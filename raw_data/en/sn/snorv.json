(n) All cans of raw milk from individual dairy farms shall be identified by the name or number of the individual milk producer. (5) Administrative Procedures (a) Emergency Supplies/ Labeling -When the sale of \"ungraded \" milk, milk products, or frozen desserts is authorized during emergencies , under the terms of Rule 420-3-16-.03, the label must bear the designation \"ungraded.\" When such labeling is not available, the State Health Officer shall take immediate steps to inform the public that the particular supply is \"ungraded\" and that the supply will be properly labeled as soon as the distributor can obtain the required labels. Note: The option for the sale of \"ungraded\" milk, milk products, or frozen desserts, as cited above, shall not be applicable to a milk company IMS listed under the ICP. (b) Identity Labeling 1. \"Identity,\" as used in this rule, is defined as the name and address or permit number of the milk or frozen dessert plant at which the pasteurization , ultra\u00ad pasteurization, aseptic processing and packaging , retort processed after packaging, condensing, and/or drying takes place. It is recommended that the voluntary national uniform coding system for the identification of milk and frozen dessert plants, at which milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products are packaged, be adopted in order to provide a uniform system of codes throughout the country. 2. In cases where several milk plants are operated by one ( 1) firm, the common firm name may be utilized on milk bottles, containers, and packages; provided, the location of the milk plant at which the contents are pasteurized, ultra\u00ad pasteurized, aseptically processed and packaged , retort processed after packaging , condensed and/or dried is also shown, either directly or by a code. This requirement is necessary in order to enable the Health Officer to identify the source of the pasteurized, ultra-pasteurized, aseptically processed and packaged , retort processed after packaging, condensed and/or dried milk and/or milk products, and frozen dessert products. The street address of the milk or frozen dessert plant does not need to be shown when only one ( 1) milk or one ( 1) frozen dessert plant, of a given name, Is located within the municipality. 3. The identity labeling requirement may be interpreted as permitting milk or frozen dessert plants and persons to purchase and distribute , under their own label, milk, milk products, and frozen desserts processed and packaged at another plant, provided, the label contains the name, address, and permit number of the manufacturer or that the label contains the name and address of the distributor and the statement \"Processed or Manufactured at (name and address)\" or that the processing and packaging milk plant is identified by the permit number of the manufacturer. (c) Misleading Labels -The Health Officer shall not permit the use of any misleading marks, words, or endorsements upon the label. They may permit the use of registered trade designs or similar terms on the bottle cap or label, when in their opinion, they are not misleading and are not so used as to obscure the labeling required by this rule. For dry milk products. the outer bag shall be preprinted Grade \"A\" before filling. The use of super grade designations shall not be permitted ; -24 -I P , ,, , however, this should not be construed as prohibiting the use of official grade designations awarded to dry milk products by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Grade designations such as \"Grade \"AA\" Pasteurized ,\" etc., gives the consumer the impression that such a grade is significantly safer than Grade \"A.\" Such an implication is false, because the rule requirements for Grade \"A\" pasteurized , ultra-pasteurized , aseptically processed milk products , and frozen desserts or retort processed after packaged low-acid milk, milk products, and frozen desserts, when properly enforced, will ensure that this grade of milk, milk products, and frozen desserts will be as safe as they can practically be made. Descriptive labeling terms shall not be used in conjunction with the Grade \"A\" designation or name of the milk, milk product, or frozen dessert and shall not be false or misleading. Author: G. M.

Following the issuance of a permit, each bulk milk pickup tanker and its appurtenances used by a milk hauler who collects samples of raw milk for pasteurization, for bacterial. chemical, or temperature standards and hauls milk from a dairy farm to a milk plant, frozen dessert plant, transfer station, or receiving station shall be Inspected/audited at least once every twenty-four (24) months. Each hauler's or sampler's pickup and sampling procedures shall be inspected at least once every twenty-four (24) months. Prior to the issuance of a permit as specified in Rule 420-3-16-.04, the Health Officer shall inspect all dairy farms. milk plants, and frozen dessert plants, the milk and/or milk products from which are intended for consumption and which are subject to provisions of these rules. Inspections of dairy farms shall be quarterly for dairies with a sanitation score of ninety (90) or more. Dairies with a sanitation score of less than ninety (90) shall be inspected monthly until such time as a score of ninety (90) or more is received. At no time shall a period of one-hundred ( 100) days lapse without an official inspection .

At no time shall a period of ninety (90) days lapse without an official inspection . (2) The Health Officer having jurisdiction may require more frequent -25 -I f' :t E inspections of plants than the minimum number set forth in this rule. In case the Health Officer discovers the violation of any item of sanitation prescribed in Rule 420-3-16- .09 or 420-3-16- .10 for the grade of milk being currently produced at any dairy farm or plant, he/she shall make a second inspection of the said dairy farm or plant after a lapse of such time as he/she deems necessary for the correction of the defect or violation discovered, but not before the lapse of three (3) days. The Health Officer shall, upon finding the violation of the same item of Rule 420-3-16-.09 or 420-3-16-.10 on two (2) consecutive inspections, serve upon the permit holder a written notice of intent to suspend permit, which notice shall specify with particularity the violation(s) in question and afford the permit holder a reasonable time to correct such violatlon. (3) The violation of the same item in Rule 420-3-16- .09 or 420-3-16-.10 on three (3) consecutive inspections shall call for permit suspension or revocation after proper notification outlines above in accordance with Rule 420-3-16-.04 and/or court action; provided, that when the Health Officer finds that a critical processing element violation involving the following : (a) Proper pasteurization, whereby, every particle of milk or milk product may not have been heated to the proper temperature and held for the required time In properly designed and operating equipment; (b) A cross connection exists whereby direct contamination of pasteurized milk or milk product is occurring ; or (c) Conditions exist whereby direct contamination of pasteurized milk or milk product is occurring. (d) The Health Officer shall take immediate action to prevent further processing of such milk or milk product until such violations of critical processing element(s) have been corrected. Should correction of such critical processing elements not be accomplished immediately , the Health Officer shall take prompt action to suspend the permit as provided for in Rule 420-3-16-.04, Provided in the case of dairy plants producing aseptically processed milk and milk products, when an inspection of the dairy plant and its records reveal that the process used has been less than the required scheduled process , it shall be considered an imminent hazard to public health and the Health Officer shall take immediate action to suspend the permit of the plant for the sale of aseptically processed milk and milk products in conformance with Rule 420-3-16-.04 . (4) A copy of the inspection /audit report, electronically generated or handwritten, shall be posted by the Health Officer in a conspicuous place upon the inside wall of the dairy farm, and said inspection report shall not be removed or defaced by any person except the Health Officer. Also, copies of all laboratory analysis of samples from products entering the processing plant shall be maintained on appropriate ledger forms supplying all information specified by the Health Officer. All inspection reports of milk and frozen dessert plants shall be posted by the Health Officer in a conspicuous place upon an Inside wall of the plant being inspected. Said inspection reports shall not be removed or defaced by any person except the Health Officer. The inspection report shall be entered on appropriate ledger forms approved by the State Health Officer containing all -26 -I P-n p -information needed by the Health Officer, and this ledger shall be kept currently posted A copy of each inspection shall be available to the Bureau of Environmental Services for records audit. (5) Every milk producer, hauler or sampler, distributor . or plant operator shall, upon request of the Health Officer, permit access of officially designated persons to all parts of his/her establishment or facilities to determine compliance with the provisions of these rules. A distributor or plant operator shall furnish the Health Officer, upon request, for official use only, a true statement of the actual quantities of milk, milk products, and frozen desserts of each grade purchased and sold and a list of all sources of such milk, milk products, frozen desserts, records of inspections, tests, and pasteurization time and temperature records. (6) It shall be unlawful for any person who is in an official capacity, to obtain any information under the provisions of this chapter which is entitled to protection as a trade secret (including information as to quantity, quality, source, or disposition of milk or milk products or results of inspections, audits, or tests thereof) to use such information to his/her own advantage or to reveal it to any unauthorized person. (7) Administrative Procedures (a) Inspection Frequency 1. For the purposes of determining the inspection frequency for dairy farms, transfer stations, milk plants, frozen dessert plants, or the portion of a mllk plant that is IMS listed to produce aseptically processed and packaged low-acid milk and/or milk products and/or retort processed after packaged low-acid milk and/or milk products, the interval shall include the designated ninety (90) day period. 2. For the purposes of determining the inspection frequency for bulk milk haulers or samplers , industry plant samplers, and dairy plant samplers, the interval shall include the designated twenty-four (24) month period. 3. One ( 1 ) bulk milk pickup tanker inspection every twenty-four ( 24) months, one ( 1) hauler or sampler or industry plant sampler pickup, and sampling procedures each twenty-four ( 24) months, one ( 1) producer inspection each quarter for dairies with a sanitation score of ninety (90) or more, one (1) producer inspection each month for dairies with a sanitation score of less than ninety (90), one (1) plant inspection, and one (1) receiving station every ninety (90) days is a legal minimum . 4. Milk haulers, dairy farms, milk plants, and frozen dessert plants experiencing difficulty meeting requirements should be visited more frequently . Inspections of dairy farms shall be made at milking time as often as possible and of processing plants at different times of the day in order to ascertain if the processes of equipment assembly, sanitizing , pasteurization , cleaning, and other procedures comply with the requirements of these rules. (b) Enforcement Procedure 1. This rule provides that a dairy farm, bulk milk hauler or sampler, milk tank truck, milk tank truck cleaning facility, milk plant, frozen dessert plant, receiving station, transfer station, or distributor shall be subject to suspension of permit and/or court action if two (2) successive inspections disclose a violation of the same requirement. 2. Experience has demonstrated that strict enforcement of these rules leads to a better and friendlier relationship between the Health Department and the dairy industry than does a policy of enforcement which seeks to excuse violations and to defer penalty therefore. The Health Officer's criterion of satisfactory compliance should be neither too lenient nor unreasonably stringent. When a violation is discovered, the Health Officer should point out to the milk producer, bulk milk hauler or sampler, industry plant sampler, truck cleaning facility, plant operator, or responsible person for the milk tank truck, milk tank truck cleaning facility, milk plant, receiving station, transfer station, or distributor the requirement that has been violated, discuss a method for correction and set a time for correcting the violated requirement. 3. The penalties of suspension or revocation of permit and/or court acUon are provided to prevent continued violation of the provisions of these rules but are worded to protect the dairy industry against unreasonable or arbitrary action. When a condition is found which constitutes an imminent health hazard, prompt action Is necessary to protect the public health; therefore, the Health Officer is authorized in Rule 420-3-16-.04 to suspend the permit immediately . However, except for such emergencies , no penalty is imposed on the producer, milk hauler or sampler, milk plant, or frozen dessert plant upon the first violation of any of the sanitation requirements listed in Rule 420-3-16- .09 or 420-3-16-.10. 4. A producer, milk hauler or sampler, milk tank truck, cleaning facility, receiving station, or distributor, milk plant, or frozen dessert plant found violating any requirement on two (2) consecutive inspections must be notified in writing and given a reasonable time to correct the violation(s) before a third inspection is made. The requirement of giving written notice shall be deemed to have been satisfied by the handing to the operator or by the posting of an inspection report as required by this rule. After receipt of a notice of violation, but before the allotted time has elapsed, the producer, milk hauler, milk plant, or frozen dessert plant shall have an opportunity to appeal the interpretation to the Health Officer or for an extension of the time allowed for correction. 5. Aseptic Processing Milk Plants -Because aseptically processed milk and milk products are stored at room temperature and not refrigerated after processing, they must be considered an imminent hazard to public health wherever it is revealed by an inspection or a review of the processing records that the process is less than the required scheduled process and the products produced have not maintained their commercial sterility. Prompt action by the Health Officer to suspend the permit must be initiated in order to protect the public health. The Health Officer shall stop the sale of all under processed product and follow at least the minimum requirements of 21 CFR 113.89 (refer to Appendix L) before releasing any product. . 2s.

A viable bacterial count of nonfat dry milk shall be made In accordance with the procedures in SMEDP for the SPG or PAC of Dry Milk, except agar plates shall be incubated for seventy-two (72) hours. 5 Drug Testing -Beta lactam test methods which have been independently evaluated or evaluated by FDA and have been found acceptable by FDA and the NCIMS for detecting Beta lactam drug residues in raw milk, or pasteurized milk, or a particular type of pasteurized milk product at current target testing or tolerance levels, shall be used for each Beta lactam drug of concern. This does not apply to those milk products for which there are not any approved Beta lactam test methods available (refer to M-a-85, latest revision, for tile approved Beta lactam test methods and M-a-98, latest revision, for the specific milk and/or mllk product for which there are approved Beta lactam test methods available) . Enforcement action shall be taken on all confirmed positive Beta lactam results (refer to Appendix N). A result shall be considered confirmed positive for Beta lactams if it has been obtained by using a test method, which has been evaluated and deemed acceptable by FDA and accepted by the NCIMS at levels established in memoranda transmitted periodically by FDA (refer to Appendix N, IV). 6. Screening and Confirmatory Methods for the Detection of Abnormal Milk -The results of the screening test or confirmatory test shall be recorded on the official records of the dairy farm and a copy of the results sent to the milk producer. 7. When a warning letter has been sent, because of excessively high somatic cell counts, an official inspection of the dalry farm should be made by regulatory personnel or certified industry personnel. This inspection should be made during milking time. (i) Milk (Non-Goat) -Any of the following confirmatory or screening test procedures shall be used: Single Strip Direct Microscopic Somatic Cell Count (DMSCC) or Electronic Somatic Cell Count (ESCC). (ii) Goat Milk -DMSCC or ESCC may be used for screening raw goat milk samples, to indicate a range of somatic cell levels, as long as the somatic cell standard for goat milk remains 1,500,000/ml. Screening for official purposes shall be conducted by an analyst (s) certified for that procedure . -33 -I ., \u00b7 -(iii) Only the Pyronine Y-Methyl stain or \"New York modification \" Single Strip DMSCC test procedures shall be used to confirm the level of somatic cells in goat milk by certified analysts. (iv) Sheep Milk -Any of the following confirmatory or screening test procedures shall be used: Single Strip DMSCC or ESCC. When results from the Single Strip DMSCC procedure exceed the 750,000/ml standard set forth in this rule, the count shall have been derived from, or be confirmed by, the Pyronine Y Methyl-Green Stain or the ''New York modification .\" (v) Camel Milk -Any of the following confirmatory or screening test procedures shall be used: Single Strip DMSCC or ESCC. When results exceed the 750,000/ml standard set forth in this rule, the count shall have been derived from, or be confirmed by, the Single Strip DMSCC using the Pyronine Y Methyl\u00ad Green Stain or the \"New York modification ,\" and conducted by analysts certified for that procedure (refer to the Note: on page 35). 8. Electronic Phosphatase Tests -The phosphatase test is an index of the efficiency of the pasteurization process. In the event an accredited laboratory finds that a sample confirms positive for phosphatase , the pasteurization process shall be investigated and corrected. When a laboratory phosphatase test is confirmed positive, or If any doubt should arise as to the compliance of the equipment , standards , or methods outlined in Rule 420-3-16 -.10(1)(a) the Health Officer should immediately conduct field phosphatase testing at the milk plant (refer to Appendix G). 9. Vitamin testing shall be performed using test methods acceptable to FDA or other official methodologies , which give statistically equivalent results to the FDA methods. 10. Any other tests, which have been approved by FDA to be equally accurate, precise, and practical. 11. All standards used in the development and use of drug residue detection methods designed for the PMO monitoring programs shall be referenced to a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standard when available. When a USP standard is not available, then the original method shall define the standard to be used. 12. Procedura l or reagent changes for official tests shall be submitted to FDA for acceptance prior to being used by certified NCIMS milk laboratories . 13. Sampling Procedures -SMEDP contains guidance for the sampling of milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products. Optionally , sample collection time may be identified in military time (24 hour clock) (refer to Appendix G for a reference to drug residues in milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products and the conditions under which a positive phosphatase reaction may be encountered in properly pasteurized milk or cream), (refer to Appendix B for reference to farm bulk milk hauling programs regarding training, licensing/permitting, routine inspection , and the evaluation of sampling procedures) . -34 -I P . e: (i) pasteurization , ultra-pasteurization , aseptic processing and packaging , or retort processed after packaging are taken at a milk or frozen dessert plant prior to pasteurization , ultra-pasteurization , aseptic processing and/or retort processing. respectively , they shall be drawn following adequate agitation from randomly selected storage tanks/silos. All counts and temperatures shall be recorded on a milk-ledger form as soon as reported by the laboratory . A computer or other information retrieval system may be used. (ii) When bacterial counts except for aseptically processed milk and milk products. and temperature determinations are made of several samples of the same milk or milk products collected from the same supply or processor on the same day, these values are averaged arithmetica lly, and the results recorded as the count or temperature determinations of the milk or milk product for that day. All counts and temperatu res should be recorded on a milk ledger form for dairy farms or milk plants as soon as reported by the laboratory. (iii) A computer of other information retrieval system may be used. (iv) See Appendix G for a reference to antibiotics in milk and the conditions under which a positive phosphatase reaction may be encounte red in properly pasteurized milk or cream. Note: Milk from animals not currently in the PMO may be labeled as Grade \"A\" and IMS listed upon FOA's acceptance of validated the PMO, Section 6, and Appendix N test methods for the animal to be added (refer to M-a-98, latest revision, for the specific milk and/or milk products that have FDA validated and NCIMS accepted test methods). 14. Farm Bulk Milk Hauling -The farm bulk milk hauler occupies a unique position in the producer/processor /Health Officer relationsh ip. The milk hauler is a critical factor in the current structure of milk marketing . As a weigher and sampler, he/she stands as the official and, frequently, the only judge of milk volumes bought and sold. As the milk receiver, the hauler's operating habits directly affect the quality of milk committed to his/her care. When the bulk milk hauler's obligations include the collection and delivery of samples to the laboratory for analysis, he/she becomes a vital part of the quality control and regulatory programs . Any deviation from acceptable practices by the milk hauler may result in the suspension and/or revocation of his/her permit (see Appendix 8 for reference to farm milk hauling program regarding training, licensing, permitting , routine inspection, and the evaluation procedure ). Note: The industry should be encouraged by the Health Officer to achieve day-to-day compliance with the foregoing standards by performing tests on each producer's milk, including platform tests for odors, temperature , and sediment. Bacterial counts should be conducted following laboratory pasteurizat ion as a check for thermoduric organisms. Examinations for the presence of phychro-philic bacteria are also recommended . Periodic screening tests for presence of added water1 antibiotics, and pesticide residues should be performed on producer's milk. Plants should reject milk of abnormal odor and high temperature , as well as milk that is found to be unsatisfactory by the sediment test. Follow-up inspection on the daf ry farm should be made by the field man to determine the cause and to institute -35 ~ I I' corrective measures whenever milk is rejected by the plant. Author: G. M.

Lactating animals producing contaminated milk, that is, lactating animals which have been treated with, have consumed chemical, medicinal, or radioactive agents, which are capable of being secreted in the milk and which in the judgment of the Health Officer may be deleterious to human health, shall be milked last or with separate equipment and the milk disposed of as the Health Officer may direct. For applicability to AMls refer to Appendix Q. (b) Public Health Reason 1. The health of lactating animals is a very important consideration because a number of diseases of lactating animals, including salmonellosis , -39-I r \"g ~ staphylococcal infection, may be transmitted to man through the medium of milk. The organisms of most of these diseases may get into the milk either directly from the udder or indirectly through infected body discharges which may drop, splash, or be blown into the milk. 2. Bovine mastitis is an inflammato ry and, generally, highly communicable disease of the bovine udder. Usually, the inciting organism is a streptococcus of bovine origin (Type B ), but the disease is often caused by a staphylococcus or other infectious agent. Occasionally , lactating animals' udders become infected with hemolytic streptococci of human origin, which may result in milk borne epidemics of scarlet fever or septic sore throat. The toxins of staphylococc i, and possibly other organisms in milk may cause severe gastroenteritis . Some of these toxins are not destroyed by pasteurization . (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Milk from lactating animals being treated with medicinal agents which are capable of being secreted in the milk, is not offered for sale for such period as is recommended by the attending veterinarian or as indicated on the package label of the medicinal agent. 2. Milk from lactating animals treated with or exposed to insecticides not approved for use on dairy cattle by the U.S. EPA is not offered for sale 3 The Health Officer requires such additional tests for the detection of abnormal milk as he/she deems necessary . 4 Bloody, stringy, off-colored milk or milk that Is abnormal to sight or odor, is so handled and disposed of as to preclude the infection of other cows and the contamination of milk utensils. 5. Lactating animals secreting milk with abnormalities are milked last or in separate equipment , which effectively prevents the contaminat ion of the wholesome supply. Milking equipment used on animals with abnormalities in their milk is maintained clean to reduce the possibility of reinfecting or cross infection of the dairy animals. 6. Equipment. utensils, and containers used for the handling of abnormal milk are not used for the handling of milk to be offered for sale unless they are first cleaned and effectively sanitized. 7. Processed animal waste derivatives , used as a feed ingredient for any portion of the total ration of the lactating dairy animal have been: (a) Properly processed in accordance with at least those requirements contained in the Model Regulations for Processed Animal Wastes (MRPA W) developed by the Association of American Feed Control (AAFC) officials; and (b) Do not contain levels of deleterious substances , harmful pathogenic organisms . or other toxic substances which are secreted in the milk at any level which may be deleterious to human health . -40 -I r-,, ~ 8. Unprocessed poultry litter and unprocessed recycled animal body discharges are not fed to lactating dairy animals. (2) Milking Baro or Parlor -Construction (a) A milking barn or parlor shall be provided on all dairy farms in which the milking herd shall be housed during milking time operations. For applicability to AMls, refer to Appendix Q. The areas used for milking purposes shall: 1 _ Have floors constructed of concrete or equally impervious materials : Provided convalescent (maternity) pens located in milking areas of stanchion -type barns may be used when they comply with the guidelines specified in Appendix C. 2. Have walls and ceilings which are smooth, painted or finished in an approved manner, in good repair, and ceiling dust tight. 3. Have separate stalls or pens for horses, calves, and bulls. 4. Be provided with natural and/or artificial light, well distributed for day and/or night milking. 5. Provide sufficient air space and air circulation to prevent condensation and excessive odors. 6. Not be overcrowded , and 7. Have dust-tight, covered boxes or bins, or separate storage facilities for ground, chopped, or concentrated feed. {b) Public Health Reason -When milking is done elsewhere than in a suitable place provided for this purpose, the milk may be contaminated . Floors constructed of concrete or other impervious materials can be kept clean more easily than floors constructed of wood, earth, or similar materials; and are, therefore, more apt to be kept clean. Painted or properly finished walls and ceilings encourage cleanliness. Tight ceilings and feed rooms reduce the likelihood of dust and extraneous material getting 1nto the milk, Adequate light makes it more probable that the barn will be clean and that the lactating animals will be milked in a sanitary manner. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. A milking barn or parlor is provided on all dairy farms. 2. Gutters, floors, and feed troughs are constructed of good quality concrete or equally impervious material. Floors shall be easily cleaned (brushed surfaces permitted) and shall be graded to drain and maintained in good repair and free of excessive breaks or worn areas that may create pools. 3. Gravity flow manure channels in milking barns, if used, shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of Appendix C. \u00b7 41-I r ., tz !:: 4. Stall barns, when used with gutter grates over manure storage pits, are designed and constructed in accordance with the specifications of Appendix C. 5. Walls are finished with tile, smooth-surfaced concrete, cement plaster, brick, or other equivalent materials with light-colored surfaces; provided, existing barns with wood walls will not be considered a violation provided they are properly maintained . Walls, partitions, doors, shelves, windows, and ceilings shall be kept in good repair, and surfaces shall be refinished whenever wear or discoloration is evident. Ceilings are constructed of smooth dressed lumber, plywood, or similar material. Whenever feed is stored overhead , ceilings shall be constructed to prevent the sifting of chaff and dust into the milking barn or parlor. If an opening is provided from a loft into the milking portion of the barn, such opening shall be provided with a dust-tight door which shall be kept closed during milking operations . 6. Bullpens. maternity calf stalls, and horse stalls are partitioned from the milking portion of the barn. Such portions of the barn that are not separated by tight partitions shall comply with all requirements of this item. 7. The milking barn is provided with natural and/or artificial light to ensure that all surfaces and particularly the working areas will be plainly visible. The equivalent of at least 20 foot-candles ( 110 lux) of light in all working areas shall be provided. 8. Air circulation is sufficient to minimize odors and to prevent condensation upon walls and ceilings. 9. Overcrowding is not evidenced by the presence of calves, lactating animals, or other barnyard animals in walks or feed alleys. Inadequate ventilation and excessive odors may also be evidence of an overcrowded barn. 10. A dust-tight partition provided with doors that are kept closed, except when in actual use, shall separate the milking portion of the barn from any feed room or silo in which feed is ground or mixed or in which sweet feed is stored. Feed may be stored in the milking portion of the barn, only in such manner as will not increase the dust content of the air, attract flies, or interfere with cleaning of the floor (as in covered, dust-tight boxes or bins). Open feed dollies or carts may be used for distributing the feed, but not storing feed in the milking barn. When conditions warrant, the Health Officer may approve a barn without four walls extending from floor to roof or a shed-type barn provided the requirement of paragraph 3, prohibiting animals and fowl entering the barn is satisfied. Animal housing areas (stables without stanchions , such as loose-hou .sing stables, pen stables, resting barns, free-stall barns, holding barns, loafing sheds, wandering sheds) may be of shed-type construction provided no milking is conducted therein. They are classified as part of the animal yard under Rule 430-3-16- .09(4). (3) Milking Barn/Stable or Parlor Cleanliness (a) The interior shall be kept clean. Floors, walls, ceilings, windows, pipelines, and equipment shall be free of filth and/or litter and shall be clean. -42 -I ., I.'\\ Swine, fowl, and other animals other than the milking herd shall be kept out of the milking barn area. Feed shall be stored in a manner that will not increase the dust content of the air or interfere with the cleaning of the floor (for applicability to AM ls, refer to Appendix Q). Surcingles, or belly straps, milk stools, and anitkickers shall be kept clean and stored above the floor, (b) Public Health Reason -A clean interior reduces the chances of contamination of the milk or milk equipment during milking. The presence of other animals increases uncleanliness and the potential for spread of disease. Clean milk stools and surcingles reduce the likelihood of contamination of the m11ker's hands between the milking of one (1) lactating animal and the milking of another. (c) Administrat ive Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. The interior of the milking barn or parlor is kept clean. 2. Leftover feed in feed mangers appears fresh and is not wet or soggy. 3. The bedding material, if used, does not contain more manure than has accumulated since the previous milking, 4. Outside surfaces of pipeline systems located in milking barn or parlor are reasonably clean. 5. Gutter cleaners are reasonably clean. 6. All pens, calf stalls, and bullpens, if not separated from the milking barn, stable, or parlor, are clean. 7. Swine, fowl, and animals other than the milking herd are kept out of the milking barn. 8. Gravity flow manure channels in milking barns, if used, shall be maintained in accordance with Appendix C. 9. Stall barns, when used with gutter grates over manure storage pits, are operated and maintained in accordance with the specifications of Appendix C. 10. Milk stools are not padded and are constructed to be easily cleaned. Milk stools, surcingles, and antik1ckers are kept clean and are stored above the floor in a clean place in the milking barn, stable, parlor, or milkhouse when not in use. 11. In barns in which water under pressure is not available, the floors may be brushed dry and limed. In the latter event, care should be exercised to prevent caking of the lime. When lime or phosphate is used, it shall be spread evenly on the floor as a thin coating. If clean floors are not maintained by this method, the sanitarian should require cleaning with water. (4) Lactating Animal Yard (a) The lactating animal yard shall be graded and drained and shall have -43 -I P , ~ -no standing pools of water or accumulations of organic waste. Provided, that in loafing or lactating animal housing areas, lactating animal droppings and soiled bedding shall be removed, or clean bedding added, at sufficiently frequent intervals to prevent the soiling of the lactating animal's udder and flanks. Cooling ponds shall be allowed provided they are constructed and maintained in a manner that does not result in the visible soiling of flanks, udders, bellies, and tails of lactating animals exiting the pond. Waste feed shall not be allowed to accumulate . Manure packs shall be properly drained and shall provide a reasonable firm footing. Swine shall be kept out of the lactating animal yard. (b) Public Health Reason -The lactating animal yard is interpreted to be that enclosed or unenclosed area in which the lactating animals are apt to congregate . approximately adjacent to the barn including lactating animal's housing areas. This area is, therefore, particularly apt to become filthy with manure droppings , which may result in the soiling of the lactating animal's udders and flanks. The grading and drainage of the lactating animal yard as far as practicable is required because wet conditions are conducive to fly breeding and make it difficult to keep manure removed and the lactating animals clean. lf manure and barn sweepings are allowed to accumulate in the lactat ing animal yard, fly breeding will be promoted; and the lactating animals, because of their habit of lying down, will be more apt to have manure-soiled udders. Lactating animals should not have access to piles of manure, in order to avoid the soiling of udders and the spread of diseases among dairy animals. (c) Administrative Procedures -This Item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. The animal yard, which is the enclosed or unenclosed area adjacent to the milking barn in which the lactating animals may congregate , including animal housing areas and feed lots, is graded and drainedi depressions and soggy areas are filled; lactating animal lanes are reasonably dry. 2. Approaches to the barn door and the surroundings of stock watering and feeding stations are solid to the footing of the animal. 3. Wastes from the barn or milkhouse are not allowed to pool in the cowyard. Cowyards which are muddy due to recent rains should not be considered as violating this item. 4. Manure, soiled bedding, and waste feed are not stored or permitted to accumulate therein in such a manner as to permit the soiling of lactating animal's udders and as loose-housing stables, pen stables, resting barns, and holding barns, shall be considered a part of the cowyard. Manure packs shall be solid to the footing of the animal (see Appendix C). 5. Cowyards are kept reasonably free of animal droppings. Animal droppings shall not be allowed to accumulate in piles that are accessible to the animals. -44-lr. (5) Milkhouse or Room -Construction and Facilities (a) A milkhouse or room of sufficient size shall be provided in which the cooling, handling, and storing of milk and the washing, sanitizing , and storing of milk containers and utensils shall be conducted except as provided for in Rule 420- 3-16.09( 12).

Incidental articles such as desks, refrigerators , and storage cabinets may be in the milkroom provided they are kept clean and ample space is available to conduct the normal operations In the milkroom and will not cause contamination of the milk. 3. Vestibules, if provided, are kept clean. -51 -I ~ ;q; E 4. Animals and fowl are kept out of the milkroom . (7) Toilet (a) Every dairy farm shall be provided with one or more toilets, conveniently located -and properly constructed , operated, and maintained in accordance with the Rules of the State Board of Health. The waste shall be inaccessible to flies and shall not pollute the soil surface or contaminate any water supply. (b) Public Health Reason -The organisms of typhoid fever, dysentery, and gastrointestinal disorders may be present in the body wastes of persons who have these diseases. In the case of typhoid fever, well persons (carriers) also may discharge the organisms in their body wastes. If a toilet is not fly-tight and so constructed as to prevent overflow, infection may be carried from the excreta to the mllk, either by flies or through the pollution of ground water supplies or streams to Which the lactating animals have access. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item ls deemed to be satisfied when: 1. There is at least one ( 1) flush toilet connected to a public sewer system or to an individual sewage-disposal system.

All new or extensively remodeled barns must be provided with a flush type toilet connected to a public sewer or an individual sewage disposal system. (8) Water Supply (a) WaJer for milkhouse and milking operations shall be from a supply properly located, protected , and operated and shall be easily accessible , adequate , and of a safe, sanitary quality. (b) Public Health Reason 1. A dairy farm water supply should be accessible in order to encourage its use in ample quantity in cleaning operations . It should be adequate so that cleaning and rinsing will be thorough and it should be of safe, sanitary quality in -52 -I F ;i ,.. order to avoid the contamination of milk utensils. 2. A polluted water supply used in the rinsing of the dairy utensils and containers may be more dangerous than a similar water supply which is used for drinking purposes only. Bacteria grows much faster in milk than in water and the severity of an attack of a given disease depends largely upon the size of the dose of disease organisms taken into the system. Therefore , a small number of disease organisms consumed in a glass of water from a polluted well may possibly result in no harm, whereas, if left in a milk utensil which has been rinsed with the water, they may, after several hours, grow in the milk, increase in such numbers as to cause disease when consumed. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1 . The water surrly for milkhouse and milking operations is approved as safe by the appropriate regulatory agency and, in the case of individual water systems, complies with the specificat ions outlined in Appendix D, and the bacteriological standards outlined in Appendix G. 2. No cross-connection exists between a safe water supply and any unsafe or questionable water supply or any other source of pollution. 3. There are no submerged inlets through which a safe water supply may be contaminated . 4 The well or other source of water is located and constructed in such a manner that neither underground or surface contamination from any sewerage system, privy, or other source of pollution can reach such water supply . 5. New individual water supplies and water supply systems which have been repaired or otherwise become contaminated are thoroughly disinfected before being placed in use. The supply shall be made free of the disinfection by pumping the waste before any sample for bacteriological testing shall be collected. 6. All containers and tanks used in the transportation of water are sealed and protected from possible contamination. These containers and tanks shall be subjected to a thorough cleaning and a bacteriological treatment prior to filling with potable water to be used at the dairy farm. To minimize the possibility of contamination of the water during its transfer from the potable tanks to the elevated or ground-water storage at the dairy farm, a suitable pump, hose, and fittings shall be provided. When the pump, hose, and fittings are not being used, the outlets shall be capped and stored in a suitable dust-proof enclosure so as to prevent their contamination . The storage tank at the dairy farm shall be constructed of impervious material provided with a dust and rainproof cover, and also provided with an approved -type vent and roof hatch. All new reservoirs or reservoirs which have been cleaned shall be disinfected prior to placing them into service (see Appendix D). 7. Samples for bacteriolog ical examination are taken upon the initial approval of the physical structure based upon the requirements of these rules; and when any repair or alteration of the water supply system has been made, and at -53-, , least every three (3) years; provided, that water supplies with buried well casing seals, installed prior to the adoption of this section, shall be tested at intervals no greater than six (6) months apart. Whenever such samples indicate either the presence of E. coli bacteria or the coliform group or whenever the well casing, pump, or seal needs replacing or repair, the well casing and seal shall be brought above the ground surface and shall comply with all other applicable construction criteria of this paragraph; provided, that when water is hauled to the dairy farm, such water shall be sampled for bacteriological examination at the point of use and submitted to a laboratory at least four ( 4) times in separate months during any consecutive six (6) months. Bacteriological examinations shall be conducted in a laboratory acceptable to the Health Officer. 8. Current records of water test results shall be retained on file with the Health Department; provided, that when water is hauled to the dairy farm, such water shall be sampled for bacteriological examination at the point of use and submitted to a laboratory at least four (4) times in separate months during any consecutive six (6) months. Bacteriological examinations shall be conducted in a laboratory acceptable to the Health Officer. To determine if water samples have been taken at the frequency established in this section, the interval shall include the designated period plus the remaining days of the month in which the sample is due.

Strainers , if used, are of perforated metal design or so constructed as to utilize single-service strainer media. 9. Seamless hooded pails having an opening not exceeding one-third the area of that of an open pail of the same size are used for hand milking and hand str[pping. 10. All milking machines , including heads, milk claws, milk tubing, and other milk-contact surfaces can be easily cleaned and inspected and appurtenances, which require a screwdriver or special tool, shall be considered easily accessible for inspection providing the necessary tools are available at the milkhouse. Milking systems shall not have components incorporated In the return solution lines, which by design do not comply with the criteria for product-contact surfaces. Some examples of these are: (i) Ball type plastic valves; (il) Plastic tees with barbed ridges to better grip the plastic or rubber hoses: and (iii) The use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) water type piping for return solution lines. 11. Milk cans have umbrella-type lids. 12. Farm holding-cooling tanks, welded sanitary piping, and transportation tanks comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 420-3-16-.10( 10) and 420- 3-16-.10( 11 ). 13. During filling, flexible plastic/rubber hoses may be used between the fill valves of bottom fill and top fill bulk milk storage tanks, when needed for functional purposes. Such hoses shall be drainable, be as short as practical, have sanitary fitting, and be supported to maintain uniform slope and alignment. The end fittings of such hoses shall be permanently attached in such a manner that will assure a crevice-free joint between the hose and the fitting, which can be cleaned by mechanical means.

In the absence of a temperature-recording device, partial pickups may be permitted as long as the milk storage/holding tank is completely empty, clean, and sanitized prior to the next milking. In the event of an emergency situation, such as inclement weather, natural disaster, etc., a variance may be permitted at the discretion of the Health Officer. (11) Utensils and Equipment-Sanitizati on (a) The product-contact surfaces of all multi-use containers. equipment , and utensils used in the handling, storage or transportation of milk shall be sanitized before each usage. (b) Public Health Reason -Mere cleaning of containers, equipment , and utensils does not ensure the removal or destruction of all disease organisms which may have been present. Even very small numbers remaining may grow to dangerous proportions. since many kinds of disease bacteria grow rapidly in milk. For this reason, all milk containers, equipment, and utensils must be treated with an effective sanitizer before each usage. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: All product-contact surfaces of multi-use containers. utensils, and equipment used in the handling, storage, or transportation of milk are sanitized before each usage by one of the following methods or by any method which has been demonstrated to be equally effective: 1. Complete Immersion in hot water at a temperature of at least 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C) for at least five (5) minutes or exposure to a flow of hot water at a temperature of at least 170\u00b0F (77\u00b0C) as determined by use of a suitable accurate thermometer (at the outlet) for at least five (5) minutes. 2. Certain chemical compounds are effective for the sanitization of milk utensils, containers, and equipment. These are contained in 40 CFR 180.940 and shall be used in accordance with label directions or the electro-chemical activation (ECA) device manufactu rer's instructions. if produced onsite in accordance with Appendix F for further discussion of approved sanitizing procedures . (12) Utensils and Equipment-Storage (a) All containers, utensils, and equipment used in the handling, storage, -57-IPH' or transportation of milk, unless stored in sanitizing solutions, shall be stored to assure complete drainage and shall be protected from contamination prior to use; provided, that pipeline milking equipment, such as, milker claws, inflations, weigh jars, meters, milk hoses, milk receivers, tubular coolers1 plate coolers, and milk pumps which are designed for mechanical cleaning and other equipment , as accepted by FDA, which meets these criteria may be stored in the milking barn or parlor provided this equipment is designed, Installed, and operated to protect the product and solution-contact surfaces from contamination at all times. Some of the parameters to be considered in determining protection are: 1. Proper location of equipment. 2. Proper drainage of equipment. 3, Adequate and properly located lighting and ventilation . (b) Public Health Reason -Careless storage of milk utensils which previously have been properly treated is apt to result in recontamination of such utensils, thus rendering them unsafe. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. All milk containers , utensils, and equipment , including milking machine vacuum hoses, are stored in the milkhouse in a sanitizing solution or on racks until used. Milk pipelines and pipeline milking equipment, such as, milker claws, inflations, weigh jars, meters, milk hoses, milk receivers, tubular coolers, plate coolers, and milk pumps which are designed for mechanical cleaning and other equipment as accepted by FDA, which meet these criteria may be mechanically cleaned, sanitized, and stored in the milking barn or parlor, provided this equipment is designed, installed, and operated to protect the product and solution contact surface from contamination at all times. Some of the parameters to be considered in determining protection are proper location of equipment, proper drainage of equipment, and adequate and properly located lighting and ventilation. The milking barn or parlor must be used only for milking. Concentrates may be fed in the barn during milking, but the barn shall not be used for the housing of animals. When manual cleaning of product-contact surfaces is necessary, the cleaning shall be done in the mllkhouse . 2. Means are provided to effect complete drainage of equipment when such equipment cannot be stored to drain freely. 3. Clean cans or other containers are stored in the milkhouse within a reasonable time after delivery to the dairy farm. 4. Strainer pads, parchment papers, gaskets, and similar single-service articles are stored in a suitable container or cabinet and protected against contamination . (13) Utensils and EquipmentHandling (a) After sanitization , all containers, utensils, and equipment shall be handled in \u00b7 ss-I J ; such manner as to prevent contamination of any product-contact surface. (b) Public Health Reason -Handling milk pails by inserting the fingers under the hood, carrying an armful of milk can covers against a soiled shirt, or jacket or similar handling of utensils will nullify the effect of sanitization. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Sanitized product-contact surfaces, including farm cooling holding tank openings and outlets, are protected against contact with unsanitized equipment and utensils, hands, clothing, splash, condensation, and other sources of contamination . 2. Any sanitized product-contact surface which has been otherwise exposed to contamination is again cleaned and sanitized before being used. (14) Milking Flanks, Udders, and Teats (a) Milking shall be done in the milking barn, stable, or parlor. The flanks, udders, bellies, and tails of all milking lactating animals shall be free from visible dirt. All brushing shall be completed prior to milking. The udders and teats of all milking lactating animals shall be clean and dry before milking. Teats shall be treated with a sanitizing solution just prior to the time of milking and shall be dry before milking. Wet hand milking is prohibited. (b) Public Health Reason -If m11king is done elsewhere than in a suitable place provided for this purpose, the milk may become contaminated. Cleanliness of the lactating animals is one of the most important factors affecting the bacterial count of the milk. Under usual farm conditions, lactating animals contaminate their udders by standing in polluted water or by lying down in the pasture or animal yard. Unless the udders and teats are carefully cleaned just before milking, particles of filth or contaminated water are apt to drop or be drawn into the milk. Such contamination of the milk is particularly dangerous because manure may contain the organisms of brucellosis, tuberculosis, and polluted water may contain the organisms of typhoid fever and other intestinal diseases. Application of sanitizing solutions to the teats, followed by thorough drying just prior to the time of milking, has the advantage of giving an additional margin of safety with reference to such disease organisms as they are not removed by ordinary cleaning and it is helpful In the control of mastitis. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Milking is done in a milking barn or parlor. 2. Brushing is completed prior to milking. 3. Flanks, bellies, talls, and udders are clipped as often as necessary to facilitate cleaning of these areas and are free from dirt. The hair on the udders shall be of such length that it is not incorporated with the teat in the inflation during milking. -sg -I f' 1 ~ e 4. Udders and teats of all milking animals are clean and dry before milking. Teats shall be cleaned 1 treated with a sanitizing solution, and dry just prior to milking. Provided that the sanitizing of teats shall be required if the udder is dry and the teats have been thoroughly cleaned (not dry wiped) and dried (manually wiped dry) prior to milking. The determination of what constitutes a dry udder and cleaned and dried teats shall be made by the Health Officer. Note: Additional alternative udder preparation methods may also be used once they have been evaluated by FDA and found acceptable. 5. Wet hand milking is prohibited . (15) Milking -Surcingles, Milk Stools, and Anti-kickers (a) Surcingles , milk stools, and anti-kickers shall be kept clean and stored above the floor. (b) Public Health Reason -Clean milk stools and clean surcingles (or belly straps) reduce the likelihood of contamination of milkers' hands between the milking of one lactating animal and the milking of another. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Milk stools are not padded and are constructed to be easily cleaned. 2. Milk stools, surcingles1 and anti-kickers are kept clean and are stored above the floor in a clean place in the milking barn, parlor, or milkhouse when not in use. (16) Protection from Contamination (a) Milking, milkhouse operations, equipment, and facilities shall be located and conducted to prevent any contamination of milk, container, utensils, and equipment. 1. Milk shall not be strained, poured, transferred , or stored unless it is properly protected from contamination. 2. After sanitization. all containers, utensils, and equipment shall be handled in such a manner as to prevent the contamination of any milk product\u00ad oontact surface. 3. Vehicles used to transport milk from the dairy farm to the milk plant. receiving station, or transfer station shall be constructed and operated to protect their contents from sun, freezing, and contamina tion. Such vehicles shall be kept clean, inside and out, and any substance capable of contaminating the milk shall not be transported with the milk. (b) Public Health Reason -Because of the nature of milk and its susceptibility to contamination by disease producing bacteria and other contaminants , every effort should be made to provide adequate protection for the -60 -I t' ,1 g .: milk at all times. This should include the proper placement of equipment so that work areas in the milking barn and milkhouse are not overcrowded . The quality of any air which is used for the agitation or movement of milk or is directed at a milk product-contact surface should be such that it will not contaminate the milk. The effect of sanitization of equipment can be mollified if the equipment is not protected after sanitization . To protect milk during transportation , delivery vehicles shall be properly constructed and operated. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Equipment and operations are so located within the milking barn and milkhouse as to prevent overcrowding and contamination of cleaned and sanitized containers, equipment , and utensils by splash, condensation , or manual contact. 2. During processing, pipelines and equipment used to contain or conduct milk and milk products shall be effectively separated from tanks or circuits containing cleaning and/or sanitizing solutions. 3. All milk which has overflowed , leaked, been spilled, or improperly handled is discarded . 4. All product-con tact surfaces of containers , equipment, and utensils are covered or otherwise protected to prevent the access of insects, dust, condensation , and other contamination . All openings, including valves and piping attached to milk storage and transport tanks, pumps, or vats shall be capped or otherwise properly protected . Gravity type strainers used in the milkhouse do not have to be covered. Milk pipelines used to convey milk from pre-coolers to the farm bulk tank must be fitted with effective drip deflectors . 5. The receiving receptacle is raised above the floor (as on a dolly or cart) or placed at a distance from the lactating animals to protect it against manure and splash when milk is poured and/or strained in the milking barn. Such receptacle shall have a tight-fitting cover, which shall be closed except when milk is being poured. 6. Each pail or container of milk is transferred immediately from the milking barn, stable, or parlor to the milkhouse . 7.

Vehicles have bodies with solid enclosures and tight, solid doors. 13. Vehicles are kept clean, inside and out. 14. No substance capable of contaminating milk is transported with the milk (refer to Items 10 and 11 and Appendix B for information on the construct ion of milk tank trucks). (17) Drug and Chemical Control (a) Cleaners and sanitizers used on dairy farms shall be purchased in containers from the manufacturer or distributor which properly identify the contents or if bulk cleaners and sanitizers are transferred from the manufacturer's or distributor's container , that the transfer only occur into a dedicated end-use container which is specifically designed and maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications for that specific product. The label on the dedicated end-use container shall include the product name, chemical description. use directions , precautionary and warning statement , first aid instructions , and the name and address of the manufacturer or distributor . (b) Equipment used to administer medicinals/drugs is not cleaned in the wash vats and is stored so as not to contaminate the milk or milk contact surfaces of equipment. ( c) Drugs intended for the treatment of non-lactating dairy animals are segregated from those drugs used for lactating dairy animals. Separate shelves in cabinets, refrigerators , or other storage facilities satisfy this Item. This required storage system shall also be followed for drugs intended for use in goats, sheep, and other dairy animals. (d) The only drugs that shall be stored with the lactating drugs are drugs that are specifically indicated on the drug label or on a veterinarian 's label for extra-label drug use to be used in a specific class/species of lactating dairy animals. For the purpose of complying with this item \"lactating dairy animals\" shall mean those dairy animals that are currently producing milk. 1. The name and address of the manufacturer or distributor (for O.T.C. medicinals /drugs) or veterinary practitioner dispensing the product (for Rx and extra-label use medicinals/drugs) and, if the drug is dispensed by a pharmacy on the order of a veterinarian , the labeling shall include the name of the prescribing veterinarian and the name and address of the dispensing pharmacy , and may include the address of the prescribing veterinarian . 2. Directions for use and prescribed holding times. -62 -I I\" 1 3. Cautionary statements , if needed. 4. Active ingredient(s) in the drug product. 5. Unapproved and/or Improperly labeled medicinals/drugs are not used to treat dairy animals and are not stored in the milkhouse, milking barn, stable, or parlor_ Medicinals/drugs intended for treatment of non-lactating dairy animals are segregated from those medicinals/drugs used for lactating animals (separate shelves in cabinets, refrigerators , or other storage facilities satisfied this item). Note: Topical antiseptics, wound dressings , (unless intended for direct injection into the teat) vaccines, and other biologics and dosage form vitamins and/or mineral products are exempt from labeling and storage requirements , except when it is determined that they are stored in such a manner that they may contaminate the milk or milk product surfaces of containers or utensils. (18) Personnel-Handwashing FacHities (a) Adequate handwashing facilities shall be provided, Including a lavatory fixture with hot and cold or warm running water, soap or detergent, and individual sanitary towels in the milkhouse and in/or convenient to the milking barn, parlor, or flush toilet. (b) Public Health Reason -The hands of the milker in his preparation for milking come into contact with almost identically the same kind of material as may have contaminated the udders During the course of his duties and natural habits outside of the milking barn, the dairyman's hands must be assumed to have been exposed to body discharges . Washing facillties are required in order to increase the assurance that milker's and bulk milk hauler's or sampler's hands will be washed. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Handwashing facilities are located in the milkhouse and in/or convenient to the milking barn, parlor, or flush toilet. 2. Handwashing facilities include soap or detergent , hot and cold running water, individual sanitary towels , and a lavatory fixture. Utensil wash and rinse vats shall not be considered as handwashing facilities. ( 19) Personnel-Cleanliness (a) Hands shall be washed clean and dried with an individual sanitary towel immediately before milking, before performing any milkhouse function, and immediately after the interruption of any of these activities. Milkers and milk haulers or samplers shall wear clean outer garments while milking or handling milk, milk containers , utensils, or equipment. (b) Public Health Reason -The reasons for clean hands of the persons doing the milking are similar to those for cleanliness of the animal's udders. The milker's hands must be assumed to have been exposed to contamination during the course of his/her normal duties on the farm and at milking time. Because the -63 -I Cf j g hands of all workers frequently come into contact with their clothing, it is important that the clothes worn during milking and the handling of milk be clean. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Hands are washed clean and dried with an individual sanitary towel immediately before milking, before performing any milkhouse function, and immediately after the interruption of any of these activities. 2. Milkers, milk haulers, or samplers wear clean outer garments while milking or handling milk, milk containers , utensils, or equipment. (20) Cooling (a) Raw Milk for pasteurization, ultra-pasteurization , aseptic processing , and packaging or retort processed after packaging shall be cooled to 10\u00b0c (50\u00b0F) or less within four ( 4) hours or less of the commencement of the first milking and to 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F) or less, within two (2) hours after the completion of milking; provided, that the blend temperature after the first milking and subsequent mllklngs does not exceed 10\u00b0c (S0\u00b0F). (b) Public Health Reason 1. Milk produced by disease-free animals and under clean conditions usually contains relatively few bacteria immediately after milking. These multiply to enormous numbers in a few hours unless the milk is cooled. When the milk is cooled quickly to 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0C) or less, there is only a slow increase in numbers of bacteria. In order to understand this. It is necessary to recall merely that bacteria are actually infinitesimal plants and that most plants do not grow in cold weather. 2. Usually, the bacteria in milk are harmless, and if this were always true, there would be no reason to cool milk except to delay souring. There is however, no way for the dairyman or Health Officer to be absolutely sure that no disease bacteria have entered the milk even though observance of the other items of these rules will greatly reduce this likelihood. The likelihood of transmitting disease is much increased then the milk contains large numbers of disease bacteria. Therefore, it is extremely important for milk to be cooled quickly so that small numbers of bacteria which may have entered will not multiply. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Raw milk for pasteurization is cooled to 10\u00b0c (50\u00b0F) or less within two (2) hours of the commencement of the first milking; provided that the blend temperature after the first milking and subsequent milkings does not exceed 10\u00b0F {S0\u00b0F). 2. Recirculated cold water which is used in plate or tubular coolers or heat exchanges is from a safe source and protected from contamination. Such water shall be tested semi~annually and shall comply with the current bacteriological standards established by the EPA for drinking water. 3. All farm bulk tanks manufactured after January 1, 2000, shall be -64-1~;:\u00a7e equipped with an approved temperature-recording device. (i) The temperature-recording device shall be operated continuously and be maintained in a properly functioning manner. Circular charts shall not overlap. Electronic records that comply with the applicable provisions of Appendix H, IV, and V, with or without hard copy, may be used in place of temperature-recording records. (ii) The temperature-recording device shall be verified every six (6) months and documented in a manner acceptable to the Health Officer uslng an accurate ( +/-1 \u00b0C (2\u00b0F] thermometer that has been calibrated by a traceable standard thermometer, within the past six (6) months, with the results and date recorded, and the thermometer being properly identified or by using a traceable standard thermometer that has been calibrated within the last year. (iii) Temperature-recording records shall be maintained on the premises for a period of a minimum of six (6) months and are available for review by the Health Officer.

(i) Rooms In Which milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products are handled, processed , stored, condensed , dried, and packaged or in which milk or frozen dessert containers, utensils, and equipment are washed or stored, shall not open directly into any stable or any room for domestic purposes. All rooms shall be of sufficient size for their intended purposes . -71-l';gt;'. (ii) Designated areas or rooms shall be provided for the receiving, handling, ahd storage of returned packaged milk, milk products, and frozen desserts. (b) Public Health Reason -If the washing and sanitization of containers are conducted in the same room in which the pasteurizing, processing, cooling, condensing , drying, or packag1ng or bottling is done, there is opportunity for the pasteurized product to become contaminated. For this reason, separate rooms are required as indicated . The unloading of cans of raw milk directly into the pasteurizing room is apt to increase the prevalence of insects therein, as well as, to render it to public. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Pasteurizing , processing, reconstitution, cooling, condensing, drying, and packaging of milk and milk products are conducted in a single room(s), but not in the same room(s) used for the cleaning of milk cans, portable storage bins, bottles, and cases or the unloading and/or cleaning and sanitizing of milk tank trucks, provided that these rooms may be separated by solid partitioning doors that are kept closed. Provided further, that cooling, plate or tubular, may be done in the room where milk tank trucks are unloaded and/or cleaned and sanitized. Separation/clarification of raw milk may be done in an enclosed room where m11k tank trucks are unloaded and/or cleaned and sanitized. Note: Packaging of dry milk or milk products shall be conducted in a separate room. 2. All returned packaged milk, milk products, and frozen desserts which have physically left the premises of the processing plant shall be received, handled, and stored in separate areas or rooms isolated from the Grade \"A\" and frozen dessert dairy operations. Such separate areas or rooms shall be clearly defined and marked for such use. 3. All bulk milk and milk product storage tanks are vented into a room used for pasteurization, processing, cooling, or packaging operations or into a storage tank gallery room, provided that vents located elsewhere which are adequately equipped with air filters so as to preclude the contamination of the milk, milk product, or frozen dessert products shall be considered satisfactory. 4. Solid doors installed in required partitions are self-closing. 5. Facilities for the cleaning and sanitizing of milk tank trucks are properly equipped for manual and/or mechanical operations.

Cottage cheese vats shall be located in a separate room, maintained free from flies and other vermin, and kept in a clean condition. (6) Toilet-Sewage Disposal Facilities (a) Every milk and frozen dessert plant shall be provided with toilet facilities conforming to the Rules of the Alabama State Board of Health. Toilet rooms shall not open directly into any room in which milk, frozen desserts, and milk products are processed. Toilet rooms shall be completely enclosed and shall have tight-fitting, self-closing doors. Dressing rooms, toilet rooms, and fixtures shall be kept in a clean condition, in good repair and shall be well ventilated and well lighted. Sewage and other liquid wastes shall be disposed of in a sanitary manner. (b) Public Health Reason 1. Human excreta are potentially dangerous and must be disposed of in a sanitary manner. The organisms causing typhoid fever, para-typhoid fever. and dysentery may be present in the body discharges of active cases or carriers. Sanitary toilet facilities are necessary to protect the milk, milk products, or frozen dessert products, equipment, containers, and utensils from fecal contamination which may be carried by flies, other insects, hands, or clothing. When the toilet facilities of a satisfactory type are kept clean and in good repair, the opportunities for the spread of contamination by the above means are minimized . The provision of an intervening room or vestibule between the toilet room and any room in which milk, milk products, or frozen desserts are processed makes it less likely that contaminated flies will enter these rooms. It will also minimize the spread of odors. 2. The wastes resulting from the cleaning and rinsing of containers , equipment, utensils, and floors from flush toilets and from washing facilities should be properly disposed of so as not to contaminate the milk and frozen dessert containers, utensils, or equipment, or to create a nuisance or a public health hazard. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. The milk or frozen dessert plant is provided with toilet facilities conforming to the Rules of the State Board of Health. 2. Toilet rooms do not open directly into any room in which milk and/or milk products are processed, condensed, or dried. 3. Toilet rooms are completely enclosed and have tight-fitting, self-closing doors. 4. Dressing rooms, toilet rooms, and fixtures are kept in a clean condition, in good repair, and are well-ventilated and well-lighted . 5. Toilet tissue and easily cleanable covered waste receptacles are provided in toilet rooms. -73-I \u00b7 6. All plumbing is installed to meet the applicable provisions of the state or local plumbing code. 7. Sewage and other liquid wastes are disposed of in a sanitary manner. 8. Non-water-carried sewage disposal facilities are not used. (7) Water Supply (a) Water for milk and frozen dessert plant purposes shall be from a supply properly located, protected , and operated and be easily accessible , adequate, and of a safe, sanitary quality. (b) Public Health Reason -The water supply should be accessible in order to encourage its use in cleaning operations; and it should be adequate so that cleaning and rinsing may be thorough; and it should be of safe, sanitary quality in order to avoid the contamination of milk, frozen dessert, containers, utensils, and equipment. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Water for milk and frozen dessert plant purposes is from an adequate supply, properly located, protected , and operated. It shall be easily accessible and of a safe, sanitary quality. 2. The water supply is approved as safe by the Health Officer and, in the case of individual water systems. complies with at least the specification outlined in Appendix D and the bacteriological standards outlined in Appendix G. 3. There is no cross-connect ion between the safe water supply and any unsafe or questionable water supply or any source of pollution through which the safe water supply might become contaminated. A connection between the water supply piping and a make-up tank (such as for cooling or condensing), unless protected by an air gap or effective backflow preventer, constitutes a violation of this requirement. An approved air gap is defined as the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere of at least twice the diameter of the largest incoming water supply pipe or faucet to the flood level of the vessel or receptacle. The distance of the air gap is to be measured from the bottom of the potable inlet supply pipe or faucet to the top of the effective overflow, (i.e., flood level rim or internal overflow of the vessel). In no case, may the effective air gap be less than 2.54 centimeter (one [1] inch). 4. Condensing water for milk or milk product evaporators and water used to produce vacuum and/or to condense vapors in vacuum heat processing equipment is from a source complying with 2 above, provided when approved by the Health Officer. water from sources not complying with 2 above may be used when the evaporator or vacuum heat equipment is constructed and operated to preclude contamination of such equipment or its contents by condensing water or by water used to produce vacuum. Means of preventing such contamination are: (i) Use of a surface-type condenser in which the condensing water is physically separated from the vapors -and compensated , or (ii) Use of reliable safeguards to prevent the overflow of condensing water from the condenser into the evaporator. Such safeguards include a barometric leg extending at least thirty~five (35) feet vertically from the invert of the outgoing condensing water line to the free level at which the leg discharges or a safety shut off valve, located on the water feed line to the condenser , automatically actuated by a control which will shut off the inflowing water when the water level rises above a predeterm ined point in the condenser. This valve may be actuated by water, air, or electricity and shall be designed so that failure of the primary motivating power will automatically stop the flow of water into the condenser . 5. Condensing water for milk or milk product evaporators complying with 2 above and water reclaimed from milk or milk products, may be reused when all necessary means of protection are afforded and it complies with the procedures outlined in Appendix D, V. 6. New individual water supplies and water supply systems, which have been repaired or otherwise become contaminated , are disinfected before being placed in use (refer to Appendix D). The supply shall be made free of the disinfectant by pumping to waste before any sample for bacteriological testing shall be collected. 7. Samples for bacteriological testing of individual water supplies are taken upon the initial approval of the physical structure, each six (6) months thereafter , and when any repair or alteration of the water supply system has been made. Samples shall be taken by the Health Officer and examination shall be conducted in an official laboratory . To determine if water samples have been taken at the frequency established in this item, the interval shall include the designated six (6) month period plus the remaining days of the month in which the sample is due. 8. Current records of water test results are retained on file with the Health Officer or as the Health Officer directs. 9. Water supply outlets are provided immediately available to the cottage cheese vats, The hose for transport of water for washing cottage cheese curd shall be arranged in such a way as to preclude the possibility of the hose touching the floor or the product. 10. A potable water supply, which meets the criteria of this rule, may be connected to the product feed line of a steam vacuum evaporator , provided that the water supply is protected at the point of connection by an approved backflow prevention device. 11 Water supply piping connected to raw or pasteurized milk, milk product. or frozen dessert product lines or vessels shall be protected with an effective backflow preventer . Note: Refer to Rule 420-3 16-.15(c) , Administrative Procedures , for additional requirements involving the protection of milk and milk products.

In plants utilizing automatic bottle washers, such washers must provide for bactericidal treatment by means of steam, hot water, or chemical treatment. Soaker-type bottle washers, in which bactericidal treatment depends upon the causticity of the washing solution, the caustic strength for a given soaking time and temperature shall be as specified in the following table listing combinations of causticity , time, and temperature of equal bactericidal value, for the soaker tank of soaker-type bottle washers: TABLE 2 COMBINATIONS OF CAUSTIC ITY, TIME, AND TEMPERA TURE OF EQUAL BACTERJCIDAL VALUE, FOR SOAKER TANK OF SOAKER-TYPE BOTTLE WASHERS (Based on NSDA Specifications for Beverage Bottles) Temperature , Degrees F 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 C 77 71 66 60 54 49 43 Concentration of NaO H, Percent 3 0.57 0.86 1.28 1.91 0.36 0.53 0.80 1.19 1.78 1.66 I 3.98 Note: The National Soft Drink Association (NSDA), Washington, D.C. 20036 alkali test, the NSDA caustic test, or other suitable test may be used to determine the strength of the soaker solution. The caustic strength shall be tested monthly by the Health Officer. 10. When caustic is so used, subsequent final rinsing of the bottles shall be with water which has been treated with heat or chemicals to assure freedom from viable pathogenic or otherwise harmful organisms, to prevent recontamination of the treated bottles during the rinsing operation. -84-I P -': 11. All multi-use containers, equipment, and utenstls are sanitized before use, employing one or a combination of the methods prescribed under Rule 420-3-16- .09( 11 )_ Additionally, for milk and frozen dessert plants that condense or dry milk products the following methods are acceptable or any other method, which has been demonstrated to be equally efficient: (i) Exposure to an enclosed jet of stream for not less than one (1) minute. (ii) Exposure to hot air at a temperature of at least 83\u00b0C ( 180\u00b0F) for at least twenty (20) minutes as measured by an acceptable indicating thermometer located In the coldest zone. 12. Assembled equipment shall be sanitized prior to each day's run, unless the FDA and the Health Officer have reviewed and accepted information supporting the sanitizing of multi-use containers, utensils, and equipment at frequencies extending beyond one (1) day. Tests to determine the efficiency of sanitization should be made by the Health Officer at intervals sufficient to satisfy the Health Officer that the sanitization process is effective. 13. For milk plants that dry milk, milk products, or frozen dessert products, higher temperatures and longer periods may be necessary for the sanitization of high-pressure lines. It has been demonstrated that alkaline cleaners at 72\u00b0C (160\u00b0F) for thirty (30) minutes, followed by an acid cleaner for thirty (30) minutes at the same temperature, produce satisfactory results. Studies have indicated that effective sanitization of the dryer may be accomplished by the following procedure : (i) Operate the spray nozzles with water at a temperature and rates at least as high as those employed during the drying operation. {ii) Adjust airflow to give at least 0.5 inch (water) pressure in the drying chamber (iii) Continue the operation for twenty (20) minutes while a temperature of not less than 85\u00b0C ( 185\u00b0F) is being registered at the discharge from the dryer. 14. Portions of the drying system not reached by this treatment or dryers in which this procedure is not practical shall be treated by one of the methods prescribed above, or by other methods of demonstrated effectiveness. 15. The residual bacteria count of multi-use containers and closures shall be conducted as outlined in Appendix J. The residual bacterial count of multi-use containers used for packaging pasteurized milk and/or milk products shall not exceed one (1) colony per milliliter (1/mL) of capacity, when the rinse test is used, or fifty (50) colonies per fifty (50) square centimeters (cm2) one (1) colony per square centimeter) of product-contact surface, when the swab test is used, in three (3) out of four (4) samples taken at random on a given day. Coliform organisms shall be undetectable in all multi-use containers. 16. The residual bacteria count of single-service containers and closures, used for packaging pasteurized milk and/or milk products shall not exceed fifty (50) colonies per container , or in the case of dry product packaging , shall not exceed -85 -I P , one (1) colony per milliliter (1/ml) of capacity when the rinse test is used, except that in containers less than 100 ml the count shall not exceed ten ( 1 O) colonies or fifty (50) colonies per fifty (50) cm2 (one (1) colony per square centimeter) of product-contact surface, when the swab test is used, in three (3) out of four (4) samples taken at random on a given day. Coliform organisms shall be undetectable in all single-service containers and/or closures. 17. When single-service containers and/or closures are fabricated in another plant that conforms to the Standards of Appendix J and the Health Officer has information that they do comply, the Health Officer may accept the containers and/or closures as being in conformance without additional testing. If there is reason to believe that containers and/or closures do not conform to the bacteriological standards , additional testing may be required. If containers and/or closures are fabricated in the milk plant, the Health Officer shall collect, during any consecutive six (6) months, at least four (4) sample sets of containers with applied closures, as defined in Appendix J from each manufacturing line, as defined in Appendix J, in at least four (4) separate months, except when three (3) months show a month containing two (2) sampling dates separated by at least twenty (20) days, and analyze the sample sets at an Official Commercial or Industry Laboratory . approved by the Milk Laboratory Control Agency specifically for the examinations required under Appendix J. 18. Plants which utilize multi-use plastic containers for pasteurized milk, milk products, and frozen desserts shall compfy with the following criteria: (i) The plastic material from which the containers are molded shall be of safe material. (ii) The plastic material shall comply with the material specifications of Rule 420-3-16- .10(11). (iii) All containers shall be identified as to plant of manufacture , date of manufacture , and type and class of plastic material used. This information may be by code, provided the code is revealed to the Health Officer. (iv) A device shall be installed in the filling line capable of detecting in each container before it is filled, volatile organic contaminants in amounts that are of public health significance . Such device must be constructed so that it may be sealed by the Health Officer to prevent the changing of its sensitivity functioning level. Models using an air-injection system and with a testing device built into the detection equipment do not have to be sealed. To assure proper functioning of the system, the operator needs to be able to adjust the sensitivity. However , those models utilizing an external testing device must be sealed. Any container detected by the device as being unsatisfactory must be automatically made unusable to prevent refilling. In addition, the device must be interconnected so that the system will not operate unless the detecting device is in proper operating condition, provided any other system so designed and operated will provide equal assurance of freedom from contamination and recognized by the FDA to be equally efficient may be accepted by the Health Officer. When other systems are used ln place of a device for the detection of volatile organic contaminants , the following criteria has been developed to determine what constitutes equal assurance : -86 -I r ~ i; (v) A soaker-type washer shall be used for cleanlng and sanitizing the containers and shall conform with the following criteria: I. If caustic is used, the caustic strength for a given washing time and temperature shall be as specified in Table 2 of this item; or II.

There shall be at least a two (2) minute soak time in the soaker tank. V. The temperature of the soaker tank shall be at least 69\u00b0C (155\u00b0F); and the final rinse subsequent to the soaking tank shall be with a sanitizing solution. VI. The soaker-type washer system shall be so designed and operated that unless the time, temperature , and concentration, as specified for the soaker solutions. are met, the containers cannot be discharged from the washer. The mechanism for control of the time, temperature. and concentration of the use solution shall be sealed. VII. A standard must be available for the use of the Health Officer for testing the proper sensitivity functioning levels of the detection device. VIII. A thorough inspection procedure shall be in effect to remove any containers which show stress cracks, splitting, pitting, discoloration , or cloudiness, as well as any unremoved soil. This shall be carried out with adequate light and be much more thorough than the customary cursory inspection given to glass bottles. IX. The containers shall comply with the applicable construction requirements of Rule 420-3-16- .10(11). The closure for the contalner shall be single-service . Screw-type closures shall not be used. X.

Milk plant operations that handle nondairy food allergens shall have a written food allergen control plan to protect milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products from allergen cross-contract, including during storage and use, and to ensure proper declaration of allergens on product labeling. (b) Public Health Reason -Because of the nature of milk, milk products, and frozen desserts and their susceptibility to contamination by bacteria, chemicals , and other adulterants, as well as the potential for allergen cross-contact of such products in certain facilities, every effort should be made to provide adequate -89 -I Pase protection for the milk, milk products, and frozen desserts at all times. Public health officials have long recognized that raw milk contains microorganisms of public health concern and it is important to understand that these microorganisms may be found in the milk plant environment if measures are not taken to minimize the risk of contamination by these microorganisms . Contamination of milk from the environment can result in milkborne illness. Misuse of pesticides and other harmful chemicals can provide opportunities for contamination of the milk, milk product, or frozen dessert or equipment with which the milk, milk product, or frozen dessert comes in contact. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Equipment and operations are so located within the plant as to prevent overcrowding and contamination of cleaned and sanitized containers , equipment, and utensils by splash, condensation , or manual contact. 2. Packaged milk, milk products, and frozen desserts which have physically left the premise or the processing plant are not repasteurized for Grade \"A\" or grade manufacturing use. The Health Officer may, on a specific individual request, authorize reprocessing of packaged milk, milk products, and frozen desserts; provided, all other aspects of this item, including proper storage temperature and container integrity are complied with; provided, that the re\u00ad pasteurization of milk, milk products, and frozen desserts shipped in milk transport tankers which have been pasteurized at another Grade \"A\" or manufacturing grade plant and have been handled in a sanitary manner and maintained at 7\u00b0C ( 45\u00b0F) or less is permitted . Equipment , designated areas, or rooms utilized for storage, processing , and handling of returned packaged milk, milk products, and frozen desserts are maintained , operated, cleaned, and sanitized so as to preclude contamination of Grade \"A\" milk, milk products , frozen dessert products. equipment, and the operations. Note: The option for the authorizing of the reprocessing of packaged milk and/or milk products on an individual request, as cited in 2 above, shall not be applicable to a TPC authorized under the ICP. 3. All product-contact surfaces of containers, equipment. and utensils are covered or otherwise protected to prevent the access of insects, dust, condensation, and other contaminat ion. All openings, including valves and piping attached to milk and milk product storage tanks and m11k tank trucks, pumps, or vats, etc., shall be capped or otherwise properly protected . While unloading at a receiving station, transfer station, or pasteurizat ion plant, one of the following conditions shall be met: (i) If the area is completely enclosed (walls and ceiling, with doors closed) during the unloading process and the dust-cover or dome and the manhole cover is opened slightly and held in this position by the metal clamps used to close the cover, then a filter is not required. However, if the dust~cover and/or manhole cover(s) are opened in excess of that provided by the metal clamps or the covers have been removed, then a suitable filter is required for the manhole. (ii) If the area is not completely enclosed or doors of the unloading area -90 -I r \" .. , are open during unloadlng , a suitable filter is required for the manhole or air inlet vent and suitable protection must be provided over the filter material either by design of the filter holding apparatus or a roof or ceiling over the area. When weather and environmental conditions permit, manhole openings and covers of milk tank trucks may be opened outdoors for the short period of time necessary for the collection of samples for animal drug residue screening. Direct connections from milk tank truck to milk tank truck must be made from valve to valve or through the manhole lid; provided, all connections are made ferrule-to-ferrule and adequate protection is provided for the air vent. (iii) Receiving and dump vats shall be completely covered, except during washing and sanitizing, and when milk is being dumped. Where strainers are used, the cover for the vat opening shall be designed to cover the opening with the strainer In place. 4. Ingredients added to milk, milk products, and frozen desserts are handled in such a manner as to avoid contamination . 5. Whenever air under pressure is used for the agitation or movement of milk, or is directed at a milk-contact surface, it is free of oil, dust, rust, excessive moisture, extraneous materials, and odor, and shall otherwise comply with the applicable standards of Appendix H.

During processing , pipelines and equipment used to contain or conduct milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products shall be effectively separated from tanks/silos and/or circuits containing cleaning and/or sanitizing solutions. This can be accomplished by: (i) Physically disconnecting all connection points between tanks/silos and/or circuits containing cleaning and/or sanitizing solutions from pipelines and equipment used to contain or conduct milk and/or milk products; or -93 -I \u00b5 (Ii) Separation of all connection points between such circuits by at least two (2) automatically controlled valves with a drainable opening to the atmosphere between the valves; or by a single-bodied double seat mixproof valve, with a drainable opening to the atmosphere between the seats, if: (I) the drainable opening to the atmosphere {vent) is equal to the largest pipeline connected to the mixproof valve or one (1) of the following exceptions: a. If the cross sectional area of the vent opening is less than that of the largest pipe diameter for the double seat valve, the maximum pressure in the space between the two (2) valve seats for the double seat valve shall be equivalent to or less than the maximum pressure In the space between the two (2) blocking seats of two (2) automatically controlled compression type valves (three [3]-way valve to the drain and a two (2]-way valve separating product lines from cleaning and/or sanitizing solution lines); or b. In low pressure gravity drain applications, ( i.e., cheese curd transfer lines from cheese process vats where the product Hne Is the same size or larger than the cleaning and/or sanitizi'ng solution line), the vent may be the size of the solution line and the valves or valve seats are not required to be position detectable. In order to accept this variation, the valve(s) shall fail to the blocked position upon loss of air or power, and there shall not be any pumps capable of pushing milk and/or milk product, cleaning solutions, and/or sanitizing solutions into this valve arrangement. (II) Both valves and valve seats, in the case of single-bodied double seat valves, are position detectable and capable of providing an electronic signal when not properly seated in the blocked position (refer to Appendix H, I-pg. H-1 ), (111) These valves or valve seats, in the case of single-bodied double seat valves, are part of an automatic fail-safe system that shall prevent the contamination of milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products with cleaning and/or sanitizing solutions. Automatic fail-safe systems shall be unique to each particular installation, but are normally based on the premise that both blocking valve seats are properly seated in the blocked position before the CIP cleaning system can be activated for the cleaning circuit containing this valve arrangement, except as provided in (VI) below. (IV) The system shall not have any manual overrides . (V) Controls for the fail-safe system are secured as directed by the Health Officer in order to prevent unauthorized changes. (VI) The vent is not cleaned until milk and/or milk products have been removed or isolated, except in the case of a properly designed and operated single\u00ad bodied double seat valve, in which case, the vent may be cleaned while milk and/or milk products are present in one ( 1) of the valve housings. A properly designed and operated single-bodied double-seat valve shall incorporate the following: I. There shall not be any impingement of cleaning liqurd on the opposite -94-I P valve seat gasket during seat lifting, even in the case of damaged or missing gaskets. II.

During a seat-lift operation, the position of the seat opposite to the seat being lifted shall be monitored by a position detection device that is interlocked with the cleaning pump or source of the CIP cleaning solution pressure such that if this opposite seat is determined to be other than fully closed, the cleaning pump or source of the CIP cleaning solution pressure shall be immediately de-energized . IV. The single-bodied double seat valve vent cavity cleaning option shall have an Automated Fail-Safe Control System and the Control System shall comply with applicable provisions of Appendix H, VI. (\\'11) Variations from the above specifications may be individually evaluated and found to also be acceptable If the level of protection Is not compromised. (iii) In the case of higher-heat-shorter-time (HHST) pasteurized milk and milk products that are processed and the equipment cleaned and/or chemically sanitized above the atmospheric boiling point of the milk or milk product or cleaning and/or sanitizing solutions, the required separation between pipe lines and equipment used to contain or conduct milk and milk products and tanks or circuits containing cleaning and/or chemical sanitizing solutions may be accomplished using an alarmed steam block(s}, located between the milk and milk product or cleaning and/or chemical sanitizing solutions If: (I) The steam block is equipped with a visible steam trace that exits at the bottom of the steam block; (II) The steam trace is equipped with a temperature sensor that is capable of differentiating between those temperatures that indicate steam exiting the steam trace has not been exposed to liquid in the steam block and temperatures that will occur when liquid is present in the steam block; (Ill) This steam trace shall be physically isolated from other steam lines or traces such that the temperature sensor measures the steam temperature only from that single trace; (IV) The temperature sensor is integrated with automatic controls, such that when there is milk or milk products on one ( 1) side of the steam block and cleaning and/or chemical sanitizing solutions on the other side of the steam block, and the temperature sensor in the steam trace detects a temperature that indicates that liquld, rather than steam, is present in the steam trace, the cleaning pump shall be de\u00ad energized , and when needed to prevent solution pressure on the steam block, the cleaning and/or chemical sanitizing solution are automatically drained away from the steam block. Except that in systems where the cleaning and/or sanitizing solution is circulated by the timing pump, that pump may continue to operate during an alarmed condition ; provided, a legal flow-diversion device (FOO) is used to divert the -95 -I Ii' ~ \u00a3 I.! cleaning and/or chemical sanitizing solution flow away from the steam block. (V) During times when a steam block(s) is used as described in this section to provide separation between pipe lines and equipment used to contain or conduct milk and milk products and tanks or circuits containing cleaning and/or chemical sanitizing solutions, there shall be no time delays or other means that delay an immediate automatic response to liquid exiting the steam trace; (VI) Although the automatic control system is not required to comply with Appendix H, VI, there shall be means provided to test and verify the accuracy of the sensor and the operation of the control system. (VII) In order to facilitate testing, the temperature set point that will activate the automatic controls described in this section shall be identified for each steam block used for this purpose. Means shall be provided to verify that lowering the temperature below this set point will activate the control system when a steam block(s) is used, as described in this section, to provide separation between pipe lines and equipment used to contain or conduct milk and milk products and tanks or circuits containing cleaning and/or chemical sanitizing solutions. Note: The valve arrangement(s) described in this section shall not be used to separate raw products, dairy, non-dairy , or water, from pasteurized milk or milk products; provided, nothing in this section shall be construed as barring any other means to separate milk and milk product from cleaning/sanitizing solution in systems which have been recognized by the FDA to be equally effective and which are approved by the Health Officer. 25.

In the event of a ooter control authority Issued boil ooter order or other emergency that renders the water supply to be a public health concern, the established approved equivalency protocol shall be evaluated to determine that it will continue to produce water equivalent to pasteurized water. In addition, a safety assessment shall be made of the milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products that may have been affected during the time that the water utilized may not have been equivalent to pasteurized water. b. This section does not require separate raw and pasteurized CIP cleaning systems. 26, Pasteurized re-circulation lines, divert lines, and leak-detect lines connecting to the constant-level tank shall be designed so that there is an air gap between the termination of these pipelines and the raw milk or milk product overflow level. This air gap shall be equivalent to at least two (2) times the diameter of the largest of these pipelines. For purposes of this section, an overflow Is defined as the flood rim of the constant-level tank or any unrestricted opening below the flood rim of the constant-level tank which is large enough that it is at least equivalent to two (2) times the diameter of the largest of these pipelines. 27. All milk and/or milk products that have overflowed , leaked, been spilled, or improperly handled are discarded. Milk and/or milk products drained from processing equipment at the end of a run, collected from a defoamer system, and milk or milk product solids rinsed from equipment, containers, or pipelines shall be repasteurized only if such milk or milk products are handled in a sanitary manner and maintained at 7\u00b0C ( 45\u00b0F) or less. When the handling and/or cooling of such milk and/or milk products are not in compliance with this requirement , they shall be discarded. Milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products from damaged, punctured , or otherwise contaminated containers or product from out-of-code containers shall not be repasteurized for Grade \"A\" use. -97-I 28.

(vi) A pump(s) shall not be located between the heat-transfer water inlet to the plate or double/triple tube type heat exchanger and the water supply tank, unless it is designed and installed to operate only when pasteurized mill< or milk product is flowing through the pasteurized milk or milk product side of the plate or double/triple tube type heat exchanger and when the pressure of the pasteurized milk or milk product is higher than the maximum pressure produced by the pump(s). This may be accomplished by wiring the heat-transfer water pump(s) so that it cannot operate unless: (I) Pasteurized milk or milk product is flowing through the pasteurized milk or milk product side of the plate or double/triple tube type heat exchanger . (II) The pasteurized milk or milk product pressure exceeds, by at least 6.9 kPa (1 psi), the maximum pressure developed by the heat-transfer water pump. A pressure differential controller shall be installed with a sensor located at the heat\u00ad transfer water inlet to the plate or double/triple tube type heat exchanger and the pasteurized milk or milk product outlet of the plate or double/triple tube type heat exchanger.

(ii) Document that a supplier of non-milk and/or milk, milk product, and frozen desserts product Ingredients has a functional and written food safety program that includes allergen management , if utilized in the milk plant's Grade \"A\" milk and/or milk products. ( 16) Pasteurizat ion,, Aseptic Processing and Packaging and Retort Processed After Packaging (a) Pasteurization shall be performed as defined in Rule 420-3-16-.02 and 420-3-16-.10( 16). Aseptic processing and packaging and retort processed after packaging shall be performed in accordance with the applicable requirements of 21 CFR Parts 108, 110, and 113 (refer to Appendix L). . 100 -I r ., ~ , 1. In all cases, except for the specific exemptions provided for in Administrative Procedures 3, pasteurization of raw milk or milk product shall be performed before the raw milk, milk product, or frozen dessert product enters the reverse osmosis (RO), ultra-filtration (UF), evaporator , or condensing equipment and shall be performed in the milk plant where the processing is done. All condensed milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products transported to a milk plant or frozen dessert plant for drying shall be re-pasteurized at the milk plant or frozen dessert plant at which it is dried. If condensed whey containing at least 40 percent total solids has been partially crystallized by cooling, it may be transported to a separate milk plant for drying without re-pasteurization1 provided the following conditions are complied with: 2. The condensed , partially crystallized whey is cooled and maintained at 7\u00b0C ( 45\u00b0F) or less. 3. Milk tank trucks dedicated to hauling pasteurized product shall be used to transport the condensed , partially crystallized whey and shall be washed and sanitized immediately prior to filling and then sealed after filling until unloading . 4. Separate unloading pumps and pipelines shall be provided and used only for the unloading of the condensed, partially crystallized whey. Such pumps and pipelines shall be cleaned and sanitized as a separate cleaning circuit. (b) Public Health Reason 1 . The public health value of pasteurization is unanimously agreed upon by health officials. Long experience conclusively shows its value in the prevention of diseases which may be transmitted through milk. Pasteurization is the only practical commercial measure which, if properly applied to all milk, will destroy all milk-borne disease organisms. Examination of lactating animals and milk handlers, while desirable and of great value can be done only at intervals and. therefore, it is possible for pathogenic bacteria to enter the milk for varying periods before the disease condition is discovered . Disease bacteria may also enter milk accidentally from other sources such as flies, contaminated water, utensils, etc. It has been demonstrated that the time-temperature combinations specified by these rules, if applied to every particle of milk, will devitalize all milk-borne pathogens. Compilations of outbreak of milk-borne disease by the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and FDA over many years indicate that the risk of contracting disease from raw milk is approximately fifty (50) times as great as from milk labeled \"pasteurized .\" 2. A note of caution is in order. Although pasteurization devitalizes the organisms, it does not destroy the toxins that may be formed in milk and/or milk products when certain staphylococci are present (as from udder infections), and when the milk, milk products , and/or frozen dessert product are not properly refrigerated before pasteurization. Such toxins may cause severe illness. Aseptic processing and packaging and retort processed after packaging have also been conclusively demonstrated to be effective in preventing outbreaks from milk borne pathogens. 3. Numerous studies and observations clearly prove that the food value of -101 -I r , ~ _ milk is not significantly impaired by pasteurizat ion. (c) Administrative Procedures -The pasteurization portion of this item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Every particle of milk, milk product, or frozen dessert is heated in properly designed and operated equipment to one of the temperatures specified in the following table and held continuously at or above that temperature for at least the time specified: Table 3. Pasteurization Temperature vs. Time Batch (Vat) Pasteurization Temperature Time 63\u00b0c ( 145\u00b0F}* 30 minutes 100\u00b0c (212\u00b0F} 0.01 seconds *If the fat content of the milk product is 10 percent or greater, or a total solids of 18 percent or greater or if it contains added sweeteners , the specified temperature shall be increased by 5\u00b0F (3\u00b0C); provided, that eggnog and frozen dessert mix shall be heated to at least the following temperature and time specifications : 69\u00b0C 155\u00b0F 30 minutes Continuous Flow HHST Pasteurization Time 25 seconds 83\u00b0C 180\u00b0F 15 seconds 2.

Diverted product that has exited the system shall be either discarded , immediately cooled to below 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F), or immediately pasteurized. (111) The RO or UF system shall be equipped with temperature monltoring and recording devices that comply with the applicable specifications outlined in Appendix H. At a minimum, milk or milk product temperature shall be monitored and recorded prior to entering the system, prior to entering each stage of the modules in series that contains cooling, and the retentate stream prior to any final cooler and upon exiting the system.

(ii) If there is a continuous , circulating retentate loop with a feed and bleed system, the following design, installation and operational criteria shall be complied with: (I) The MF system is designed and operated to assure that milk or milk product temperature In the circulating retentate loop is maintained at or below 18.3\u00b0C (65\u00b0F), or at or above 51. 7\u00b0C (125\u00b0F) throughout the process; provided, the product temperature may rise above 18.3\u00b0C (65\u00b0F) or fall below 51. 7\u00b0C ( 125\u00b0F) for a period of not more than fifteen (15) minutes; further provided, should the product temperature rise above 21.1\u00b0c (70\u00b0F) or fall below 48.9\u00b0C (120\u00b0F), the product shall be either immediately diverted to the system's balance tank until the product is again below 18.3\u00b0C (65\u00b0F) or above 51.?\u00b0C (125\u00b0F), or be diverted to exit the system entirely. Diverted product that has exited the system shall be either discarded , immediately cooled to below 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F). or immediately pasteurized . (II) The MF system shall be equipped with temperature monitoring and recording devices that comply with the applicable specificat ions outlined in Appendix H. At a minimum, milk or milk product temperature shall be monitored and recorded prior to entering the MF system and within the circulating retentate loop of each module just prior to the circulation pump. (Ill) The permeate from the MF system is either immediately cooled to below 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F), or immediately pasteurized . -104 -I P c , 6. All condensed milk and milk products transported to a milk plant for drying shall be repasteurized at the milk plant where it is dried. 7. If condensed whey containing at least 40 percent total solids has oeen partially crystallized by cooling, it may be transported to a separate milk plant for drying without re-pasteurization ; provided, the following conditions are complied with: (i) The condensed , partially crystallized whey is cooled and maintained at 7\u00b0C ( 45\u00b0F) or less. (Ii) Milk tank trucks used to transport the condensed , partially crystallized whey shall be washed and sanitized immediately prior to filling and are sealed after filling until unloading . (iii) Separate unloading pumps and pipelines shall be provided and used only for the unloading of the condensed , partially crystallized whey. Such pumps and pipelines shall be cleaned and sanitized as a separate cleaning circuit. 8. The design and the operation of pasteurization equipment and all appurtenances thereto shall comply with the applicable specifications and operational procedures of sub-items (I), (II), (Ill), (IV), and (V) as follows: ( 17) Batch Pasteurizatio n ( 1) All indicating and recording thermome ters used in connection with the batch pasteurization of milk, milk products, or frozen desserts shall comply with the applicable specifications set forth in Appendix H. (Specifications for test thermometers and other test equipment appear in Appendix 1). (2) Public Health Reason (a) Unless the temperature-control instruments and devices used on pasteurization equipment are accurate within known limits, there can be no assurance that the proper pasteurization temperature is being applied. Pasteurization must be performed in equipment which is properly designed and operated, and which ensures that every particle of milk, milk products, or frozen desserts will be held continuously at the proper temperature for the specified period of time. (b) Recording thermometers are the only known means for furnishing the Health Officer with a record of the time and temperature of pasteurizat ion. Experience has shown that recording thermometers due to their mechanical complexity are not entirely reliable. Therefore , mercury indicating thermometers or equivalent , which are much more reliable are needed to provide a check on the recording thermometers and assurance that proper temperatures are being applied. (c) The recording thermometer shows the temperature of the product Immediately surrounding its bulb, but cannot indicate the temperature of the -105 -j 11 ,l g l! product in other portions of the holder. Similarly, it shows the holding time in manual-discharge vats but not in automatic-discharge systems. The pasteurizer must, therefore, be so designed and so operated and, where necessary ; provided, with such automatic controls as to assure that every portion of the milk, milk product, or frozen dessert product will be subjected to the proper temperature for the requlred length of time. (d) Unless the inlet and outlet valves and connections to vats properly designed and operated, cold pockets of product may be held in the outlet valve or pipe-line; raw product may leak into the vat or pocket during the filling, holding. or emptying time; and raw or incompletely pasteurized product may leak into the outlet line during the filling, heating, or holding period. (e) Tests have shown that when foam is present on product In vats or pockets during pasteurization, the temperature of the foam may be well below the pasteurization temperature. In such cases, pathogenic organisms that may be in the foam will not be killed. Experience indicates that some foam Is present at some time in all vats, particularly at certain seasons. Furthermore, in filling vats, product frequently is splashed on the surfaces and fixtures above the product level as well as on the underside of the vat cover. Droplets of this splash may drop back into the body of the product, and since they may not have been at pasteurization temperature for the required time. they may contain living pathogenic organisms . Heating the air above the product. above pasteurization temperature , remedies these conditions . When air heating is not provided, its need may frequently be qemonstrated by swabbing product from the upper vat walls, and from the underside of the cover, at the end of the holding period, and running phosphatase tests on the swab samples. (f) Many plant operators have reported that the use of airspace heaters, especially with partly filled vats with uninsulated lids, makes it easier to maintain the product at a uniform and sufficiently high temperature . It also helps to prevent the growth of thermophllic organisms and promotes easier cleaning. (g) Obviously, if the design and construction of pasteurization vat and pocket covers do not prevent leakage, condensation, and the entrance of water and dust. the product may become contaminated with material containing disease bacteria. Keeping the covers closed during operation will decrease the chance of dust, flies, sputum droplets, drip, and splash entering the product. (3) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed be satisfied when: (a) Time and Temperature Controls for Batch Pasteurizers 1. Temperature Difference -The pasteurizer shall be so designed that the simultaneous temperature difference between the milk, milk product, or frozen dessert mix at the center and the coldest milk, milk product, or frozen dessert mix in the vat will not exceed 1 \u00b0F (0.5\u00b0C) at any time during the holding period. The vat shall be provided with adequate agitation, operating throughout the holding period.

Assurance of Minimum Holding Periods -Batch pasteurizers shall be so operated that every particle of milk, milk product, or frozen dessert mix will be held at not less than the minimum pasteurization temperature continuously for at least thirty (30) minutes. When milk, milk products, or frozen dessert mix are raised to pasteurization temperature in the vat, and cooling is begun in the vat, simultaneously with or before the opening of the outlet valve, the recorder chart shall show at least thirty (30) minutes at not less than minimum pasteurization temperature. When milk, milk products, or frozen dessert mix are preheated to pasteurization temperature before entering the vat, the recorder chart shall show a holding period of at least thirty (30) minutes at not less than the minimum pasteurization temperature plus the time of filling from the level of the recorder bulb. When cooling is begun in the holder after the opening of the outlet valve, or is done entirely outside the holder, the recording chart shall show at least thirty (30) minutes at not less than the minimum pasteurization temperature plus the time of emptying to the level of the recording thermometer bulb. When the recorder time interval on the recorder chart at the pasteurization temperatures includes filling and/or emptying time, such intervals shall be indicated on the recorder chart by the operator, by removing the recording thermometer bulb from the product for a sufficient time to depress the pen or by turning cold water into the vat jacket at the end of the holding period or by inscribing the holding time on the chart. The filling time and the emptying time for each holder so operated shall be determined by the Health Officer, initially, and after any change which may affect these times. No product shall be added to the holder after the start of the holding period. (b) Airspace Heating 1. Means shall be provided and used in batch pasteurizers to keep the atmosphere above the milk, milk products, and frozen dessert mix at a temperature not less than 5\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) higher than the minimum required temperature of pasteurization during the holding period (see Appendix H). 2.

A closed-coupled valve which is not truly flushed shall be considered as satisfying this requirement when: (i) The vat outlet is so flared that the smallest diameter of the large end of the flare is not less than the diameter of the outlet line, plus the depth of the flare. (ii) The greatest distance from the valve seat to the small end of the flare Is not greater than the diameter of the outlet line.

To prevent clogging and to promote drainage , all leak-protection grooves shall be at least 0.187 inch (5 millimeters) wide and at least 0.094 inch (2.3 millimeters) deep at the center. Mating grooves shall provide these dimensions throughout their combined length whenever the valve is in, or approximately in, the fully closed position. All single-leak grooves and all mating leak grooves when mated, shall extend throughout the entire depth of the seat so as to divert leakage occurring at all points throughout the depth of the seat and so as to prevent air bindings Washers or other parts shall not obstruct leak-protector grooves. 4. A stop shall be provided on all plug-type outlet valves and on all plug- type inlet valves in order to guide the operator in closing the valve so that unpasteurized product may not Inadvertently be permitted to enter the outlet line or the holder, respectively. The stop shall be so designed that the plug will be irreversible when the plug Is provided with any grooves or their equivalent unless duplicate, diametrically opposite grooves are also provided. In the case of two\u00ad way, plug-type valves (i.e., those having only one inlet and one outlet), a 180\u00b0 stop or any combination of stops permitting two fully closed posit1ons, may be substituted for a 90\u00b0 stop; provided, there are no air-relief grooves in the plug and that all leak grooves are located symmetrically with respect to the valve inlet.

Recording Charts -All recording thermometer charts shall comply with all the applicable requirements of Rule 420-3-16-.10(21 )(a). (18) High Temperature, Short-Time (HTST) Continuous-Flow Pasteurization (a) Public Health Reason -See Reason under Rule 420-3- 16-.10(16) and 420-3-16- .10(17). (b) Administrative Procedures -This item deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Indicating Thermometers and Recorder /Controller Instruments -All indicating thermomete rs and recorder/cont roller instruments and devices used in connection with the high-temperature , short-time continuous-flow pasteurizat ion of milk, milk products, or frozen dessert mix shall comply with the applicable specifications , set forth in Appendix H. (c) high-tempera ture, short-time continuous-flow (HTST) pasteurization system shall be equipped with an automatic milk-flow control of the diversion type which complies with the following definition , specificat ions, and performance requirements : (d) Automatic Milk or Milk Product-Flow Controls -The term \"automati c milk or milk product flow control'1 shall mean those safety devices which control the flow of product in relation to the temperature of the product or heating medium and/or pressure, vacuum. or other auxiliary equipment. Milk-flow controls shall not be considered as part of the temperature control equipment. Milk-flow controls shall be of the flow-diversion type, which automatically cause the diversion of the product in response to a sublegal pasteurization temperature . At sublegal temperatures, flow-diversion devices return the product to the raw product side of the heating systems continuously until legal pasteurization temperatures are obtained; at which time, the device restores forward flow through the pasteurizer . (e) Flow-Diversion Devices (FDDs) -All FDDs -110 -I P ~ ~ c pasteurizers shall comply with the following or equally satisfactory specifications : 1. Forward flow of subtemperature product due to the omission or looseness of the connecting cllp1 shall be prevented by making the valve and its actuating mechanism integral; or where there is a connecting device, by making it impossible to assemble the valve and its actuating mechanism . except in such manner that lt will function properly; or where there is a connecting device which may be omitted or shaken loose by providing for pushing instead of pulling, the valve to the diverted position; or by providing that the pump will shut down when the product is below the pasteurization temperature and the valve is not in the fully\u00ad diverted position; or by any other equally satisfactory means. For the detection of the FDO and valve seat positions, refer to Appendix H, I. position detection devices of this rule. 2. When a packing gland is used to prevent leakage around the actuating stem, it shall be impossible to tighten the stem packing nut to such an extent as to prevent the valve from assuming the fully-diverted position. 3. A leak escape shall be installed on the forward-flow side of the valve seat. However, when back pressure is exerted on the forward-flow side of the valve seat, while the product flow is being diverted, the leak-escape should lie between two valve seats or between two portions of the same seat, one upstream and one downstream from the leak-escape . The leak-escape shall be designed and installed to discharge all leakage to the outside or to the constant-leve l tank through a line separate from the diversion line; provided, when leakage is discharged to the constant-level tank, a sight glass shall be installed in the leak\u00ad escape line to provide a visual means of leak detection. 4. The closure of the forward-flow seat shall be sufficiently tight so that leakage past It will not exceed the capacity of the leak escape-device, as evidenced when the forward-flow line is disconnected ; and, in order that proper seating may not be disturbed, the length of the connecting rod shall not be adjustable by the user. 5. The FOO shall be so designed and installed that failure of the primary motivating power sha.11 automatically divert the flow of product. 6. The F DD shall be located downstream from the holder. The flow- control sensor shall be located in the product line not more than eighteen (18) inches = forty-six ( 46) centimeters upstream from the flow-control device. 7. In the case of higher-heat , shorter-time (HHST) pasteurizing systems utilizing the temperatures of 191 \u00b0F (89\u00b0C) and above and holding times of one second and less, the FOO may be located downstream from the regenerator and/or cooler section; provided, when the FOO is located downstream from the regenerator and/or cooler section, the FOO shall be automatically prevented from assuming the forward-flow position until all product-contact surfaces between the holding tube and FOO have been held at or above the required pasteurizat ion temperature continuousl y and simultaneously for at least the required pasteurization time as defined in Rule 420-3-16- .02(68). -111 -I P ,, q ~ 8. The pipeline from the diversion port of the FDD shall be self-draining, and shall be free of restrictions or valves, unless such restrictions are noticeable and valves are so designed that stoppage of the diversion line cannot occur. In the case of continuous flow pasteurization systems, which have the FDD located downstream from the regenerator and/or cooler and are inter-wired or are computer controlled to thoroughly clean the system, including the divert pipeline before the re\u00ad starting of production , a cooling section, which is not self-draining , may be present in the divert pipeline. 9. When it is used, the pipeline from the leak detector port of the FOO shall be self-draining and shall be free of restrictions or valves. 10. For the timing pump, a one (1) second maximum ''off\" time delay is allowed to maintain the flow-promoting device in the \"on\" position through the travel time of the FOO. 11. If the area between the divert and leak-detec t valve seats is not self\u00ad draining when the FOO is in the diverted position, a delay of at least one (1) second and not more than five (5) seconds is required between the movement of the divert and leak-detect valves when the FOO assumes the forward-flow position. Except that, the delay may be longer than five (5) seconds if: the timing system is a magnetic flow meter based timing system; or if the holding time in diverted-flow through an unrestricted divert valve line is longer than the required pasteurization time as specified in the definition of Pasteurization of this rule; and except that, no time delay is required in pasteurizat ion systems in which the FOO is located downstream from the pasteurized regenerator and in which all forward\u00ad flow product-contact surfaces of the FOO are sanitized, or sterilized during the normal start-up process. 12. In the case of HHST pasteurizing systems utilizing temperatures and holding times to meet the definition of ultra-pasteurization (UP) of this rule, the FOO may be located downstream of the regenerator and/or cooler section. Said FOO may alternative ly be a system of the \"Steam-Block Type'' as described in Appendix H. This FOO system shall allow for the flow of water and/or milk, milk product, or frozen dessert to the constant-level tank through appropriate valves and coolers during sterilization and when diverted. (f) Milk-Flow Controller Instrumentation -The following requirements shall be met wfth respect to the instrumentation of the milk-flow controller : 1. The thermal-limit controller shall be set and sealed so that forward-flow of product cannot start unless the temperature at the controller sensor is above the required pasteurization temperature as defined in Rule 420-3-16-.02(68) for the milk, milk product, and frozen dessert, and the process used nor continue during descending temperatures when the temperature is below the required pasteurization temperature . The seal shall be applled by the Health Officer after testing, and shall not be removed without immediately notifying the Health Officer. The system shall be so designed that no product can be by-passed around the controller sensor which shall not be removed from its proper position during the pasteurization process. The cut-in and cut-out milk temperatures, as shown by the indicating thermometer , shall be determined at the beginning of each day's -112-Ir-g e operation and entered upon the recorder chart daily by the plant operator. 2. In the case of HHST pasteurization systems utilizing the temperatures of 191 \u00b0F (89\u00b0C) and above, and holding times of one ( 1) second or less, with the FFD located downstream from the regenerator and/or cooler section, additional temperature controllers and timers shall be interwired with the thermal-limit\u00ad controller; and the control system shall be set and sealed so that forward-flow of product cannot start until all product-contact surfaces between the holding tube and FFD have been held at or above the required pasteurization temperature, continuously and simultaneously for at least the required pasteurization time as defined in Rule 420-3-16- .02{68). The control system shall also be set and sealed so that forward-flow cannot continue when the temperature of the product in the holding tube is below the required pasteurization temperature. 3. Provided, for systems used for the processing of milk, milk products anq frozen desserts labeled as ultra-pasteurized (UP), it is not necessary to set and seal the thermal-limit-controller at or above 138\u00b0C (280\u00b0F). Also, provided, these systems shall meet all the public health control requirements for HHST systems, and that the recorder-controller chart shows that the UP milk, milk product, and frozen dessert has been processed at a minimum temperature of 138\u00b0C (280\u00b0F), and has been verified by the Health Officer to have a calculated holding time of at least two (2) seconds. The seal, if required, shall be applied by the Health Officer after the equipment has been tested, and shall not be removed without immediately notifying the Health Officer. The seal shall be applied by the Health Officer after test and shall not be removed without immediately notifying the Health Officer. The system shall be so designed that no product can be bypassed around the control sensors, which shall not be removed from their proper position during the pasteurization process. For these HHST systems, daily measurement by the operator of the cut-in and cut-out temperatures is not required. 4. Manual switches for the control of pumps. homogenizers, or other devices which produce flow through the holder shall be wired so that the circuit is completed only when the product is above the required pasteurization temperature as defined in Rule 420-3-16- .02(68) for the milk product and the process used, or when the diversion device is in the fully-diverted position. (g) Holding Tube 1. Holding tubes shall be designed to provide for the holding of every particle of milk or milk product for at least the time required in Rule 420-3-16-.02(68) for the milk or milk product and the process used. 2. The holding tube shall be so designed that the simultaneous temperature difference between the hottest and coldest product in any cross section of flow at any time during the holding period will not be greater than 1\u00b0F (0.5\u00b0C). This requirement may be assumed to have been satisfied without testing in tubular holders of seven (7) inches ( 17. 8 centimeters) or smaller diameter which are free of any fitting through which the product may not be thoroughly swept. 3. No device shall be permitted for short circuiting a portion of the holder to compensate for changes in rate of product flow. Holding tubes shall be installed -113-111\u00a7-so that sections of pipe cannot be left out, resulting in a shortened holding time. 4. The holding tube shall be arranged to have a continuously upward slope in the direction of flow of not less than 0.25 inch (2.1 centimeters) per foot. 5. Supports for holding tubes shall be provided to maintain all parts of holding tubes in a fixed position, free from any lateral or vertical movement. 6. The holding tube shall be so designed that no portion between the inlet and the flow-control temperature sensor is heated. (h) The following items apply to HHST systems: 1. The holding time for the HHST processes must be determined from the pumping rate rather than by the salt conductivity test because of the short holding tube. The holding tube length must be such that the fastest flowing particle of any product will not traverse the holding tube in less than the required holding time. Since laminar flow (the fastest flowing particle travels twice as fast as the average flowing particle) can occur in the holding tube during pasteurization of high\u00ad viscosity products, holding tube lengths are calculated as twice the length required to hold the average flow for the time standard. 2. With the direct steam heating processes, the holding time is reduced because the product volume increases as the steam condenses to water during heating in the injector. This surplus water is evaporated as the pasteurized product Is cooled in the vacuum chamber. For example, with a 120\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) increase by steam injection which is probably the maximum temperature rise that wlll be used, a volume increase of 12 percent will occur in the holding tube. The measurement of the average flow rate at the discharge of the pasteurizer does not reflect this volume increase in the holding tube. However, this volume increase (i.e., holding time decrease) must be considered in the calculations. 3. For those HHST systems capable of operating with less than 518 kPa (75 ps1g) pressure in the holding tube, a pressure limit indicator/pressure switch shall be interwired so that the FOO will move to the divert position if the milk, milk product. and frozen dessert pressure falls below a prescribed value. For operating temperatures between 89\u00b0C (191\u00b0F) and 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F) the instrument shall be set at 69 kPa (10 psi). To prevent vaporization in the holding tube, which may substantially reduce residence times, HHST systems operating above 100\u00b0c (212\u00b0F), the instrument shall be set at 69 kPa (10 psi) above the boiling pressure of the product, at its maximum temperature in the holding tube. 4. With the steam injection process, a differential pressure limit indicator across the Injector is needed to keep the heated milk or milk product in the liquid phase and to ensure adequate isolation of the injection chamber. The instrument shall have a differential pressure switch so that the FOO will move to the divert position, if the pressure drop across the injector falls below 69 kPa (10 psi). (i) Indicating and Recording Thermometers \u00b7 114 -I P El c: 1. An indicating thermometer shall be located as near as practicable to the temperature sensor of the recorder/controller, but may be located a short distance upstream from the latter where product between the two thermometers does not differ significantly in temperature . 2. The temperature shown by the recorder/controlfer shall be checked daily by the plant operator against the temperature shown by the indicating thermometer. Readings shall be recorded on the chart. The recorder/controller shall be adjusted to read no higher than the indicating thermometer. 3. The recorder/controller charts shall comply with the applicable prov[sions of Rule 420-3-16-.10(21 )(a). 0) Flow-Promoting Devices 1. The pump or pumps and other equipment which may produce flow through the holder shall be located upstream from the holder; provided, that pumps and other flow-promoting devices shall be located downstream from the holder if means are provided to eliminate negative pressure between the holder and the inlet to such equipment. When vacuum equipment is located downstream from the holder, an effective vacuum breaker, plus an automatic means of preventing a negative pressure in the line between the FOO and the vacuum chamber shall be acceptable . 2. The speed of pumps or other flow-promoting devices governing the rate of flow through the holder shall be so controlled as to ensure the holding of every particle of product for at least the time required as defined in Rule 420-3-16- .02(68) for the milk or milk product and the process used. In all cases, the motor shall be connected to the metering pump by means of gears, pulleys, or a variable\u00ad speed drive, with the gear box, the pully box., or the setting of the variable speed protected in such a manner that the holding time cannot be shortened without detection by the Health Officer. This shall be accomplished by the application of suitable seal(s) after tests by the Health Officer and such seal shall not be broken without immediately notrfying the Health Officer. The provision shall apply to all homogenizers used as timing pumps. Variable speed drives used in connection with the metering pump shall be so constructed that wearing or stretching of the belt results in a slow-down, rather than a speed-up, of the pump. The metering or timing pump shall be of the positive displacement type or shall comply with the specifications for magnetic flow meter systems as outlined In Appendix H. Timing pumps and homogenizers , when used as a timing pump, shall not have by-pass lines connected from their outlet pipelines to their inlet pipelines during processing if an additional flow-promoting or vacuum producing device is located within the system. When a homogenizer is used in conjunction with a timing pump, it shall be either: (i) Of larger capacity than the timing pump. In which case an unrestricted . open, recirculation line shall be used to connect the outlet pipeline from the homogenizer to its inlet line. The recirculation line must be of at least the same or larger diameter than the inlet pipeline feeding product to the homogenizer. A check valve, allowing flow from the outlet line to the inlet line, may be used in the re\u00ad circulating line provided it is of the type which provides a cross-sectional area at -115 -I P age least as large as the recirculatlng line. (ii) Of smaller capacity than the timing pump. In which case a relief line and valve shall be used. Such relief line shall be located after the timing pump and before the inlet to the homogen izer and shall return product to the balance tank or to the outlet of the balance tank upstream of any booster pump or other flow\u00ad promoting device. 5. For those systems which do not homogenize all products and wish to utilize a by-pass line to by-pass the homogenizer while processing such product. the by-pass line must be connected with valves which are so designed that both lines cannot be open at the same time. This may be accomplished with three (3)\u00ad way plug valves with properly designed and operating pins or other automatic , fail\u00ad safe valves which accomplish the same objective. 6. The holding time shall be taken to mean the flow time of the fastest particle of milk, at or above the required pasteurization temperature as defined in Rule 420-3-16-.02(68), forthe milk or milk product and the process used, throughout the holder section ( i.e., that portion of the system that is outside of the influence of the heating medium, slopes continuously upward in the downstream direction, and is located upstream from the FOO). Tests for holding time shall be made when all equipment and devices are operated and adjusted to provide for maximum flow. When a homogenizer is located upstream from the holder, the holding time shall be determined with the homogenizer in operation with no pressure on the homoge nizer valves. For those systems which do not homogenize all products and utilize by-pass lines as outlined in (i) above, the holding time shall be tested in both flow patterns and the fastest time used. The holding time shall be tested during both forward and diverted flow. If it is necessary to lengthen the holding time during diverted flow, an identifiable restriction may be placed in the vertical portion of the diversion pipeline. When vacuum equipment is located downstream from the holder, the holding time shall be tested with the metering pump operating at maximum flow, and the vacuum equipment adjusted to provide for the maximum vacuum. The holding time shall be tested in both forward and diverted flow by the Health Officer initially; semi-annually thereafter ; after any alteration or replacement that may affect the holding time; and whenever the seal of the speed setting has been broken. (k) Heating by Direct Addition of Steam -Steam injection is an inherently unstable process; accordingly, when steam in injected into a fluid, condensation of the steam may not be completed inside the Injector unless the proper design criteria are used. Lack of complete condensation inside the injector would cause temperature variations in the holding tube that could lead to some product particles bein9 processed below pasteurization temperature . When culinary steam is introduced directly into milk or milk products, as the means of terminal heating to achieve pasteurization temperature , the steam injector shall be designed, installed, and operated to comply with the following or equally satisfactory specifications : 1. The product and steam flows must be isolated from pressure fluctuat ions inside the injection chamber. One method of isolation is to insert supplementary orifices on the product inlet and the heated product outlet of each injector. The two (2) supplementary orifices must be sized for at least a 10 psi (69kPa) product pressure -116 -I P a ! L\" drop across the injector during a simulation of normal operations . Excessive vibrations , pressure fluctuations , or erratic noise levels indicate an unstable steam injection system and a need to check the isolation of the injection chamber. 2. The product pressure in the holding tube must be of sufficient magnitude to condense the steam and keep the heated product in the liquid phase. If this pressure is too low, the resultant vaporization in the holding tube will substantially reduce residence times. A minimum product pressure in the holding tube of 1 0 psi (.69 kPa) for operating temperatures from 191\u00b0F (89\u00b0C) through 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C) Is satisfactory. For units which have operating temperatures above 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C) the pressure of the product in the holding tube must be at least 10 psi (. 703 KPI) above the boiling pressure of the product at its maximum temperature in the holding tube. 3. The process should be as free as possible of non-condensable gases that may evolve from the product or be carried in the steam supply. Any two-phase flow caused by the non-condensable gases would displace the product in the holding tube, resulting in reduced residence times. In addition, these gases in the steam supply may also markedly alter the condensation mechanism at the point of injection. Accordingly, the steam boiler shall be supplied with a deaerator The deaerator will aid in keeping the product in the holding tube as free as possible of non-condensab le gases. (I) Prevention of Product Adulteration with Added Water 1. When culinary steam is introduced directly into the milk or milk product, downstream from the FOO, means shall be provided to preclude the addition of steam to the milk or milk product. unless the FOO is in the forward-flow position. This provision may be satisfied by the use of an automatic steam control valve with a temperature sensor located downstream from the steam inlet, or by the use of an automatic solenoid valve installed in the steam line and so wired through the FOO controls, so that steam cannot flow unless the FOO is in the forward-flow position. 2. When culinary steam is introduced directly Into the milk or milk product, auwmatic means (Le,, stand-alon e and/or programmable logic controller (PLC]\u00ad based ratio control system) shall be provided to maintain a proper temperatu re differential between incoming and outgoing milk or milk product to preclude dilution with water. 3. Where a water feed line is connected to a vacuum condenser and the vacuum condenser is not separated from the vacuum chamber by a physical barrier, means shall be provided to preclude the backup and overflow of water from the vacuum condenser to the vacuum chamber. This provision may be satisfied by the use of a safety shut-off valve, located on the water feed line to the vacuum condenser , automatically actuated by a control which will shut off the in-flowing water if, for example, the condensate pump stops and the water level rises above a predeterm ined point in the vacuum condenser . This valve may be actuated by water, air, or electricity , and shall be so designed that failure of the primary motivating power will automatically stop the flow of water into the vacuum condenser . (m) Aseptic Processing Systems 1. Public Health Reason -Aseptically processed milk and milk products are being packaged in hermetically sealed containers and stored for long periods of time under non-refrigerated conditions. These conditions are favorable to the growth of many types of bacteria (pathogenic , toxin producing, and spoilage types). Because of this, every precaution must be taken to ensure that all viable organisms and their spores are destroyed by the chosen heat process for the particular milk or milk product and that the subsequent handling, packaging, and storage processes do not provide an opportunity for recontamination of the product. The selected process must conform to the acceptable requirements for low acid canned foods. 2. Administrative Procedures -The aseptic processing portion of this item is deemed to be satisfied when the design and operation of aseptic processing systems comply with the applicable specifications and operational procedures of sub-items C, D, and E as follows; provided, nothing shall be construed as barring any other aseptic processing system which have been recognized by the FDA to be equally effective and which is approved by the Health Officer. (n) Indicating Thermometers and Recorder/Controller Instrumen ts; All indicating thermometers, recorder/controller instrument devices used in connection wlth aseptic processing systems used for the aseptic processing of milk or milk products shall comply with the applicable specifications set forth in Appendix H, (o) Aseptic Processing Equipment 1. Temperature Indicating Device -Each aseptic processing system shall be equipped with at least one mercury-in-glass thermometer or an equivalent temperature-indicating device. 2. Temperature Recorded /Controller -An accurate temperature recorded/controller shall be installed in the product at the holding-tube outlet and before the inlet to the cooler or regenerator. The following requirements shall be met with respect to the Instrumenta tion of the temperature recorded/controller : (i) The temperature recorded/controller shall be set and sealed so that during product processing the forward flow of product cannot start unless the temperature at the controller sensor is above the required temperature for the product and the process used, nor continue during descending temperatures when the temperature is below the required temperature . The seal shall be applied by the Health Officer after testing, and shall not be removed without immediately notifying the Health Officer. The system shall be so designed that no product can be bypassed around the controller sensor which shall not be removed from its proper position during the processing of aseptic milk and milk products. (ii) Additional temperature controllers and timers shall be interwired with the thermal limit controller, and the control system shall be set and sealed so that forward flow of product cannot start until all product-contact surfaces between the holding tube and flow-diversion device have been held at or above the required sterilization temperature, continuously and simultaneously for at least the required sterilization time. The control system shall also be set and sealed so that forward flow cannot continue when the temperature of the product in the holding tube is below the required temperature . The seal shall be applied by the Health Officer after test, and shall not be removed without immediately notifying the Health -11s-11\u00b7 Officer. The system shall be so designed that no product can be bypassed around the control sensors, which shall not be removed from their proper position during the processing of aseptic milk and milk products. (iii) Manual switches for the control of pumps, homogenizers , or other devices which produce flow through the holder, shall be wired so that the circuit 1s cotnpleted only when the milk is above the required temperature for the product and the process used, or when the diversion device is in the fully-diverted position. (p) Metering Pump 1. A metering pump shall be located upstream from holding tube and shall be operated to maintain the required metering pump by means of a common drive shaft or by means of gears, pulleys, or a variable-speed drive with the gear box, the pulley boxi or the setting of the variable speed protected in such a manner that the hold time cannot be shortened without detection by the Health Officer. This shall be accomplished by the application of a suitable seal(s) after tests by the Health Officer and such seal shall not be broken without immediately notifying the Health Officer. The provision shall apply to all homogenizers used as timing pumps. Variable speed drives used in connection with the metering pump shall be so constructed that wearing or stretching of the belt results in a slowdown. rather than a speedup of the pump. The metering or timing pump shall be of the positive displacement type or shall comply with the specifications for magnetic flow meter systems. 2. The holding time shall be taken to mean the flow time of the fastest particle of product throughout the holder section (i.e., that portion of the system that is outside of the influence of the heating medium, slopes continuously upward in the down-stream direction, and is located upstream from the FOO). Tests for holding time shall be made when all equipment and devices are operated and adjusted to provide for maximum flow. When a homogenizer is located upstream from the holder, the holding time shall be determined with the homogenizer in operation with no pressure on the homogenizer valves. For those systems which do not homogenize all milk or milk products and utilize by-pass lines as outlined in (j)2(i) above, the holding time shall be tested in both flow patterns and the fastest time used. The holdlng time shall be tested during both forward and diverted-flow. If it is necessary to lengthen the holding time during diverted-flow, an identifiable restriction may be placed in the vertical portion of the diversion pipeline. When vacuum equipment is located downstream from the holding tube, the holding time shall be tested with the timing pump operating at maximum flow and the vacuum equipment adjusted to provide for the maximum vacuum. The holding time shall be tested by the Health Officer initially, semi-annually thereafter , after any alteration or replacement that may affect the holding time. and whenever the seal of the speed setting has been broken. (q) Product Holding Tube 1 The product holding tube shall be designed to give continuous holding of every particle of product for at least the minimum holding time specified in the scheduled process. The holding tube shall be designed so that no portion of the tube between the product inlet and the product outlet can be heated, and it must be sloped upward at least 0.25 (2.1 cm/m) inch per foot. Supports for tubes shall be provided to maintain all parts \u00b7 119 -I ~ 1 -: -of holding tubes in a fixed position, free from any lateral or vertical movemenl. 2. No device shall be permitted for short circuiting a portion of the holder to compensate for changes in rate of production flow. Holding tubes shall be installed so that sections of pipe cannot be left out, resulting in a shortened holding time. The holding time for the processes must be determined from the pumplng rate rather than by the salt conductivity test. 3. The holding tube length must be such that the fastest flowing particle of any product will not traverse the holding tube in less than the required holding time. Note: Since laminar flow (the fastest flowing particle travels twice as fast as the average flowing particle) can occur in the holding tube during aseptic processing of high-viscosity products, holding tube lengths are calculated as twice the length required to hold the average flow for the time standard. With the steam injection process, the holding time is reduced because the product volume increases as the steam condenses to water during heating in the injector. This surplus water is evaporated as the aseptically processed product is cooled in the vacuum chamber. For example, with a 120\u00b0F (66\u00b0C) Increase by steam injection, which is probably the maximum temperature rise that will be used, a volume increase of 12 percent will occur in the holding tube. The measurement of the average flow rate at the discharge of the aseptic processor does not reflect this volume increase in the holding tube. However, this volume increase (i.e., holding time decrease) must be considered in the calculations. 4. With the steam injection process, a pressure limit indicator is needed in the holding tube to keep the heated product in the liquid phase. The instrument must have a pressure switch so that the FDD will move to the divert position if the product pressure falls below a prescribed value. The pressure switch must be set at a pressure 10 psi (.703 kPa) above the boiling pressure of the product at its maximum temperature in the holding tube. 5. With the steam injection process. a differential pressure limit indicator across the injector is needed to ensure adequate isolation of the injection chamber. The instrument must have a differential pressure switch so that the FOO will move to the divert position If the pressure drop across the injector falls below 10 psi (.703 kPa). 6. Heating by Direct Addition of Steam -Injection is an inherently unstable process; accordingly, when steam is injected into a fluid, condensation of the steam may not be completed inside the injector unless the proper design criteria are used. Lack of complete condensation inside the injector would cause temperature variations in the holding tube that could lead to some product particles being processed below filed process temperature . When culinary steam is introduced directly into milk or milk products as the means of terminal heating to achieve aseptic processing temperature, the steam injector shall be designed, installed, and operated to comply with the following or equally satisfactory specifications . 7. The product and steam flows must be Isolated from pressure fluctuations inside the injection chamber. One method of isolation is to insert supplemen tary orifices on the product Inlet and the heated product outlet of each injector. The two supplementary orifices must be sized for at least a 10 psi (.703 kPa) product pressure drop across the injector during a simulation of normal operations . Excessive vibrations, pressure fluctuations , or erratic noise levels indicate an unstable steam injection system and a need to check the isolation of the injection chamber. 8. The product pressure in the holding tube must be of sufficient magnitude to condense the steam and keep the heated product in the liquid phase lf this pressure is too low, the resultant vaporization in the holding tube will substantially reduce residence times. For units which have operating temperatures above 212\"F (100\u00b0C), the pressure of the product in the holding tube must be at least 10 psi (.703 kPa) above the boiling pressure of the product at its maximum temperature in the holding tube. 9. The process should be as free as possible of non-condensable gases that may evolve from the product or be carried in the steam supply. Any two-phase flow caused by the non-condensable gases would displace the product in the holding tube, resulting in reduced residence times. In addition, these gases in the steam supply may also markedly alter the condensation mechanism at the point of injection. Accordingly , the steam boiler shall be supplied with a deaerator . The deaerator will aid in keeping the product in the holding tube as free as possible on non-condensable gases. (r) Prevention of Product Adulteration with Added Water 1. When culinary steam is introduced directly into the milk or milk product downstream from the FOO, means shall be provided to preclude the addition of steam to the milk or milk product unless the FOO is in the forward-flow position. This provision may be satisfied by the use of an automatic steam control valve with a temperature sensor located downstream from the steam inlet, or by the use of an automatic solenoid valve installed in the steam line and so wired through. 2. Where a water feed line Is connected to a vacuum condenser and the vacuum condenser is not separated from the vacuum chamber by a physical barrier, means shall be provided to preclude the back-up and overflow of water from the vacuum condenser to the vacuum chamber. This provision may be satisfied by the use of a safety shutoff valve located on the water feed line to the vacuum condenser , automatically actuated by a control which will shut off the inflowing water, if, for example, the condensate pump stops and the water level rises above a predetermined point in the vacuum condenser . This valve may be actuated by water, air, or electricity, and shall be so designed that failure of the primary motivating power will automatically stop the flow of water into the vacuum condenser . (s) FOO -All FOOs used in continuous aseptic process systems shall comply with the following or equally satisfactory specifications : 1. Forward flow of sub-temperature product due to the omission of looseness of the connecting clip shall be prevented by making the valve and its actuating mechanism integral; or, where there is a connecting device, by making it impossible to assemble the valve and its actuating mechanism , except in such manner that it will function properly; or, where there is a connecting device which -121-I r, :. g t' may be omitted or shaken loose by providing for pushing, instead of pulling, the valve to the diverted position; or by providing that the pump will shut down when the product is below the aseptic processing temperature and the valve is not in the fully-diverted position; or by any other equally satisfactory means. 2. When a packing gland is used to prevent leakage around the actuating stem, it shall be impossible to tighten the stem packing nut to such an extent as to prevent the valve from assuming the fully-diverted position. 3. A leak escape shall be installed on the forward-flow side of the valve seat. However, when back pressure is exerted on the forward-flow side of the valve seat, while the product flow is being diverted, the leak escape should lie between two portions of the same seat, one upstream and the other downstream from the leak escape. The leak escape shall be designed and installed to discharge all leakage to the outside, or to the constant-level tank through a line separate from the diversion line; provided, when leakage is discharged to the constant-level tank, a sight glass shall be installed in the leak escape line to provide a visual means of leak detection. 4. The closure of the forward-flow seat shall be sufficiently tight so that leakage past it will not exceed the capacity of the leak escape device, as evidenced when the forward-flow line is disconnected; and, in order that proper seating may not be disturbed, the length of the connecting rod shall not be adjustable by the user. 5. The FOO shall be so designed and installed that failure of the primary motivating power shall automatically divert the flow of milk. 6. The FOO shall be located down-stream from the regenerator and/or cooler section. The FOO shall be automatically prevented from assuming the forward-flow position until all product-contact surfaces between the holding tube and FOO have been held at or above the required sterilization temperature continuously and simultaneously for at least the required sterilization time. 7. The pipeline from the diversion port of the FOO shall be self-draining, and shall be free of restrictions or valves, unless such restrictions or valves are so designed that stoppage of the diversion line cannot occur. 8. When it is used, the pipeline from the leak detector port of the FOO shall be self-draining , and shall be free of restrictions or valves. (t) Pasteurizers and Aseptically Processing Systems Employing Regenerative Heating 1. Public Health Reason -To prevent contamination of the pasteurized product in regenerators. the raw product must always be under less pressure than the pasteurized product or the heat-transfer medium. In the case of milk-to-milk regenerators or milk regenerators , this requirement is necessary to prevent contamination of the pasteurized product by the raw product if flaws should develop in the metal or in the joints separating the two kinds of product. -122-jP;q;e 2. Administrative Procedure -This item is deemed to be satisfied when\u00b7 (19) Milk-To-Milk Product-To-Milk or Milk Product Regenerative Heating (1) Pasteurizers employing milk-to-milk regenerative heating with both sides closed to the atmosphere shall comply with the following or equally satisfactory specifications: (a) Regenerators shall be constructed, installed, and operated so that pasteurized or aseptic product in the regenerator will automatically be under greater pressure than raw product in the regenerato r at all times. (b) The pasteurized product, between its outlet from the regenerator and the nearest point downstream open to the atmosphere, shall rise to a vertical elevation of 12 (30.5cm) inches above the highest raw product level downstream from the constant-level tank and shall be open to the atmosphere at this or a higher elevation. (c) The overflow of the top rim of the consta,nt-level raw product tank shall always be lower than the lowest product level in the regenerator . (d) No pump or flow-promoting device which can affect the proper pressure relationships within the regenerator shall be located between the pasteurized or aseptic product outlet from the regenerator and the nearest downstream point open to the atmosphere. (e) No pump shall be located between the raw product inlet to the regenerator and the constant-level tank, unless it is designed and installed to operate only when product is flowing through the pasteurized product side of the regenerator , and when the pressure of the pasteurized milk product is higher than the maximum pressure produced by the pump. This may be accomplished by wiring the booster pump so that it cannot operate unless: 1. The metering pump is in operation . 2. The FDD is in forward-flow position. 3. The pasteurized product pressure exceeds, by at least 6.9 kPa (1 psi) the maximum pressure developed by the booster pump. Pressure gauges shall be installed at the raw product inlet to the regenerator and the pasteurized product outlet of the regenerator or the outlet of the cooler. The accuracy of required pressure gauges shall be checked by the Health Officer on installation, quarterly thereafter , and following repair or adjustment. (i) The motor, casing, and impeller of the booster pump shall be identified, and such records thereof maintained as directed by the Health Officer. All electric wiring interconnections should be in permanent conduit ( except that rubber covered cable may be used for final connections) With no electrical connections to defeat the purpose of any provisions of these rules. -123 -I 11 ,1 \"\"' (ii) All raw products in the regenerators will automatically drain freely back into the constant-level raw product tank or to the floor when the raw product pump(s) are shut down and the raw product outlet from the regenerator is disconnected . (iii) When vacuum equipment is located downstream from the FOO, means shall be provided to prevent the lowering of the pasteurized or milk product level in the regenerator during periods of diverted-flow or shutdown . An effective vacuum breaker, plus an automatic means of preventing a negative pressure, shall be installed in the line between the vacuum chamber and the pasteurized product inlet to the regenerator . 4. In the case of HHST pasteurization systems utilizing the temperatures of 191 \u00b0F (89\u00b0C) and above, and holding times of one ( 1) second or less, with the FOO located downstream from the regenerator and/or cooler section, the requirement that the pasteurized product from the outlet of the regenerator or cooler shall rise to a vertical elevation of twelve (12) inches above the highest raw product level downstream from the constant-level tank and shall be open to the atmosphere at this or a higher elevation, may be eliminated--provided a differential pressure controller is used to monitor the highest pressure in the raw product side of the regenerator and the lowest pressure in the pasteurized side of the regenerator , and the controller is interlocked with the FFO and is set and sealed so that whenever improper pressures occur in the regenerator, forward flow of product is automatically prevented and will not start again until all product-contact surfaces between the holding tube and FFO have been held at or above the required pasteurization temperature , continuously and simultaneously for at least the required pasteurization time as defined in Rule 420-3- 16-.02(68). 5. When culinary steam Is introduced directly into milk or milk products as the means of terminal heating to achieve pasteurization temperature, and vacuum equipment is located downstream from the holding tube, the requirement that a vacuum breaker be installed at the inlet to the pasteurized or aseptic side of the regenerato r may be eliminated ; provided, that the differential pressure controller is installed and wired to control the FDO as described in (iii) above. 6. When the differential pressure controller is installed and wired to control the FOO as described in (i) above, the raw product booster pump may be permitted to run at all times; provided, the metering pump is in operation .

(b) The heat-transfer water shall be safe water and the heat-transfer water shall be in a covered tank which is open to the atmosphere at an elevation higher -124 -I , -,; ~ by at least twelve ( 12) inches (30.5 cm) than any raw product level downstream from the constant-level tank. The heat-transfer water between its outlet from the regenerator and the nearest point downstream open to the atmosphere shall rise to a vertical elevation of at least twelve (12) Inches (30.5 cm) above any raw product in the system and shall be open to the atmosphere at this or a higher elevation. (c) The heat-transfer water circuit shall be full of water at the beginning of the run, and all loss of water from the circuit shall be automatically and immediately replenished whenever raw product is present in the regenerator. (d) The overflow of the top rim of the constant-level raw product tank shall always be lower than the lowest product level in the raw product section of the regenerator. The regenerator shall be designed and installed so that all raw product shall drain freely back to the upstream supply tank when the raw product pumps are shut down and the raw product line is disconnected from the regenerator outlet. (e) No pump shall be located between the raw product inlet to the regenerator and the raw product supply tank, unless it is designed and installed to operate only when water is flowing through the heat-transfer section of the regenerator, and when the pressure of the heat-transfer water is higher than the pressure of the raw product. This may be accomplished by wiring the booster pump so that it cannot operate unless: 1. The heat-transfer water pump ls in operation . 2. Pressure gauges shall be installed at the raw product inlet and the heat-transfer water outlet of the regenerator . The heat-transfer water pressure exceeds, by at least 6.9 kPa (1 psi), the raw milk or milk product pressure in the regenerator . A differential pressure controller shall be installed at the raw milk or milk product inlet and the heat-transfer water outlet of the regenerator . The raw milk or milk product booster pump shall be wired so that it cannot operate unless the differential pressure Is met.

OPTION II: Milk or milk product-to-water-to-milk or milk product regenerators may also be constructed, installed, and operated such that the pasteurized milk or milk product in the regenerator will be under greater pressure than the heat-transfer-medium in the pasteurized milk or milk product side of the regenerator. (a) A differential pressure recorder-controller shall be used to monitor pressures of the pasteurized product and the heat-transfer medium. One pressure sensor shall be installed at the pasteurized milk or milk product outlet of the regenerator and the other pressure sensor shall be installed at the heat\u00ad transfer-medium inlet of the aseptic product side of the regenerator . This recorder\u00ad controller shall divert the FOO whenever the lowest pressure of pasteurized milk or milk product in the regenerator fails to exceed the highest pressure of heat\u00ad transfer-medium in the aseptic product side of the regenerator by at least one ( 1) psi (6.9 kPa). Forward flow of product shall be automatically prevented until all -125 -[ F c1 !? <c-product-contact surfaces between the holding tube and the FOO have been held at or above the required pasteurization sterilization temperature continuously and simultaneously for at least the pasteurization time. (b) The heat-transfer-medium pump shall be wired so that it cannot operate unless the metering pump is in operation . Note: See Appendix H for further discussion concerning methods of achieving the required pressure relationships within the regenerator .

This drain valve shall be normally open (spring-to-open). Iii) The drain valve and any pipes or pumps located between the drain valve and the heat exchanger shall be lower than the lowest liquid level in the heat exchanger . -139 I I g I;! iv) De-energize any dedicated tower water supply pump, if present, located between the tower water reservoir and the tower water heat exchanger v) If a tower water return pump is used, a bypass line may be used to flood the dry pump at start up. (IV) In a system with the overflow of an atmospheric balance tank lower than the lowest water level in the heat exchanger (refer to Figures 11 and 12 fn Appendix D, VII). (V) In this application , the isolation system shall begin at the tower water balance tank and end at the check-valve in the line returning to the open cooling tower. (VI) Isolation is accomplished by meeting all of the following: i) De-energiz ing the ''local tower water supply pump\", if present (refer to Figure 11 in Appendix D. VII). ii) Opening a full port vent valve on the supply srde of the tower water heat exchanger. iii) Open a full port drain valve prior to a check-valve in the tower water return line. Iv) This drain valve shall be normally open (spring-to-open). v) The drain valve and any pipes or pumps located between it and the heat exchanger shall be lower than the lowest liquid level in the heat exchanger . (\\/11) Variations from the above isolation systems may be individually evaluated and found to also be acceptable by the Health Officer, if the level of protection required by this Administrative Procedure is not compromised . (Vlll)Testing -A means to test the response of this isolation system shall be developed and available at the milk plant. The accuracy of the required differential pressure controller shall be checked by the Health Officer on installation; every six (6) months thereafter ; and following repair or replacement. -Note: Nothing shall be construed as barring other time and temperature relationships , which have been recognized by FDA to be equally efficient and which are approved by the Health Officer.

All covers shall be in place during operation . (v) A drip deflector is installed on each filler valve. Drip deflectors shall be designed and adjusted to divert condensation away from the open container. (vi) Container in-feed conveyors to automatic bottling or packaging machines have overhead shields to protect the bottles or packages from contamination. These shields shall extend from the bottle washer discharge to the bottle feed-star, or in the case of single-service packaging machines , from the forming unit discharge to the filling unit and from the filling unit to the closure unit. Overhead shields shall be required on can in-feed conveyors when the cans are fed to the filler with the covers off. (vii) Container coding/dating devices are designed , installed, and operated such that the coding/dating operations are performed in a manner that -141 -I f, ;; le\\ open containers are not subjected to contamination. Shielding shall be properly designed and installed to preclude the contamination of open containers. (viii) Container fabricating materials, such as paper stock, foil. wax, plastic, etc., are handled in a sanitary manner and protected against undue exposure during the package assembly operation . (ix) Bottling and packaging machine floats are designed to be adjustable without removing the cover. (x) The filler pipe of all bottling and packaging machines have a diversion apron or other acceptable device, as close to the filler bowl as possible, to prevent condensation from entering the inside of the filler bowl. (xi) Filling cylinders on packaging machines are protected from contaminat ion by overhead shields. When lubricants are used on filler pistons, cylinders or other milk or milk product-contact surfaces, the lubricant shall be food-grade and applied in a sanitary manner. For milk plants that condense and/or dry milk or milk products, the following shall apply: 1. The filling of condensed and dry milk product containers is done by mechanical equipment. The term \"mechanical equipment'' shall not be Interpreted to exclude manually operated equipment. 2. All pipes, connections, and similar appurtenances comply with Rule 420-3-16- .10-11 . 3. Filling devices are constructed so as to prevent any contamination from reaching the product. Covers of filling devices, if used, shall be in place during operation . 4.

Provided, if suitable mechanical equipment for the capping or closing of specific container(s) of three (3) gallons 12.8 liters or more is not available, other methods which eliminate all possibility of contamination may be approved by the Health Officer. 2. All mechanical capping or closure mechanisms are designed to minimize the need for adjustment during operation . 3. Bottles and packages which have been imperfectly capped or closed are emptied immediately into approved sanitary containers . Such milk, milk products, or frozen desserts shall be protected from contamination, maintained at 45\u00b0F (7\u00b0C) or less. except dry milk products , and subsequently re-pasteur ized or discarded. 4. All caps and closures are designed and applied in such a manner that the pouring lip is protected to at least its largest diameter and, with respect to fluid product containers , removal cannot be made without detection. Single-serv ice containers are so constructed that the product and the pouring and opening areas are protected from contamination during handllng, storage, and when the containers are initially opened. -143 -I ~ -, -0 t:' 5. All caps and closures are handled in a sanitary manner. The first cap from each tube, the first lap(s) from each roll of cap or cover stock, and the first sheet of parchment or cover paper shall be discarded. The subseque nt use of loose caps which are left in the cappers at the end of an operation period after removal from the cap tubes shall be a violation of this paragraph , provided that loose plastic caps and closures supplied by the manufacturer in plastic bags may be returned to storage in a protective wrap if removed from a hopper/descrambler immediately after a production run. Plastic caps and closures remaining in the chute between the hopper and the cupping device shall be discarded . Provided further that if suitable equipment is not available for capping cottage cheese, dry curd cottage cheese, and lowfat cottage cheese, other methods of capping which eliminate possible chance of contamination may be approved by the Health Officer. 6. Closures for cottage cheese. dry curd cottage cheese, and lowfat cottage cheese containers shall extend over the top edges of the container so as to protect the product from contamination during subsequent handling. 7. Provided, that this requirement shall not apply to cottage cheese, dry curd cottage cheese, and lowfat cottage cheese container closures, when such closures are supplied in a totally enclosed package, or wrapped so as to protect the closures. (26) Personnel -Cleanliness (a) Hands shall be thoroughly washed before commencing plant functions and as often as may be required to remove soil and contamination. No employee shall resume work after visiting the toilet room without thoroughly washing his hands. All persons while engaged in the processing , pasteurization, handling, storage, transportation , or packaging of milk, milk products, frozen desserts, containers, equipment , and utensils shall wear clean outer garments . All persons, while engaged in the processing of milk, milk products, or frozen desserts, shall wear adequate hair coverings and shall not use tobacco. (b) Public Health Reason -Clean clothing and clean hands (including clean fingernails) reduce the possibility of milk, milk products, frozen desserts, containers, utensils, and equipment from becoming contaminated. (c) Administrati ve Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. Hands are thoroughly washed before commencing plant functions and as often as may be required to remove soil and contaminat ion. 2. Each employee washes his hands following a visit to the toilet room and prior to resuming work. 3. All persons, while engaged in the processing , pasteurization , handling, storage, transportation , or packaging of milk, milk products, frozen desserts, containers , equipment, and utensils wear clean outer garments . 4. The use of tobacco products is prohibited in all rooms in which milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products are handled, processed , or stored, or in which -144 -I F i1 ~ milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products, containers, utensils, and/or equipment are washed. These rooms shall include, but are not limited to. the receiving, processing, packaging, milk. milk product, and frozen dessert product storage, cooling and dry storage ingredients , single-service article storage, and container /utensil wash-up areas.

Milk tank cars, milk tank trucks, and frozen dessert transport vehicles, and portable shipping bins shall not be used to transport or contain any substances that may be toxic or harmful to humans. (b) Public Health Reason -The exposure of milk to the sun will alter the flavor of milk and will tend to increase the temperature, thus increasing the possibility of bacterial growth. Freezing alters the physical and chemical properties of milk. Milk, milk products, and frozen dessert products, as well as empty containers , should be protected against contamination at all times. ( c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. All vehicles are kept clean. 2. Material which is capable of contaminating milk, milk products. and frozen desserts is not transported with milk, milk products, or frozen desserts. 3. MIik and milk products. except dry milk products, are maintained at 7\u00b0C ( 45\u00b0F) or less. 4.

(28) Surroundings (a) Milk and frozen dessert plant surroundings shall be kept neat, clean, and free from conditions which might attract or harbor flies, other insects, and rodents or which otherwise constitute a nuisance. (b) Public Health Reason -The surroundings of a plant should be kept neat and clean to prevent attracting rodents, flies, and other insects which may contaminate the mllk, milk products, or frozen desserts. Insecticides and rodenticides not approved for use in plants or approved insecticides and rodenticides not used in accordance with label recommendations may contaminate the milk, milk products, or frozen desserts processed by the plant. (c) Administrative Procedures -This item is deemed to be satisfied when: 1. There is no accumulation of trash, garbage, or similar waste in areas adjacent to the milk or frozen dessert plant. Waste material stored in suitable covered containers shall be considered in compliance. 2.

The term \"accredited veterinarian'' shall mean an individual veterinarian authorized for those activities in said country or region of that country. ( 4) Public Health Reason (a) The health of the animal is a very important consideration because a number of diseases of cattle, including TB, brucellosis, Q-fever, salmonellosis , staphylococcic infection, and streptococcic infection may be transmitted to man through the medium of milk. The organisms of most of these diseases may get into the milk either directly from the udder or indirectly through infected body discharges which may drop, splash, or be blown into the milk. (b) The great reduction in the incidence of bovine TB in man indicates that the practice of good sanitation in animal husbandry, the testing of cattle and removal of the reactors from the herds, and the pasteurization of milk have been effective in the control of this disease. The reservoir of bovine TB still exists, however, constant vigilance against this disease must be continued by industry and health agencies. -149 -I r 3 e r (5) Administrative Procedures -This item Is deemed to be satisfied when: (a) Bovine Tuberculosis -All tuberculin tests and retests shall be made and any reactors disposed of, in accordance with the current edition of Uniform Methods and Rules; Bovine TB Eradication, Uniform Methods and Rules for Establishment and Maintenance of TB-Free Accredited Herds of Cattle, Modified Accredited Areas and Areas Accredited Free of Bovine TB in the Domestic Bovine, as published by the USDA at the time of the adoption of these rules. For TB test purposes, the herd is defined as all adult cattle twenty-fou r (24) months of age and over. including any commingled beef animals. Dairy cattle less than two (2) years of age and already milking shall be included in the herd test. A letter or other official correspondence attesting to the accreditation status of the locality in which the herd is located, including the date of accreditation, or a certificate identifying the animals tested, the date of injection, the date of reading of the test, and the results of the test signed by a USDA accredited veterinarian shall be evidence of compliance with the above requirements and shall be filed with the Health Officer (see Appendix A). Note: For the ICP, an official letter or other official correspondence attesting to the accreditation status of the locality in which the herd is located, including the date of accreditation or recertification or certificate identifying the animals tested, the date of injection, the date of the reading of the test, and the results of the test signed by the county's veterinary services shall be provided as directed by the TPC. (b) Bovine Brucellosis -All brucellosis tests, retests, disposal of reactors, vaccination of calves, and certification of herds and areas shall be in accordance with the current edition of Brucellosis Eradication Recommended Uniform Methods and Rules, as published by the USDA All reactors disclosed on blood agglutination tests shall be separated immediately from the milking herd; the milk of these reactors shall not be used for human consump tion. (c) A certificate identifying each animal, signed by the veterinarian and the director of the laboratory making the test, shall be filed as directed by the Health Officer. Provided, that in the event the herd is subject to the milk ring test, the record shall be required to show only the date and results of such test. Within thirty (30) days following the expiration of an official milk ring testing program or in the case of a herd subject to annual blood tests, thirteen ( 13) months following the last annual blood tests, the Health Officer shall notify the herd owner or operator of the necessity to comply with the brucellos is requirements. The failure of the herd owner or operator to comply with the brucellosis requirements within thirty (30) days of written notice shall result in immediate suspension of the permit (See Appendix A). Note: For the ICP. a certificate identifying each animal signed by the country's veterinary services and director of the laboratory conducting the testing shall be provided as directed by the TPC. (d) Other Diseases -Cows which show a complete induration of one quarter or extensive induration in one or more quarters of the udder upon physical examination, whether secreting abnormal or not shall be permanently excluded from the milking herd; provided this shall not apply in the case of a quarter that is \u00b7 1so I i: 1: '=' completely dry. Lactating animals giving bloody, stringy, or otherwise abnormal milk based on bacteriological, chemical, or physical examination, but without entire or extensive induration of the udder, shall be excluded from the herd until re\u00ad examination shows that the milk has become normal. For other diseases such tests and examinations as the Health Officer may require shall be made at intervals and by methods prescribed by him or the Alabama State Veterinarian, and any diseased or dead animals or reactors shall be disposed of as either may require.

A well-planned and extended educational phase will encourage the support of producers and reduce the problems of enforcement. The National Mastitis Council (NMC), 421 South Nine Mound Road, Verona, Wisconsin 53593 (www.nmconline.org), has studied a large number of existing control programs and has outlined a suggested flexible control program. In addition, review of the current knowledge of mastit1s may be found in thelr publications : Current Concepts of Bovine Mastitis and Laboratory Handbook of Bovine Mastiffs. Sanitariahs may find the screening test a useful device for detecting abnormal milk. Sample screening methods, as well as somatic cell diagnosis and reduction programs are discussed in the references above, as well as the Dairy Practices Council (DPC), 19 Titus Court, Richboro , Pennsylvania 18954 (www.dairypc.org) publication : The Fieldperson 's Guide to Troubleshooting High Somatic Cell Counts, DPC Guide Number 18.

MILK SAMPLIN~ HAULING , AND TRANSPORTATION Milk sampling, hauling, and transport are integral parts of a modern dairy industry. Hauling, sampling, and transport can be categorized into three (3) separate functions: Dairy or industry plant samplers, bulk milk hauling and sampling, and milk transport from one (1) milk-handing facility to another. l. MILK SAMPLING AND HAULING PROCEDURES The dairy plant sampler is a person responsible for the collection of official samples for regulatory purposes outlined in 420-3-16~.07. These persons are employees of the Health Officer and are evaluated at least once each two (2) year period by an SSO or a properly delegated Sampling Surveillance Regulatory Official (dSSO). These individuals are evaluated using ADPH-FML-248A (Alabama Department of Public Health Bulk Milk Hauler Report and Sampler Evaluation Form), which is derived from the most current edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products SMEDP (refer to Appendix M). Note: For the purposes of determining the inspection frequency for bulk milk hauler/samplers, industry plant samplers, and dairy plant samplers, the interval shall include the designated twenty-four (24) month period plus the remaining days of the month in which the inspection is due. The bulk milk hauler or sampler is any person who collects official samples and may transport raw milk from a farm and/or raw milk products to or from a milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station and has in their possession a permit from any regulatory agency to sample such products. The bulk milk hauler or sampler occupies a unique position making this individual a critical factor in the current structure of milk marketing. As a weigher and sampler, they stand as the official, and frequently the only judge of milk volumes bought and sold. As a milk receiver, the operating habits directly affect the quality and safety of milk committed to their care. When the obligations include the collection and delivery of samples for laboratory analysis, the bulk milk hauler/sampler becomes a vital part of the quality control and regulatory programs affecting producer dairies. Section .04 of this rule requires that Health Officers establish criteria for issuing permits to bulk milk haulers or samplers. These individuals are evaluated at least once each two (2) year period using ADPH-FML-284A. The industry plant sampler or bulk milk hauler or sampler is a person responsible for the collection of official samples for regulatory purposes at a milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station as outlined in Appendix N. These industry plant samplers are employees of the dairy plant, receiving station, or transfer station and are evaluated at least once each two (2) year period by an SSO or a dSSO. These industry plant samplers are evaluated using ADPH-FML-284A. The milk tank truck driver is any person who transports raw or pasteurized milk or milk products to or from a milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station. Any transportation of a direct farm pickup requires the milk tank truck driver to have responsibility for accompanying official samples. The criteria for permitting these individuals should embrace at least the following: TRAINING -To understand the importance of bulk milk collection and the techniques of sampling, Including the use of an approved in-line sampler and approved aseptic samplers for milk tank trucks or for farm bulk milk tanks and/or silos, all bulk milk haulers or samplers and industry plant samplers shall be told why, and instructed how, in the proper procedures of picking up milk and the collection of samples. The Health Officer, dairy field person, route supervisors, or any appropriate person whose techniques and practices are known to meet the requirements can conduct this training. If the Health Officer does not conduct the training, the training shall be approved by or conducted under the supervision of the Health Officer. Training also frequently takes the form of classroom sessions in which the trainer describes pickup practices, demonstrates sampling and care of samples, and affords the candidate the opportunity for guided practice in these techniques . Basic considerations of sanitation and personal cleanliness, which are important to the protection of milk quality, are discussed here. Officials administering weights and measures may participate in these programs and provide instruction in the measuring of milk and the keeping of required records. An examination, approved by the Health Officer shall be administered at the conclusion of this program. Candidates failing the exam, a score of less than 70 percent, shall be denied permits or licenses until indicated deficiencies are corrected . The examination should be adequate enough to determine if a bulk milk hauler or sampler is competent. The exam shall be composed of a minimum of twenty (20) total questions broken down into the following areas: 1. Six (6) questions relating to sanitation and personal cleanliness. 2. Six (6) questions relating to sampling and weighing procedures. 3. Four (4) questions relating to equipment , including proper use, care, cleaning, etc. 4. Four ( 4) questions relating to proper record keeping requirements . Regularly scheduled refresher short courses by the regulatory agents and officials administer ing weights and measures would assist in maintaining and increasing the efficiency of the bulk milk hauler or sampler. Appropriate training should also be provided to industry plant samplers with regularly scheduled refresher short courses. QUALi FiCA TIONS: 1. Experience -Experience may include a required period of observation during which the candidate accompanies a bulk milk hauler or sampler in the performance of their duties. 2. Personal References -Permit applications should be supported by suitable references testifying to the character and integrity of the candidate . S--2 I ~ I p ,. fl d 1 EVALUAT ION OF BULK MILK HAULER OR SAMPLER PROCEDURES The routine inspection of bulk milk hauling or sampling procedures provides the Health Officer with an opportunity to check both the condition of the bulk milk hauler's or sampler's equipment and the degree of conformance with required practices. The bulk milk hauler's or sampler's technique is best determined when the regulatory agent is able to observe the bulk milk hauler or sampler at one (1) or more farms. Each bulk milk hauler or sampler shall be inspected by the Health Officer prior to the issuance of a permit and at least once every twenty-four (24) months thereafter as referenced In 420-3-16- .06. The bulk milk hauler or sampler shall hold a valid permit prior to the collection of official samples. Health Officers may use inspections from any regulatory agency as a means of maintaining record requirements and enforceme nt. Note: The option to utilize inspections of bulk haulers or samplers conducted by other regulatory agencies, as cited above. shall not be applicable to a third party certifier (TPC) authorized under the ICP. The procedures for sampling and the care of samples should be in compliance with the current edition of SMEDP. Specific items to be evaluated in determining compliance include: 1. Personal Appearance -Bulk milk haulers or samplers shall practice good hygiene; shall maintain a neat and clean appearance ; and not use tobacco in the milkhouse. 2. Equipment Requirements (a) Sample rack and compartment to hold all samples collected. (b) Refrigerant to hold temperature of milk samples between 0\u00b0C-4.5\u00b0C (32\u00b0F- 400F). (c) Sample dipper or other approved aseptic sampling devices of sanitary design and material approved by the Health Officer; clean and in good repair. (d) Single use sample containers; properly stored. ( e) Calibrated pocket thermometer ; certified for accuracy every six (6) months; accuracy \u00b11\u00b0C (2\u00b0F). (f) Approved sanitizing agent and sample dipper container . (g) Watch for timing milk agitation. (h) Applicable sanitizer test kit. B-3 I A p p e 11 d 1 (i) Single-service sanitary towels shalf be provided for bulk tanks with a measuring rod. 3. Milk Quality Checks (a) Examine the milk by sight and smell for any off odor or any other abnormalities that would class the milk as not being acceptable . Reject if necessary . (b) Wash hands thoroughly, and dry with a clean individual sanitary towel or other approved hand-drying device immediately prior to measuring and/or sampling the milk. (c) Record milk temperature, collection time (optionally, in military time 24 hour clock), date of pick-up, and bulk milk hauler's or sampler's name and license or permit number on the farm weight ticket; monthly the hauler or sampler shall check the accuracy of the thermometer on each bulk tank and record results when used as a test thermometer. Accuracy of required recording thermometers shall be checked monthly against a standardized thermometer and recorded. Pocket thermometer shall be sanitized before use. 4. Milk Measurements (a) The measurement of the milk shall be taken before agitation. If the agitator is running upon arrival at the milkhouse , the measurement can be taken only after the surface of the milk has been quiescent.

Record measurements on the farm weight ticket. (c) Do not contaminate the milk during measurement. 5. Universal Sampling System -When bulk milk haulers or samplers collect raw milk samples, the \"universal sampling system\" shall be employed , whereby samples are collected every time milk is picked up at the faITTl. This system permits the Health Officer, at its discretion, at any given time and without notification to the industry, to analyze samples collected by the bulk milk hauler/sampler. The use of the \"universal sample\" puts more validity and faith in samples collected by industry personnel. The following are sampling procedures : (a) Pick-up and handling practices are conducted to prevent contamination of milk contact surfaces. (b) The milk shall be agitated a sufficient time to obtain a homogeneous blend. Follow the Health Officer's and/or manufacturer's guidelines or when using an approved aseptic sampling device, follow the specified protocol and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for that device. 8-4 I ;. I I i, 11 I I {c) While the farm bulk mnk tank and/or silo are being agitated, br7ng the sample container, dipper, dipper container, and sanitizing agent for the outlet valve, or single-service sampling tubes into the milkhouse aseptically. Remove the cap from the farm bulk milk tank and/or silo outlet valve and examine for milk deposits or foreign matter and then sanitize if necessary. Protect the hose cap from contamination when removing it from the transfer hose and during storage. (d) The sample may only be collected after the milk has been properly agitated or when using an approved aseptic sampling device, follow the specified protocol and SOP for that device. Remove the dipper or sampling device from the sanitizing solution or sterile container and rinse at least twice in the milk.

It is recommended that this permit be renewed each year pending satisfactory completion of an inspection as outlined in the following Inspection Section. RECIPROCITY -Each permit shall be recognized by other regulatory agencies under the reciprocal agreements of the NCIMS and supporting documents of this rule. A milk tank truck need only bear one (1) permit from an appropriate Regulatory agency. A milk tank truck may be inspected at any time when deemed appropriate by the Health Officer. Absent proof of a current permit and current inspection , when the milk tank truck is inspected by a Regulatory agency other than the permitting agency, an inspection fee may be charged to the owner of the milk tank truck, This is necessary to allow a milk tank truck to pickup and deliver in several jurisdictions without the need for more than one (1) permit. A Health Officer may have the option of inspecting any milk tank truck at any time when milk and milk products are transported in or out of a particular jurisdiction. It is the responsibility of the milk tank truck owner or operator to maintain a current proof of inspection to avoid a re\u00ad inspection fee. Disputes concerning reciprocal agreements on milk tank truck inspection between regulatory agencies may be tendered to the Chair of the NCIMS or the Chair's designee for resolution. INSPECTION -Each milk tank truck shall be inspected at least once each year by a regulatory agency (refer to 420-3-16-.06). A copy of the current inspection report shall accompany the milk tank truck at all times, or the tank shall bear an affixed label, which identifies the regulatory agency with the month and year of inspection. The affixed label shall be located near the tank outlet valve or on the front le~ side of the milk tank truck bulkhead. When significant defects or violations are encountered by a regulatory agency, a copy of the report shall be forwarded to the permitting regulatory agency and also carried on the milk tank truck until the violations are corrected. Milk tank truck inspections shall be conducted in a suitable location, i.e., a dairy plant, receiving, or transfer station or milk tank truck cleaning facility. Inspections may not require entry of confined spaces as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards . When significant cleaning, construction, or repair defects are noted, the milk tank truck shall be removed from service until proper confined entry safety requirements can be satisfied to determine cleaning or repairs needed.

C-1 I 4. p p e n cl i , (Ill) GUIDELINE #45 GRAVITY FLOW GUTTERS FOR MANURE REMOVA L IN MILKING BARNS\u00b7 Published by the Dairy Practices Council (a) The gravity flow gutter concept for manure removal comes from Europe. Manure falls into a deep gutter in the barn floor and then flows by gravity to a cross channel or outlet pipe to storage. A low 8-20 centimeters (3)\"-(8)\" dam retains a lubricating liquid layer over which the manure flows (Fig. 1 ). After one (1) to three (3) weeks in a newly started gutter, the manure surface forms an incline of 1 percent to 3 percent above the dam. Then the manure moves continuously over the lip. The gutter shall be deep enough to contain manure sloped at this i-....Lmn. tt=._:JI ~ Figure 1. Side Cross Section of a Gravity Flow Gutter Step Height, h -23 36\"' Figure Flow Gutter C-2 [ ~ p ,, c-: n p. Figure 3. Cross Section of a Typical Gutter and Grate (b) Because manure moves by its own weight, no mechanical equipment is required to remove it from the barn. Generally the cost of the gutter and cover grates is less than the cost of installing, operating , and maintaining a mechanical cleaner. (c) This system is neither a flush gutter, where 115-225 liters (30-60 gallons) of water per cow is needed to remove manure from the gutter, nor is it an under-barn storage that is open to the barn. Rather, it is a conveying channel that carries the manure from behind the cow to the outside storage. The top surface of the slurry has been recorded to move 3 meters (10 feet) per hour. (IV) CONSTRUCTION (a) Gutter Depth -Gutter depth depends on the length of the gutter and the angle of incline of the manure surface. Design in this guideline assumes the manure surface forms a 3 percent slope. Most diets form wetter manure, and with no bedding the slope may be 1 percent less. The bottom should be level so the dam will hold a uniform liquid layer. The maximum depth of the gutter at the end opposite the discharge shall not exceed 138 centimeters (54 inches). In addition, the outlet shall be clear of obstructions . (b) The depth includes an allowance for a 15 centimeters (6 inches) dam and 8 centimeters (3 inches) deep grates. (c) Adding steps may decrease the maximum manure depth. The depth from the bottom of each dam to the bottom of the next level varies depending on the distance between steps (refer to Figure 2). TABLE 6 (d) Width of Gutters -The bottom of the gutter shall not exceed ninety-one 91 centimeters (thirty-six [36] inches) in width. A seventy-six (76) centimeters (thirty C-3 I ...1 P p e 1 <l > [30] inches) wide gutter is recommended . The gutter opening may be narrowed to fifty (50)-sixty (60) centimeters (twenty [20] to twenty-four [24} inches) in order to reduce the size and costs of grates. Overflow Dam -The dam retains a lubricating liquid layer over the channel, which is essential to maintain flow. Typical heights range between eight (8) and twenty (20) centimeters (three [3] and eight [8] inches). Dams, if removable , would facilitate total cleanout, when and if necessary. Concrete , a steel plate, or a plank may be used to construct the dam. Caulking may be needed to seal the dam. TABLE 7 GRAVITY FLOW GUTTER DEPTH VS. LENGTH FOR MANURE FROM LACTATING ANIMALS Length De >th Meters Feet Cm. Inches 12 40 58 12 18 60 78 18 24 80 96 24 30 100 114 30 36 120 132 36 1. Length -A 70 meter (226 feet) long gutter has worked, but typical distances between dams range from 12 to 24 meters (40 to 80 feet). Longer channels must be deeper; hence, they may cost more because they require more concrete and stronger forms. TABLE 8 STEP HEIGHT VS. LENGTH FOR STEPPED GRAVITY FLOW GUTTERS Step Height LenQth Between Dams For stall barns and concrete slats for freestall barns are generally available. Table 7 suggests slot widths. Grates for stall barns are made from round or flat steel stock. 3. Cross Channel -The cross channel may be constructed like the gutter. At least a 60 centimeters (2 feet) drop from the top of the dam to the bottom of the cross channel is suggested to prevent backup of manure into it. The channel may be extended directly to storage. The slurry should enter the bottom; to prevent storage gases and cold air from returning up the channel. Channel depth, below grade, should be sufficient to prevent freezing. C-4 I A o p e n d i x Gravity flow via a concrete, steel, or plastic pipe may also be used to transfer manure to the bottom of the outside storage. Pipe as small as 38 centimeters (15 inches) diameter has been used successfully; however, 60 centimeters (24 inches) diameter pipe is recommended . Do not empty channels into large sumps or pits within, or having direct openings into the barn. These storages will produce gas and odors that will be drawn into the barn through the ventilation systems. Figure 4. Manure Transfer to Storage MANAGEMENT 1. Flooding of Gutters -Prior to stocking the building, fill the gutters with 8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) of water to start the lubrication layer. 2. Bedding Usage -The type and amount of bedding used is important to successful operation . Up to .5 kilograms (1 pound) per lactating animal per day of sawdust, fine cut shavings or peanut hulls still allows the system to work. Some have worked with long straw bedding, but it is not recommended , More bedding or long straw increases manure stiffness and may clog the gutter. Lactating animal mats allow minimum bedding use. Sometimes water may need to be added, depending upon the feed ration and amount of bedding used. 3. Wastage and Deposits -Keep feed and hay out of the gutter. Barn lime and soil brought in from outside may settle to the bottom. For this reason, the overflow dam on some gutters is removable for clean out. Buildup of solids has not been a problem under normal management , although the gutter will need cleaning if it has not been used for some time. Watch for islands of solids, especially where excess bedding or feed builds up. Cut these islands free of the walls to keep them flowing. 4. Cleaning Grates -Grates need cleaning at least weekly and, preferably , daily. A broom connected to a hose makes the job easy. 5. Flies and Odors -Flies have caused little or no problems . Biodegradable oil such as mineral oil may be sprayed on the manure surface to control them. Little or no odors have been observed in barns with good ventilation . There is no need to install fans to ventilate the gutters. C-5 I A r o e n <J , ) IV. CONVALESCENT (MATERNITY) PENS IN MILKING BARNS ANO STABLES While the requirement for concrete floors in milking barns and stables is necessary for good sanitation , climatic conditions in some areas of the country has created a need for convalescent (maternity) pens to be located in milking barns and stables. Therefore, convalescent pens may be allowed in the milk barn or stable; provided that the following requirements are met: 1. All floors in the production milking facility, with the exception of the convalescent pens, shall be of an impervious surface, with slopes for drainage as currently listed In the regulations. 2. Milk from animals milked in convalescent pens with non-impervious floors shall not enter the distribution system or be sold. 3. Routine milking in pens shall not be allowed. 4. Pens shall be located in a location so as not to contamina te milk holding transfer facilities or water supplies. Convalescent pens cannot be within 15 meters (50 feet) of a well. 5. A minimum of a 15 centimeters (6 inches) curb shall be provided on all exposed sides of the pen( s ). 6. Convalescent pens shall be well bedded, clean, and dry at all times. 7. No water faucet or drinking fountain shall be located within the curbed area. 8. State sanitarians, at their discretion, may require cleaning and/or reconstruction of such pens, based at intervals as necessary when the pens present a sanitation problem. 9. It is recommended that the number of pens be limited to 1 per 50 lactating animals. -------~----~==----Soil e- Figure 5. Side Cross Section of a Convalescent Pen C-6 I A p p = \" (11 VI. GUIDELINES FOR CONVENT IONAL STALL BARN WITH GUTTER GRATES OVER LIQUID MANURE STORAGE INTRODUCTIO N The use of liquid manure storage under milking barns can be a cost, labor, and energy efficient method for handling dairy animal wastes. This type of system can aid in pollution control and will provide a safe and healthy environment for cattle and humans under the following guidelines : 1. Plans for the construction of a conventional stall barn, with gutter grates over liquid manure storage, shall be submitted to the Health Officer for approval before work Is begun. Upon completion of the work, the builder shall furnish the purchaser with a signed written statement certifying that the system is constructed so as to be in full compliance with these guidelines . 2. The storage capacity of the liquid manure tank shall be for a minimum of nine (9) months. 3. A negative pressure mechanical ventilation system shall be installed to meet the following requirements (refer to Figures 6 and 7): a. Provide a maximum exhaust capacity of 40 air changes per hour from the occupied area. Of this total, about one-half, 20 air changes per hour shall be considered the cold weather part of the system and shall be exhausted through the manure storage area. The remaining 20 air changes per hour shall be considered the warm weather part of the system and shall be exhausted through the barn walls. b. Of the 20 air changes exhausted through the manure storage area there shall be a minimum continuous exhaust of 4 air changes per hour. The additional cold weather capacity of about 16 air changes per hour shall be thermostatically controlled . All fans exhausting from the manure storage area shall be installed in permanent fan houses built on the exterior wall of the barn and connected directly to the manure storage area. These fans shall be single-speed with a certified delivery rating against 6 millimeters (0.25 of an inch) water gauge static pressure. One (1) pit fan shall operate continuous ly. Airflow shall be from the occupied area through the gutters. The use of variable-speed fans is prohibited. c. Fans supplying the additional summer capacity shall be mounted to discharge directly through the barn walls. They may be mounted on the outside of the building and the openings closed with insulated panels in cold weather, or when mounted in the walls be protected with an inside insulated cover to eliminate condensation and frost formation on the shutters and mountings. Warm weather fans are to be located on the same side of the barn as the pit fans. They must have a certified delivery rating against 3 millimeters (0.125 of an inch) water gauge static pressure and should be single speed. C-7 I ,-1, I I \" 1 <l I >< d. All fans, except those providing the minimum contlnuous exhaust rate are to be controlled by thermostats located away from the barn walls. All pit fans are to be in operation before any of the wall fans are started. An electrical thermal overload device of the proper size shall protect each fan. e. Calculation Method: To calculate the fan capacity in cubic feet per minute ( cfm) for a particular barn, multiply the length times the width times the average ceiling height, all in feet, to obtain the volume. Divide the volume by 15 to obtain the minimum continuous capacity of 4 air changes per hour in cfm. W XL X H =cfm 15 For Example: Barn width 36 feet, length 160 feet and average ceiling height eight (8) feet-(6) inches. This would be a reasonable size for 60 stalls and 2 pens. The calculation of the minimum continuous exhaust for this example would be: 36 X 160 X 8.5 =3.264 cfm 15 Total cold weather capacity of 20 air changes per hour equals 5 times the minimum capacity: 3,264 x 5 ~ 16,320 cfm. Use 2 fans of 3,264 each and 2 fans of 4,896 cfm each to make up the total. Build (2) fan houses. Mount one 3,264 cfm and one 4,896 cfm fan in each. Operate one 3,264 cfm fan continuously . Thermostatically control the second 3,264 cfm fan at 4.5\u00b0C (40\u00b0F). Control the two (2) larger fans with thermostats set at 6\u00b0C (43\u00b0F) and 8\u00b0C (46\u00b0F). Divide the summer capacity of an additional 20 air changes per hour among three (3) fans of 5,440 cfm each. Locate these fans in the walls. Control them with thermostats set to 10\u00b0C-13\u00b0C (50\u00b0F-56\u00b0F (refer to Figure 6 for the approximate locations for all fans). Fans of the exact calculated capacity are usually unavailable . Always select those having a slightly higher rather than lower capacity. f. Adequate incoming fresh air, to enable the fan exhaust system to function as designed, shall be provided. A continuous slot inlet with manual adjustment on 1 side is recommended to provide uniform fresh air distribution throughout the barn (refer to Figure 7). Adjustment of the slot opening opposite the fans is to be done manually for cold and warm weather conditions . Careful construction of the fresh air intake system is essential to the satisfactory performance of the ventilation system. 4. A stand-by generator to supply electric current to the ventilation system, in the event of a power failure, shall be provided. 5. Construction Requirements a. The floor system over the pit shall be designed to safely support all animal weight, plus the possibility of a. tractor that may be needed to remove a sick or dead animal. Agitating and pumping of the stored manure shall be done through annexes C-8 I A r, }') (: 11 tJ I \\ built outside the barn (refer to Figures 6 and 7). Service alley floor and lactating animal stall platforms shall be constrvcted to drain to the grated gutter tank opening, located between the lactating animal stall and the service alley. b. Waste water from the milkhouse can be discharged into the pit. Sanitary (toilet) waste shall not be disposed of in the manure storage tank. When wastewater from the milkhouse is discharged into the pit, a drop pipe shall be connected to the discharge line so that the liquid waste will be deposited beneath the surface of the tank contents to prevent turbulence and possible odor production. c. Grates over the gutters, tank slot openings, shall be of sufficient strength to support all applied loads. A suitable grate design is one using 16 millimeters (0.625 of an inch) smooth steel bars running the length of the open gutter. The distance between the center of the first bar and the vertical face of the stall platform should be 57 millimeters (2.25 inches). The remaining bars should be spaced 63 millimeters (2.5 inches) center-to-center . Support bars crossing the gutters should be 19 millimeters (0. 75 of an inch) diameter and spaced 40 centimeters (16 inches) center\u00ad to-center. 6. Little or no bedding can be used with this system, rubber mats or equivalent, and lactating animal trainers shall be installed at the time the barn is constructed. Daily cleaning of grates with a stiff broom or scraper Is recommended. 7. Other construction criteria and management practices recommended for stall dairy barns should be followed. 8. Requirements for emptying holding tanks: a. Remove all animals and post signs on all doors that no one is to enter the milking barn during the time the tank is being agitated. b. All pit fans shall be operating during agitation and emptying. c. All milkhouse and feed storage area openings, doors, windows, etc .. shall be closed. d. The milking barn shall remain evacuated by animals and people for at least one ( 1) hour, after agitation of the holding tank is completed . C-9 I A p p ;:, ,i cl 1 ,,.

DAIRY -CONSTRUCTION ANO OPERATION -MILKING BARN, STABLE OR PARLOR Numerous factors, including the size and topography of the farm, the availability of utilities, the condition and disposition of existing buildings, the dairy operator's ultimate goals for the enterprise , and the operator's construction budget serve to make each milk producer's herd housing problems individual and unique. While there has been a tendency for workers to develop strong convictions about the practicability of given housing or milking systems, there is little doubt that the success or failure of most dairy farm operations may be traced to good or poor planning. When the unique problems of each system in its individual applications are given proper consideration , the job of producing clean milk is made easier and compliance with regulations is simplified. For example, operators of barns in which lactating animals are housed and milked will find that efficient ventilation not only reduces condensation but also relieves the problem of dust and mold on walls, ceilings, and windows. When window sills are sloped or windows set flush with interior walls in stanchion barns, the accumulation of dust and unwanted miscellaneous C-10 I App-= II d Ix items is similarly lessened. Covered recessed light fixtures remain clean longer and are less subject to damage than those projecting from the ceiling. Operators of milking parlor loose-housing systems, on the other hand, will value design features such as mechanically operated doors, which speed up animal traffic, and glazed wall finishes. which cut down the time required for proper post-milking wash-up of the parlor. Cleaner lactating animals result from proper planning and management of exercise yards and bedded areas. At least 9 square meters (100 square feet) of surfaced yard and not less than 5 square meters (50 square feet) of bedded space are recommended for each animal to be accommodated . Provisions shall also be made for the removal at least daily of manure from exercise yards and traffic lanes. Operators utilizing loose housing have shown considerable interest ln free-stall housing. Many workers have concluded that it provides the solution to the problems of unclean lactating animals and excessive bedding demands that have plagued loose housing in past years. Milk producers planning new construction or large-scale changes in existing housing should carefully study its features. Adequate light shall be available in all work areas in the milking barn, stable or parlor. Because many dairy functions are frequently performed after dark, it is important that the required minimum of 10 foot-candles ( 110 lux) of illumination be available from artificial sources. While absolute certainty of compliance with this requirement can only be confirmed by the use of a light meter, experience has shown that milking barns which otherwise meet the standards of these Rules will be properly lighted when equipped with one 100-watt bulb (or its fluorescent equal) for each 3 stanchions or per 3 meters (10 linear feet) of walkway behind each row of lactating animals in face-in barns or between rows of lactating animals in face-out barns. In addition, a smaller number of bulbs, equally spaced, are recommended for feed alleys in front of the lactating animals. When natural light is utilized, a minimum of .37 square meters (4 square feet) of window space for each 5.6 square meters (60 square feet) of floor space is recommended . Construction plans and suggestions for the various systems of animal management are available to the sanitarian and the dairyman from numerous sources, including the USDA, the county extension agent, farm periodicals . and the trade associations serving the building supply industry. MILKHOUSE M11khouses should be large enough to provide adequate space to meet present needs and should take into account the prospect of future expansion. Installed milkhouse equipment should be readily accessible to the operator. Aisles should be at least 76 centimeters (30 Inches wide), with added allowance at the outlets of bulk milk tanks, adjacent to wash-and-rinse vats and where operational conditions warrant. It is especially important that the space available to bulk milk tanks and mechanical cleaning systems be adequate to permit their disassembly , inspection , and servicing. C-11 I r. p re n d I v Floor drains should not be located under bulk milk tanks unless there is sufficient room for servicing. Floor drains should not be located directly under the outlet of a bulk milk tank. Drains and waste disposal systems should be adequate to drain the volume of water used in rinsing and cleaning. Milkhouses should be well ventilated . Proper ventilation not only avoids the obvious disadvantages of condensation on equipment and walls, It also lengthens the useful life of the building and its equipment. The constant need for renewal of painted surfaces, the repair of wooden fixtures and frames, and the removal of algae and mold from walls and ceilings of poorly ventilated milkhouses can represent a continuing expense to the operator. Where possible, windows should be placed to provide cross ventilation. In addition, one (1) or more ceiling vents should be located to receive water vaporizing from wash-and-rinse vats and other sources of evaporative moisture. Glass brick is sometimes substituted for windows in milkhouse construction. In these instances , mechanical ventilation shall be provided. A system affording filtered positive air pressure is recommended over exhaust ventilation, as the latter frequently draws dust, insects, and odors into the milkhouse. The great demand for water under pressure in milkhouse operations has emphasized the importance of protecting plumbing from freezing. Devices that have proved effective include the insulation of water lines, the use of wrap-around heat tape, infrared lamps, and thermostatically controlled space heaters. Insulated milkhouses make protection against freezjng easier and more economical, and offer the additiona l advantage of greater comfort for the operator. The factor of personal convenience frequently results in better performance by the operator1 with subsequent benefits to milk quality. Automated milking and mechanical cleaning systems of milking equipment has increased the use of hot water in the milkhouse . The following table indicates the volumes of water required to fill 30 meters 100 feet of pipeline of varying diameters: TABLE 9 WORK WATER VOLUME OF VARIOUS SIZED PIPELINES Pipe Diameter (Inches} Gallons 1 4.7 1.5 9.2 2 16.3 Since most cleaning installations employ a pre-rinse, followed by wash-and\u00ad rinse cycles , this table actually represents only one-third (\u00bd) the usual milking-time demand for heated water. Also, it does not include the \"take up\" of collecting jars, pumps, rubber parts, etc. Udder washing, bulk milk tank cleaning, and similar milkhouse tasks offer additional uses for hot water. C-12 I A p p -ll i , Sanitarians should compute the hot water demand of the individual milking systems under their supervision and require that not less than the minimum amount be available at all times. Milk producers should be made aware of the fact that effective cleaning of mechanically cleaned installations is impossible without adequate hot water and should be encouraged to provide a supply which exceeds their expected need. Such planning avoids emergency shortages and allows for normal expansion of the herd and facilities. Detailed plans for milkhouses , as well as recommendations on hot water needs, insulation, lighting, and ventilation are available from power companies , building supply associations , county agricultural extension agents, and state universities . Refrigeration , electrical, or mechanical systems powered by gasoline or diesel engines has no place in a milkhouse , milking barn, or in any communicating passageway between the milkhouse and milking barn. Such equipment is characteristically given to oil leakage and the discharge of fumes. The space occupied by it is difficult to keep clean and frequently becomes a gathering place for trash and flammable materials. With effective planning, these engines and their accessory equipment can be located, without detriment to their performance , in a separate room or building adjacent to the barn or milkhouse . MILKING METHODS Milking methods shall be geared to permit the efficient withdrawal of milk without introducing undue numbers of bacteria or causing injury to the udder. The goal of a successful milking procedure is to ensure that most dairy animals will be milked quickly, gently, and completely under conditions that optimize udder health and result in the production of milk with a low bacteria count and somatic cell count. 3-A Accepted Practices for the Design, Fabrication, and Installation of Milking and Milk Handling Equipment, Number 606-##, provides guidance on perfonnance and information requirements and certain dimensiona l requirements for satisfactory functioning of milking equipment for milking and cleaning. Methods for milking equipment testing to ensure compliance with this Accepted Practice are presented in the NMC guidelines Procedures for Evaluating Vacuum Levels and Air Flow in Milking Systems. Suggested milking procedures to minimize the risk of mastitis and to enhance the quality of milk are presented in the NMC publication Current Concepts of Bovine Mastitis and the NMC factsheet Recommended Milking Procedures . It has been known for many years that a relationship exists between mastitis and milking practices. While not all the facts are known about mastitis, it is abundant ly clear that its control is enhanced by use of mechanically sound milking equipment and good milking practices. The NMC has described a satisfactory milking system as one which: C-13 I -1, r I e I cJ I . 1. Maintains a stable vacuum in the teat cup and at a level adequate for completely milking most udders in three (3) to five (5) minutes. 2. Does not stress the tissues of the teat by excessive stretching and ballooning . 3. Produces massage without harsh action. 4. Is designed so that the entire system can be sanitized efficiently and satisfactorily. The NMC considers proper milking procedure to include the following: (i) Before the milking unit is applied to the udder, the operator takes thirty (30) seconds to prepare the lactating animal in the recommended manner to obtain milk letdown, and the milking machine should be applied immediately thereafter . (ii) The teat cups are attached in a manner to limit the volume of air drawn into the system. (iii) The teat cups are positioned as low on the teats as practicable . (iv) The operator stays near the machine and, at the end point of milk removal, the claw is briefly pulled down to open the teat cavity and remove the strippings. Stripping by machine should not extend over a period of more than fifteen to twenty (15- 20) seconds. Prolonging stripping can be injurious to the udder. (v) Before removing the machine, the vacuum to the teat cups is broken and the cups removed in a gentle manner. REVERS E FLUSH SYSTEMS Systems are acceptable if they are designed, installed, and operated in accordance with the followfng parameters for reverse flush systems: 1. All product-contact surfaces shall conform to the construction criteria of 420-3-16-.09(09). 2. An intervening break to the atmosphere shall be provided between the water and/or chemical solution and the milk and/or milk product-contact surfaces at all times. 3. If a pre-rinse cycle is used it shall be with safe water. 4. The system shall provide for: (a) A chemical solution cycle with a chemical solution complying with the provisions of Appendix F of these rules. C-14 I A pp end 1 \u00b7, (b) The chemical solution strength shall be limited to that strength necessary to accomplish its intended effect and shall not leave a significant residual in the milk. (c) A post-rinse cycle with safe water. The use of treated water to prevent psychroph ilic microorganism contamination should be considered. (d) A drain cycle with sufficient time to drain or remove all moisture from the product-contact surfaces of the reverse flush system. 5. When air under pressure is used in contact with product or solution-contact surfaces, it shall comply with the requirements for air under pressure contained in 420-3-16- .09(16), provided that an exception to the piping requirement for the air piping downstream from the terminal filter may be granted when: (a) The piping is used only for filtered air. (b) At least one ( 1) access point is available to determine cleanliness of the air piping. (c) The piping is of a smooth, non-absorbent, corrosion-resistant , non-toxic material, including any adhesives used in joints. In some installations , a check-valve may be required to prevent water and/or chemical solution from entering these air lines. DRUG RESIDUE AVOIDANCE CONTROL MEASURES Animal identification and record keeping are critical for avoiding milk drug residues. Producers should establish systems to ensure that animal drugs are used properly and be able to provide evidence that adequate control over the administration of drugs to prevent residues in milk and/or meat has been implemented . These control systems should accomplish the following objectives: 1. Lactating animals treated with medicinal agents are: (a) Identified, i.e., leg bands. chalk marks, etc . and/or (b) Segregated ; or ( c) Other means provided to preclude the adulteration of milk offered for sale. 2. Treatment Records include the following information: (a) Identity of the animal(s) treated. (b) Date(s) of treatment. (c) Drug(s) or other chemicals administered. c-1s I A p \u00b5 ~ ,, r , ) ( d) Dosage administered ( e) Milk discard time. (f) Withdrawal time prior to slaughter, even if zero. Note: Records may consist of paper and file folders, card files, appointment book\u00ad type calendars , monthly paper calendars , chalk boards (temporary records), electronic computer records, etc. 3. Maintenance of Records -The proper use or misuse of some animal drugs may cause prolonged residues in milk 4 to 45 days ahd meat 18 to 24 months. Verification of drug treatment records may be necessary in the event of an investigation or trace back by the industry or Health Officer to identify specific treated animal(s) that may be related to a milk or dairy beef residue. Producers should maintain all treatment records for a minimum of two (2) years in the event of a need to trace back or follow up on a confirmed milk or meat residue. 4. Quarantine/segregation of treated animals or other means to preclude the sale of milk or offering of treated animals for sale for slaughter prior to the end of the prescribed withdrawal time. 5. Education of all farm personnel involved in treating animals on proper drug use and methods to avoid marketing adulterated milk or meat for human food. INSECT AND RODENT CONTROL The complete elimination of flies from the farm premises is practically unattainable . However, a major reduction of fly infestation is obtainable by the dairy farm operator who conscientiously follows a sustained program of sanitation, screening, and the proper use of insecticides . The milk producer or milk plant operator must be continually aware of the potential hazard to people and animals which is inherent in most pesticides, including insecticides and rodenticides. It is important that they employ only those insecticides and rodenticides that are recommended by competent authority for the insect and rodent problems they seek to overcome , and that they follow implicitly the manufacturer's label directions for their use. Questions on the use of pesticides should be referred to the appropriate Health Officer and/or County Agricultural Extension Agent. Intermittent , time release, high-pressure insect fogging or spraying systems shall be installed and operated in accordance with the following guidelines : 1. The insecticide shall be registered with the EPA. 2. The label on the insecticide container shall specify that the insecticide may be used on dairy farms and in milking areas. C-16 I A> p '=' n d 1 3. The label shall contain adequate instructions for the safe use of the insecticide . 4. The insecticide shall be designated for use in an intermittent, time release, high-pressure insect fogging system and used in accordance with the labeling directions. 5. The container, tank, or barrel of concentrated Insecticide or use solution and the pumping or pressurizing equipment shall not be located in the milkhouse. 6. Nozzles, which would emit, spray, or fog the insecticide shall not be located in the milkhouse. 7. Nozzles shall be located, positioned, and operated so that they will not spray, fog, drip, or drain any insecticide on milk pipeline and return solution line openings, milking machine appurtenances , including milk claws, inflations, flow sensors, and interconnecting flexible milk tubing, milk receivers, or releasers, milk pumps, weigh jars, milk measuring equipment, or over any area where milk is poured, strained, or transferred . 8. Nozzles shall be located, positioned, and operated so that they will not contaminate any feed or water. 9. The fogging or spraying systems, which have nozzles located in the milking barn or parlor, shall not be operated during milking. In addition, the system shall not operate during the washing and sanitizing of milking equipment in a milking barn or parlor. This may be accomplished by inter-wiring the system so that it will not operate When the vacuum pump is operating or by a master cut-off switch with a conspicuously posted sign warning the operator that the switch shall be turned off while milking, cleaning, and sanitizing. 10. The fogging or spraying system shall operate so that only the amount of insecticide necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of reducing fly and other insect populations is used. Excessive insecticide which leaves a film on exposed walls, floors, and equipment, should be considered a violation of Item 19r of these rules. 11. These systems should be considered an adjunct to and not a replacement for good sanitary practices of proper manure removal and disposal to adequately control fly and other insect breeding on dairy farms. Effective rodent control, like insect control, is dependent on sanitation for much of its success. The careful elimination of trash and woodpiles ; the rodent-proofing of feed bins, corn cribs, and similar structures ; the prompt removal of spilled feed and manure to places of ultimate disposition ; and the deliberate elimination of protected harborage areas in farm buildings, all tend to discourage rodents near the dairy farm. Such a program also pays excellent dividends in feed savings, lowered maintenance costs for farm buildings, reduced fire hazards, and lessened risk of disease outbreaks among farm animals. C-17jc.pp?nd Anticoagulant poisons, Warfarin, Fumarin, etc. have offered improved means of controlling rodents on the farm. Used according to directions, and with due precaution against their consumption by domestic animals, these chemicals should keep the rodent population in check while additional preventive programs are instituted.

STANDARDS FOR WATER SOURCES The Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, Revision 2015 (PMO), fonnal FDA interpretations of the PMO, and other written USPHS/FDA opinions shall be used in evaluating the acceptab ility of individual water supplies and water system construction requirements at dairy farms, milk plants, and single-service container manufacturing facilities. The applicable Government Water Control Authority requirements, which are less stringent than the PMO, shall be superseded by the PMO. The applicable Alabama Water Control Authority (AWCA) requirements which are more strict than the PMO, shall not be considered in detennining the acceptability of water supplies during ratings, check ratings, single-service listing evaluations , and audits. For example, the PM O requires a satisfactory farm water sample every three (3) years. If state law required such samples to be taken annually, a Sanitation Rating Officer (SRO) conducting a sanitation rating, which includes that farm, will give that farm full credit for water sample frequency , if the PMO three (3) year requirement is met, even though the state required annual frequency is not met. Supplies other than individual water supplies, which have been approved as safe by the AWCA, shall be considered to be acceptable sources as provided in 420-3-16- .08 for Grade \"A\" inspections , as well as for all other IMS purposes without further inspection of the spring, well, or reservoir treatment facility(ies), testing records, etc. I. LOCATION OF WATER SOURCES DISTANCE FROM SOURCES OF CONTAMINATION All ground water sources should be located a safe distance from sources of contamination . In cases where sources are severely limited; however, a ground water aquifer that might become contaminated may be considered for a water supply, if treatment is provided. After a decision has been made to locate a water source in an area, it is necessary to determine the distance the source should be placed from the origin of contamination and the direction of water movement. A determination of a safe distance is based on specific local factors described in the following section on sanitary survey. Because many factors affect the determination of \"safe\" distances between ground water supplies and sources of pollution, it is impractical to set fixed distances . Where insufficient information is available to determine the \"safe\" distance, the distance should be the maximum that economics, land ownership, geology, and topography will permit. It should be noted that the direction of ground water flow does not always follow the slope of the land surface. A person with sufficient training and experience to evaluate all of the factors involved should inspect each installation . Since the safety of a ground water source depends primarily on considerations of good well construction and geology, these factors should be the guides In determining safe distances for different situations. The following criteria apply only to properly constructed wells, as described in this appendix. There is no safe distance for a poorly constructed well. D-1 I A P p e n (] v When a properly constructed well penetrates an unconsolidated formation, with good filtering properties, and when the aquifer itself is separated from sources of contaminatio n by similar materials, research and experience have demonstrated that fifteen 15 meters (fifty (50] feet) is an adequate distance separating the two. Lesser distances should be accepted only after a comprehensive sanitary survey conducted by qualified applicable AWCA Officials has determined such lesser distances are both necessary and safe. lf it is proposed to install a properly constructed well In formations of unknown character, the state or U.S. Geological Survey and the state or local health agency should be consulted. When wells must be constructed in consolidated formations, extra care should always be taken in the location of the well and in setting \"safe\" distances, since pollutants have been known to travel great distances in such formations . The owner should request assistance from the applicable state or local health agency. The following table is offered as a guide in determining acceptable distances of a well from sources of contamination: TABLE 10 DISTANCE OF A WELL FROM SOURCES OF CONTAMINATION Formation Minimum acceptable er.stance cf a well from sources of contamination Favorable 15 meters (50 feet) -Lesser distances only on applicable (Unconsolidated) government agency approval following a comprehensive sanitary survey of the proposed site and immediate surroundinos. Unknown 15 meters ( 50 feet) -Only after a comprehensive geological survey of the site and its surroundings has established , to the satisfaction of the applicable government agency that favorable formations do exist. Poor Safe distances can be established only following both the (Consolidated) comprehensive geological and comprehensive sanitary surveys. These surveys also permit determining the direction in which a well may be located with respect to sources of contamination. In no case should the acceptable distance be less than 15 meters (50 feet). EVALUATING CONTAMINATION THREATS TO WELLS Conditions unfavorable to the control of contamination and that may require specifying greater distances between a well and sources of contamination are: 1. Nature of the Contaminant: Human and animal excreta and toxic chemical wastes are serious health hazards. Salts, detergents , and other substances that dissolve in water can mix with ground water and travel with it. They are not ordinarily removed by natural filtration. D-2 I A o p :: n o , x 2. Deeper Disposal: Cesspools, dry wells, disposal, and waste injection wells and deep leaching pits that reach aquifers or reduce the amount of filtering earth materials between the wastes and the aquifer increase the danger of contamination . 3. Limited Filtration : When earth materials surrounding the well and overlying the aquifer are too coarse to provide effective filtration, as in limestone, coarse gravel, etc., or when they form a layer too thin, the risk of contamination is increased . 4. The Aquifer: When the materials of the aquifer itself are too coarse to provide good filtration, as in limestone , fractured rock, etc., contaminants entering the aquifer through outcrops or excavations may travel great distances . It is especially important in such cases to know the direction of ground water flow and whether there are outcrops of the formation, or excavations reaching it, \"upstream\" and close enough to be a threat. 5. Volume of Waste Discharged: Since greater volumes of wastes discharged and reaching an aquifer can significantly change the slope of the water table and the direction of ground water flow, it is obvious that heavier discharges can increase the threat of contamination. 6. Contact Surface: When pits and channels are designed and constructed to increase the rate of absorption , as in septic tank leaching systems, cesspools , and leaching pits, more separation from the water source will be needed than when tight sewer lines or waste pipes are used. 7. Concentrat ion of Contamination Sources: The existence of more than one source of contamination , contributing to the general area, increases the total pollution load and, consequently, the danger of contamination . SANITARY SURVEY The importance of a sanitary survey of water sources cannot be overemphasized . With a new supply, the sanitary survey should be made in conjunction with the collection of initial engineering data, covering the developmen t of a given source and its capacity to meet existing and future needs. The sanitary survey should include the detection of all health hazards and the assessment of their present and future importance. Persons trained and competent in public health engineering and the epidemiology of waterborne diseases should conduct the sanitary survey. In the case of an existing supply, the sanitary survey should be made at a frequency compatible with the control of the health hazards and the maintenance of a good sanitary quality. The information furnished by the sanitary survey is essential to complete the interpretation of bacteriological and frequently the chemical data. This information should always accompany the laboratory findings. The following outline covers the essential factors that should be investigate d or considered in a sanitary survey.

CONSTRUCTION SANITARY CONSTRUCT ION OF WELLS The penetration of a water-bearing formation by a well provides a direct route for possible contamination of the ground water. Although there are different types of wells and well construction , there are basic sanitary aspects that shall be considered and followed: 1. The annular space outside the casing shall be filled with a watertight cement grout or puddled clay from a point just below the frost line or deepest level of excavation near the well to as deep as necessary to prevent entry of contaminated water. 2. For artesian aquifers . the casing shall be sealed into the overlying impermeable formations so as to retain the artesian pressure. 3. When a water-bearing formation containing water of poor quality is penetrated, the formation shall be sealed off to prevent the infiltration of water into the well and aquifer. 4. A sanitary well seal, with an approved vent, shall be installed at the top of the well casing to prevent the entrance of contaminated water or other objectionable material. Well Casing or Lining -All that part of the suction pipe or drop pipe of any well within three (3) meters (ten [1 O] feet) of and below the ground surface shall be surrounded by a watertight casing pipe extending above the ground, platform, or floor surface, as the case may be, and covered at the top as herein provided. The casing of every well shall terminate above the ground level; the annular space outside the casing shall be filled with a watertight cement grout or clay, with similar sealing properties , from the surface to a minimum of three ( 3) meters (ten [1 O] feet) below the ground surface. A dug well, in lieu of a casing pipe, may be provided with a substantial watertight lining of concrete, vitrified tile with outer concrete lining, or other suitable material. Such lining shall extend at least three (3) meters (ten (10] feet) below the surface and shall extend up to the well platform or pump room floor with a watertight connection. In such case, the platform or floor shall have a suitable sleeve pipe, surrounding the suction pipe or drop pipe, and projecting above as herein provided for a casing pipe. Well Covers and Seals: Every well shall be provided with an overlapping, tight\u00ad fitting cover at the top of the casing or pipe sleeve to prevent contaminated water or other material from entering the well. The sanitary well seal, in a well exposed to possible flooding, shall be either watertight or elevated at least .6 meters (2 feet) above the highest known flood level. When it is expected that a well seal may become flooded, it shall be watertight and equipped with a vent line, whose opening to the atmosphere , is at least .6 meters (2 feet) above the highest known flood level. D-6 I ;\\ p fl E n a 1 The seal in a well not exposed to possible flooding shall be either watertight , with an approved vent line, or self-draining, with an overlapping and downward flange. If the seal is of the self-draining , non-watertight type, all openings in the cover should be either watertight or flanged upward and provided with overlapping , downward flanged covers. Some pump and power units have closed bases that effectively seal the upper terminal of the well casing. When the unit is the open type, or when it is located at the side, as with some jet and suction pump type installations , it is especially important that a sanitary well seal be used. There are several acceptable designs consisting of an expandable neoprene gasket, compressed between two (2) steel plates. They are easily installed and removed for well servicing. Pump and water well suppliers normally stock sanitary well seals. If the pump is not installed immediately after well drilling and placement of the casing, the top of the casing should be closed with a metal cap screwed or tack welded into place, or covered with a sanitary well seal. For large diameter wells, such as dug wells, it would be difficult to provide a sanitary well seal, consequently , a reinforced concrete slab overlapping the casing and sealed to it with a flexible seal and/or rubber gasket should be installed. The annular space outside the casing should first be filed with suitable grouting or sealing materials, i.e., cement, clay, or fine sand. A well slab alone is not an effective sanitary defense, since it can be undermined by burrowing animals and insects. cracked from settlement or frost heave or broken by vehicles and vibrating machinery . The cement grout formation seal is far more effective. It is recognized however, that there are situations that call for a concrete slab or floor around the well casing to facilitate cleaning and improve appearance . When such a floor is necessary , it shall be placed only after the formation seal and the pitless installation have been inspected . Well covers and pump platforms shall be elevated above the adjacent finished ground 'level. Pump room floors shall be constructed of reinforced, watertight concrete and carefully leveled or sloped away from the well, so that surface and wastewater cannot stand near the well. The minimum thickness of such a slab or floor shall be 10 centimeters (4 inches). Concrete slabs or floors shall be poured separately from the cement formation seal and when the threat of freezing exists, insulated from it and the well casing by a plastic or mastic coating or sleeve to prevent bonding of the concrete to either. All water wells shall be readily accessible at the top for inspection , servicing. and testing. This requires that any structure over the well be easily removable to provide full, unobstructed access for well servicing equipment. The so-called \"buried seal,\" with the well cover buried under several meters (yards) of earth, is unacceptable because: 1. It discourages periodic inspection and preventive maintenance. 0-71 Anpen<1tk' 2. It makes severe contamination during pump servicing and well-repair more likely. 3. Any well servicing is more expensive . 4. Excavation to expose the top of the well increases the risk of damage to the well, the cover, the vent, and the electrical connections . Well Pits and Drainage -Because of the pollution hazards involved, the well head, well casing, pump, pumping machinery, valve connected with the suction pump, or exposed suction pipe shall not be permitted in any pit, room, or space extending below ground level, or in any room or space above the ground, which is walled-in or otherwise enclosed, so that it does not have free drainage by gravity to the surface of the ground. Provided, that a dug well properly constructed, lined, and covered, as herein prescribed, shall not be construed to be a pit. Provided further, that pumping equipment and appurtenances may be located in a residential basement, which is not subject to flooding. And provided further, that in the case of existing water supplies which otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of this appendix, pit installations may be accepted, under the following conditions , when permitted by the AWCA: 1. Pits shall be of watertight construction, with walls extending at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) above the established ground surface at all points. 2. Pits shall be provided with a watertight , concrete floor, sloping to a drain which discharges to the ground surface at a lower elevation than the pit, and preferably at least 9 meters (30 feet) from it; or if this should be impossible , to a watertight concrete sump, in the pit, equipped with a sump-pump discharging to the ground surface, preferably at least nine 9 meters (30 feet) from the pit. 3. Pits shall be provided with a concrete base for pumps or pumping machinery , so that such units shall be located at least thirty 30 centimeters (12 inches) above the floor of the pit. 4. Pits shall be provided with a watertight housing or cover in all cases. 5. If inspection should reveal that these conditions are not being properly maintained , the supply shall be disapproved . Note: The PMO permits the acceptance of pit installations on existing water supplies but prohibits the installation of well pits on new water supplies. For well pits, \"existing water supplies,\" are those which were in use by a producer at the time they applied for a Grade \"A\" permit Therefore , pit installations which meet the above criteria would be acceptable. Change in construction and extensive alterations of an existing water supply that does not affect the physical structure of the well pit does not require elimination of the well pit. Manholes : Manholes may be provided on dug wells, reservoirs, tanks, and other similar features of water supplies. A manhole, if installed, shall be provided D-8 I n. p p e n d 1 x with a curb, the top of which extends at least 10 centimeters (4 Inches) above the slab and shall be equipped , where necessary for physical protection , with a locked or bolted overlapping watertight cover. The sides of which extend downward at least 5 centimeters (2 inches). The covers shall be kept closed at all times, except when it may be necessary to open the manhole. Vent Opening -Any reservoir, well, tank or other structure containing water for the dairy water supply may be provided with vents, overflows , or water-level control gauges which shall be so constructed as to prevent the entrance of birds, insects, dust, rodents or contaminating material of any kind. Openings on vents shall be not less than 46 centimeters ( 18 inches) above the floor of a pump room, or above the roof or cover of a reservoir. Vent openings on other structures shall be at least 46 centimeters (18 inches) above the surface on which the vents are located. Vent openings shall be turned down and screened with corrosion-resistant screen of not less than 16 x 20 mesh. Overflow outlets shall discharge above and not less than 15 centimeters (6 inches) from a roof, roof drain, floor, and floor drain or over an open water-supplied fixture. The overflow outlet shall be covered by a corrosion\u00ad resistant screen of not less than 16 x 20 mesh and by (0.6 centimeters) (0.25 of an inch) hardware cloth, or shall terminate in a horizontal angle seat check-valve. DEVELOPMENT OF SPRINGS There are two (2) general requirements necessary in the development of a spring used as a source of domestic water: 1. Selection of a spring with adequate capacity to provide the required quantity and quality of water for its intended use throughout the year. 2. Protection of the sanitary quality of the spring. The measures taken to develop a spring shall be tailored to its geological conditions and sources. The features of a spring encasement are the following: 1. An open-bottom . watertight basin intercepting the source which extends to bedrock or a system of collection pipes and a storage tank. 2. A cover that prevents the entrance of surface drainage or debris into the storage tank. 3. Provisions for the cleanout and emptying of the tank contents. 4. Provision for overflow. 5. A connection to the distribution system or auxiliary supply (refer to Figure 17). A tank is usually constructed in place with reinforced concrete of such dimensions as to enclose or intercept as much of the spring as possible. When a D-9 I A p p e n o spring is located on a hillside, the downhfll wall and sides are extended to bedrock or to a depth that will ensure maintenance of an adequate water level in the tank. Supplementary cutoff walls of concrete or impermeable clay extending laterally from the tank may be used to assist in controlling the water table in the locality of the tank. The lower portion of the uphill wall of the tank can be constructed of stone, brick, or other material so placed that water may move freely into the tank from the formation . Backfill of graded gravel and sand will aid in restricting movement of fine material from the formation toward the tank. The tank cover shall be cast in place to ensure a good fit. Forms should be designed to allow for shrinkage of concrete and expansion of form lumber. The cover shall extend down over the top edge of the tank at least 5 centimeters (2 inches). The tank cover shall be heavy enough so that it cannot be dislodged by children and shall be equipped for locking. A drainpipe with an exterior valve shall be placed close to the wall of the tank, near the bottom. The pipe shall extend horizontally so as to clear the normal ground level at the point of discharge by at least ( 15) centimeters (6) inches. The discharge end of the pipe shall be screened to prevent the entrance of rodents and insects. The overflow is usually placed slightly below the maximum water-level elevation and screened. A drain apron of rock shall be provided to prevent soil erosion at the point of overflow discharge . The supply outlet from the developed spring shall be located at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) above the drain outlet and properly screened. Care shall be taken in casting pipes into the walls of the tank to ensure a good bond with the concrete and freedom from honeycombs around the pipes. SANITARY PROTECTION OF SPRINGS Springs usually become contaminated when barnyards , sewers, septic tanks, cesspools , or other sources of pollution are located on higher adjacent land. In limestone formations however, contaminated material frequently enters the water\u00ad bearing channels through sinkholes or other large openings and may be carried along with ground water for long distances. Similarly, if material from such sources of contamination finds access to the tubular channels in glacial drift, this water may retain its contamination for long periods of time and for long distances. The following precautionary measures will help to ensure developed spring water of consistent ly high quality: 1. Provide for the removal of surface drainage from the site. A surface drainage ditch shall be located uphill from the source so as to Intercept surface-water runoff and carry it away from the source. Location of the ditch and the points at which the water should be discharged are a matter of judgment. Criteria used should include the topography , the subsurface geology, land ownership , and land use. 2. Construct a fence to prevent entry of livestock. Its location should be guided by the considerations mentioned In Item 1. The fence shall exclude livestock from the surface-water drainage system at all points uphill from the source. 0-10 I A p n.., ,, 1.1 1 3. Provide for access to the tank for maintenance. but prevent removal of the cover by a suitable locking device. 4. Monitor the quality of the spring water with periodic checks for contamination . A marked increase in turbidity or flow after a rainstorm is a good indication that surface runoff is reaching the spring. SURFACE WATER The selection and use of surface water sources for individual water supply systems require consideration of additional factors not usually associated with ground water sources. When small streams, open ponds, lakes, or open reservoirs must be used as sources of a water supply, the danger of contamination and the consequent spread of enteric diseases such as typhoid fever and dysentery are increased. As a rule, surface water shall be used only when ground water sources are not available or are inadequate. Clear water is not always safe, and the old saying that running water \"purifies itself.'' to drinking water quality within a stated distance is false. The physical and bacteriological contamination of surface water makes it necessary to regard such sources of supply as unsafe for domestic use unless reliable treatment , including filtration and disinfection , is provided. The treatment of surface water to ensure a constant, safe supply requires diligent attention to operation and maintenance by the owner of the system. When ground water sources are limited. consideration shall be given to their development for domestic purposes only. Surface water sources can then provide water needed for stock and poultry watering, gardening, fire-fighting , and similar purposes. Treatment of surface water used for livestock is not generally considered essential. There is however, a trend to provide stock and poultry drinking water that ls free from bacterial contamination and certain chemical elements. Where the final resort must be made to surface water for all uses, a wide variety of sources, including farm ponds, lakes, streams, and the roof runoff of buildings may be considered These sources are regarded, without exception , to be contaminated and their use cannot be condoned unless an individually tailored treatment process can be used which will make them safe and satisfactory . Such treatment may include aeration and the use of suitable filtration or precipitation devices to remove suspended matter, in addition to routine full-time disinfection . The milk producer and/or milk plant operator who is considering surface sources of water for milking, milkhouse, milk plant, receiving station, and/or transfer station operations shall receive the advance approval of the Health Officer and shall comply with all applicable requirements of the applicable state v,..ater control authority on the construction , protection, and treatment of the chosen supply. Note: The EPA publishes a document entitled Manual of Individual l,ll,ater Supply Systems that is an excellent source of detailed information on the development, construction , and operation of individual water systems and also contains a suggested well-drilling code. Ill. DISINFECTION OF WATER SOURCES All newly constructed or newly repaired wells shall be disinfected to counteract contamination introduced during construction or repair. Every well shall be disinfected immediately after construction or repair and flushed prior to bacteriological testing. An effective and economical method of disinfecting wells and appurtenances is the use of calcium hypochlorite , containing approximately 70 percent available chlorine. This chemical can be purchased in granular form at hardware stores, swimming pool equipment supply outlets, or chemical supply houses. When used in the disinfection of wells, calcium hypochlorite should be added in sufficient amounts to provide a dosage of approximately fifty (50) mg. available chlorine per liter (50mg/L) in the well water. This concentration is roughly equivalent to a mixture of 1 gram (0.03 ounce) of dry chemical per 13.5 liters (3.56 gallons) of water to be disinfected. A stock solution of disinfectant may be prepared by mixing 30 grams (1 ounce) of high-test hypochlorite with 1.9 liters (2 quarts) of water. Mixing is facilitated if a small amount of the water is first added to the granular calcium hypochlorite and stirred to a smooth watery paste free of lumps. The stock solution should be stirred thoroughly for 1 O to 15 minutes. The inert ingredients should then be allowed to settle. The liquid containing the chlorine should be used and the inert material discarded . Each 1.9 liters (2 quarts) of stock solution will provide a concentration of approximately 50 mg/L when added to 378 liters (100 gallons) of water. The solution should be prepared in a clean utensil. The use of metal containers should be avoided, as they are corroded by strong chlorine solutions. Crockery, glass or rubber lined containers are recommended. Where small quantities of disinfectant are required and a scale is not availablei the material can be measured with a spoon. A heaping tablespoonful of granular calcium hypochlorite weighs approximately 14 grams(\u00bd ounce). When calcium hypochlorite is not available, other sources of available chlorine such as sodium hypochlorite 12 to 15 percent of volume can be used. Sodium hypochlorite , which is also commonly available as liquid household bleach, with 5.25 percent available chlorine, can be diluted with 2 parts of water to produce the stock solution. One point nine (1.9) liters (2 quarts) of this solution can be used for disinfecting 378 liters ( 100 gallons) of water. Stock solutions of chlorine in any form will deteriorate rapidly unless properly stored. Dark glass or plastic bottles with airtight caps are recommended . Bottles containing solution should be kept in a cool place and protected from direct sunlight. If proper storage facilities are not available, the solution should always be prepared fresh immediately before use. Complete information concerning the test for residual chlorine is included in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of vVclter and lM3stewater (SMEWW), published by the American Public Health Association . 0-12 I r~ p p e r, d 1 ~ DUG WELLS After the casing or lining has been completed, follow the procedure outlined below; 1. Remove all equipment and materials that will not form a permanent part of the completed structure. 2. Using a stiff broom or brush, wash the interior walls of the casing or lining with a strong solution (100 mg/L) of chlorine to ensure thorough cleaning and sanitizing. 3. Place the cover over the well and pour the required amount of chlorine solution into the well through the manhole or pipe opening just before inserting the pump cylinder and drop-pipe assembly. The chlorine solution should be distributed over as much of the surfaoe of the water as possible to obtain proper diffusion of the chemical through the water hose or pipeline, as the line is being alternately raised and lowered. This method should be followed whenever possible. 4. Wash the exterior surface of the pump cylinder and drop pipe with the chlorlne solution as the assembly is being lowered into the well. 5. After the pump has been set in position, pump water from the well and through the entire water distribution system to the milkhouse until a strong odor of chlorine is noted. 6. Allow the chlorine solution to remain in the well for at least twenty-four (24) hours. 7. After twenty-four (24) hours or more have lapsed, flush the well to remove all traces of chlorine. DRILLED , DRIVEN, AND BORED WELLS After the casing or lining has been completed , follow the procedure outlined below: 1. Remove all equipment and materials that will not form a permanent part of the completed structure. 2. When the well is being tested for yield, the test pump should be operated until the well water is clear and as free from turbidity as possible. 3. After the testing equipment has been removed, slowly pour the required amount of chlorine solution into the well just before installing the permanent pumping equipment. Diffusion of the chemical with the well water may be facilitated as previously described . 0-13 1 A p p e n r1 I ll 4. Wash the exterior surface of the pump cylinder and drop pipe with chlorine solution as the assembly is being lowered into the well. 5. After the pump has been set in position, operate the pump until the water discharged through the entire distribution system to waste has a distinct odor of chlorine. Repeat this procedure a few times, at one (1) hour intervals, to ensure complete circulation of the chlorine solution through the column of water in the well and the pumping equipment. 6. Allow the chlorine solution to remain in the well for at least twenty-four (24) hours. 7. After twenty-four (24) hours or more have elapsed, flush the well to remove all traces of chlorine. The pump should be operated until water discharged to waste is free from the chlorine odor. In the case of deep wells having a high water level, it may be necessary to resort to special methods of introducing the disinfecting agent into the well so as to ensure proper diffusion of chlorine throughout the well. The following method is suggested : Place the granulated calcium hypochlorite m a short section of pipe capped at both ends. A number of small holes should be drilled through each cap or into the sides of the pipe. One (1) of the caps should be fitted with an eye to facilitate attachment of a suitable cable. The disinfecting agent is distributed when the pipe section is lowered and raised throughout the depth of the water. WATER-BEARING STRATA Sometimes a well Is encountered that does not respond to the usual methods of disinfection. A well like this 'has usually been contaminated by water that entered under sufficient head to displace water into the water-bearing formation . The displaced water carries contamination with it. The contamination that has been carried into the water-bearing formation can be eliminated or reduced by forcing chlorine into the formation. Chlorine may be introduced in a number of ways, depending on the construction of the well. In some wells. it is advisable to chlorinate the water and then add a considerable volume of a chlorine solution in order to force the treated water into the formation. When this procedure is followed, all chlorinated water should have a chlorine strength of approximately 50 mg/L. In other wells, such as the drilled well cased with standard weight casing pipe, it is entirely practicable to chlorinate the water, cap the well, and apply a head of air. When air is alternately applied and released, a vigorous surging effect Is obtained and chlorinated water is forced into the water bearing formation . In this procedure, the chlorine strength of the treated water in the well will be reduced by dilution as it mixes with the water in the water-bearing formation . Therefore , it is advisable to double or triple the quantity of chlorine D-14 I A I n en u, compound to be used so as to have a chlorine strength of one (100) to one hundred, ( 150 mg/L) in the well as the surging process is started. After treating a well in this manner, it is necessary to flush it to remove the excess chlorine. DISINFECTION OF SPRINGS Springs and encasements should be disinfected by a procedure similar to that used for dug well. If the water pressure is not sufficient to raise the water to the top of the encasement , it may be possible to shut off the flow and thus keep the disinfectant in the encasement for twenty-four (24) hours. If the flow cannot be shut off entirely, arrangements should be made to supply disinfectant continuously for as long a period as practicable . DISINFECTION OF WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS These instructions cover the disinfection of water distribution systems and attendant standpipes or tanks. It is always necessary to disinfect a water system before placing it in use under the following conditions : 1 . Disinfection of a system that has been in service with raw or polluted water preparatory to transferring the service to treated water. 2. Disinfection of a new system upon completion and preparatory to placing in operation with treated water or water of satisfactory quality. 3. Disinfection of a system after completion of maintenance and repair operations. The entire system, including tank or standpipe, should be thoroughly flushed with water to remove any sediment that may have collected during operation with raw water. Following flushing, the system should be filled with a disinfecting solution of calcium hypochlorite and treated water. This solution is prepared by adding 550 grams (1.2 pounds) of high-test ( 70 percent) calcium hypochlorite to each 3,785 liters (1,000 gallons) of water. A mixture of this kind provides a solution having not less than (100 mg/L) of available chlorine. The disinfectant should be retained in the system, tank. or standpipe, if included, for not less than twenty-four (24) hours. then examined for residual chlorine and drained out. If no residual chlorine is found present, the process should be repeated. The system is next flushed with treated water and put into operation . IV. CONTINUOUS WATER DISINFECTION CHEMICAL DISINFECTION OF WATER Water supplies which are otherwise deemed satisfactory, but which prove unable to meet the bacteriological standards prescribed herein, shall be subjected to continuous disinfection. The individual character of the supply shall be investigated D-15 I A r r e n d , , and a treatment program developed , which shall produce a safe supply as determined by bacteriological testing. For numerous reasons, including economy, effectiveness , stability, ease of use, and availability, chlorine is by far the most popular chemical agent employed for the disinfection of water supplies. This does not preclude the use of other chemicals or procedures demonstrated to be safe and effective. The amount necessary to provide adequate protection varies with the supply and the amount of organic and other oxidizable material that it contains. Proper disinfection can only be assured when a residual concentration of chlorine remains. for bactericidal activity, after the demands of these other substances are met. In general, these factors exert the most important influences on the bactericidal efficiency of chlorine: 1. Free chlorine residual; the higher the residual, the more effective the disinfection and the faster the disinfection rate, 2. Contact time between the organism and the disinfectant ; the longer the time, the more effective the disinfection. 3. Temperature of the water in which contact Is made, the lower the temperature , the less effective the disinfection. 4. The pH of the water in which contact is made; the higher the pH, the less effective disinfection . For example, when a high pH and low temperature combination is encountered in a water, either the concentration of chlorine or the contact time shall be increased . Likewise, chlorine residual will need to be increased if sufficient contact time is not available in the distribution system before the water reaches the first user. SUPERCH LORINATION -DECHLORINATION Superchlorination -The technique of superchlorination involves the use of an excessive amount of chlorine to destroy quickly the harmful organisms that may be present in the water. If an excessive amount of chlorine is used, free chlorine residual will be present. When the quantity of chlorine is increased, disinfection is faster and the amount of contact time required ensuring safe water is decreased. De-chlorination -The de-chlorination process may be described as the partial or complete reduction of any chlorine present in the water. When de-chlorination is provided in conjunction with proper superchlorination , the water will be both properly disinfected and acceptable to the consumer for domestic or culinary uses. De-chlorination can be accomplished in individual water systems by the use of activated carbon de-chlorinating filters. Chemical de-chlorination by reducing agents such as sulphur dioxide or sodium thiosulfate can be used for batch de-chlorination . Sodium thiosulfate is also used to de-chlorinate water samples prior to submission for bacteriological examination . D-16 I \\ P P i! 11 (I I < DISINFECTION EQUIPMENT Hypochlor inators are the most commonly employed equipment for the chemical elimination of bacteriological contamination. They operate by pumping or injecting a chlorine solution into the water. When properly maintained. hypo-chlorinators provide a reliable method for applying chlorine to disinfect water. Types of hypo-chlorinators include positive displacement feeders, aspirator feeders, suction feeders, and tablet hypo-chlorinators. This equipment can be readily adapted to meet the needs of other systems of treatment , which require the regulated discharge of a solution into the supply. Positive Displacemen t Feeders -A common type of positive displacement hypo-chlorinator ls one ( 1) that uses a piston or diaphragm pump to inject the solution. This type of equipment, which is adjustable during operation, can be designed to give reliable and accurate feed rates. When electricity is available, the stopping and starting of the hypo-chlorinator can be synchronized with the pumping unit. A hypo-chlorinator of this kind can be used with any water system. However, it is especially desirable in systems where water pressure is low and fluctuating . Aspirator Feeders -The aspirator feeder operates on a simple hydraulic principle that employs the use of the vacuum created when water flows either through a venturi tube or perpendicular to a nozzle. The vacuum created draws the chlorine solution from a container into the chlorinator unit where it is mixed with water passing through the unit and the solution is then injected into the water system. In most cases, the water inlet line to the chlorinator is connected to receive water from the discharge side of the water pump, with the chlorine solution being injected back into the suction side of the same pump. The chlorinator operates only when the pump is operating . Solution flow rate is regulated by means of a control valve; pressure variations are known to cause changes in the feed rate. Suction Feeders -One (1) type of suction feeder consists of a single line that runs from the chlorine solution container through the chlorinator unit and connects to the suction side of the pump. The chlorine solution is pulled from the container by suction created by the operating water pump. Another type of suction feeder operates on the siphon princtple with the chlorine solution being introduced directly into the well. This type also consists of a single line, but the line terminates in the well below the water surface instead of the influent side of the water pump. When the pump is operating , the chlorinator is activated so that a valve is opened and the chlorine solution is passed into the well. Tablet Chlorinator: These hypo-chlorinators inject water into a bed of concentrated calcium hypochlorite tablets. The result is metered into the pump suction llne. 0-17 I A p JI t! 11 'J I ~ ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT DISINFECTION OF WATER The use of ultraviolet light (UV) to disinfect drinking water has been demonstrated to be an effective process that can inactivate microbes generally targeted by standard chemical disinfectants as well as pathogens that are resistant to other treatments such as Cryptosporidium . However, in the design of a water treatment system with UV light, the dairy farm, milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station permit holder must exercise care to ensure that all other requirements of these rules relating to source, protection from contamination , and chemical and physical characterist ics are met. UV disinfection does not change the chemical or physical characteristics of the water such as reducing or removing turbidity, mineral levels, or arsenic, etc., so additional treatment, if otherwise dictated, may still be required. Nor does UV treatment provide residual disinfection . Some supplies may require routine chemical disinfection , including the maintenance of a residual disinfectant throughout the distribution system, and there may continue to be a need for the periodic flush ing and disinfection of the water distribution system. In addition. materials present in water can give rise to significant transmission difficulties so that it may be necessary to pre-treat some supplies to remove excessive turbidity and color. Color, turbidity, and organic impurities can interfere with the transmission of UV energy and may decrease the disinfection efficiency below levels required to ensure the destruction of pathogenic organisms. In general, color and turbidity measurements do not provide an accurate measure of their impact on UV disinfection efficacy Percent UV Transmissivity (% UVT) multiplied by time measures dfsinfection efficiency . As a result, an in-line UVT analyzer is needed to assure that the proper dose is provided on a continuing basis, and it may be necessary to pre-treat the water supply to assure consistent water quality. The use of UV to meet the bacteriologica l requirements of the PMO is acceptable provided the equipment used meets the criteria described herein. Water systems that are within the scope of the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act as amended and 40 CFR Part 141, or state programs that have adopted these requirements, shall be regulated under this act and these regulations.

Criteria for the Acceptability of a UV Disinfection Unit For Farm Water Supplies with a Flow Rate Less than Twenty (20) Gallons Per Minute 1. When used to disinfect water to potable drinking water standards, UV light shall be applied so that the entire volume of water receives at least a minimum reduction equivalent does of UV at 2,537 Angstrom (254 nanometers) of 40,000 microwatt-seconds per square centimeter. 2. A flow or time delay mechanism shall be provided so that all water moving past the flow stop or divert valve receives the minimum dose required above. 3.

METHODS OF SANITIZATION CHEMICA L Certain chemical compounds are effective for the sanitizatio n of milk containers. utensils, and equipment. These are contained in either in 40 CFR 180.940 and shall be used in accordance with label directions , or Electro-Chemical Activation (ECA) device manufacturer 's instructions if produced onsite in accordance with Section II below. STEAM When steam is used, each group of assembled piping shall be treated separately by inserting the steam hose into the inlet and maintaining steam flow from the outlet for at least five (5) minutes after the temperature of the drainage at the outlet has reached 94\u00b0C (200\u00b0F). The period of exposure required here is longer than that required for individual cans because of the heat lost through the large surface exposed to the air. Covers shall be in place during treatment. HOT WATER Hot water may be used by pumping it through the inlet if the temperature at the outlet end of the assembly is maintained to at least 77\u00b0C (170\u00b0F) for at least five (5) minutes. II. CRITERIA FOR THE ONSITE PRODUCTION AND USE OF ELECTRO - CHEMICAL ACTIVATION (ECA) GENERATED HYPOCHLOROUS ACID FOR THE SANITIZATION OF MULTI-USE CONTAINERS, UTENSILS, AND EQUIPMEN T The following is a list of criteria that are required for on-site generation of ECA generated hypochlorous acid that was produced onsite and used as a sanitizer for the sanitization of multi-use containers , utensils, and equipment. 1. The ECA device manufacturer shall be registered with the EPA as a pesticidal device establishment pursuant to 40 CFR 152.500 and shall comply with the labeling requirements outlined in 40 CFR 156.10. 2. The minimum dilution percentage of the sanitizer shall be fifty ( 50) parts per million (ppm) free available chlorine (FAC) with a m1nimum contact time of thirty ( 30) seconds pursuant to the efficacy requirements for EPA DISfTSS four ( 4) Sanitizer rinses, for previously cleaned milk-contact surfaces, and less than two\u00ad hundred (200) ppm FAG. The sanitizer produced shall meet the data requirements of 40 CFR Part 158 Data Requirements for Registration , Pesticide Assessment Guidelines -Subdivision G, 91-2(f), and its test documents shall be pursuant to Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs). F-1 I A pr> e 11 ct I 3. The salt used to generate the sanitizer shall be of food-grade quality rated at a minimum of 99.6 percent purity, and potable water shall be used to ensure quality and consistency of the sanitizer generated. 4. The ECA device and its solution concentrate storage containers shall be constructed of materials that do not impart toxic materials into the sanitizing solution either as a result of the presence of toxic constituents in the materials of construction or as a result of physical or chemical changes that may occur during the ECA process. 5. The ECA solution concentrate storage containers shall be labeled with the following: (a) Contents. (b) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishment number for the ECA device manufacturer. (c) Dilution percentage Instructions for use and storage conditions, including the shelf-life. (d) A list of its active and inert ingredients . (e) Other required standard safety data disclosures , formerly referred to as Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). 6. The ECA device used to produce the hypochlorous sanitizer shall control and record the parameters to ensure that the ECA device is operating within its design limits and provides an effective real time notification or alarm and shall shut down when it falls out of the required range as recommended by the ECA device manufacturer. 7. Standard measurement methods such as FAC titration or chlorine test strips shall be used to verify that the concentration of the ready to use sanitizer being applied Is in a range between 50 ppm and 200 ppm. Measurement equipment shall be checked, calibrated , and measurements recorded. All records shall be accessible to the Health Officer for inspection . Electronically generated records for FAC concentrations , if used, shall meet the criteria specified in Appendix H, Section V. 111. EVAPORATING, DRYING, AND DRY PRODUCT EQUIPMENT CLEANING CLEANING Cleaning of Evaporators and Condensers -Some evaporators are designed so that the milk or milk product is exposed to large surface areas for a long period of time at temperatures conducive to the growth of microorganisms . F-2 I A 11 P ~ ,, 1 -.: Pipelines and/or equipment designed for automa ted mechanical cleaning of evaporators should meet the following requirements: (a) A pH recording device should be installed in the return solution line to record the pH and time which the line or equipment is exposed during the cleaning and sanitizing operation. (b) These pH recording charts should be identified, dated, and retained for three (3) months. (c) During each official inspection, the Health Officer should examine and initial the pH recording charts to verify the time of exposure to the cleaning solutions and their pH. The following are suggested procedures for cleaning and sanitizing evaporators and condensers: The surface area inside an evaporator is extremely large. Not only is there a large separator chamber and vapor lines but steam chests may also have as many as 500 to 1400 heating tubes from 3 to 15 meters 10 to 50 feet long. The total surface area may be 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, which may require large volumes for recirculation. This surface area shall be cleaned and sanitized carefully or it will contaminate the milk or milk product. The operating temperatures in an evaporator are very close to the growing temperatures of thermoduric and certain mesophilic types of bacteria, The first effect may operate at 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) to 77\u00b0C (170\u00b0F), the second effect at 52\u00b0C 63\u00b0C the third effect at 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) to 49\u00b0C (120\u00b0F). The product being evaporated is often re-circulated in the last effect several times until the right concentration is reached, which may give bacteria ample time to grow. A clean evaporator operates more efficiently. It is necessary to clean the evaporato rs after long periods of operations because burned-on material reduces heat transfer and efficiency. A point is reached where it will be more economical to stop and clean up than to continue to operate. Evaporators need cleaning for sanitary reasons as well as for efficient operation . Tube chests and heating plates shall be cleaned to get good heat transfer. If vapor lines are not cleaned, it is possible to get a back surge of vapor when the vacuum is released. This can carry soil back into the milk or milk product thus lowering the quality. This soil may drop into the thermo\u00ad compression unit, block passage of vapors, and actually prevent good operation . Compounds for cleaning are usually divided into two (2) main groups: (a) The alkaline cleaners usually contain caustic with water conditioners , synthetic detergents, and foam depressants added to enhance cleaning action. The purpose of the alkaline cleaner is to digest the bulk of the soil. The alkaline solutions are usually run first at concentrations ranging from 1 percent to 3 percent at temperatures of 83\u00b0C ( 180\u00b0) to 88\u00b0C (190\u00b0F) for 30 to 60 minutes. (b) Acid cleaners are usually food grade with synthetic detergents and inhibitors to prevent attack on metal surfaces. The purpose of acid cleaners is to remove mineral films, alkali cleaner residues, and shine the inside surfaces. Acid F-3 I A p l' e ,, JI solutions are usually used last at concentrations of 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent at 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) to 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F). In all cases, cleaners and cleaning instructions should be followed as recommended by the manufacturer of the cleaning compound. It is also necessary to follow the recommendations and instructions of evaporator manufacturers. The evaporators operating with compressed ammonia require special cleaning precautions . Cleaning Methods -There are four ( 4) basic methods of cleaning evaporators : 1. Boil-out; 2. Circulation ; 3. Spray cleaning; or 4, A combination of the three methods (a) The boil-out method is the oldest, but it is still very effective. It is accomplished by rolling or boiling the cleaning solutlon under partial vacuum. Heat is applied by the evaporator and just enough vacuum is used to roll the solution. Cleaning solutions are elevated to the dome and upper parts by opening and closing the vacuum breaker. Hand-brushing of some areas is often necessary following boil-out because it is difficult to thoroughly clean the upper surfaces with this method. (b) Circulation cleaning is a newer method of cleaning. The cleaning solution actually follows the milk or milk product path. The solution is circulated by returning it back to the starting point. Heat is applied by a pre-heater , tube chest, or steam jet, sometimes called a boil-out nozzle. This method Is not adaptable to all types of evaporators and it is usually necessary to add spray cleaning devices to thoroughly clean separators and the bottom tube sheet in steam chests. (c) Spray cleaning is the newest method of cleaning evaporators . Cleaning solutions are pumped through spray devices and distributed over the surfaces which are contacted by the milk or milk product. Heat is applied by a pre\u00ad heater, a surge tank, or on the run with live steam. When properly designed and operated spray cleaning systems are used, cleaning problems are at a minimum. Spray cleaning offers many advantages over boil-out or circulation methods of cleaning. Less water and less cleaning solution are required. This not only results in a saving of water, heat, and cleaners, but more concentrated cleaning solutions can be used giving faster, more effective cleaning. Heat for the rinse water and cleaning solutions is applied externally, preventing additional burn-on in tube chests. As the evaporator is not under vacuum, less heat is required to keep the solution hot, resulting in a saving of fuel. Higher temperatures can be used to improve cleaning efficiency. There are some disadvantages to spray cleaning. Spray devices cost extra money because they are specifically designed for almost every operation . Spray devices shall be properly placed and designed to cover the top of the dome in F-4 I \"' r ., n l I the separator, the tangential inlets, the vapor lines, sight glasses, and steam chest tubes. Spray cleaning may require additional stainless steel lines to convey the solution at the necessary volumes. Larger pumps are also required to pump the necessary volume of cleaning solution. Even with these disadvantages , the advantages of savings in heat. water, cleaning compound , and time outweigh the disadvantages . (d) Sometimes there are advantages in using combined systems of cleaning. It may be possible to boil-out the steam chests and spray the separators . Sometimes it is possible to circulate the steam chests and spray clean the separators or other portions of the unit. Quite often the combined systems. especially the circulation in the spray system, will work best on certain types of evaporators. ( e) One of the biggest factors affecting the method of cleaning used is the type of evaporator . In a falling film type evaporator , circulation cleaning can be used to clean the tube chests and spray cleaning can be utilized to clean the evaporator chambers. When using a plate-type evaporator , circulation cleaning is best. In an internal type tube chest, a boil-out system for the tubes and spray cleaning of the separator works very well. With an external chest type evaporator , the entire unit can be spray cleaned. If it is a compressed ammonia operated evaporator , spray cleaning works well, and sanitizing should be done to eliminate any microorganisms which may have survived the cleaning regimen. Sanitizing can best be accomplished by using chemical sanitizers. Heat may be used if all surfaces are heated to 83\u00b0C (180\u00b0F) or higher. Since there is a tremendous investment in stainless steel evaporato rs, it is necessary to use cleaning and sanitizing products which do not corrode stainless steel. Chemical sanitizers can be applied through the spray equipment or they can be applied with fogging guns. 1. High-Press ure Pump and High-Pressure Lines -The high-pressure pump and high-pressure line to the dryer nozzles may be cleaned as a separate circuit by connecting the line to the nozzle back to the drop tank and this tank connecting to the inlet of the high-pressure pump. The regular milk or milk product atomizing nozzles should be removed before cleaning is to be done. Another method of cleaning the high-pressure pump and lines is to include this pump and high-pressure lines in the circuit when wet cleaning some types of spray dryers. In either case, a solution of 1-3 percent caustic heated to 72\u00b0C ( 160\u00b0F) should be circulated for at least thirty (30) minutes. A solution of inhibited acid should be pumped through the atomizing system as a daily procedure to remove the milkstone from the high-pressure pump and high-pressure line. A solution of inhibited acid should be recirculated a minimum of 10 to 15 minutes and followed by a rinse with potable water. It is also recommended that the high-pressure pump head be disassembled as a daily procedure immediately following the final rinse and the parts be placed on a table or rack for air drying. When the pump is disassemb led the parts are to be checked to see if they are clean, and to see if any maintenance is required to remove pits. Seats are also checked at this time. Since a high-pressure pump is subjected F\u00b7 s 1 11. p r, t n Ll :,, daily to extreme heavy duty, the valves and seats are recommended to be ground periodically to maintain uniform pressure on the atomizing nozzles. Prior to use, the entire system should be sanitized. 2. Wet Cleaning of Dryers -There are several methods of wet cleaning dryers: (a) The first method is hand-brushing . The cleaning personnel go into the dryer with buckets of cleaning solution and brush all surfaces of the dryer. The unit is then rinsed with a hose. (b) Cleaning can also be done with hand-operated spray guns. These spray guns are pressure pumps which operate at high pressures in low volumes. In many cases, box-type dryers can be completely cleaned with the addition of a seven (7) foot extension on these pressure guns. By using high-pressure spray guns and cleaning compounds with a high synthetic detergent content, it is possible to remove very difficult soil. (c) The third method of wet cleaning is by spray cleaning with various types of stationary or rotating spray devices. They usually operate at a high volume of low pressure in the range of 69 kPa (10 psi) to 138 kPa (20 psi). Constant spray coverage can be obtained when spray devices are properly designed. Usually several spray devices are required because of the many chambers , collectors, and down pipes within these units. Less time is required to do a complete job with spray cleaning. The systems are installed so that cleaning lines are easily connected to the spray devices and an effective return system, Spray cleaning time is much shorter than hand cleaning time. especially in large units. Spray cleaning eliminates the entry of cleaning personnel into the drying units. Silo or vertical type dryers are often 6.2 meters (20 ft.) to 30.4 meters ( 100 ft.) high and it is difficult and dangerous to clean by hand or by hand operated units. Spray cleaning elimlnates the flavor contamination when switching to other milk or milk products. If an ungraded milk or milk product is run through the dryer, it is necessary to thoroughly clean before running a Grade \"A\" milk or milk product. There are disadvantages to spray cleaning. The spray devices shall be properly placed and designed to do the complete cleaning job. They shall be removable so as not to affect the air currents during operation . However, the advantages of safety plus cleaning time and consistently complete cleaning outweigh the disadvantages . A typical spray cleaning cycle might operate as follows: (1) The various spray heads are placed in the dryer and securely fastened into place. The rinse water is pumped through the spray device and allowed to run down the side-walls of the drying units. Cleaning compounds which are mild alkaline or chlorinated cleaners are prepared at 0.3 percent concentration , heated to 71 \u00b0C (160\u00b0F) to 83\u00b0C (180\u00b0F), and circulated for forty-five (45) minutes to one (1) hour. The unit is given a final rinse and is thoroughly dried. Occasiona lly acid type cleaners are used to control mineral films. Sanitizing with chemical sanitizers is a controversial subject. Sanitizing can be done with heat but it may be difficult to heat all surfaces to 83\u00b0C (180\u00b0F). Heating to 83\u00b0F (180\u00b0F) for ten (10) minutes does not kill spore formers. However, they are killed with many chemical sanitizers . Even if heat F-6 I ..\\ ., p ~ n ct i 1 is used, it is recommended that chemical sanitizers be occasionally used. By pumping the sanitizer solution to the high-pressure pump or by fogging wjth high pressure, it is possible to completely oover the milk or milk product-contact surface. Actually, the untt shall be thoroughly dried before operation. Chlorine sanitizers may cause corrosion. Obviously, these compounds should be used with care. If chlorine is left on the dryer and heat is applied, the chlorine droplets will become hot and concentrate and cause pitting. When chlorinated cleaners are used, a dryer surface can be effectively cleaned and at least partially sanitized and the solution can be completely rinsed. Acid-synthetic detergent type sanitizers have been developed which are effective on spore formers. These compounds are germicidal, effective in hard water, and stable in hot or cold solutions. They have an advantage in that they are noncorrosive to dairy metal. (2) It is not necessary to wet clean dryers on a daily basis. However, a schedule should be set up so cleaning is done periodically. As long as a dryer is operating continuously, it is not necessary to clean it from an efficiency standpoint. Some types of dryers require very little cleaning, maybe once each month; others require dry cleaning on a more frequent basis. It is necessary to clean and sanitize dryers if they are going to remain idle any appreciable length of time. Bacteria may grow ih dryers which remain idle. Dryers shall be spray cleaned if they are improperly operated, causing burn-on in the drying chamber. Whenever fires develop inside the drying unit or when burn-on occurs, it is necessary to thoroughly clean at least the drying chambers. Quality is the key to the dry milk industry. There should be a program of cleaning and sanitizing of both evaporators and dryers. Better quality milk and milk products are produced in evaporators and dryers when thoroughly cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis. 3. Ory Cleaning -It Is very difficult to discuss proper cleaning procedures without also discussing proper operating procedures , especially the start-up and shutdown of the dryer. Assuming the dryer has been properly started and operated throughout the run or drying cycle, the first step in a successful cleaning operation is shutting the dryer down properly. The type of energy supplying heat to the dryer chamber, i.e., steam or gas, alters the proper shutdown technique . The correct procedure in shutting down a steam heated dryer is as follows: (a) Shut off the main steam valve at the proper time. (b) Maintain the proper dryer outlet temperature for drying by gradually reducing the output of the high-pressure pump until the residual heat of the steam coil is dissipated to a point where it does not maintain proper temperature or until the milk or milk product being pumped by the high-pressure pump does not maintain a satisfactory spray pattern. (c) Keep the dry milk product removal system and conveying system in operat1on. (d) Keep the air intake and exhaust fans on the dryer in operation until the main chamber is sufficiently cooled to provide a comfortab le atmosphere for the cleaning personnel. F-7 I A P II .. 11 U 0. On a gas-fired spray dryer, the burner assembly has very little or no residual heat capacity. Therefore , the shutdown is more rapid. The correct procedure for shutting down a gas-fired dryer is as follows= (a) Shut off the gas supply to the burner. (b) Immediately shut off the high-pressure pump. (c) Same procedure as steam heated dryer. (d) After the above procedures have been accomplished, shut down the intake fan. Let the exhaust fan and vibrators or shakers continue to operate, along with the milk and milk product removal system. The exhaust fan should be severely dampered so that it induces only a small air-flow. A small auxiliary fan is sometimes used in lieu of the dampered exhaust fan. The use of either fan serves a twofold purpose: First, it is helpful to put the drying system under a slight negative pressure to reduce the tendency for milk or milk product to drift out of the system into the milk plant through open doors, etc. Secondly, it is vital to prevent thermal currents from creating a reverse air-flow through the drying system1 which tends to deposit milk or milk product on the heating surfaces and plenum duct. Milk or milk product deposits on steam coils reduce their heating ability. create sediment, and conceivably bacterial problem areas. If the dryer Is gas fired, there is a further hazard of fire. It is important ; therefore, that the closure or covers supplied by the manufacturer be placed on the inlet air duct system simultaneous with the shutdown of the fan. After any prime milk or milk product has been removed from the drying system. the system is ready for cleaning. The cleaning personnel should be supplied each day with a freshly laundered set of coveralls, white cap, white face mask, and clean rubbers or boot covers (canvas or single-service plastic). Prior to donning the above uniform, the procedure is to remove the spray nozzles and pipes as these are normally cleaned with the liquid dryer feed equipment. With clean uniforms, proper brushes, and preferably vacuum cleaning equipmen4 the cleaning personnel enter the main desiccator chamber and start the cleaning process as far upstream as possible from the milk or milk product removal or pneumatic conveyor system: (1) The first portion cleaned is the collector system. This is done by inserting a brush into the cloth tubes and brushing the length of the tube. Again, this can be done more satisfactorily by utilizing the special vacuum tools designed and available for this service (2) Remove the dust covers and brush or vacuum out the nozzle ports. (3) Manually brush or vacuum the ceiling and walls of the drying chamber. (4) Sweep or vacuum clean the floor of the dryer. placing milk or milk product in a container. Note: Do not remove this milk or milk product by way of the milk and milk product removal system. F\u00b78 I A ,, J> e-,, ,j i ~ (5) Inspect the dryer for any inadvertent wet spraying or nozzle drippings that may have occurred during the drying cycle. Should either of these have occurred, the application of a minimum amount of water and effort will be required to remove the clinging material. Any moisture introduced shall be removed before operation begins because of its effect upon smooth milk or milk product flow and because it would establish a more favorable environment for bacterial growth if it were allowed to remain. (6) Check the collector for loose or torn bags and any other mechanical checks necessary before leaving the dryer. (7) Close the dryer securely and check the switches to make sure they are in the proper starting positions. At frequent intervals, not over a two (2) week period, the operator should clean and inspect the heated air intakes of the dryer, assuming that the dryer is properly operated during this time. However, should a malfunction occur where the dryer operator does not follow the procedures outlined for proper shutdown, it may require an inspection and cleaning at closer intervals. Frequent inspection will eliminate a source of sediment contamination . (8) On start up after dry cleaning of the cloth collector dryer, the first two (2) bags of milk or milk product shall be discarded. This will allow for the removal of any milk or milk product remaining in the tubes and system after shutdown . AUXILIAR Y DRY PRODUCT EQUIPMENT 1. Sifters -In general, there are two (2) types of dry product sifters in use by the dry milk industry. These are the shaker type and the rotary or gyrating type. Both are designed to operate at various capacities either manually bagging or packaging from their outlet or designed for automatic packaging equipment. For the general guidance of sifter manufacturers and the dry milk industry, the following screen size openings may be considered as recommended openings to result in satisfactory screening of the listed dry milk product: TABLE13 SIEVE SIZES AND DESIGNATIONS Sieve Designation From The American Society For Testing and Maximum Sieve Openb,g Materials (ATSM) {approxlR18tely) Product International E-11 MM 0.027 Dry Whole/Dry Buttermilk #16 1.19 0.047 It is recognized that larger screen size openings may be necessary for sifting certain special dry milk products, such as \"instant\" products, and for classification of dry milk products into different particle sizes. F-9 I t\\ p p e n d I '< Openings referred to above are based on general experience as to what constitutes satisfactory screening to remove dry milk product lumps or potential dry milk product contamination , and also on the ability of most currently used sifters to successfully sift dry milk products through such size openings, without excessive loss of fine dry milk product into the \"reject material\" outlet. Other factors also affect loss, such as: (a) Percent of \"open area\" in the screen used. (b) Uneven flow rates to the sifter. (c) Ratio of screening surface to dryer capacity. (d) Amount and kind of mechanical energy applied to the screening surface. (e) Sifter design and construction. (f) Nature of dry product being sifted. Screen opening dimensions may be obtained by any desired combination of wire thickness and number of wires per inch. For instance, if the screening surface is made of stainless steel woven wire, the 0.707 mm (0.027 of an inch) opening might be obtained by using 24 X 24 mesh market grade screen cloth made of wire 0.399 mm (0.014 of an inch) thick about 45 percent open area or by using 30 X 30 bolting cloth screen made of wire 0.185 mm (0.0065 of an inch) about 65 percent open area or by many other mesh-wire thickness combinations. These combinations allow a wide choice to obtain a desired balance between screen strength and percent open area. If materials other than stainless steel are used to construct the screening surface, similar combinations may be employed to achieve the desired opening size. Recommenda tions for cleaning dry milk product sifters: a. Dry Cleaning Program -The procedures set forth below should be followed: (1) Completely dismantle and thoroughly vacuum or dry brush-clean all dry milk or milk product-contact surfaces of the dry milk sifter. Reassemble as soon as finished and make every effort to keep all parts dry, (2) Check the sifter screen(s) for broken or displaced wires (threads) and for other openings around the frame of the screen, which might permit the passage of un\u00ad sifted dry milk product. Other parts of the sifter, including ball trays and balls, if used, should also be inspected for condition. Any necessary repair or replacement should be made as soon as possible. (3) Flexible rubber or cloth connectors at the inlet and outlets of the sifter should be thoroughly cleaned daily following the procedures as recommended for the sifter. At this time. connecto rs should be closely examined for holes, cracks. or other damage. F-10 I .\\vu c II LI I Note: To facilitate removal for cleaning, the use of easily removable fastening devices are recommended. ( 4) Thoroughly vacuum or dry brush-clean all external parts of the sifter, including the sifter frame and drive mechanism. b. Wet Cleaning Program -The procedures set forth below should be followed: (1) Completely dismantle as cited in a.(1) above; remove all loose dry milk product; then rinse all parts with clear water; and follow by a thorough hand-brushing of all parts, using a general purpose dairy cleaner. Rinse thoroughly to remove all evidence of cleaning solution or soil. It is recommended that hot water at 7\u00b0C (170\u00b0F) or above be used for rinsing in order to sanitize the equipment and to aid the subsequent drying. (2) Allow all parts to air dry completely prior to reassemb ly. (3) The wet wash should be done as frequently as necessary and should be done after each use if the sifter is not being used on a daily basis. (4) After cleaning, drying, and reassembly , the dry milk product outlet should be protected from contamination. c. General Recomm endations (1) Vacuum cleaning is preferred to brush-cleaning or cleaning with air under pressure as it decreases the dust drift problem to other areas of the milk plant. (2) Brushes or vacuum cleaner fittings used for cleaning dry milk product\u00ad contact surfaces should not be used for cleaning non-dry milk product-contact surfaces or for other uses which might result in contamination. Such brushes and special fitting should be stored in an enclosed cabinet when not in use. For protection and housekeeping considerations , such cabinets preferably should be of non-wood construction and should have open mesh metal shelving. Note: For additional details refer to 3-A Sanitary Standards for Sifters for Dry Milk and Dry Milk Products, Serial 26-##-. 2. Storage/Shipping Bins: The use of portable bins, totes, super sacks, or other portable storage/shipping containers shall comply with the construction requirements of Item 11 p and the cleaning and sanitizing requirements of Item 12p of this these rules. If interior bracing and ladders are used in milk plant storage bins, they shall be constructed of smooth rounded metal and be installed sufficiently far from the walls to prevent harborages . F-11 I A r r, ~ ,, rl 1 , Dry milk product entrance and discharge openings connected to the attending conveying equipment shall be dust-tight and shall be easily accessible for cleaning. Vents to the exterior shall be equipped with readily removable air filters of adequate capacity or readily removable covers. If air is to be introduced into the dry milk product zone, only filtered air shall be used, and it shall comply with the applicable standards of Appendix H. Auxiliary agitators or any other interior devices, if used, shall be designed to be smooth, crevice-free, and readily cleanable. The exterior surface of the bin should be smooth, hard finished, and readily cleanable. Hinges on covers, if used, shall be the take-apart type. Covers or doors shall be provided to enclose the dry milk product zone when dry milk product is not being dumped. These shall be so constructed that dirt or dust on the top will not slide or fall into the bin when the cover is open. Access openings shall be provided on all in-milk plant bins. Such openings should not be less than 45.7 centimeters (18 inches) in its smallest dimension . Covers shall be constructed without raised internal reinforcements and should be hinged and equipped with a quick opening device. The gaskets for such openings shall be made of solid material that is non-toxic , nonabsorbent, smooth, and unaffected by the dry milk product. Storage/shipping bins in continuous use either in the milk plant or in transporting dry milk products from one (1) milk plant to another should be cleaned according to manufacturer's recommendations when necessary . They may be cleaned by either approved dry cleaning methods or wet cleaned. 3. Packaging and Packages -Packaging equipment for dry milk products will vary greatly as to their design depending upon whether the packages being filled are drums, bins or bags. Whatever equipment is used, it should be designed so as to protect the dry milk product from contamination from outside sources and from air during the packaging operation . All connections of conveying equipment to packaging devices should have dust-tight connections. All conveyors, ducts, belts, and screws used in connection with packaging equipment should be provided with a dust collector system, capable of eliminating any visible dust. All dry milk product hoppers, when used, should be provided with covers to properly protect the dry milk product from contamination. Hand-filling should not be permitted except for periods of adjustment of automatic weighing devices. Author: G. M.

G-2 I A r r, ,.. n {I 1 any laboratory phosphatase test is positive, or any doubt arises as to the adequacy of pasteurization due to noncompliance with equipment. or requirements of 420-3-16-.10(16). Criteria -Less than 350 mU/L by an electronic phosphatase procedure . -Fluorophos (Advanced , Alkaline (Charm , Inc.), approved/validated standards and accessories . Methods -The test is based on the detection of the phosphatase enzyme, a constituent that is inactivated by pasteurization at 63\u00b0C (145\u00b0F) for thirty (30) minutes or 72\u00b0C (161 \u00b0F) for fifteen (15) seconds. When pasteurization is faulty, some phosphatase remains and is determined by the electronic detection of fluorescent or chemiluminescent by-products of its action on the approved test system's substrates. Procedure -Refer to the applicable FDA/NCIMS 2400 Forms and M-a-98, latest revision, for the specific milk and/or milk products for which there are approved phosphatase tests available. Corrective Action -Whenever a phosphatase test is positive, the cause shall be determined . Where the cause is improper pasteurization, it shall be corrected and any milk or milk products involved shall not be offered for sale. IV. PHOSPHATASE REACTIVATION IN HTST PASTEURIZED PRODUCTS The presence of an appreciable quantity of phosphatase in milk and cream after heat treatment has been traditionally regarded as evidence of inadequate pasteurization. However, with the advent of modern HTST methods, evidence has been accumulating that under certain conditions , the relationship between inadequate pasteurization and the presence of phosphatase does not hold. A number of investigators who have studied HTST pasteurizing methods have concluded that while a negative test can be obtained immediately after pasteurization , the same sample may yield a positive test after a short period of storage, particularly if the product is not continuously or adequately refrigerated. This phenomenon has come to be known as reactivation . Reactivation may occur in HTST pasteurized products after storage at temperatures as low as 10\u00b0c (50\u00b0F), although 34\u00b0C (93\u00b0F) is optimum. Products of high fat content generally produce relatively more reactivable phosphatase . Reactivation is greatest in products pasteurized at about 110\u00b0C (230\u00b0F), but may occur in products pasteurized at much higher temperatures and as low as 73\u00b0C (163\u00b0F). G-3 I \u00b7 ri n \"'n d It has been noted that an increase in holding time during pasteurization will reduce reactivation. The addition of magnesium acetate to HTST processed milk or cream after pasteurization but before storage accelerates reactivatio n. The difference in activity between an adequately pasteurize d sample, stored with and without magnesium. and an inadequately pasteurized sample. stored with and without magnesiu m, forms the basis of a test for differentiating reactivated from residual, inadequately pasteurized phosphatase. V. DETECTION OF PESTICIDES IN MILK Any health agency that has adopted these rules should operate under a control program that will ensure that milk supplies are free from pesticide contamination in conformance with 420-3-16-.03. Pesticide compounds gain access to milk by various routes, including any of the following: 1. Application to the lactating animals. 2. Inhalation of toxic vapors by the animals, following application to their environment. 3. Ingestion of residues in feed and water. 4. Accidental contamination of milk, feed, and utensils. At the present time, chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides are the chief concern. While there are other pest control compounds that are more toxic than the chlorinated hydrocarbons, many of the agents in this latter group tend to accumulate in the body fat of both lactating animals and human beings, and are secreted in the milk of contaminated lactating animals. The accumulation of these toxic agents in a person continually consuming contaminated milk may reach hazardous concentrations. Advances in residue analysis have resulted in a radical decrease in the use of paper chromatographic screening procedures for milk because of its rather limited sensitivity. Health Officers can now routinely detect residues as low as 0.01 ppm of many of the chlorinated organic pesticides . Satisfactory screening procedures should, therefore, attain this level of sensitivity, which usually necessitates the use of gas chromatograp hy or thin layer chromatography . General screening procedures of the latter two (2) types are described and discussed in Volume 1 of the Pesticide Analytical Manual (PAM) published by FDA. The need for closer scrutiny of milk supplies for pesticide residues has stimulated considerable research in detection technology. The Health Officer entering upon a surveillance program should carefully check the available equipment in relation to its adaptability to the indicated need. While a schedule of testing comparable to that for microorgan isms, four (4) tests of individual producer's milk during any consecutive six (6) months would be desirable, broad-spectrum G-4 I \u00b7 r, ~ e n a 1 procedures are too time consuming to render such a schedule feasible. As a more practical approach, the following procedure is suggested : 1. Test one (1) load of milk from each milk tank truck route every six (6) months by a broad spectrum method and trace positive samples; or 2. Test each producer's milk four (4) times every six (6) months for the most common chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides by available instrumental methodology . Note: Where Procedure 1 is used, samples of commingled milk from known sources are drawn from receiving station storage tanks. Sampling for Procedure 2 may be done directly from the weigh tank. VI. DETECTION OF DRUG RESIDUES IN MILK The problem of drug residues in milk is associated with their use in the treatment of mastitis and other diseases. Failure to withhold milk from the market for a sufficient length of time after treatment may result in the presence of drug residues in milk. Such milk is undesirable for two (2) reasons: 1. It comes from an unhealthy lactating animal. 2. It is adulterated . The allergenic properties of certain drugs in common use make their presence in milk potentially hazardous to consumers . Also, substantia l losses of by products may be sustained by the milk industry each year because of the inhibitory effects of drug residues on the culturing process. Drug residues shall be tested for, using tests provided for in 420-3-16- .07. These tests are specified in memoranda from the FDA (refer to the latest revision of M-a-85 for the approved drug tests, the FDA/NCIMS 2400 Forms for each specific test method and M-a-98, latest revision, for the specific milk and/or milk products for which there are approved drug tests available) . VII. ANALYSIS OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS FOR VITAMIN A ANO D CONTENT Reference -Rule 420-3-16-.07 Frequency -Annually for each product type, or when any doubt arises as to the adequacy of vitamin fortification (refer to Appendix 0). Methods -Vitamin testing shall be performed using test methods acceptable to the FDA and other official methodologies that give statistically equivalent results to the FDA methods (refer to M-a-98, latest revision, for the specific milk and/or milk products that have FDA validated and NCIMS accepted test methods for vitamins} .

HIGH TEMPERATURE/S HORT HTST PASTEURIZATION SYSTEMS HTST pasteurization is important to the dairy industry because of the operating efficiencies that it affords. Properly operated, these units allow a high volume of production in a minimum of processing space. The ability of HTST pasteurizers to assure a safe, finished milk and/or milk product hinges on the reliability of the time-temperature-pressure relationships that must prevail whenever the system is in operation. It is important that the milk plant operator understand the HTST process in order to maintain proper surveillance over the equipment. The basic flow pattern is described below: 1. Cold raw milk or milk product in a constant-level supply tank is drawn into the regenerator section of the HTST pasteurizer. Note: Some operators prefer to bypass the regenerator when starting. Under this system, cold milk is drawn directly through the timing pump, step 3, and into the heater section. The remaining steps are performed without exception. This bypass arrangement facilitates and speeds up the -starting operation . After forward\u00ad flow has been established at the FDD, the bypass, which may be manually or automatically controlled , is not used and the raw milk or milk product flows through the regenerator. A second start-up technique involves the use of sanitizing solution at 77\u00b0C (170\u00b0F). This is passed through the complete unit and followed immediately by milk or mllk product. Dilution of the first milk or milk product does occur; however, care shall be taken to prevent this from being packaged . 2. In the regenerator section, the cold raw milk or milk product is warmed by hot pasteurized milk or milk product flowing in a counter current direction on the opposite sides of thin stainless steel surfaces. 3. The raw milk or milk product still under suction passes through a positive-displacement-timing pump that delivers it under pressure through the rest of the HTST pasteurization system. 4. The raw milk or milk product is pumped through the heater section where hot water or steam on opposite sides of thin stainless steel surfaces heats the milk or milk product to a temperature of at 72\u00b0C (161 \u00b0F). 5. The milk or milk product at pasteurization temperature and under pressure flows through the holding tube where it is held for at least fifteen ( 15) seconds. The maximum velocity of the milk or milk product through the holding tube is governed by the speed of the timing pump, the diameter and length of the holding tube, and surface friction. H-1 I .!I p c '.! II I i 6. After passing the sensing bulbs of the indicating thermometer and recorder/controller , the milk or milk product passes into the FDD which automatically assumes a forward-flow position if the milk or milk product passes the recorder/controller bulb at the preset cut-in temperature , i.e., 72\u00b0C (161\u00b0F). 7. Improperly heated milk or milk product flows through the diverted-flow line back to the constant-leve l tank. 8. Properly heated milk or milk product flows through the forward-flow line to the pasteurized milk or milk product regenerator section where it serves to warn, the cold raw milk or milk product and, in turn, is cooled. 9. The warm milk or milk product passes through the cooling section where coolant on the sides of thin stainless steel surfaces opposite the pasteurized mllk or milk product reduces its temperature to 4.5\u00b0C (40\u00b0F) and below. 10. The cold pasteurized milk or milk product then passes to a storage tank or vat to await packaging. HTST PASTEUR IZERS EMPLOYING MILK OR MILK PRODUCT-TO-MILK OR MILK PRODUCT REGENERATORS WITH BOTH SIDES CLOSED TO THE ATMOSPHERE Rule 420-3-16- .10(16) establishes standards for regenerators. These standards ensure that the raw milk or milk product will always be under less pressure than pasteurized milk or milk product in order to prevent contamination of the pasteurized milk or milk product in the event flaws should develop in the metal or joints separating it from the raw milk or milk product. An explanation of regenerator specifications is given below. During normal operation , i.e., while the timing pump is operating, raw milk or milk product will be drawn through the regenerator at sub-atmospheric pressure. The pasteurized milk or milk product In the milk, or milk product-to-milk or milk product regenerator will be above atmospheric pressure. The required pressure differential will be assured when there is no flow-promoting device downstream from the pasteurized milk or milk product side of the regenerator to draw the pasteurized milk or milk product through the regenerator , and the pasteurized milk or milk product downstream from the regenerator rises to at least 30.5 centimeters (twelve [12] inches) elevation above the highest raw milk or milk product level downstream from the constant-level tank, and is open to the atmosphere at this or a higher elevation, as required in Item 16p(C), 420- 3-16-.10( 16)(iv) ( refer to Administrative Procedures 2). During a shutdown , i.e., when the timing pump stops, the raw milk or milk product in the regenerator will be retained under suction, except this suction may be gradually relieved by possible entrance of air drawn through the regenerator plate gaskets from the higher outside atmospheric pressure. With a free draining regenerator as required under Item 16p(C), Administrative Procedures 8, the raw milk or milk product level in the regenerator may drop slowly depending on the tightness of the gaskets ultimately falling below the level of the plates to the milk or milk product H-2 I \u00b7\\ p p '! n d 1 \\\" level in the constant-level tank. However, under these conditions , as long as any raw milk or milk product remains in the regenerator , it will be at sub-atmospheric pressure. During shutdown, the pasteurized milk or milk product in the regenerator is maintained at atmospher ic pressure or above by meeting the elevation requirement of Item 16p(C), (refer to Administrative Procedures 2). Pressure greater than atmosphe ric is maintained when the level of pasteurized milk or milk product is at or above the required elevation and loss of pressure due to suction is prevented by prohibiting a downstream pump. Any backflow of milk or milk product through the FOO would lower the pasteurized milk or milk product level during pump shutdowns thus tending to reduce the pressure on the pasteurized milk or milk product side of the regenerator. An FDD cannot be relied upon to prevent backflow in such instances because during the first few minutes following a pump shutdown , the milk or milk product is still at a sufficiently high temperatu re to keep the FDD in the forward flow position. Compliance with the provisions of Item 16p(C), Administrat ive Procedures 2 and 3; however, will ensure a proper pressure differential in the regenerator . At the beginning of a run, from the time raw milk or milk product or water is drawn through the regenerator until the pasteurized milk or milk product or water has risen to the elevation specified in Item 16p(C), Administrative Procedures 2, the pasteurized milk or milk product side of the regenerator is at atmospheric pressure or higher. Even if the timtng pump should stop during this period, the pressure on the pasteurized milk or milk product side of the regenerator will be greater than the sub\u00ad atmospheric pressure on the raw milk or milk product side. This will be assured by compliance with Item 16p(C), Administrative Procedures 2 and 3, as long as any raw milk or milk product remains in the regenerator. When a raw milk or milk product booster pump is incorporated into the HTST pasteurization system, Item 16p(C), Administrative Procedures 5 requires. in part, that automatic means shall be provided to assure, at all times, the required pressure differential between raw and pasteurized milk or milk product in the regenerator before the booster pump can operate. THE USE OF SEPARA TORS WITHIN HTST SYSTEMS Separators in HTST pasteuriza tion systems shall be installed and operated in such a manner that they will not adversely affect the regenerator pressures, create a negative pressure on the FDD during operation, or cause milk or milk product flow through the holding tube during times when such flowwould compromise a required public health safe guard. 1. A separator may be located between the outlet of a raw regenerator and the timing pump or between raw regenerator sections if the separator is automatically valved-out of the system, and separator stuffing pump(s) are de-energized , when: a. The timing pump is not in operation ; or H-3 I A fl p e \" d I ' b. A dual stem FDD is in the inspect position; or c. In a system with a dual stem FDD in which the separator is located between sections of a raw regenerator, during the first ten (10) minutes of a required ten (10) minute time delay in CIP mode and during any period of diverted-flow; or d. The pressures in any raw regenerator sections located after the separator are out of compliance with the pressure requirements of these rules. Note: The second section of a split raw regenerator shall automatically drain freely to the constant-level tank or to the floor In the event of a shut down. 2. A separator may not be located between the timing pump and the FDO. 3. A separator may be located on the pasteurized side of the FOO if: a. A properly installed atmospheric break Is located between the FOO and the inlet of the separator . b. All milk or milk product rises to at least 30.5 centimeters (twelve [12] inches) higher than the highest raw milk or milk product in the system and is open to the atmosphere at some point between the outlet of the separator and the inlet of any pasteurized side regenerator. c. All milk or milk product rises to at least 30.5 centimeters (twelve [12] inches) higher than the highest raw milk or milk product in the system and is open to the atmosphere at some point between the outlet of any pasteurized side regenerator and the inlet of a separator. d. The separator is automatically valved-out of the system, and the separator stuffing pump is de-energized. (1) When a dual stem FOO is in the first ten (10) minutes of a required ten (10) minute delay in CIP mode. (2) When the FDO is diverted in product or inspect mode. (3) When the timing pump is not in operation. (4) When the temperature is below the required pasteurization temperature and the FOO is not in the fully diverted-position . 4. The following criteria apply to installations where a separator shall be valved-out: a. A valve shall be located to isolate the product supply line from the separator . b. A valve shall be located to prevent all flow exiting the separator from being returned to the pasteurization system downstream of the separator . H-4 I /\\ p n e \" LI 1 ,.. c. The valves are required to move in order to accomplish the two (2) criteria listed above and shall move to the valved-out position, and any separator stuffing pumps shall be de-energized upon loss of air or power. 5. The following criteria applies to installations where a separator is located on the raw side of a HTST system and a cream or skim balance tank(s) is not being utilized for the collection of either the cream or skim that exits the HTST system: a. A fail-safe (spring-to-close upon loss of air or power), block-and-bleed valve or valve arrangement shall be installed on the cream or skim line downstream from the separator and prior to any pump(s) or cream or skim storage tank(s), and shall be at least 30.5 centimeters (12 inches) below the required opening to the atmosphere on the pasteurized side of the HTST regenerator . This fail-safe valve or valve arrangement shall be closed whenever the separator is required to be automatically valved-out of the system and the separator stuffer pump is de\u00ad energized. b. If a computer or programmable controller is used to provide any of these required functions, it shall comply with the applicable Section(s) of Appendix H, VI. c. If not installed in compliance with a. and b. above, the height of the cream or skim storage tank shall be considered when determining the highest raw product in the HTST system. THE USE OF LIQUID INGREDIENT INJECTION WITHIN HTST SYSTEMS Milk or milk product flavoring slurries, condensed milk or milk products, and cream or skim milk for standardization and similar ingredients may be injected at a point after the last regenerator and before the timing pump, if all of the following conditions are met: 1. The slurry injection valve(s) is (are) closed and the slurry pump is de- energized : a. When the FDD is in the \"Inspect'' mode. b. When the timing pump is not in operation . c. When the temperature is below the required minimum legal pasteurization temperature and the FDD is not in the fully diverted position. Note: The slurry pump may remain energized provided: (1) A spring-to-close and air-to-open blocking valve is located between the slurry injection pump and the slurry injection valve(s) described in 2 below. (2) All valves shall be inter-wired to assure they fully isolate the slurry pump from the pasteurization system when the FOO is not in the forward-flow H-5 I .., n 11 c ,, o , \u00b7 position or whenever any flow-promoting device(s) which is (are) upstream of the FOO and (are) capable of generating flow through the FOO is (are) not in operation. 2. The slurry injection valve(s) is (are) of the fail-safe type, spring-to-close and air-to-open, and are \"block-and-bleed\" design with a full port open to the atmosphere between the HTST isolation seat and the slurry pump when slurry Is not being injected. 3. The slurry piping between the slurry pump and the injection point may rise to a height that is higher than the overflow level of the slurry supply tank(s), but is at least 30.5 centimete rs (twelve [12) inches) Jower than the required opening to the atmosphere on the pasteurized side. 4. The slurry supply tank has an overflow that is at least twice the diameter of the largest inlet pipe, or all inlet pipes are disconnected and the openings capped during operation of the slurry pump. 5. There is a check-valve in the flow stream of the milk or milk product line from the last regenerator,. typically after the separator, upstream of the injection point valve. 6. For a milk or milk product flavoring slurry that contains milk and/or milk products, the tanks and/or vessels used to blend and hold the slurry shall be completely emptied and cleaned after each four ( 4) hours of operation or less, unless the slurry is stored at a temperature of 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F) or less, or at a temperature of 66\u00b0C (150\u00b0F) or greater, and maintained thereat until the time of injection. 7. If computers or programmable controllers are used to provide any of these required functions, they shall meet the applicable portion of Appendix H, VI. 8. Appropriate test procedures shall be provided to evaluate the required inter- wiring and function. Note: This section describes one (1) method that has been reviewed and accepted for this purpose. It does not preclude other methods that may be reviewed and found acceptable_ In order to help assure compliance with Section 2-Adulteration , the Health Officer may require that the milk plant close the slurry valve and de-energize the slurry pump during times when the system ls recycling milk or milk product, such as in recycle mode, diverted-flow , or the first ten (10) minutes of the CIP cycle. If a computer is used to accomplish this, it does not need to meet Appendix H and VI. PRESSURE RELIEF VALVES LOCATED DOWNSTREAM FROM THE HOLDING TUBE WITHIN HTST PASTEURIZATION SYSTEMS The pressures in the pasteurized side of the regenerator shall be protected from falling within 6.9 kPa (1 psi) of the pressures in the raw side of the regenerator at all times, including during shut down. A pressure relief valve on the pasteurized side of the H-6 I ; p p E fl n I x FOO will meet this criterion if the pressure relief valve is fail-safe. A leaking pressure relief valve can cause an unacceptable loss of pressure in the pasteurized side of the regenerator during a shut down and is considered a violation of Item 16p(C) 420-3-16- .10(19). Any leakage from this pressure relief valve shall be readily visible. This may be accomplished by opening the pressure relief valve vent directly to the floor or by providing sanitary piping from the pressure relief valve vent to the constant-level tank. If the latter option is utilized, the piping shall be properly sloped to assure drainage to the constant-level tank and shall be provided with a properly located and installed sight-glass. POSITION DETECTION DEVICES Where the position detectability of FOOs and valve seats is required this may be accomplished by mechanical or electronic means, such as mechanical limit switches (micro-switches) or electronic proximity switches. These switches shall be capable of providing an electrical signal when the valve seat is in the fully closed position, provided further that the position detection capability is fully testable. Position detection devices (PODs) shall be repeatable and capable of detecting valve seat movement of less than 3.18 mm ( 1 /8 [O .125] of an inch) at all times. MAGNETIC FLOW METER BASED TIMING SYSTEMS WITHIN CONTINUOUS FLOW PASTEURIZATION SYSTEMS Many pasteurization systems use magnetic flow meter based timing systems (MFMBTS). The flow through these timing systems is developed by a combination of flow promoting devices including booster and stuffer pumps, separators and clarifiers, homogenizers , and positive displacement pumps. Item 16p.(B)2(f), Section 7 provides for their use, provided they meet the following specifications for design, installation, and use. Components -MFMBTS shall consist of the following components : 1. A magnetic flow meter which has been reviewed by FDA or one (1) which meets the following criteria for accuracy and reliability: a. Self-diagnostic circuitry that provides constant monitoring of all sensing, input. and conditioning circuits. The diagnostic circuitry shall be capable of detecting \"open\" circuits, 11short'' circuits. poor connections. and faulty components. Upon the detection of a failure of any component , the magnetic flow meter read-out shall be blank or become unreadable. b. The electro-magnetic compatibility of the magnetic flow meter shall be documented and available to the Health Officer. The magnetic flow meter shall be tested to determine the effects of electrostatic discharge, power fluctuation. conductive emission and susceptibility , and radiative emission and susceptibility . H-7 I :. pp e-11 I , c. The effect of exposure to specific environmental conditions shall be documented. The magnetic flow meter shall be tested to determine the effects of low and high temperatures , thermal shock, humidity, physical shock, and salt fog. d. The magnetic flow meter converter or transmitter and flow sensor, for those magnetic flow meters in which flow sensor sealing is required, shall be constructed so that they can be sealed by the Health Officer. e. The calibration of the magnetic flow meter shall be protected against unauthorized changes. f. The magnetic flow meter shall be protected against unauthorized converter or transmitter replacement. If flow tubes are replaced, the Health Officer shall be notified and such replacement shall be regarded as a replacement of the magnetic flow meter and subject to the Health Officer's inspection and all applicable tests under Appendix I. g. The flow tube shall be encased in appropriate material and constructed in such a manner that the final assembly complies with the conditions cited within Item 11 p 420-3-16-.10(11 ). Calibration -The calibration shall be based on multiple points for the entire range of the magnetic flow meter for MFMBTS application. The magnetic flow meter shall be tested against a traceable National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard. The procedure(s) used for the magnetic flow meter calibration is documented and available to the Health Officer. Accuracy -At mid-range, six (6) consecutive flow measurements are taken at the same flow setting. From these six (6) measurements , the standard deviation is calculated . The standard deviation for these measurements shall be less than 0.5 percent. Compliance of the magnetic flow meter would be determined through the actual installation field-testing of the magnetic flow meter. 2. Suitable converters for conversion of electric and/or air signals to the proper mode for the operation of the system. 3. A suitable flow recorder capable of recording flow at the flow alarm set point and also at least nineteen (19) liters (five [5] gallons) per minute higher than the flow alarm setting. The flow recorder shall have an event pen that shall indicate the status of the flow alarm with respect to flow rate. 4. A flow alarm, with an adjustable set point shall be installed within the system which shall automatically cause the FDD to be moved to the divert position whenever excessive flow rate causes the milk or milk product holding time to be less than the legal holding time for the pasteurization process being used. The flow alarm shall be tested by the Health Officer in accordance with the procedures of Appendix I, Test 11, 2.A and 8 at the frequency specified. The flow alarm adjustment shall be sealed. H-8 I A n P \"' n r. 1 ~ Note: Test 11, 2.A is not applicable to HHST pasteurization systems. 5. A low-flow or loss-of-signal alarm shall be installed with the system, which shall automatically cause the FDD to be moved to the divert position whenever there is a low-flow or loss-of-signal from the magnetic flow meter. The low-flow or loss-of-signal provision shall be tested by the Health Officer In accordance with Appendix I, Test 11, 2.C at the frequency specified. The low-flow or loss-of-signal provision shall be sealed. 6. For HTST systems, when the legal flow rate has been reestablished following an excessive flow rate, a time delay shall be instituted which shall prevent the FOO from assuming the forward-flow position for at least a minimum of fifteen ( 15) or twenty-five (25) seconds depending upon the product being pasteurized and the temperature being utilized. The time delay shall be tested and sealed by the Health Officer, For HHST systems, when the legal holding time has been reestablished following an excessive flow rate, a time delay at least as long as the legal flow rate shall be instituted which shall prevent the FDD from assuming the forward-flow position until at least the legal holding time within the holding tube has been reestablished. This time delay shall be built into the sequencelogic that requires all conditions for legal pasteurization to be satisfied and that legal pasteurization temperature exists from the holding tube to the FOO, before the FOO can assume the forward-flow position. 7. For HTST systems, a sanitary check valve or normally closed automatically controlled sanitary valve shall be installed with the magnetic flow meter to prevent a positive pressure in the raw milk or milk product side of the regenerator whenever a power failure, shutdown, or flow-diversion occurs. Note: This provision is not applicable to HHST pasteurization systems. 8. For HTST systems, when a regenerator is used with large systems, it will be necessary to bypass the regenerator during start-up and when the FOO is in the diverted-flow position. Care shall be taken in the design of such bypass systems to assure that a dead-end does not exist. A dead-end could allow milk or milk product to remain at ambient temperature for long periods of time and allow bacterial growth in the milk or milk product. Caution shall also be observed with such bypass systems and any valves used in them so that raw milk or milk product will not be trapped under pressure in the raw regenerator plates and not have free drainage back to the constant-level tank when shutdown occurs. Note: This provision is not applicable to HHST pasteurization systems. 9. When switching to the \"CIP\" position, the FOO shall move to the divert position and shall remain in the diverted-flow position for at least ten (10) minutes, regardless of temperature, and for HTST pasteurizat ion systems, the booster pump cannot run during this ten ( 10) minute time delay. H-9 I \"' I' P f ,, ti i r. 10. All MFMBTS pasteurization systems shall be designed, installed, and operated so that all applicable tests required by 420-3-16-.10(21 ), Item 16p(D) can be performed by the Health Officer, at the frequency specified (refer to Appendix I). Where adjustment or changes can be made to these devices or controls, appropriate seals shall be applied by the Health Officer after testing so that changes cannot be made without detection. 11. Except for those requirements directly related to the physical presence of the timing pump, all other requirements of the most recent edition of these rules are applicable. Placement of Components -Individual components in an MFMBTS shall comply with the following placement conditions: 1. The timing system's flow promoting device(s) shall be located upstream from the magnetic flow meter. 2. The magnetic flow meter shall be placed after the last raw product regenerator outlet and upstream of the holding tube. There shall be no intervening flow\u00ad promoting components between the magnetic flow meter and the holding tube. 3. For HTST pasteurization systems, when a sanitary check valve or normally closed automatically controlled sanitary valve, as described in #7 above, is used with a variable or constant speed flow promoting device, it shall be located downstream of the last regenerator outlet and upstream of the holding tube. Note: This provision is not applicable to HHST pasteurization systems. 4. All flow-promoting devices which are upstream of the FDD and which are capable of generating flow through the FOO, shall be properly interwired with the FDD so that they may run and produce flow through the system at sub-legal temperatures only when the FDD is in the fully diverted position and in \"Product\" run mode, or \"CIP\" mode after the ten (10) minute time delay has timed out. Such flow promoting devices shall be de-energized in \"Inspect\" mode. Separators or clarifiers that continue to run after they are de-energized shall be automatically valved-out of the system with fail-safe valves so that they are incapable of producing flow. 5. There shall not be any product entering or leaving the pasteurization system, i.e., cream or skim milk from a separator or other product components , between the magnetic flow meter and the holding tube. 6. The magnetic flow meter shall be so installed that the milk or milk product has contact with both electrodes at all times when there is flow through the system. This is most easily accomplished by mounting the flow tube of the magnetic flow meter in a vertical position with the direction of flow from the bottom to the top. However, horizontal mounting is acceptable when other precautions are taken to assure that both electrodes are in contact with the product and the horizontal line H-10 I ~ r p c: n o , .,. shall remain full of liquid during operation. Magnetic flow meters shall not be mounted on a horizontal line that may be only partially full and thereby trap air. 7. The magnetic flow meter shall be piped in such a manner that at least ten (10) pipe diameters of straight pipe exists, upstream and downstream from the center of the magnetic flow meter, before any elbow or change of direction takes place. Except that other piping configurations upstream and downstream of the magnetic flow meter may also be used If they have been reviewed and found acceptable to FDA and the Health Officer. THE USE OF VACUUM BREAKERS ON HTST SYSTEMS Vacuum breakers are often used on HTST pasteurization systems to help maintain proper pressure relationships in milk-to-milk regenerator sections, or to prevent a negative pressure between the FOO and any downstream flow-promoting device. The use of vacuum breakers on HTST pasteurization systems is allowed provided the following conditions are met: 1. Vacuum breakers shall open to the atmosphere when subject to a negative pressure. 2. The pasteurized milk and milk product between its outlet from the regenerator and the nearest point downstream open to the atmosphere shall rise to a vertical elevation of 30.5 centimeters (12 inches) above the highest raw milk or milk product level, downstream from the constant-level tank, and shall be open to the atmosphere at this or a higher elevation. Spring-to-close vacuum breakers are not allowed.

Moisture Removal Equipment -Air under pressure systems in excess of one ( 1) bar, i.e., 103.5 kPa ( 1 Spsi), shall be provided with methods of moisture removal. The removal of moisture may be achieved by condensatio n and coalescing filtration or absorption, or equivalent, to prevent free water in the system. If it is necessary to cool the compressed air, an after-cooler shall be installed between the compressor and the air storage tank for the purpose of removing moisture from the compressed air. Filters and Moisture Traps -Filters shall be constructed so as to assure effective passage of air through the filter media only. The coalescing filter and associated traps shall be located in the air pipeline downstream from the compressing equipment, and from the air tank, if one is used. The filter shall be readily accessible for examination, cleaning, and for replacing the filter media. The moisture trap shall be equipped with a petcock or other means for draining accumulated water (refer to Figures 44, 45, and 48). When coalescing filters are used, a means shall be provided to measure the differential pressure across the filter. The differentia l pressure device is required to indicate the need for filter media replacement. All coalescing filter housings shall be provided with a means of removing the condensed liquid from the filtration device. This can be accomplished by an automatic or manual drain installed on the base of the filter housing. The final filter media shall be disposable. The filter media shall be located in the air line upstream from, and as close as possible to, the point of application (refer to Figures 44, 45 and 48). Except that a final filter shall not be required where the compressing equipment is of a fan or blower type and operating at a pressure of less than one (1) bar, i.e., 103.5 kPa (15psi) (refer to Figures 46 and 47). Electronic air cleaners utilizing electrostatic precipitation principles to collect particulate matter may be used. Disposable filter media shall not be cleaned and reused Air Piping -The air piping from the compressing equipment to the filter and moisture trap shall be readily drainable. A milk or milk product check-valve of sanitary design shall be installed in the air piping downstream from the disposable media filter to prevent backf)ow of milk or milk product into the air pipeline, except that a check-valve shall not be required if the air piping enters the milk or milk product zone from a point higher than the milk or milk product overflow level which is open to the atmosphere or is for dry product applications or for other dry application where liquids are not present. When a check-valve is not required, plastic or rubber or rubber-like tubing and suitable compatible fittings and connections made of plastic or stainless steel may be used between the final filter and the point of application. H-21 I '\u00b7 J;, 1),? f ,1 I , Air distribution piping and fittings after the final filter shall be of corrosion-resistant materials. Air distribution piping. fittings, and gaskets between the discharge of the sanitary check-valve to the processing equipment shall be sanitary piping that conforms to the requiremen ts of Item 10p, Rule 420-3-16- .10(10), except that: When air under pressure is directed at product-contact surfaces of containers, closures, and supplementary fitments, the air passage from the final filter to the point of application shall be made of a non-toxic, relatively nonabsorbent material. In this application , check-valves are not required. The final filter shall be located as close as practical to the point of application (refer to Figure 48). When used for air agitation, tubing used to introduce air into the product and/or product zone shall be sanitary piping that conforms to the requirements of Item 10p, Rule 420-3-16-.10(10). There shall be no threads on product-contact surfaces. When drilled or perforated pipe is used, internal drilling burrs shall be removed and the orifices shall be chambered on the outer surface of the pipe. If the volume of the air from the compressing equipment is in excess of that required for satisfactory agitation, suitable means shall be employed to eliminate the excess volume.

CULINARY STEAM -MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS The following methods and procedures will provide steam of culinary quality for use in the processing of milk and milk products. SOURCE OF BOILER FEED WATER Potable water or water supplies acceptable to the Health Officer shall be used. FEED WATER TREATMENT Feed water may be treated, if necessary , for proper boiler care and operation . Boiler feed water treatment and control shall be under the supervision of trained personnel or a firm specializing in industrial water conditioning . Such personnel shall be informed that the steam is to be used for culinary purposes. Pretreatment of feed waters for boilers or steam generating systems to reduce water hardness before entering the boiler or steam generator by ion exchange or other acceptable procedures is preferable to the addition of conditioning compounds to boiler waters. Only compounds complying with 21 CFR 173.310 may be used to prevent corrosion and scale in boilers or to facilitate sludge removal. Greater amounts shall not be used of the boiler water treatment compounds than the minimum necessary for controlling boiler scale or other boiler water treatment purposes . No greater amount of steam shall be used for the treatment and/or pasteurization of milk and milk products than necessary . It should be noted that tannin, which is also frequently added to boiler water to facilitate sludge removal during boiler blow-down , has been reported to give rise to odor problems and should be used with caution. Boiler compounds containing cyclohexylmine , morpholine, octadecylamine , diethylamino-ethanol, trisodium nitrilotriacetae, and hydrazine shall not be permitted for use in steam in contact with milk and milk products. BOILER OPERATION A supply of clean. dry saturated steam is necessary for proper equipment operation. Boilers and steam generation equipment shall be operated in such a manner as to prevent foaming, priming, carryover, and excessive entrainment of boiler water into the steam. Carryover of boiler water additives can result fn the production of milk or milk product off-flavors . Manufacturers' instructions regarding recommended water level and blow-down should be consulted and rigorously followed. The blow\u00ad down of the boiler should be carefully watched so that an over-concentration of the boiler water solids and foaming is avoided. It is recommended that periodic analyses be made of condensate samples. Such samples should be taken from the line between the final steam separating equipment and the point of the introduction of steam into the milk or milk product. H-27 I -\u00b5 ,, e o I , ,.

Chart Speed -Circular charts shall make one (1) revolution in not more than twenty-four (24) hours. Strip charts shall not move slower than 25mm (1 inch) per hour. More than one (1) record of the cleaning operation shall not overlap on the same section of the chart for either circular or strip-type charts. V. CRITERIA FOR THE EVALUATION OF ELECTRONIC DATA COLLECTION , STORAGE, AND REPORTING BACKGROUND Electronically collecting data storing data and reporting information with computers can be a beneficial replacement for circular chart recorders and/or hand- H-42 I A ft p e ,1 cl i ' written records. This method of presenting Grade \"A\" PMO required information should essentially replace and duplicate the purpose and functionality of their manual or chart recorder counterparts . These would include GIP records, pasteurization records, raw and heat-treated product storage tank's temperature and cleaning requirements , and temperature monitors for membrane filtration. This criteria for the evaluation addresses the difference between manual records or chart recorders and electronic or computer record keeping. These differences are identified in the criteria below that address the verification of system reliability, security and dependability, and what information is available and accurate for assuring public health safety and inspection. Following are some of the differences between manual records and chart recorders as compared to electronically collecting data. storing data, and reporting information using computers: 1 . Manual Records and Chart Recorders are Visual in Nature -Milk plant employees and regulatory personnel can see and physically hold the records and place them in files for safe keeping. Whereas computerized data collection systems are not so, they need to have methods in place to assure that the information is reliably placed and safe. 2. Manual Records and Chart Recorders are Physical in Nature -Milk plant employees and regulatory personnel can physically record on and actually sign the records and; therefore, become responsible for the required public health activity. Also, the quality assurance manager is typically responsible for the integrity of the stored records. Whereas, computerized data collection and reporting systems need to collect the identity of the person performing the function and they also need to have someone at each milk plant responsible for the integrity of the stored records. 3. Manual Records and Chart Recorders are Typically Hard Wired Directly to Dedicated Instrumentation -Very little complexity exists between the sensor, such as a temperatu re or flow sensor, and the final recording device. This allows routine maintenance and compliance monitoring and inspection of manual records and chart recorders to be relatively simple. Whereas the computerized data collection, storage, and reporting systems need to have documented procedures in place to assure that system changes, upgrades , and normal operating procedures do not compromise the integrity of the public health safety information and reports. CRITERIA -The following criteria are to be used for the evaluation of electronic collection, storage, and recording or reporting of any information required within Items 12p and 16p(D), Rules 420-3-16-.10(12) and 420-3-16-.10(21). Note: These criteria do not address computer instrumentation or tJie electronic control of pasteurization for public health safety. All computer-generated records and reports shall contain the information required in these rules that is applicable. The computerized data collection, storage, and reporting system shall have an assigned and identified representative from the milk H-43 I I), r, o ~ n 11 , , plant that is responsible for the system. This person's name shall be available to the Health Officer and the FDA. 1. Any computer required in the making of a public health safety report, including data collection computers , data storage computers , or report servers shall be powered with an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) capable of maintaining power to the computerized data collection , storage, and reporting system for twenty (20) minutes. 2. A written user's guide of the computerized data collection, storage and reporting system shall be provided and will explain the system's architecture, the software used, and the sensors or instruments monitored , This overview may be presented in text or in a graphical representat ion. A copy of this overview shall be maintained at the discretion of the Health Officer. This document shall bear the name of the identified representative from the milk plant assigned to administrate this procedure and be available for review at the milk plant by the Health Officer and the FDA. This documentation shall explain: a. System's architecture , the software used, and the sensors or instruments monitored . b. Reporting interface of the computerized data collection , storage, and reporting system. c. Backup procedure for ensuring the safe storage of the public health safety data of all reports. d. Procedure for any changes or maintenance to the instrumentation , sensors, hardware, or computers. This procedure will explain how the plant will ensure that when a physical change occurs, the information affected has been checked for accuracy. e. Listing and explanation of the reports available on the system, instructions on how to access the reports, and examples of each report with a description of their content. 3. A written record shall be maintained by the milk plant identifying any changes or updates to the computerized data collection, storage and reporting system. software, drivers, networking , or servers in order to assure the collection, storage, or reporting of any data needed for compliance has not been compromised. This document shall bear the name of the representative from the milk plant assigned to administer this procedure and be available for review at the milk plant by the Health Officer and the FDA. 4. In the case of CIP and raw and heat-treated storage tank records, data shall be stored at a rate to provide a reasonable account of the process being recorded. This shall never exceed a maximum of fifteen (15) minutes between data records. The data for the reporting system shall be backed up at least once every twenty-four (24) H-44 I A. 1 r. e n Ii i hours. Alternatively , the final reports may be stored and backed up at least once every twenty-four (24) hours. 5. In the case of pasteurization records, data shall be stored no less than every five (5) seconds for each required variable. Any event required to be recorded in manual reporting, such as a divert condition, shall be recorded no matter how short the duration. Provisions shall be made to allow operators to report additional events electronically, such as a record of unusual occurrences. The data for the reporting system shall be backed up at least once every twenty-four (24) hours. Alternatively , the final reports may be stored and backed up at least once every twenty-four (24) hours. 6. Upon the initial installation , computer generated reports shall be verified visually for accuracy for seven (7) consecutive days and be found to be accurate and error free in actual service in the milk plant where installed. These seven (7) days of reports shall be printed out and shall bear the signature of both the vendor of the system and the identified representative from the milk plant, or they shall be accompanied by a cover letter signed by the vendor and the identified representative from the milk plant. If the milk plant develops the computerized data collection, storage, and reporting system, the programmer and the identified representative from the milk plant shall be two (2) different individuals. This seven (7) day report verification period shall only be required at initial installation and one (1) time only whenever a chart recorder and/or hand-written record is being replaced by electronic data collection , storage, and reporting . These seven (7) days of reports shall be kept on file at the milk plant and a copy shall be provided to the Health Officer when requested . 7. Whenever changes, updates, or observed anomalies that affect the reliability or accuracy of the reporting system occur following the initial installation of the system, these changes, updates, or observed anomalies shall be evaluated and investigated and if corrections are warranted shall be addressed. The records of each evaluation and corrections made shall bear the signature of the vendor or the identified representative from the milk plant. The records shall be maintained and be available for the Health Officer when requested . 8. The electronic computerized data collection , storage, and reporting system shall provide for any signatures or initials required by these rules. Acceptable operator signatures or initials captured electronically may be any combination of alpha and/or numeric characters that identify the individual performing the test or operation. Input of this signature or initials may be done by any means, including but not limited to, a biometric reader, a card or radio frequency device, or by simple direct entry that provides a unique identifier directly associated with a specific person. Input of this signature or initials shall occur each time it is required by these rules. Except, that in the case of pasteurization records, the operator's signature or initials shall occur whenever an operator changes and at a minimum frequency of once every twenty-four (24) hours. H-45 I r'I I r, ~ fi 1 , 9. The data supporting electronic reports shall be stored in a database or data archival system in a Write Once, Read Many (WORM). 10. The system shall provide an anomalies report indicating any system or communication failure that could have affected the validity of the required reports. This anomalies report shall be automatically attached to any report that may have been affected by the system anomaly. A separate error log or system log shall not suffice for meeting this requirement, since any anomaly requires an evaluation and investigation to correlate the anomaly. Note: While electronic and computerized systems can furnish a wide range of process validation and anomaly reporting, these criteria only require appended reporting of data loss that affects the reports that are required to comply with this Appendix and Items 12p and 16p(O) or other required reporting contained in Ru le s 420-3-16- .10(12) and 420-3-16- .10(21). 11. When a report is viewed on a computer screen, this format is exempt from the graduated temperature divisions, temperature-scale divisions, and line spacing requirements of this appendix. 12. Printed reports shall present data in a form that is compatible with the applicable requirements of these rules. VI. CRITERIA FOR THE EVALUATION OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS FOR GRADE \"A\" PUBLIC HEALTH CONTROLS BACKGROUND Computer systems are commonly used to manage the functions of public health control devices (valves, pumps, etc.) that operate milk pasteurization systems. These computer systems may be programmed for monitoring and controlling the instrumentation of HTST and HHST pasteurizers . They may also control the operational state of devices such as the FODs, booster pumps, etc. While this technology can furnish numerous advantages throughout the manufactur ing process, the public health computer system should essentially just replace its hard-wired counterpart . These computer systems are evaluated similar to hard-wired systems and all of the required public health controls shall meet the established criteria. Computers are different from hard-wired controls in three (3) major categories. To provide adequate public health protection , the design of computerized public health controls shall address these three (3) major differences. First, unlike conventional hard-wired systems which provide full-time monitoring of the public health controls, the computer performs its tasks sequentially , and the computer may be in real time contact with the FOO for only one (1) millisecond . During the next one hundred ( 100) milliseconds , or however long it takes the computer to cycle one ( 1) time through its tasks, the FOO remains in forward-flow , independent of temperature in the holding tube. Normally, this is not a problem because most computers can cycle through one hundred (100) steps in their H-46 I ,\\ 1> n ~ ri ,1 1 program, many times during one (1) second. The problem occurs when the public health computer is directed away from its tasks by another computer; or the computer program is changed; or a seldom used JUMP. BRANCH . or GOTO Instruction diverts the public health computer away from its tasks. Second, in a computerized system, the control logic is easily changed because the computer program is easily changed. A few keystrokes at the keyboard will completely change the control logic of the computer program. Sealing the access to the public health computer's programming function can solve the problem addressed above. A procedure Is needed to ensure that the public health computer has the correct program when the Health Officer reseals the public health computer . Finally, for public health controls, the public health computer program shall and can be made error-free since the programs required for public health control are relatively brief. This is accomplished by attempting to keep the public health computer program simple and of limited control scope. GLOSSARY Address -A numerical label on each memory location of the computer.

CRITERIA The following listed criteria shall be complied with for all computers when applied to HTST and HHST pasteurization systems used for Grade \"A\" milk and/or milk products. In addition, all systems shall conform to all other existing requirements of these rules. 1. A computer or a PLC used for the public health control of a pasteurizer shall be dedicated only to the public health control of that individual pasteurizer . The public health computer shall have no other assignments involving the routine operation of the milk plant. Computer functions peripheral to the public health controls, such as CIP valve cycling, may be acceptable; provided, it does not compromise the public health functionality of the public health computer or pasteurization system and all rule requirements and safeguards are not compromised. 2. The public health computer and its outputs shall not be under the command or control of any other computer system or Human Machine Interface. 1t shall not have an address that is addressable by any other computer system. A host computer cannot override its commands or place it on standby status. All addresses of the public health computer shall be ready to process data at any time. 3. A separate public health computer shall be used on each HTST and HHST pasteurization system. Only the public health computer may provide control over the public health devices and functions of the HTST and HHST pasteurization system. Any other computer or Human Machine Interface may request a function of a device (valve, pump, etc.) within the HTST or HHST pasteurization system through a hard-wired input; however, this request would be granted or denied by the logic in the public health computer depending on the current status of the computer program and public health rule requirements . 4. The status of the inputs and outputs of the public health computer may be provided as inputs only to other computer systems and all public health outputs or devices shall be controlled by dlrect hard-wiring from the output terminal bus of the computer to the device. This includes solenoids, motor speed controls, such as frequency drives, and motors located within the HTST or HHST pasteurization system. The wiring connections shall be provided with isolation protection such as relays, H-49 I A r ,1; n t i , diodes, or optical-coupling devices to prevent the public health outputs from being driven by the other computer system. Digital outputs from another computer may be connected to an input of the public health computer in order to request the operation of a device controlled by the public health computer. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit control of the motor speed controls, such as frequency drives, by non\u00ad public health computer systems provided that the regulatory limits cannot be altered or disabled. 5. Upon loss of power to the public health computer all public health controls shall assume the fail-safe position. Most computers can be placed in standby status by either a program instruction or manual switches. When the public health computer is in standby status, all public health controls shall assume the fail-safe position. Some computers have internal diagnostic checks that are performed automatically during start-up. During this time, the public health computer places all outputs in default mode. In this default mode, all public health controls shall be in the fail-safe position. The status of outputs or inputs of the public health computer may provide status to another computer for informational purposes . This shall only be accomplished through a hard-wired output (separate from any control output) from the public health computer to an input on another computer system. No other communication from the public health computer is allowed. 6. Some computers and/or PLCs have Input/Output terminals (buses) with \"last state switches\" that permit the designer to decide what state the output bus will take on power-up , after a shutdown . or loss of power. The choices are \"on,\" \"off,\" or \"last state\" occurring when the computer lost power. These \"last state switches\" shall be placed in the \"fail-safe'' or \"off' position. Upon loss of power to the computer , all public health controls shall assume the fall safe position. Most computers can be placed in standby status by either a program instruction or manual switches. The public health computer shall have its manual switch in the position that maintains all outputs in the \"off' state during any operations except normal program execution. 7. A computer performs its tasks sequentially , and for most of real time the computer outputs are locked in the \"ON\" or \"OFF'' position, while waiting for the computer to come back through the cycle. Consequently , the public health computer program shall be written so that It monitors all inputs and updates all outputs on a precise schedule, at least once every second. Most computers will be capable of performing this function many times In one (1) second. Program instructions may not exist within the public health computer program that are capable of altering the scan order of the logic, or distract focus from this order. These would include \"JUMP\" or ''GOTO\" type instructions. 8. The computer program used to control the required public health functions of HTST or HHST pasteurizers shall be stored in some form of ROM and be available when the public health computer is turned on. The use of tapes or disks are not acceptable . H-50 I cl. () p r! fl d 1 -< 9. The public health computer program access shall be sealed. Any telephone modem accesses shall also be sealed. If the Input/Output terminals contain \"last state switches ,\" the Input/Output terminals shall be sealed. The vendor shall supply the Health Officer with test procedures and instructions to verify that the program currently in use by the public health computer is the correct program. Typically this is made available by providing a copy of the program that controls the public health computer of the HTST or HHST pasteurizer. The Health Officer shall use this test procedure to confirm that the correct program is in use during a start-up, normal operation, and whenever the seal is broken. Challenging the system during normal operation could involve challenging the inter-wiring requirements through the CIP computer. One (1) method could include attempting access to the booster pump through the CIP computer. With the FOO mode selector in \"PROCESS \" or \"PRODUCT\" position, attempt to access the booster pump using the CIP computer . Public health controls in pasteurizers that may be compromised by such a challenge , shall be altered or re-programmed so this compromise is prevented and the access to this computer program shall be sealed by the Health Officer. Similar challenges may be performed on other required public health functions that are computer controlled . 10. If the public health computer contains FORCE-ON , FORCE-OFF functions, the public health computer shall provide indicator lights showing the status of the FORCE-ON , FORCE-OFF function. The vendor's instructions shall remind the Health Officer that all FORCE-ON , FORCE-OFF functions shall be cleared before the public health computer is sealed by the Health Officer. 11. The Input/Output terminals of the public health computer shall contain no operator override switches that are accessible without compromising a regulatory seal. 12. Computerized systems that provide for printing the pasteurizer recording chart by the public health computer shall ensure that the required calibration is maintained . During chart printing, the public health computer shall not be diverted from its tasks for more than one (1) second. Upon returning to public health control tasks, the public health computer shall complete at least one (1) full cycle of its public\u00ad health tasks before returning to chart printing. 13. When printing a chart, some systems may provide status reports on the chart paper of selected lnpuUOutput conditions . This is usually done by interrupting the printing of the chart and printing the Input/Output conditions. Such interruptions for status printing are permitted only when a continuous record is recorded on the chart. When an interruption is initiated the time of the start of the interruption shall be printed on the chart, at the beginning of the interruption . and at the end of the interruption. The time interval during which the public health computer is diverted from its public health tasks for status printing shall not exceed one (1) second. Upon returning to public health tasks, the public health computer shall complete at least one (1) full cycle of its public health tasks before returning to status printing. 14. When the public health computer prints the holding tube temperature trace at specific intervals rather than a continuously changing line, temperature readings shall H-51 I 11, p p ;: n il , be printed not less than once every five (5) seconds. In addition, during the recorder/controller thermometric response test, the temperature shall be printed or indicated at a time rate sufficient to allow the Health Officer to measure the 7\u00b0C (12\u00b0F) rise in temperature as described in Test 8. Recorder/Controller-Therm ometric Response of these rules. 15. When the public health computer prints the event pen position, the position of the FDD, either forward or divert at specific intervals, rather than continuously, all changes of position shall be recognized by the public health computer and printed on the chart. In addition, the event pen position and temperature in the holding tube shall be printed on the chart in a manner that the temperature in the holding tube can be determined at the moment of a change in position of the FDD. 16. The vendor shall provide a built-in program for test procedures or a protocol shall be provided so that all applicable public health tests, contained within Appendix I, can be performed by the Health Officer for each instrument, i.e.: a. Recording Thermometers: Temperature accuracy; time accuracy; check against indicating thermometer and thermometric response . b. FDD -Valve seat leakage; operation of valve stem(s); device assembly; manual diversion; response time and time delay intervals if used. c. Booster Pumps -Proper wiring and proper pressure control settings. d. Flow-Promoting Devices Capable of Generating Flow Through the Holding Tube -Are installed with proper wiring interlocks. 17. Computers require high quality, clean, well-regulated power supplies to operate reliably and safely. Spurious voltage spikes can cause unwanted changes in public health computer RAM. To assure the public health computer will execute its functions error free the following items parameters shall be considered : a. A \"clean\" power source that is relatively free of spikes, interference , and other irregularities shall be supplied to the public health computer. b. The correct program should be confirmed at the time of sealing (refer to the criteria cited within #9 of this section). c. The output bus \"last state\" switch should be in the \"off' or \"fail-safe\" position which shall stop all ft..mctions of the HTST or HHST pasteurizer in case of a spurious program error. d. All public health computer outputs shall not have any operator override switches and shall be wired in a manner that only allows the public health PLC complete control. It is necessary that the installer or designer for the public health PLC ensure H-52 I A p p e n o , r that the proper program is in the public health computer memory before the Health Officer seals the computer. It is also necessary that any program changes be written to the public health computer 's back-up chip if one exists. 18. Computer programs used for public health controls on pasteurizers shall conform to the attached logic diagrams. Minor modifications to these diagrams are permissible to accommodate or delete items that are unique to a specific HTST or HHST pasteurization system. For example on meter based timing systems when the FOO selector switch is placed in the CIP position: a. A minimum ten (10) minute time delay is required for the FOO to remain in diverted flow. b. During this time delay the booster pump shall shut down and remain off for ten (10) minutes and then the Programmed CIP Operation is allowed to fully perform all the cleaning functions for the HTST or HHST pasteurization system, including allowing the timing pump, the separator, and the booster/stuffer pump to run during cleaning operations ano the FOD to pulse or cycle. 19. The ladder logic diagrams for the FOO and the booster pump show a programmed CIP cleaning cycle operation as part of the computerized system. Some milk plant operators may wish to use another computer for CIP cleaning operations so that milk plant personnel may change CIP cleaning programs . When using this method, the connections between the FOO, booster pump, and milk plant computer shall be provided with solenoid relays or similar devices for the FDD and booster pump outputs. This prevents them from being operated by the milk plant computer except when the mode switch of the FDD is in the \"CIP\" position and all applicable requirements have been satisfied. 20. The vendor shall provide to the Health Officer a protocol and documentation as follows: a. Wiring diagrams of those controllers , instruments , and devices pertaining to the public health computer . b. The computer ladder logic printout and/ot storage device (programmed ROM chip, etc.) identical to the public health computer that controls the pasteurizer . This is usually in the form of ladder line logic for each component of the pasteurization system(s) and may include programming for CIP and other functions. c. A user manual including testing procedures and instructions as required in Criteria #9 of this section.

Steam-Block Type FDD Systems shall have two (2) steam-block zones between the pasteurizer and the surge tank(s)/filler(s). There shall be a continuous visible bleed of steam or condensate to the drain from each steam-block zone. 2. The steam-block zones shall be temperature monitored and shall alarm when temperature falls below 121 \u00b0C (250\u00b0F). 3. The Primary Divert Valve and other critical valves shall be position detectable and fail-safe and be alarmed to provide protection when needed. ~: For the detection of the FOO and valve seat positions (refer to Appendix H, and I, Position Detection Devices). 4. The Steam-Block Type FOO System shall not move to the forward-flow position until all conditions required of the HHST pasteurizing system are met and shall divert under the same conditions as a standard FDD. 5. When the Stearn-Block Type FDD System is in a divert condition, a loss of temperature alarm in a steam-block zone shall cause a full port opening to drain in that steam-block zone. 6. Should both steam-block zones fail when the Steam-Block Type FDD is in diverted fiow. the resulting compromised milk or milk product shall not be distributed for sale. 7. Computer controls shall meet the requlrements of this appendix. STEAM-BL OCK STYLE FDD SYSTEM -FUNCTIONAL DIAGRAM I -+ PRIMARY DIVERT V/\\L\\'E I STEAM BLOCt-: ZO~EA J. I smw BLOCK ZONE .J.

ACCEPTED PROCESS FOR THE CREATION OF PASTEURIZED EQUIVALENT WATER UV LIGHT DISINFECTION OF WATER BACKGROUND UV light between 2000-4000 Angstrom (200-400 nanometers) is well known for inactivating pathogenic microorganisms in water via several mechanisms , including the formation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bonds (dimers) that inhibit reproduction and infectivity. Different microbes have different responses to specific wavelengths which also can account for differences in overall dose requirements. Some microbes can use their own enzymes and mechanisms , or take advantage of host cell enzymes to repair the damaged DNA, requiring higher doses of UV to cause irrevocable damage and effective pasteurization-level disinfection . Three (3) critical factors determine a UV unit's ability to reliably achieve the necessary dose at any point in time: The tranmissivity of the water to UV light, the performance of the lamps, and the hydraulics and rate of the flow in the disinfection chamber. Color, turbidity, particles, and organic impurities can interfere with the transmission of UV energy and lower the disinfection efficiency below levels required to ensure destruction of pathogenic organisms. Similarly, lamps can age unevenly and water can foul the protective sleeves and prevent light from reaching some pathogens . Hydraulic patterns or flow that is too high or too low can cause uneven distribution of the dose and leave some areas without adequate disinfection . Other important factors include the geometric configuration of the reactor, the power, wavelength , and physical arrangement of the UV lamps, and the UV path length. Longer path lengths provide more opportunities for UV photon-microbe interaction and inactivation. UV lamps treat water instantaneously while it is flowing through the disinfection chamber but do not provide residual bactericidal action. Using UV light for pasteurized equivalent water is not a substitute for appropriate maintenance , periodic flushing, and sanitizing of the water distribution system inside the plant. CRITERIA The following is a list of criteria that is required to accept water treated with UV light to be considered equivalent to pasteurized water: 1. UV light shall be applied so that the entire volume of water receives at least the following dose when used as pasteurized water. a. Low pressure UV at 2,537 Angstrom (254 nanometers ) at 186,000 microwatt-seconds per square centimeter or a 4-log adenovirus equivalent. b. Medium pressure UV at 120,000 microwatt-seconds per square centimeter or a 4~ log adenovirus equivalent. H-64 I L\\ I' ll = r II I \" 2. A flow or time delay mechanism shall be provided so that all water moving past the flow stop or divert valve receives the minimum dose required above. 3. The unit shall be designed to permit the frequent cleaning of the system without disassembly of the unit and shall be cleaned often enough to ensure that the system will provide the required dose at all times. 4. An automatic flow control valve accurate within the expected pressure range shall be installed to restrict flow to the maximum design flow of the treatment unit so that all particles receive the minimum dose listed above . 5. An accurately calibrated UV intensity sensor properly filtered to restrict its sensitivity to the 2,500-2,800 Angstrom (250-280 nanometers) germicidal spectrum shall measure the UV energy from the lamps. 6. There shall be one (1) sensor for each UV lamp. 7. The light shall adjust based on water quality measured with a real time UVT analyzer to assure that the dose is always calculated accurately and provided reliably. 8. A flow diversion valve or automatic shut-off valve shall be installed which shall permit flow into the pasteurized product lines only when at least the required UV dosage is applied. When power is not being supplied to the unit, the valve should be in a closed (fail-safe) position which prevents the flow of water into the pasteurized product lines. 9. The materials of construction shall not impart toxic materials into the water either as a result of the presence of toxic constituents in materials of construction or as a result of physical or chemical changes resulting from exposure to UV energy. 10. The unit shall record the operating parameters (flow. UVT, and dose) on a real time basis. These records shall be accessible to the Health Officer for inspection . Electronically generated records, if used, shall meet the criteria specified in Appendix Hand V. Author: G. M. Gallaspy , Jr. Statutory Authority: Code of Ala. 1975, \u00a722-2-2 and \u00a722-20-7.

Criteria: Four (4) seconds or less. Apparatus : 1. Accurate time measuring device. 2. The indicating thermometer, which was previously tested against a known accurate test thermom eter. 3. Water, oil or other suitable media bath and agitator. 4. Suitable means of heating the media bath, 5. Ice and water media bath. Method: The measuring of the time required for the read1ny of the indicating thermometer being tested to increase 7\u00b0C (12\u00b0F) through a specified temperature range. This temperature range shall include the minimum legal pasteurization temperature(s) . If there are multiple cut-in temp eratures and one (1) or more are separated by more than 7\u00b0C (12\u00b0F), this test shall also be conducted for any cut\u00ad in temperature(s) not included within the initial 7\u00b0C (12\u00b0F) range as addressed in Procedure 1 below. Procedure : 1. Immerse the indicating thermomete r in the media bath which has been heated to a temperature at least 11 \u00b0C (19\u00b0F) higher than the minimum scale reading on the indicating thermometer.

Note: When consistent test readings cannot be obtained, purge the pasteurization system, check the testing instruments and connections, and check for any air leakage on the suction side of the timing pump. Repeat Procedure 7. When consistent readings cannot be obtained after repeating Procedure 7, use the fastest time obtained from any of these tests as the pasteurization holding time for water in forward-flow. 8.

Criteria: Every particle of milk and/or milk product shall be held for the applicable minimum pasteurization holding time in both the forward-flow and diverted-flow positions. Apparatus: No supplementary materials required. Method: For this test, fully developed laminar flow is assumed and the required holding tube length shall be calculated from an experimental determination of the pumping rate. An experimental determination of the pumping rate can be accomplished by determining the time required for the pasteurization system to fill a vessel of a known volume; converting these data by division to obtain the flow rate in gallons per second; and then multiplying this value, by the proper value referenced in Table 14 to determine the required holding tube length.

Operate the pasteurization system on water, in forward-flow, with all flow-promoting devices, which are capable of causing flow through the FDD operating at their maximum capacity and all flow-impeding devices adjusted or bypassed to provide the minimum amount of resistance to the flow through the pasteurization system. There shall not be any leakage on the suction side of the timing pump. a. For a variable speed timing pump, adjust the timing pump to its maximum capacity, preferably with a new belt and full size impellers. 1-53 I A p p e I d , b. For a homogenizer used as the timing pump, check the homogenrzer for its regulatory seal(s) and gears or pulley identification. c. For AC variable speed timing pump, check the timing pump's control box for its regulatory seal(s). Note: For pasteurization systems that employ a liquid ingredient Injection (slurry) system as described in Appendix H, the slurry injection pump shall be energized and running at its maximum speed and the slurry supply tank shall be complete ly filled with water. 2. Measure the time required to deliver a known volume of water at the discharge outlet of the pasteurization system. Repeat the test until the measurements are consistent. 3. Repeat Procedures 1 and 2 in diverted-flow by collecting the water at the pasteurization system's diverted-flow discharge . Note: Procedure 3 is not required for HHST pasteurization systems with magnetic flow meter based timing systems. 4. Select the highest flow rate, the shortest delivery time for the known volume, and calculate the flow rate in gallons per second by dividing the known volume by the time required to collect the known volume. Multiply this value with the appropriate value referenced in Table 14 to determine the required holding tube length for the pasteurization system. 5. The holding tube may include fittings. The centerline length of the fitting is treated as an equivalent length of straight pipe. The centerline distance may be measured by forming a flexible steel tape along the centerline of the fitting. Determine the total length of the holding tube by adding the equivalent lengths of the fittings to the measured lengths of straight pipe. Note: The holding tube shall be arranged to have a continuously upward slope in the direction of flow of not less than 2.1 centimeters (0.25 of an inch) per foot. If the indicating temperature sensing element is located at the beginning of the holding tube, the entire length of the holding tube shall be protected against heat loss by a material that is impervious to water. 6. When the actual holding tube length is equivalent to or greater than the calculated minimum holding tube length, record the number and type of fittings, the number and length of straight pipe, the holding tube configuration , and the results on the appropriate Form. If the actual holding tube length is not equivalent or greater than the calculated minimum holding tube length, refer to Action noted below. 1-54 I l> \u00b5 \" I\\ d I > Alternate Procedure for Measuring the Flow Rate: Suspend a sanitary dipstick in the constant-level tank and operate the pasteurization system at its maximum flow capacity. Record the time that is required for the water level in the constant-leve l tank to drop two (2) identified graduations on the dipstick. The volume of water is calculated from the dimensions of the constant-level tank and the drop in water level. The flow rate is determined as follows: 1. Divide the volume of water, in gallons, removed from the constant-level tank by the time, in seconds, required to remove the volume of water. 2. Then use this flow rate to calculate the required holding tube length as provided in Procedures 3 and 4 above. Alternate Procedures for the Determination of the Holding Tube Length for Non-Standard Pipe Size: The holding tube length may be accurately calculated from the following equation : L= 588 QtJD2 Where: L = Holding tube length (inches) Q = Pumping rate (gallons per second) t = Pasteurization holding time standard (seconds) D = Internal diameter of the holdlng tube (inches) Note: Table 15 provides the internal pipe diameters for piping in a HHST pasteurization system's holding tube with nominal external diameters of 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0 inches. Internal diameters for pasteurizat ion system's holding tubes designed for high pressure and for holding tubes with external piping sizes not listed in Table 15, shall be individually determined and the minimum holding tube length calculated using the above formula. TABLE15 Nominal External Dlamete Internal Olameta 2.0 1.87 2.5 2.37 3.0 2.87 4.0 3.83 Abstracted from Table 6.1 \"Pipe and Heat Exchanger Tube Dimensions,\" Fundamentals of Food Process Engineering, 1979, R. T. Toledo, AVI Press 1 Measurements are in Inches. After the minimum required holding tube length is obtained from the calculation above, the length of the holding tube is measured to determine that it is at least as long as the calculated length. Record the number and type of 1-55 I ;.. p p e n d i ., fittings, the number and length of straight pipe, and the holding tube configuration results on the appropriate form. Action: If the length of the holding tube is shorter than the calculated required minimum length, resear the timing system at a slower maximum speed based on new calculations with this slower maximum speed or have milk plant personnel lengthen the holding tube, or both, and repeat the test procedure previously used. If after adjustme nt the pasteurization system fails this test, the pasteurization system shall not be allowed to operate until the cause of this failure has been corrected and compliance has been verified by the Health Officer; or in the case of HACCP listed milk plants, qualified industry personnel acceptable to the Health Officer in compliance with Rule 420-3-16-.10(21-22); or on an emergency basis, an industry temporary testing and sealing program authorized by the Health Officer in compliance with Rule 420-3-16-.10(21-22). 11.4 CALCULATED PASTEURIZATION HOLDING TIME FOR HHST PASTEUR IZATION SYSTEMS USING DIRECT HEATING Application: To all HHST pasteurization systems using direct heating.

Note: Procedure 3 is not required for HHST pasteurization systems with magnetic flow meter based timing systems. 4. Select the highest flow rate, the shortest delivery time for the known volume and calculate the flow rate in gallons per second by dividing the known volume by the time required to collect the known volume. Multiply this value with the appropriate value referenced in Table 16 to determine the required holding tube length for the pasteurization system.

The holding tube may include fittings. The center line length of the fitting is treated as an equivalent length of straight pipe. The center line distance may be measured by forming a flexible steel tape along the center line of the 1-57 I App o:-n d i \\ fitting. Determine the total length of the holding tube by adding the equivalent lengths of the fittings to the measured lengths of straight pipe. Note: The holding tube shall be arranged to have a continuously upward slope in the direction of flow of not less than 2.1 centimeters (0.25 of an inch) per foot. If the indicating temperature sensing element is located at the beginning of the holding tube, the entire length of the holding tube shall be protected against heat loss by a material that is impervious to water. 6. When the actual holding tube length is equivalent to or greater than the calculated minimum holding tube length. record the number and type of fittings, the number and length of straight pipe, the holding tube configuration, and the results on the appropriate form. If the actual holding tube length is not equivalent or greater than the calculated minimum holding tube length, refer to Action noted below. Alternate Procedure for Measuring the Flow Rate: Suspend a sanitary dipstick in the constant-level tank and operate the pasteurization system at its maximum flow capacity. Record the time that is required for the water level in the constant-level tank to drop two (2) identified graduations on the dipstick. The volume of water is calculated from the dimensions of the constant-level tank and the drop in water level. The flow rate is determined as follows: 1. Divide the volume of water, in gallons, removed from the constant-level tank by the time, in seconds, required to remove the volume of water. 2. Then use this flow rate to calculate the required holding tube length as provided in Procedures 3 and 4 above. Alternate Procedures for the Determinat ion of the Holding Tube Length for Non-Standard Pipe Size: The holding tube length may also be accurately calculated from the following equation: L = (588 Qt X 1.12)/02 Where: L = Holding tube length (inches) Q = Pumping rate (gallons per second) t = Pasteurization holding time standard (seconds) 1.12 = 12% expansion for steam D = Internal diameter of the holding tube (inches) Note: Table 15 provides the internal pipe diameters for piping in a HHST pasteurization system's holding tube with nominal external diameters of 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0 inches. Internal diameters for pasteurization system's holding tubes designed for high pressure and for holding tubes with external piping sizes not 1-58 I ~ p ti :s II d II listed in Table 15 shall be individually determined and the minimum holding tube length calculated using the above formula. After the minimum required holding tube length is obtained from the calculation above, the length of the holding tube is measured to determine that it is at least as long as the calculated length. Record the number and type of fittings, the number and length of straight pipe, and the holding tube configuration results on the appropriate form. Action: If the length of the holding tube is shorter than the calculated required minimum length, reseal the timing system at a slower maximum speed based on new calculations with this slower maximum speed or have milk plant personnel lengthen the holding tube, or both, and repeat the test procedure previously used.

THE HACCP INTRODUCTION HISTORY OF HACCP -The use of the HACCP System is not new to the dairy industry. HACCP is a logical, simple, effective, but highly structured system of food safety control. The HACCP System was introduced to the food industry as a spin-off of the space program during the 1960s. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used HACCP to provide assurance of the highest quality available for components of space vehicles. This program to develop assurance of product reliability was carried over into the development of foods for astronauts. The U.S. Army Natick Laboratories, in conjunction with NASA, began to develop the foods needed for manned space exploration . They contracted with the Pillsbury Company to design and produce the first foods used in space. While Pillsbury struggled with certain problems, such as how to keep food from crumbling in zero gravity, they also undertook the task to come as close as possible to 100 percent assurance that the foods they produced would be free of bacterial or viral pathogens . Using traditional quality control methods for the food industry was soon proven to be unworkable for the task Pillsbury had undertaken. The degree of safety desired was not provided by the current programs , and the product sampling necessary to provide an adequate degree of safety would have been prohibitive to commerc ialization of space foods. Pillsbury discarded its standard quality control methods and began an extensive evaluation , in conjunction with NASA and Natick Labs, to evaluate food safety. They soon realized that to be successful they would have to have control over their process, raw materials, environment, and their people. In 1971, they introduced HACCP as a preventive system that enables manufacturers to produce foods with a high degree of assurance that the foods were produced safely. BACKGROUND -HACCP is a management tool that provides a structured and scientific approach to the control of identified hazards. HACCP is a logical basis for better decision-making with respect to product safety. HACCP has international recognition as an effective means of controlling food safety hazards and is endorsed as such by the joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the World Health Organization (WHO) Codex Alimentarius Commission . The U.S. National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) has also endorsed it. The HACCP concept will enable those operating and regulating under a HACCP Plan to move to a preventive approach , whereby potential hazards are identified and controlled in the manufacturing environment , i.e., prevention of product failure. HACCP allows for a preventive , systematic approach to food safety. K-ljAppenul VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION -This Appendix describes a NCIMS voluntary HACCP Program alternative to the traditional inspection system. A milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station may not participate in the NCIMS voluntary HACCP Program unless the Health Officer's responsible for the oversight of the facility agrees to participate with the milk plant(s), receiving station(s), and transfer station(s) in the NCIMS voluntary HACCP Program. Both parties shall provide written commitment to each other that the necessary resources to support participation In the NCIMS voluntary HACCP Program shall be made available. Management responsible for both the Health Officer and the milk plant, receiving station, and/or transfer station shall be willing to provide the resources required to develop and implement a successful HACCP System. HACCP PRINCIPLES -Following are the seven (7) HACCP principles to be included in a HACCP Plan: 1. Conduct a hazard analysis. 2. Determine the critical control points. 3. Establish critical limits. 4. Establish monitoring procedures . 5. Establish corrective actions. 6. Establish verification procedures . 7. Establish record~keeping and documentation procedures. PREREQUISITE PROGRAMS (PPs) -Prior to the implementation of a HACCP Plan, there is a requirement for milk plants, receiving stations, and transfer stations to develop, document and implement written PPs. PPs provide the basic environment and operating conditions that are necessary for the production of safe, wholesome food. Many of the conditions and practices are specified in federal and state regulations and guidelines . PPs and the HACCP System in total, address public health concerns such as those identified in 21 CFR Part 7, Recalls; Part 110, Good Manufacturfng Practices (GMPs); Part 113, Thermally Processed Low-Acid Foods Packaged in Hermetically Sealed Conta1ners ; Part 131, Milk and Cream; the Grade ';:\"\\\" PMO; and the current edition of the NACMCF HACCP Principles and Application Guidelines . SUMMARY -The seven (7) principles of HACCP are also called the HACCP Plan. When combined with the PPs, they constitute a HACCP System. The NCIMS voluntary HACCP Program described in this Appendix includes the HACCP System and other prescribed Grade \"A\" PMO criteria, such as drug residue K-2 I A p p ,. n <.l , , testing and trace back; use of milk only from supplies that have been awarded a milk sanitation compliance rating of 90 percent or better or from an acceptable IMS HACCP listed source; and the labeling requirements of Section 4. When properly implemented , the NCIMS voluntary HACCP Program described in this appendix will provide assurance of milk and milk product safety that is equivalent to that provided under the traditional inspection system. II. IMPLEMENTATION OF A HACCP SYSTEM PRELIMINARY STEPS -Preliminary steps as listed in the NACMCF document should be followed when producing a HACCP Plan. Complete, up-to-date process flow diagrams are required for all milk and milk products manufactured . Flow diagrams may be combined when processes , products, and hazards are similar. PREREQUISITE PROGRAM -HACCP is not a stand-alone program, but is part of a larger control system. PPs are the universal procedures used to control the conditions of the milk plant environment that contribute to the overall safety of the milk or milk product. They represent the sum of programs , practices, and procedures that shall be applied to produce and distribute safe milk and milk products in a clean, sanitary environment. They differ from CCPs in that they are basic sanitation programs that reduce the potential occurrence of a milk or milk product safety hazard. Frequently , both HACCP Plan CCPs and PPs control measures are necessary to control a food safety hazard. HACCP may be implemented only in a facility that is constructed and operated to provide a sanitary environment. Milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station premises, building construction , maintenance , and housekeeping shall be maintained in a manner sufficient to provide such an environment. These factors shall be controlled by effective milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station programs or by PPs, as the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station chooses. The exact set of PPs will vary since their application is milk or milk product and process specific. The existence and effectiveness of PPs should be assessed during the design and implementation of each HACCP Plan. PPs should be documented and regularly audited. An audit review consists of verifying that the company has a program implemented that indicates how the company monitors and controls each of the PPs. PPs are established and managed separately from the HACCP Plan. 1. Required PPs -The following required PPs shall have a brief written description or checklist that the PPs can be audited against to ensure compliance . PPs shall include procedures that can be monitored ; records that specify what is monitored; and how often it will be monitored. Each milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station shall have and implement PPs that address conditions and practices before, during, and after processing. The PPs shall address: K-3 I I), p r e n ,. 1 ., a. Safety of the water that comes into contact with milk or milk products or product-co ntact surfaces, including steam and ice. b. Condition and cleanliness of equipment product-contact surface. c. Prevention of cross-contamination from insanitary objects and/ or practices to milk or milk products or product-contact surfaces, packaging material and other food-contact surfaces, including utensils1 gloves, outer garments , etc.1 and from raw product to processed product. d. Maintenance of handwashing , hand sanitizing , and toilet facilities. e. Protection of milk or milk product, packaging material, and product\u00ad contact surfaces from adulteration with lubricants , fuel. pesticides, cleaning compounds , sanitizing agents, condensate and other chemical, physical, and biological contaminants. f. Proper labeling, storage, and use of toxic compounds. g. Control of employee health conditions , including employee exposure to high risk situations that could result in the microbiological contamination of milk or milk products, packaging materials, and product-contact surfaces. h. Pest exclusion from the milk plant. In addition to the required PPs specified above, any other PPs that are being relied upon in the hazard analysis to reduce the likelihood of hazards such that they are not reasonably likely to occur, shall also be monitored , audited, and documented as required PPs. 2. Monitoring and Correction -The milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station shall monitor the conditions and practices of all required PPs with sufficient frequency to ensure conformance with those conditions and that are appropriate both to the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station and to the safety of the milk or milk product being processed . Each milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station shall document the correction of those conditions and practices that are not in conformance . Devices such as indicating and recording thermomete rs that are used to monitor PPs shall be calibrated to assure accuracy at a frequency determined by the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station. 3. Required Records -Each milk plant, rece1v1ng station, or transfer station shall maintain records that document the monitoring and corrections required by this appendix. These records are subject to the record keeping requirements of this appendix . HAZARD ANALYSIS -Each milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station shall develop, or have developed for it, a written hazard analysis to determine K-4 I A ~ p e n cJ , < whether there are milk or milk product hazards that are reasonably likely to occur for each type of milk or milk product processed or handled by the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station and to identify the control measures that the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station can apply to control those hazards. The hazard analysis shall include hazards that can be introduced both within and outside the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station environment , including hazards that can occur during handling, transportation , processing , and distribution. A hazard that is reasonably likely to occur is one for which a prudent milk plant, receiving station1 or transfer station operator would establish controls because experience, illness data, scientific reports, or other information provide a basis to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that, in the absence of these controls, the hazard will occur in the particular type of milk or milk product being processed. The hazard analysis shall be developed by an indlvidual(s) trained in accordance with this appendix and shall be subject to the record keeping requirements as described in this appendix . 1. In evaluating what milk or milk product hazards are reasonably likely to occur, at a minimum, consideration should be given to the following: a. Microbiological contamination. b. Parasites. c. Chemical contamination . d. Unlawful drug and pesticide residues. e. Natural toxins. f. Unapproved use of food or color additives. g. Presence of undeclared ingredients that may be allergens. h. Physical hazards. 2. Milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station operators should evaluate product ingredients , processing procedures , packaging, storage, and intended use; facility and equipment function and design; and milk plant sanitation , including employee hygiene, to determine the potential effect of each on the safety of the finished milk or milk product for the intended consumer . HACCP PLAN 1. Every milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station shall have and implement a written HACCP Plan whenever a hazard analysis reveals one (1) or K-5 I A p n ~ n d , -' more hazards that are reasonably likely to occur. The HACCP Plan shall be developed by an lndividual(s) who has been trained and shall be subject to record keeping requirements in accordance with this appendix. A HACCP Plan shall be specific to each location and milk or milk product. The plan may group similar types of milk and milk products together, or similar types of production methods together, if the hazards, CCPs, CLs, and procedures required to be identified and performed by 2 of this section are essentially identical, provided that any required features of the plan that are unique to a specific milk or milk product or method are clearly delineated in the plan and are observed in practice. 2. Contents of the HACCP Plan -The HACCP Plan shall, at a minimum : a. Include complete up-to-date process flow diagrams for all milk and milk products manufactured. Flow diagrams may be combined when processes , milk and milk products, and hazards are similar. b. List all hazards that are reasonably likely to occur as identified in the hazard analysis specified above, and that shall be controlled for each type of milk or milk product. c. List the CCPs for each of the identified hazards, including the appropriate: (1) CCPs designed to control hazards that could occur or could be introduced in the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station environment. (2) CCPs designed to control hazards introduced outside the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station environment , including hazards that occur before arriving at the milk plant, receiving station, and/or transfer station. (3) List the Cls that shall be met at each of the CCPs. d. List the procedures and the frequency with which they are to be performed that will be used to monitor each of the CCPs to ensure compliance with the Cls. e. Include any corrective action plans that have been developed in accordance with the corrective action requirements as described in thisaAppendi x, and that are to be followed in response to deviations from CLs at CCPs. f. List the verification and validation procedures , and the frequency with which they are to be performed , that the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station will use in accordance with verification and validation requirements as described in this appendix . g. Provide a record keeping system that documents the monitoring of the CCPs in accordance with the record requirements as described in this appendix. The records shall contain the actual values and observations obtained during monitoring . K-6 I 1\\ p p e 11 d 1 ' 3. Sanitation -Sanitation controls may be included in the HACCP Plan. However, to the extent that they are monitored in accordance with the PPs, they need not be included in the HACCP Plan. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS -Whenever a deviation from a CL occurs, a milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station shall take corrective action by following the procedures set forth in 1 or 2 of this section. a. Milk plants, receiving stations, or transfer stations may develop written correcfive action plans which become a part of their HACCP Plan(s) in accordance with this appendix. These corrective action plans may predetermine the corrective actions that milk plants. receiving stations, and transfer stations will take whenever there is a deviation from a CL. A corrective action plan that is appropriate for a particular deviation is one (1) that describes the steps to be taken and assigns responsibility for taking those steps, to ensure that: b. No milk or milk product is allowed to enter commerce that is either injurious to health or is otherwise adulterated as a result of the deviation; or c. If such milk or milk product has entered commerce, it is expeditiously removed; and d. The cause of the deviation is corrected . 2. When a deviation from a CL occurs, and the milk plant. receiving station, or transfer station does not have a corrective action plan that is appropriate for that deviation, the milk plant, receiving station, or transfer station shall: a. Segregate and hold the affected milk or milk product, at least until the requirements of paragraphs 2.b and 2.c of this section are met. b. Perform or obtain a review to determine the acceptability of the affected milk or milk product for distribution . The review shall be performed by an individual or individuals qualified by training or experience to perform such a review. c. Take corrective action, when necessary, with respect to the affected milk or milk product to ensure that no milk or milk product is allowed to enter commerce that is either injurious to health or is otherwise adulterated as a result of the deviation. d. Take corrective action , when necessary, to correct the cause of the deviation. e. Perform or obtain timely validation by a qualified individual(s), as required in this appendix, to determine whether modification of the HACCP Plan is required to reduce the risk of recurrence of the deviation, and modify the HACCP Plan as necessary.

INDUSTRY RESPONSIBILITIES MONITORING AND SURVEIL LANCE Industry shall screen all bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers, regardless of final use, for Beta lactam drug residues. Additionally , other drug residues shall be screened for by employing a random sampling program on bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers when the Commissioner of the FDA determines that a potential problem exists as cited in Rule 420-3-16-.07 . The random bulk milk pickup tanker and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers sampling program shall represent and Include, during any consecutive six (6) months, at least four (4) samples collected in at least four (4) separate months, except when three (3) months show a month containing two (2) sampling dates separated by at least twenty (20) days. Samples collected under this random sampling program shall be analyzed as specified by the FDA (refer to Rule 420-3-16- .07). The bulk milk pickup tanker shall be sampled after the last producer has been picked up and before any additiona l commingling. These bulk milk pickup tanker samples may be collected using an approved aseptic sampler. The sample shall be representative . Bulk milk pickup tanker testing shall be completed prior to processing the milk. Bulk milk pickup tanker samples confirmed positive for drug residues using approved test methods and/or verified screening positive using test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS without additional confirmation required shall be retained as determined necessary by the Health Officer. All raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers shall be sampled prior to processing the milk. The sample(s) shall be representative of each farm bulk milk tank(s)/silo(s), milk plant raw milk tank(s) and/or silo(s), other raw milk storage container(s), etc. Testing of all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers shall be completed prior to processing the milk. Note: On-farm producer/processors that plan to store or ship their raw sheep milk frozen shall sample their raw sheep milk prior to freezing. The sample shall be obtained by a bulk milk hauler or sampler permitted by the Health Officer where the dairy farm is located. The raw sheep milk sample shall then be tested in a certified laboratory or screening facility. If this is the on-farm producer/processor's only raw sheep milk supply, this testing would suffice for the required Appendix N testing for all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers, which are required to be completed prior to processing the milk. In the case of sheep milk dairy farms, the raw milk sample may be frozen in accordance with a sample protocol approved by the Health Officer in which the dairy farm is located as specified in Appendix B and transported to a certified laboratory for testing. The test results, or raw milk samples, shall clea rly distinguish the lot number of the frozen raw sheep milk and accompany the frozen raw sheep milk to the plant. N-llApp~ndl All presumptive positive test results for drug residues using approved test methods or verified screening positive test results using test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS from analysis conducted on commingled raw milk tanks, bulk milk pickup tankers. and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers or farm raw milk tanks/silos (only milk offered for sale) samples shall be reported to the regulatory agency in which the testing was conducted. Bulk milk pickup tanker and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers samples confirmed positive for drug residues using approved test methods or verified screening positive using test methods not evaluated by FDA and accepted by the NCIMS without additional confirmation required shall be retained or disposed of as determined by the regulatory agency. Industry plant samplers shall be evaluated according to the requirements specified in Section 6 and at the frequency addressed in Section 5. REPORTING AND FARM TRACE BACK When a bulk milk pickup tanker and/or a raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers is found to be presumptive positive for drug residues using approved test methods or verified screening positive for drug residues using test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS, the regulatory agency in which the testing was conducted shall be immediately notified of the results and the ultimate disposition of the raw milk. The producer samples from the bulk milk pickup tanker found to be confirmed positive for drug residues using approved test methods or verified screening positive for drug residues using test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS without additional confirmation required shall be individually tested to determine the farm of origin. The samples shall be tested as directed by the regulatory agency. Upon official notification to the regulatory agency and milk producer of a violative individual producer's milk, further farm pickups by bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers and/or farm use of the violative individual producer's milk shall be immediately discontinued until such time that subsequent tests are no longer positive for drug residues. RECORD REQUIREMEN TS Results of all testing may be recorded in any format acceptable to the Health Officer that includes at least the following information : 1. Identity of the person doing the test. N-2 I , ,.., p -\" \" .I , ;< 2. Identity of the bulk milk pickup tanker or farm bulk milk tank(s)/ silo(s), milk plant raw milk tank(s) and/or silo(s), other raw milk storage container(s) , etc. used for the storage of all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers being tested*. 3. Date/time the test was performed (time, day, month and ~ar). 4. Identity of the test performed/lot #/any and all controls ( +/-). 5. Results of the test. 6. Follow-up testing if the initial test was positive/any and all controls ( +/-). 7. Site where test was performed. 8. Prior test documentation shall be provided for a presumptive positive load. *Include the BTU number(s) of the dairy farms present on the bulk milk pickup tanker and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers with the above information . Records of all sample test results shall be maintained for a minimum of six (6) months by the industry at the location where the test methods were run and/or another location as directed by the regulatory agency and as agreed to by industry. For the laboratory survey, two (2) years of records shall be available at the facility at the time of the survey. II. REGULATORY AGENCYRESPONSIBILITIES Upon receipt of notification from industry of a bulk milk pickup tanker and/or a raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers, which contains milk from another regulatory -agency's jurisdiction, is found to be presumptive positive for drug residues using approved test methods or verified screening positive for drug residues using test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS, it Is the responsibility of the receiving regulatory agency to notify the regulatory agency(ies) from which the milk originated . MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE Regulatory agencies shall monitor industry surveillance activities during either routine or unannounced on-site quarterly inspections to collect samples from bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers and to review industry records of their sampling program. Samples should be collected and analyzed from at least 10 percent of the bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers scheduled to arrive on the day of the inspection . The test method used shall be appropriate for the drug being analyzed and shall be capable of detecting the same drugs at the same concentrations as the test method being used by industry. N-3 I A p p = n d 1 ~ Alternately, the regulatory agency or Laboratory Evaluation Officer (LEO) may take known samples with them on the audit visit and observe the Industry Analyst (IA) test the samples. Receiving locations that choose to certify all receiving IAs certified under the provisions of the NCIMS Laboratory Certification Program are exempt from the sample collection requirements of this section. Receiving locations where all approved receiving IAs and Industry Supervisors (ISs) successfully participate in a biennial on-site evaluation and annual spilt sample comparisons by LEOs are also exempt from the sample collection requirements of this section. A review shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 1 . Is the program an appropriate routine monitoring program for the detection of drug residues? 2. Is the program utilizing appropriate test methods? 3. Is each producer's milk represented in a testing program for drug residues and tested at the frequency prescribed in Section I for drug residues? 4. Is the program assuring timely notification to the appropriate regulatory agency of positive results, the ultimate disposition of the bulk milk pickup tanker, and/or a raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers and of the trace back to the farm of origin? 5. Is the dairy farm pickup and/or use of the violative individual producer's milk suspended until subsequent testing establishes the milk is no longer positive for drug residues? To satisfy these requirements a. There shall be an agreement between the Health Officer and industry that specifies how this notification is to take place. This notification shall be \"timely\" for example by telephone or fax, and supported in writing. b. The ultimate disposition should either be prearranged in a documented agreement between the Health Officer and the industry, or physically supervised by the Health Officer.

(2) Establish that milk is not picked up or used from the drug residue positive producer until the regulatory agency has fulfilled their obligations under Section II., as applicable , based on the test method utilized, and has cleared the milk for pick up and/or use. Sufficient records should be reviewed to assure that all bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers are sampled before additional comming ling at the milk receiving facility and the results were made available to the appropriate BTU(s). The Health Officer shall also perform routine sampling and testing for drug residues determined to be necessary as outlined in Section 6. N-5 I \"' 11 n P n o , , ENFORCEMENT If testing reveals milk positive for drug residues, the milk shall be disposed of in a manner that removes it from the human or animal food chain, except where acceptably reconditioned under FDA Compliance Policy Guide (CPG 7126.20). The Health Officer shall determine the producer(s) responsible for the violation. Permit Suspension and the Prevention of the Sale of Milk -Any time milk 1s found to test as a confirmed positive using an approved test method, the regulatory agency shall immediately suspend the producer's Grade \"A\" permit or equally effective measures shall be taken to prevent the sale of milk containing drug residues. Upon official notification to the regulatory agency and milk producer of a confirmed positive, future farm pickups by bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers and/or farm use of the violative individual producer's milk are prohibited until subsequent testing reveals the milk is free of drug residue.

TESTING PROGRAM FOR DRUG RESIDUES ESTABLISHED DEFINITIONS For purposes of this appendix the following definitions are to be used: (1) Presumpt ive Positive -A presumptive positive test is a positive result from an initial testing of a bulk milk pickup tanker and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers using an M-a-85, latest revision, or M-1- 92-11 approved test method, which has been promptly repeated in duplicate with positive ( +) and negative (-) controls that give the proper results using the same test method, on the same sample, with one ( 1) or both of these duplicate retests giving a positive result. (2) Screening Test Positive (load or Raw Milk Supply that has not been Transported in Bulk Milk Pickup Tankers Confirmation) -A screening test positive (confirmation) result is obtained when the presumptive positive sample is tested in duplicate, using the same or equivalent (M-I-96-10 , latest revision) test method as that used for the presumptive positive, with a positive ( +) and negative (-) control that gives the proper results, and either or both of the duplicates are positive. A screening test positive (load or farm bulk milk tank(s)/silo(s), milk plant raw milk tank(s) and/or silo(s), other raw milk storage container(s) , etc. when used for a milk plant's raw milk supply(ies) that has (have) not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers confirmation) is to be performed by an Official Laboratory , Officially Designated Laboratory or CIS using the same or an equivalent test (M-I-96-10 , latest revision). Note: When a farm bulk milk tank(s)/silo(s) , milk plant raw milk tank(s) and/or silo(s), other raw milk storage container(s) , etc. is used for a milk plant's raw milk supply(ies) that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers is found to be positive (confirmed) for drug residues using approved test methods, the farm of origin for the drug residue has consequently already been determined and further testing is not required to determine the farm of origin. (3) Individual Producer Load -An individual producer bulk milk pickup tanker is a bulk milk pickup tanker or a compartment(s) of a bulk milk pickup tanker that contains milk from only one ( 1) dairy farm. (4) Individual On~Farm Producer/Processor's Raw Milk Supply-An individual on-farm producer/processor 's raw milk supply may be transported in bulk milk pickup tankers; and/or their raw milk supply may be stored in a farm bulk milk tank(s)/silo(s) on the dairy farm that directly feeds the batch (vat) pasteurizer (s) or constant-level tank of a HTST pasteurization system or piped from a farm bulk milk tank(s)/silo(s) to a raw milk tank(s) and/or silo(s) in the milk plant that feeds the batch (vat) pasteurizer(s) or constant-level tank of a HTST pasteurization system; and/or other raw milk storage containers . (5) Industry Analyst -A person under the supervision of a Certified Industry Supervisor (CIS) or Industry Supervisor (IS) who is assigned to conduct screening of bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers for Appendix N.

(8) Verified Screening Positive -A verified screening positive test is a positive result from an initial testing using test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS of a bulk milk pickup tanker and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers, which has been promptly repeated in duplicate with positive ( +) and negative (-) controls that give the proper results, using the same test method, on the same sample, with one {1) or both of these duplicate retests giving a positive result. (9) Producer Trace Back With Pennit Suspens ion Action Not Required - A producer trace back test is performed afte r a verified screening positive load using test methods not evaluated by FDA and accepted by the NCIMS without additional confirmation required is identified by a laboratory using the same test method as was used to obtain the verified screening positive load. A verified screening positive producer test result is obtained in the same manner as a verified screening positive for a bulk milk pickup tanker. After an initial positive result is obtained on a producer sample, that sample is then tested in duplicate using the same test method as was used to obtain the initial producer positive result. This testing is performed with positive ( +) and negative (-) controls and if either or both of the duplicates are positive and the controls give the proper results, the producer sample is a verified screening positive (refer to Section VI). Note: When a farm bulk milk tank(s)/silo(s), milk plant raw milk tank(s) and/or silo(s), other raw milk storage container(s) , etc. is used for a milk plant's raw milk supply(ies) that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers is found to be verified screening positive for drug residues using only test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS without additional confirmation required, the farm of origin for the drug residue has consequently already been determined and further testing is not required to determine the farm of origin. CERTIFIED INDUSTRY SUPERVISORS; EVALUATION AND RECORDS Reference : EML 1. Certified Industry Supervisors (CISs)/lnd ustry Supervisors (ISs)/lndustry Analysts (IAs) -Regulatory agencies may choose to allow ISs to be certified. Under this program, these CISs may officially confirm presumptive positive bulk milk pickup tanker loads and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers, and confirm producer milk for regulatory purposes (producer trace back/permit action) using approved test methods.

If the sample of the raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers is confirmed positive using an approved test method or verified screening positive using test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS without additional confirmation required then the processed milk is adulterated and unacceptable for human consumption regardless of any subsequent test results from the raw milk supply and/or pasteurized milk or milk products. The processed milk shall be disposed of under the supervision of the regulatory agency. BULK MILK PICKUP TANKER AND/OR ALL RAW MILK SUPPLIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN TRANSPORTED IN BULK MILK PICKUP TANKERS SCREENING TEST 1. Performance Tests/Controls -Each lot of test kits purchased shall be tested by positive ( +) and negative (-) controls in each screening facility prior to its initial use and each testing day thereafter. Records of all positive(+) and negative(-) control performance tests shall be maintained. 2. Initial Drug Testing Procedures - The following procedures apply to testing bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers for drug residues following the provisions of Appendix N. Industry analysts may screen tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers and receive or reject milk. Milk plants, receiving stations, transfer stations, and other screening locations may choose to participate in the Industry Supervisor Certification Program. a. Industry Presumptive Positive Options -There are two (2) industry options for the milk represented by a presumptive positive sample: (1) The regulatory agency involved (origin and receipt) shall be notified. The appropriate regulatory agency shall take control of the presumptive positive load and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers. A written copy of the presumpt ive positive test results shall follow the initial regulatory agency notification. Testing for confirmation of that presumptive positive load and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers shall be in an Official Laboratory , Officially Designated Laboratory, or by a Certified Industry Supervisor at a location acceptable to the Health Officer. Documentation of prior testing shall be provided to the analyst performing the load and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers confirmation . The presumpt ive positive load and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers may be re-sampled, at the direction of the regulatory agency, prior to analysis with the same or equivalent test (M-I-96-10, latest revision), as was used to obtain the presumptive positive result. This analysis shall be done in duplicate with positive ( +) and negative (-) controls. If either or both of the duplicate samples are N-11 I A. ~ n I I , positive and the positive ( +) and negative (-) controls give the correct reactions, the sample is deemed a Screening Test Positive (Confirmed Load and/or Raw Milk Supply that has Not been Transported in Bulk Milk Pickup Tankers Confirmation). A written copy of the test results shall be provided to the regulatory agency. The milk which that sample represents is no longer available for sale or processing into human food. (2) The owner of the presumptive positive milk may reject the load and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers without further testing. At that time, the milk represented by the presumptive positive test is not available for sale or processing into human food. The milk cannot be re-screened. The Health Officer involved (origin and receipt) shall be notified. Under this option, producer trace backs shall be conducted for the reject load. Note: When a farm bulk milk tank(s)/silo(s) , milk plant raw milk tank(s) and/or silo(s), other raw milk storage container(s), etc. is used for a milk plant's raw milk supply(ies) that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers is found to be positive (confirmed) for drug residues, the farm of origin for the drug residue has consequently already been determined and further testing is not required to determine the farm of origin. 3. Re-Sampling a. Presumptive Results Using Approved Test Methods -Occasionally , an error in sampling or a suspicious test result is discovered after a presumptive result is initially obtained using approved test methods. When this happens, the regulatory agency may allow the industry to re-sample the bulk milk pickup tanker and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers. The reasons that made the re-sampling necessary shall be clearly documented in testing records and reported to the regulatory agency. This written record shall be provided to the regulatory agency and shall be maintained with the record of the testing for that load and/or raw-milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers. b. Screening Test Results Using Approved Test Methods -Re-sampling or additional analysis of screening test results should be discouraged . However, the regulatory agency may direct re-sampling and/ or analysis, when it has determined that procedures for sampling and/or analysis did not adhere to accepted NCIMS practices ( SM EDP, FDNNCIMS 2400 Forms, Appendix N. and the applicable FDA interpretative or informational memoranda). This decision by the regulatory agency shall be based on objective evidence. A regulatory agency allowing re-sampling shall plan a timely follow-up to identify the problem and initiate corrective action to ensure the problem that led to the need for re-sampling is not repeated. If re\u00ad sampling and/or analysis are necessary, it shall include a review of the samplers, analysts, and/or laboratories to identify the problem(s) and initiate corrective action to ensure the problem(s) is not repeated. The reasons that made the re-sampling or analysis necessary shall be clearly documented in testing records maintained by the regulatory agency, and shall be maintained with the record of the testing for that load and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers. N-12jA.f J<?rtO, 4. Producer Trace aack a. All screening test confirmed positive loads using an approved test method shall be broken down (producer trace back) using the same or an equivalent test method (M-I- 96-10, latest revision). Confirmation tests (load and producer trace back/permit action) shall be performed in an Official Laboratory , Officially Designated Laboratory , or by a CIS. Positive producers shall be handled in accordance with this appendix. Note: When a farm bulk milk tank(s)/silos, milk plant raw milk tank(s) and/or sllo(s), other raw milk storage container(s) , etc. is used for a milk plant's raw milk supply(ies) that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers is found to be confirmed positive for drug residues using an approved test method, the farm of origin for the drug residue has consequently already been determined and further testing is not required to determine the farm of origin. b. All verified screening positive loads using test methods not evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS without additional confirmation required shall be broken down (producer trace back) using the same test method. Verification producer trace back tests shall be performed as cited in a prior documented agreement with the regulatory agency (refer to Section VI), Verified screening positive producers shall be handled in accordance with this appendix.

ESTABLISHED TOLERANCES ANO/OR SAFE LEVELS OF DRUG RESIDUES ''Target testing levels\" are used by the FDA as guides for prosecutorial discretion. They do not legalize residues found in milk that are below the target testing levels. In short, the FDA uses the \"target testing levels\" as prosecutorial guidelines and in full consistency with CNI v. Young. They do not dictate any result; they do not limit the FDA's discretion in any way; and they do not protect milk producers or milk from court enforcement action. \"Target testing levels\" are not and cannot be transformed into tolerances that are established for animal drugs under Section 512 (b) of the FFO&CA as amended. \"Target testing levels\" do not: 1. Bind the courts, the public, including milk producers , or the FDA, including individual FDA employees . 2. Do not have the \"force of law\" of tolerances, or of binding rules. Notification , changes, or additions of \"target testing levels\" shall be transmitted via Memoranda of Information (M-l's). N-161..\\oJ.-nrl \\ V. APPROVED TEST METHODS Regulatory agencies and industry shall use test methods from M-a-85, latest revision, for analysis of bulk milk pickup tankers and/or all raw milk supplies that have not been transported in raw milk bulk milk pickup tankers for Beta lactams residues, following the testing procedures specified in Section Ill of this Appendix. AOAC First Action and AOAC Final Action methods are accepted in accordance with Section 6. Enforcement action based on each test method may be delayed until the evaluation is completed and the method is found to be acceptable to the FDA and complies with the provisions of Rule 420-3-16- .07. One (1) year after two (2) or more drug test methods have been evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS for a particular non-Beta lactam drug or drug family, other unevaluated drug test methods for that particular non-Beta lactam drug or drug family are not acceptable for determining a Screening Test Positive (Confirmation) on a milk tank truck load of milk and/or all raw milk supplies that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers. The acceptance of evaluated drug test methods by the FDA and the NCIMS for drugs other than Beta lactams does not mandate any additional screening by industry or regulatory agencies with the evaluated drug test method, unless it is determined by the Commissioner o f the FDA that a potential problem exists with other animal drug residues in the milk supply. New drug test methods which are submitted to NCIMS from the FDA for acceptance shall not detect drug residues at less than 50 percent of the tolerance level or 25 percent of the target testing level* for individual drugs, with the exception of the following that may be accepted for Appendix N and other drug testing: 1. Penicillin G at 2 ppb. 2. Tetracycline drug kits that detect tetracyclines at levels greater than 150 ppb for Chlortetracycline, 119 for Oxytetracycline , and 67 ppb for Tetracycline. *Target testing levels are set by the FDA based on available science. They are not determined by the detection limits of commercially available test methods. VI. TEST METHODS FOR NON-BETA LACTAMS RESIDUE TESTING THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY FDA AND ACCEPTED BY THE NCIMS Provided, that until at least two (2) test methods are found acceptable by the FDA and the NCIMS for detecting a particular drug or drug family, other than Beta lactams, as cited in M-a-85, latest revision, and M-1-92-11 in raw milk, non-Beta lactam screening test methods, which have not been evaluated and accepted by the FDA and the NCIMS, may be used for the initial screening, provided that the test method manufacturer's data indicates that testing sensitivity is at or below U.S. target testing/ or tolerance levels.

The appropriate regulatory agency may take control of the verified screening positive load and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers. A written copy of the verified screening positive test results shall follow the initial regulatory agency notification. The verified screening positive load and/or raw milk supply that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers shall be disposed of to remove it from the human or animal food chain. Producer trace back shall be conducted by industry using the same drug test method at the direction of the regulatory agency as cited in the prior documented agreement. If the initial producer test result from the drug test method is found to be positive, the sample shall promptly be retested in a facility identified in the prior documented agreement using the same drug test method. The Initial positive test is found to be a verified producer screening positive by promptly repeating in duplicate with positive ( +) and negative (-) controls that give the proper results, using the same test method, on the same sample, with one (1) or both of these duplicate retests giving a positive result. The regulatory agency shall be notified of the producer trace-back results. The verified screening positive milk is removed from the human and/or animal food chain, which is managed between the user of the test method, the milk supplier, and the dairy producer. Future pickups and/or use of the violative individual producer's milk are prohibited until subsequent testing, utilizing the same drug test method or equivalent that has not been evaluated by the FDA and accepted by the NCIMS, of a representative sample taken from the producer's milk, prior to commingling with any other milk, is no longer positive for drug residue. Whenever a drug residue test is verified screening positive, an investigation may be completed by the regulatory agency or its agent to determine the cause of the drug residue and actions taken to prevent future violations. Note: When a farm bulk milk tank(s)/silo(s) , milk plant raw milk tank(s) and/or silo(s), other raw milk storage container(s), etc. is used for a milk plant's raw milk supply(ies) that has not been transported in bulk milk pickup tankers is found to be confirmed positive for drug residues using an approved test method or verified screening positive for drug residues using test methods not evaluated by FDA and accepted by the NCIMS without additional confirmation required, the farm of origin for the drug residue has consequently already been determined and further testing is not required to determine the farm of origin.

VITAMIN FORTIFICATION OF FLUID MILK PRODUCTS PROCESS /METHODS OF VITAMIN ADDITION Vitamin fortification can be accomplished by the addition of vitamins at many different points in the processing system, preferably after separation . including the pasteurizing vat, to the HTST constant-level tank, or on a continuous basis into the pipeline after standardizat ion and prior to pasteurization in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendat ions. Both batch addition and addition with metering pumps can be used. The batch procedure requires accurate measurement of the volume of milk to be fortified, accurate measurement of the vitamin concentrate . and proper mixing. When a vitamin metering pump(s) is used with an HTST or HHST unit, the pump(s) shall be installed so as to be activated only when the unit is in forward-flow . The addition of vitamins shall be accomplished prior to pasteurizatron in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations . The problem of under fortification is often related to the point in the system where fortification takes place. Vitamins A and D are fat-soluble and will gradually become more concentrated in the milk fat portion of the milk. Both oil and water base vitamins are susceptible to this migration problem. If vitamins are added in the proper amount before separation and standardization , and the product is separated and standardized , then the low fat product will tend to be under fortified and the high fat product over fortified. Water-soluble vitamin concentrates can minimize this problem if vitamins are added before separation . Processo rs who use this procedure should perform confirmatory assays to ensure proper fortification levels of each product. Many HTST systems are now being used with in-line fat standardization , which also makes possible switching , without stopping, from milk and milk products being fortified with vitamin D to those being fortified with both A and D. These systems require metered injection of the proper vitamins at a point after standardization and before pasteurization . Sanitary positive-displacement pumps are available for this purpose. There are two (2) types available: 1. The first is a piston type metering pump without valves. It is equipped with a micrometer which allows accurate and reproducible amounts of vitamins to be added based on the rate of product flow through the system. 2. The other type is a peristaltic pump that offers precise control. This precise control is possible since the volume can be controlled by the tubing size and the pump speed. This system simplifies cleaning since only the tube is in contact with the vitamin concentrates . 0-1 I AI1n F. 1(l ~ These pumps have a history of reproduc1b11ity and reliability. All metering pumps should be designed to conform with these rules. The recommended injection point is after separation and prior to homogenization . This allows the homogenization process to distribute the vitamins throughout the milk. A check-valve is recommended to prevent milk from contaminating the vitamin concentrate . Separate pumps, tubing, and check-valves are recommended when multiple types of vitamin concentrates are injected (refer to Figure 58). Pumps should be calibrated based on the pasteurization system flow rate. If flow rates change for different milk products, additional vitamin pumps may be needed. Re-calibration of the metering pumps is not recommended without verifying the accuracy. Routine calibration of metering pumps is recommended. The following are recommended to achieve desired vitamin fortification levels: 1. Management shall be committed to proper fortification and concerned with both over and under levels. 2. Design the system correctly for proper addition in which concentrate 1s added after standardization and before pasteurization . 3. Written procedures and training should be provided to all employees responsible for vitamin fortification for each milk and milk product to be fortified. These procedures should focus on milk or milk product start-up and milk or milk product change-over . 4. Maintain accurate records of vitamins used and milk and milk products produced , checked daily against theoretical use. Care should be taken that adequate fortification of small run milk or milk products like skim milk is not masked by much larger volumes of reduced fat 2 percent or other partly skimmed milk products. METERING PUMPS Use an accurate, sanitary, positive-displacement metering pump with a scheduled cleaning procedure after use. For batch addition, use only accurate, calibrated measuring devices such as plastic graduated cylinders or pipettes. Measuring devices should be sized to the amount of concentrate added, i.e., if 8 ml is added. a 10 ml graduated cylinder would be appropriate . Measuring devices should be rinsed with the milk or milk product being fortified to ensure no residual concentrate is left. Use a check-valve on the injection line to prevent milk or milk product from being pushed back into the line. This depends on the pump displacement. Check the meter calibration regularly, including both the pump and the tubing, by determining delivery rate accuracy. Use only properly calibrated tubing for peristaltic pump systems and replace the tubing regularly, 0-2 I A I> JI ' 11 I 1 Storage vessels used for supplying vitamin concentrate to metering pumps should be emptied on a regular basis. A regular systematic cleaning and sanitizing schedule shall be maintained for these vessels, pumps, and tubing. Vitamin concentrates should be stored and held in accordance with the manufacturer 's recommendations for maximum shelf life. Vitamin metering pumps should be interwired with the flow divert and recycle valves to prevent operation during divert and/or recycle flows. Analyze finished products regularly. Results should be reported in International Units (1.U.)/Quart. Because of the sensitivity and difficulty in performing these tests, it is necessary to procure the services of a competent laboratory ; one that is familiar with the handling and testing of vitamin fortified dairy products. Care shall be taken when reprocessing reclaimed product so vitamin A and/or D levels do not exceed the label claims by more than 150 percent. GOOD MANUFACTUR ING PRACTICES Good manufacturing practices require that the vitamin A and D levels be in compliance with 21 CFR 131.110 states: \"(b) Vitamin addition (Optional). (1) If added vitamin A shall be present in such quantity that each quart of the food contains not less than 2000 I.U. thereof within limits of good manufacturing practices. (2) If added, vitamin D shall be present in such quantity that each quart of the food contains 400 1.U. thereof within limits of good manufacturing practice.'' For the purpose of label claims, compliance for nutritional labeling of food 21 CFR 101.9appliesandstates \u00b7 (3) (i) Class I. Added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods. (4) (i) Class I vitamins, mineral, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Therefore , if added, the acceptable range for vitamins A and Din the standardized milk products listed in 21 CFR, 131.110 Milk, 131.111 Acidified Milk, 131.112 Cultured Milk, 131.127 Nonfat Dry Mtlk Fortified with vitamins A and D (vitamin addition not optional), 131.200 Yogurt, 131.203 Lowfat Yogurt, and 131. 206 Nonfat Yogurt are as follows: \"'100-150 percent of label claims= (400 -600 I.U. per quart for vitamin D and 2000 -3000 1.U. per quart for v[tamin A) *Within method variability 0-3 I A J.l 11 E n Fluid milk products found below 100 percent or above 150 percent of the required values or label claims should be resampled and the cause of the problem determined . Additionally , 21 CFR 130.1 O -Requirements for foods named by use of a nutrient content claim and a standardized term states: \"That nutrients must be added to the food to restore nutrient levels so that the product is not nutritionally inferior to the standardized food for products which combine a nutrient content claim, i.e., lowfat. non\u00ad fat, or reduced fat, with a standardized term, i.e., milk, sour cream, eggnog.\" Therefore , vitamins A and D shall be added to dairy products from which fat has been removed; such as, reduced fat, lowfat, and nonfat dairy products, in an amount necessary to replace the amount of these vitamins lost in the removal of fat. TESTING METHODS Test methods used for the detection of vitamins A and/or D shall be acceptable to the FDA or other official methodologies that give statistically equivalent results to the FDA methods. Vitamin analysis shall be conducted in a laboratory accredited by the FDA and acceptable to the Health Officer (refer to M-a-98, latest revision, for the specific milk and/or milk products that have FDA validated and NCIMS accepted test methods for vitamins). TYPE OF CONCENTRATES AVAILABLE A number of different types of concentrates are available. All contain vitamin D and/or vitamin A palmitate with a carrier consisting of any of the following: butter oil corn oil, evaporated milk, non-fat dry milk, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, and glycerol monooleate . It is best to store all concentrates under refrigeration unless manufacturer 's directions indicate otherwise . To achieve adequate dispersion, viscous concentrates should be brought to room temperature before addition. NEED FOR ADDITION Vitamin A is fat-soluble , It will dissolve when mixed with fat and will not dissolve in water. For this reason, vitamin A is found in whole milk and to a lesser degree in low fat and absent in non-fat milk, unless these products are fortified. Vitamin D is the major regulator of calcium absorption in the intestine. Fortification of fresh milk with vitamin D is acknowledged to have virtually eliminated rickets in milk drinking children. Since normal levels of vitamin D are necessary for optimal calcium absorption in children, it is also known that these levels are required as one increases in age. It has been associated with reducing the incidence of osteoporosis in premenopausal women. Vitamin A performs many functions. One is to enable the retina of the eye to respond to dim light. Deficiency of vitamin A produces night blindness. Vitamin A is also involved in the ability of the eye to discern color. 0-4 I ti,, rJ \u00b5 c J , Excessive levels of vitamins A and D in fluid milk can be a potential t11reat to public health. Over fortification with levels of vitamin A over 6,000 1.U. and vitamin D over 800 1.U. in fluid milk should be referred to FDA for a health hazard review. PROBLEMS INVOLVED WITH FORTIFICATION Milk and milk products that contain a large proportion of fat are relatively good dietary sources of vitamin A, but as is the cBse with other natural foods, the vitamin D content of unfortified milk is quite low. As with other milk component s, vitamin A and D levels are affected by breed, season, diet, lactation, and in the case of vitamin D, animal exposure to sunlight. In general, when lactating animals are transferred from pasture to winter rations in the fall, a decline in the vitamin A and D levels can be expected in the raw milk. This occurs slowly through the winter season until the animals are once more on pasture in the spring. With the proper selection of feed and diet concentrates, this effect can be kept to a minimum . Natural levels of vitamin A range from 400 1.U. in winter to 1200 1.U. in summer, and vitamin D, 5 1.U. in winter to 40 1.U. in summer. These are approximate ranges to indicate possible seasonal variations . Because of seasonal and other variations in natural vitamin levels, it is necessary to monitor the level of fortification to assure that levels are within good manufacturing practices. Vitamin concentrate potency degrades with time. Concentrates should be stored in accordance with manufacturer's recommendation to maintain label potency Vitamin concentrate potency should be verified by the vitamin supplier. Vitamin D is very stable in homogenized whole milk and is not affected by pasteurization or other processing procedures . Vitamin D in fortified homogenized whole milk will remain constant with little or no loss of vitamin potency during long periods of proper storage. No loss of vitamin D will be experienced under normal shelf life periods. Vitamins A and D fortified skim milk products are subject to decreases in vitamin A, because the vitamin is no longer protected by fat as it is in whole milk. In fluid skim or low fat milk, added vitamin A deteriorates gradLially during normal storage of the milk at 4.5\u00b0C (40\u00b0F) in the dark but is destroyed rapidly when the milk is exposed to sunlight in transparent glass bottles or translucent plastic containers . The photo destruction of added vitamin A is dependent on the intensity and wave-length of light and the milk source. The use of amber or brown glass bottles, pigmented plastic containers formulated with specific light barriers and colored paper cartons retard this destruction . Vitamin A losses in reduced fat milk 2 percent from five (5) dairy plants ranged from 8 percent to 31 percent when they were exposed to 200 foot-candles (220 lux) of fluorescent light for twenty-four (24) hours in opaque plastic containers . Use of pigmented containers or gold shields over fluorescent tubes practically eliminated these losses. Note: Figure 58 details a two (2) speed vitamin fortification installation using two (2) pumps and two (2) vitamin concentrate sources. This enables changing from 0-5 I A ,p P e , d different vitamin concentrates and different speed pumps via the adjustment of three-way valves. Recommendations : 1. Use a sanitary check-valve(s) to separate milklines from vitamin concentrates . 2, All milk or milk product-contact surfaces should be of a sanitary design. easily cleanable, and available for inspection .

PERFORMANCE -BASED DAIRY FARM INSPECTION SYSTEM A performance-based inspection system is an option to the traditional routine inspection frequency of at least once every six (6) months on Grade \"A\" dairy farms. This option provides Regulatory Agencies with a choice. For some regulatory agencies, inspecting every farm routinely twice a year may provide effective regulatory oversight and make efficient use of inspection resources. For other regulatory agencies, an optional system which determines routine farm inspection frequency based on producer milk quality and inspection performance may be more desirable, equally effective, and make the most efficient use of limited inspection resources. The overall inspection effort devoted to a performance-based farm inspection system may be more or less than the traditional inspection system which requires a routine inspection at least once every six (6) months per farm. INSPECTION INTERVAL ANO CRITERIA Dairy farms shall be categorized at least every three (3) months using the previous twelve (12) month farm inspection and milk quality data .

DETERMINAT ION OF TIME/TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR SAFETY MILK AND/OR MILK PRODUCTS The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) prepared and submitted a report as part of a contract with the FDA that contains responses to various questions posed by the FDA about potentially hazardous food (PHF). !FT reviewed the evolution of the term PHF and recommended a change to time/temperature control for safety (TCS) food, as well as a science-based framework for determining the effectiveness of processing technologies that formulate a food. The report examines intrinsic factors such as aw. pH, redox potential. natural, and added antimicrobia l and competitive microorgan isms; and extrinsic factors such as packaging , atmospheres , storage conditions . processing steps, and new preservation technologies that influence microbial. growth. The report also analyzes microbial hazards related to time/temperature control of foods for safety. IFT developed a framewor k that could be used to determine whether a food is a TCS or not. Part of the framework, applicable to Grade \"A\" milk and milk products Includes two tables that consider the interaction of pH and aw in milk and milk products, whether the milk or milk product is pasteurized and subsequently packaged (Table A), or not pasteurized or pasteurized but not packaged (Table B). When further product assessment (PA) is required, the application of microbiological challenge testing (inoculation studies) is discussed along with pathogen modeling programs and reformulation of the milk and/or milk product. An extensive reference list is included in the report. TCS food is defined in terms of whether or not it requires time/temperature control for safety to limit pathogen growth or toxin formation. The definition does not address foods that do not support growth but may contain a pathogenic microorganism or chemical or physical food safety hazard at a level sufficient to cause foodborne Jllness or injury. The progressive growth of all foodborne pathogens is considered whether slow or rapid. The definition of TCS takes into consideration aw, pH, aw and pH interaction, pasteurization, and subsequent packaging for a relatively simple determination of whether the food requires time/temperature control for safety. If a milk or milk product is pasteurized to eliminate pathogenic vegetative cells, it needs to be addressed differently than a raw product or a raw product subjected to inadequate heating. In addition, if a milk or milk product is packaged after pasteurizat ion to prevent re-contamination , higher ranges of pH and/or aw can be tolerated because spore-forming bacteria are the only microbial hazards of concern. Milk and milk products shall be protected from contamination in an area with limited access and packaged at a temperature in compliance with the Grade '~\" PMO requirements . In some milk or milk products, it is possible that neither the pH value nor the aw value is low enough by itself to control or eliminate pathogen growth; however, the interaction of pH and aw may be able to accomplish it. This is an example of a hurdle technology. Hurdle technology is utilized when several inhibitory factors are used together to control or eliminate pathogen growth that would otherwise be Ineffective when used alone. R-1 1 -1 p r., \"t1 i j( Another important factor to consider is combination products. A combination product is one (1) in which there are two (2) or more distinct food components, and an interface between the two (2) components may have a different property than either of the components present. Determine whether the food has distinct components such as cottage cheese curd with fruits and/or vegetables to be added and the creaming mixture, or does it have a uniform consistency such as the cottage cheese creaming mixture or plain yogurt. In these products, the pH at the interface is important in determining if the item ts a TCS milk or milk product. Appropriate evidence acceptable to FDA such as other published scientific research and/or an inoculation study should be used to determine whether a food can be held without time/temperature control when: 1. Combination products are prepared; or 2. Other extrinsic factors (packaging/atmospheres) or intrinsic factors (redox potential, salt content, antimicrobials, etc.) found in the food are used to control or eliminate pathogen growth. Before using Tables A and B, which are included in the definition of 17merremperature Control for Safety of Milk and/or Milk Products of these rules, in determining whether a milk or milk product requires TCS, answers to the following questions should be considerecl: 1. Is the intent to hold the milk or milk product without using time or temperature control? If the answer is \"No\", no further action is required. The decision tree is not needed to determine if the item is a TCS milk or milk product. 2. Is the milk or milk product raw or heat-treated , or is the milk or milk product pasteurized? 3. Does the Grade '~\" PMO already require TCS for the milk or milk product? 4. Does a product history with good scientific rationale exist indicating a safe history of use? 5. Is the milk and/or milk product processed and packaged so that it does not require TCS; such as aseptically processed and packaged Grade \"A\" low-acid milk and/or milk products and/or retort processed after packaged Grade \"A\" low-acid milk and/or milk products? 6. What is the aw and pH of the milk or milk product in question using laboratory results accepted by FDA. A milk or milk product designated PA (further product assessment required) in either Table A or B should be considered TCS until sufficient information is provided to demonstrate the safety of the product. The PA shall be an evaluation of the milk or milk R-2 I A ;i ;, o? n d I x product group's ability to not support pathogenic growth. Means to evaluate this assessment include (but are not limited to): literature review of similar milk products, inoculation studies, expert risk assessment, and/or Health Officer assessment. A milk or milk product designated PA (further product assessment required) in either Table A or B should be considered TCS until sufficient information is provided to demonstrate the safety of the product. The PA will be an evaluation of the product or product group's ability to not support pathogenic growth. Means to evaluate this assessment include (but are not limited to): literature review of similar products, inoculation studies, expert risk assessment , and/or state regulatory assessment. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING TABLES AAND B 1. Does the operator want to hold the milk or milk product without using time or temperature control? a. No: Continue holding the milk or milk product at 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F) or less as required in the Grade \"A\" PMO. b. Yes: Continue using the decision tree to identify which table to use to determine whether TCS is required. 2. Is the milk or milk product pasteurized? a. No: The milk or milk product is either raw or heat-treated. Proceed to Step 3. b. Yes: The milk or milk product is pasteurized to the required minimum time and temperature for the milk or milk product as specified in the definition of pasteurization of these rules. Proceed to Step 4. 3. Is the milk or milk product treated using some other method equivalent to pasteurization? a. No: The milk or milk product is raw or heat-treated which may allow vegetative cells and spores to survive. Proceed to Step 6. b. Yes: If another method equivalent to pasteurization is used to destroy pathogens such as irradiation , high pressure processing , pulsed light, ultrasound , inductive heating, etc., the new technology shall have been recognized by the FDA as providing milk or milk product safety equal to pasteurization , and the effectiveness of the process shall be demonstrated by sufficient evidence or other means proceed to Step 5. 4. Is it packaged to prevent re-contamination? a. No: Re-contamination of the product can occur after pasteurization because it is not immediately packaged. Proceed to Step 6 and use Table 8. R-3 I A 11 r e n d l 3 b. Yes: If the milk or milk product is packaged immediately after pasteurization to prevent re-contamination, higher ranges of aw and/or pH can be tolerated because spore-forming bacteria are the only microbial hazard. Proceed to Step 6 and use Table A. 5. Further PA or plant documentation required. a. The manufacturer of this product may be able to supply evidence acceptable to the FDA that indicate the milk or milk product can be safely held without TCS. b. Milk and milk products prepared or processed using new technologies may be held without time/temperature control provided the new technology has been recognized by the FDA as providing milk or milk product safety equal to pasteurization and provided the effectiveness of the use of such technologies is based on evidence accepted by the FDA. 6. Using the milk or milk product's processing parameters , known aw and/or pH values, position the milk or milk product in the appropriate table. a. Choose the column under ''pH Values'' that contains the pH value of the milk or milk product in question. b. Choose the row under \"aw Values\" that contains the a.,.,, value of the milk or milk product in question. c. Note where the row and column intersect to identify whether the milk or milk product is Non-TCS and therefore does not require time/temperature control, or whether further PA is required. Other factors such as redox potential, competitive microorganisms . salt content, or processing methods may allow the product to be held without time/temperature control; however, evidence acceptable to the FDA is required. 7. Use Table B for milk or milk products that are not pasteurized or pasteurized but not immediately packaged , where both pathogenic spores and vegetative cells may be a concern, or use Table A for milk and milk products that are pasteurized and immediately packaged , where only pathogenic spores are of concern. 8.
