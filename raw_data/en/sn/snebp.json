T he following sites are NOT deemed high risk: tonsil, isolated bone marrow involvement, epidural, cranio -facial involvement unless erosion through base of skull . Caution in patients over 70 years of age, and/or with significant co -morbidities. TREATMENT INTENT Used as prophylaxis alongside a curative regimen PRE-ASSESSMENT 1. Blood tests - FBC, creatinine, LFTs, urate, calcium, magnesium, creatinine, LFTs, glucose, hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis B surface Ag, hepatitis C antibody , group and save. 2. Assess creatinine clearance before prescribing. Methotrexate may cause r enal damage primarily due to the precipitation of methotrexate and its metabolites in the renal tubules . Consider measured GFR (for example, 51Cr-EDTA) in patients at higher risk of methotrexate toxicity, for example patients >65 years, and /or other significant co -morbidities (see below). 3. Confirm medication history. Counsel p atients they MUST NOT take co-trimoxazole in the week before the high dose methotrexate infusion until adequate clearance of methotrexate from the blood due to increased risk of renal toxicity. NSAIDs and penicillin antibiotics should also be avoided before and during methotrexate i nfusion (see INTERACTIONS below) .

ECG +/ - Echo - if clinically indicated . 5. Record performance status (WHO/ECOG). 6. Record height and weight. 7. Consent - ensure patient has received adequate verbal and written information regarding their disease, treatment and potential side effects. Document in medical notes all information that has been given. Obtain written consent on the day of treatment. 8. Fertility - it is very important the patient understands the potential risk of infertility; all patients should be offered fertility advice by referring to the Oxford Fertility Unit . 9. A fluid space, e.g. , pleural effusion or ascites, is potentially very dangerous as methotrexate can accumulate and cause prolonged toxicity. High dose methotrexate should not be given in such cases. 10. Asses the risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Refer to the Tumour Lysis Synd rome in Adults protocol (H.8). 11. Urine pregnancy test \u00ad before cycle 1 of each chemotherapy course for women of child -bearing age unless they are post -menopausal, have been sterilised or undergone a hysterectomy. 12. Treatment should be agreed in the relevant MDT. DRUG REGIMEN Day Time Drug Dose Route Administration details 0 -12hrs Pre-hydration and alkalization See table below 1 0 METHOTREXATE 3g/m2 IV infusion in 500mL sodium chloride 0.9% over 3 hours 1 +3hrs Post-hydration alkalization See table below 2 +24hrs Calcium foliniate (Folinic acid) See table below CYCLE FREQUENCY: 21 days DURATION: 2 - 4 cycles * * Normally 2 c ycles of intravenous methotrexate would be administered, after a full course of R-CHOP chemotherapy (typically 6 cycles). R -CHOP chemotherapy should not be interrupted for administration of IV methotrexate (unless for intravascular DLBCL) . 2-4 doses of form part of the CNS prophylaxis regimen in particular high risk cases such as testicular lymphoma , to be administered with the first few courses of R -CHOP (or equivalent chemotherapy). Pre-hydration and alkalization Start 12 hours before methotrexate infusion IV continuous infusion: Glucose 2.5%, less than 1.6m2). Duration: continuous infusi on for 15 hours (run concurrently with methotrexate infusion). PO: Sodium bicarbonate 1500mg four times daily. Dipstick urine every 2 hours to check if pH over 7. If pH under 7, give additional sodium bicarbonate (PO) 1500mg. Lymphoma group This is a controlled document and therefore must not be changed or photocopied L.13 High dose METHOTREXATE (high grade NHL CNS prophylaxis) Lymphoma Published: July 2022 Review: July 2024 Version 2.0 3 of 6 Urine output Check: Every 4 hours. Aim: 400 mL/m2/4 hours (approximately 700 mL over 4 hours). Furosemide: Administer 20 -40 mg to maintain urine output. Post -hydration and alkalization Start immediately at the end of methotrexate infusion IV continuous infusion: 1000mL Glucose 2.5%, less than 1.6m2). Duration: continuous infusion until level < 0.1 mi cromol/L. PO: Sodium bicarbonate 1500mg four times daily. Dipstick urine every 2 hours to check if pH over 7. If pH under 7, give additional sodium bicarbonate (PO) 1500mg. Review the need for regular sodium bicarbonate at the end of methotrexate infusion and continue as appropriate until methotrexate levels < 0.1 micromol/L. Calcium folinate (folinic acid) Start 24 hours after the START of methotrexate infusion 30mg IV injection every 3 hours for 4 doses, then 30mg IV injection (or tablets can be gi ven orally if no nausea or vomiting) every 6 hours until methotrexate levels < 0.1 micromol/L. RESTAGING On completion of 2 cycles of HD MTX GLUCARPIDASE - reversal agent for methotrexate -induced renal dysfunction NHS England will fund glucarpidase as a reversal agent for methotrexate (unlicensed in UK) for adults receiving high -dose methotrexate chemotherapy (doses >1g/m2) Who develop significant deterioration in renal function (>1.5x ULN and rising, or the presen ce of oliguria) , Have toxic plasma methotrexate level s, Have been treated with all standard rescue and supportive measures , At risk of life -threatening methotrexate -induced toxicities Administration of glucarpidase should optimally occur within 60 hours from the start of the HD MTX infusion, because life threatening toxicities may not be preventable beyond this time point . The recommended dose is one single intravenous injection of 50 units/kg . Multiple doses are not permitted under the NHSE Glucarpidase policy Refer to TVCA Glucarpidase guideline for full details . DOSE MODIFICATIONS All dose modifications must be discussed with consultant. Haematological toxicities: Proceed with each cycle only if neutrophils > 1.0 x 109/L and platelets > 75 x 109/L. Lymphoma group This is a controlled document and therefore must not be changed or photocopied L.13 High dose METHOTREXATE (high grade NHL CNS prophylaxis) Lymphoma Published: July 2022 Review: July 2024 Version 2.0 4 of 6 Non-haematological toxicities: Dose reduction should be considered in patients > 70 years due to reduced liver and kidney function as well as lower folate reserves which occur with increased age. Renal impairment Hepatic impairment Methotrexate GFR 60mL/min: contraindicated - use alternative therapy Mild and moderate : caution required : consider dose reduction or discontinue with concomitant renal impairment or constant increase in liver enzymes (see below **) - clinical decision . Severe : contraindicated *Consider measured GFR at consultant's discretion (for example, 51Cr-EDTA) in patients > 65 years, and/or with BMI 30 and other significant co -morbidities (for example, cardiac disease). ** It is expected that patients receiving high dose methotrexate will develop hypertransaminasemia and occasionally hyperbilirubinemia. These elevations can last up to 2 weeks following the methotrexate infusion and are not considered toxicity requiring disc ontinuation of repeated administration of methotrexate. Persist ent hyperbilirubinemia and/or grade 3 -4 hyper - transaminasemia for longer than 3 weeks should result in discontinuation of the drug. CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients . Renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 60 m L/min). Severe hepatic impairment.

INVESTIGATIONS FBC, creatinine, LFTs, CXR CONCURRENT MEDICATION Aciclovir 200 mg three times a day for duration of treatment and for 3 months after completion PJP prophylaxis Co-trimoxazole should be stopped a week before the high -dose methotrexate infusion and must be held until methotrexate level is < 0.1 micromol/L and neutrophil count recovery , when it can be restarted (480-960mg three times a week, on Mon / Wed / Fri) Pre- and post -hydration with sodium bicarbonate See DRUG REGIMEN above Lymphoma group This is a controlled document and therefore must not be changed or photocopied L.13 High dose METHOTREXATE (high grade NHL CNS prophylaxis) Lymphoma Published: July 2022 Review: July 2024 Version 2.0 5 of 6 EMETIC RISK Moderate INTERACTIONS (Consult with pharmacist and refer to SmPC for full details) Co-trimoxazole Avoid concomitant use. Acute megaloblastic pancytopenia, probably due to additive inhibition of the dihydrofolic acid reductase can occur. Co -trimoxazole should be stopped a week before the start of methotrexate and held until methotrexate levels < 0.1micr omol/L and neutrophil count recovery. Penicillins Avoid concomitant use. Reduced renal clearance of methotrexate can occur. Tazocin (piperacillin with tazobactam) should NOT be used during high dose methotrexate administration until methotrexate levels < 0.1 micromol/L. Consider using meropenem or another alternative. NSAIDs and salicylates Avoid concomitant use. Severe (including fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anaemia and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administr ation of methotrexate (usually in high dosage). Proton pump inhibitors Avoid concomitant use. Delayed elimination and increased serum methotrexate can occur. Antidiabetic agents Insulin -dependent diabetes should be carefully monitored because liver cirrhosis and an increase in transaminases can occur.
