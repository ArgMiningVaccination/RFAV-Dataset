Till it is not justified to cure by any medicine and long term prevention by vaccination.[5] But some Ayurvedic short term procedure may reduce the affects and mor tality rate of patients . Here we can follow the theory that is \"Prevention is the Best Medicine\". Actually the oldest Ayurvedic systems of medicine based on \"Protect health of the healthy and alleviate disorders in the diseased\". Ayurvedic systems of medic ine clearly describe the cause, mode of transmission and prevention of various infectious and epidemic diseases in the name of aupasargic roga (communicable sthana chapter three describes the communicable and epidemic diseases as the term of Janapadodhwans which means destruction or annihilation of communities or settlements. It mentioned vayu (air), udak (water), desha (soil & area), kala (time) are the factors responsible for Janapadodhwansha - epidemics.[7] The other root causes of communicable diseases are adarma it means not following individual's duty to the community. It also means people are not maintaining dincharya (daily regimen), ritucharya (seasonal regimen), and a char rasayan ( behavioral therapy ).[8] All these things are responsible for hampering the immunity of an individual. Communicable and epidemic diseases are as termed as aupasargic roga in chapter five of nidana sthana in Susruta It describes kustha skin disease), jwara (pyrexia or fever), shosha (kock's or tuberculosis) etc are communicable diseases and spreads through contaminated objects. The mode of disease transmission may be prasangat (close contact), gatra samsparshat (physical con 2394 -3211 2020,7(6) , 81-85 ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) is an infectious disease that causes the highest morbidity and mortality in the world. More than 17 million people affected and died 1 lakh more globally until dated 11 April 2020. More research is g oing on but till no drug or vaccine justified to cure or prevent this disease. So prevention is the way to reduce the frequency of affecting and mortality until the innovation of a new drug or vaccine. Some Aurvedic therapeutic procedures may help to preve nt various communicable diseases like COVID -19. Ayurveda is the oldest medical system in the world and its practice in Indian subcontinent for many years. The Ayurvedic systems of medicine describes the cause, mode of transmission and prevention of various infectious and epidemic diseases in the name of the aupasargic roga (communicable disease) and (treatment) like nidana parivarjan (avoid the diseases causing and aggravating factors), apakarshana (elimination therapy), prakriti vighata (breaking the therapy ) and sattvavajaya chikitsa (mind control therapy) may help to prevent various infectious and communicable diseases 13, Dhaka 1221, Bangladesh. www.ejpmr.com Huda. European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical R esearch 82 (close contact such as sharing food), sahashayya (sleeping together), asana (using same sitting arrangement), vastra (using same cloth), aulepa (using same cosmetics) an d malya (using same garlands) etc. through from person to person. The above all the references are closely related to modern medicine. [9] Ayurvedic Pathogenesis of Communicable Diseases Health is defined in Ayurveda as the equilibrium of three body humor s (vata, pitta and kapha), digestive fire (agni), all body tissues (dhatus), waste products (malas) with pleasantly disposed and satisfied mind, senses and spirit.[10] If any components either increase or decrease that is unhealthy or disease. Furthermore, the oja (the fine essence of all dhatus) or immunity is the important factor to maintain the healthy state or disease free. Depletion of immunity is the prevalence of communicable diseases, according to great Ayurvedic physician Charaka .[11] He also said if anyone have vitiated bodies humors, body tissues and depletion of immunity those are more susceptible to diseases. Later on the Ayurveda also accepts the macro and microorganism as a Aguntuja hetu (exogenous factor) that vitiate the body humors which af fect body tissue and leads diseases if immunity depleted. So Ayurveda strongly recommended that the transmission of diseases from one person to another depends upon the strength of immunity. Therefore, person with low immunity have more chance to affects b y different communicable diseases . Ayurvedic Management of Communicable Diseases The Ayurvedic treatment encompasses the equilibrium of dosha (body humors), dhatua (body tissue), mala (waste products), indriya (sense organ) and mana (mind). Basically Ayur vedic systems of medicine followed three types of treatment procedure like yukti vyapaashrya (rational treatment) , daivavyapaashrya (spiritual treatment) and satvavajaya chikitsa (psycho -somatic treatment). Here rational treatment is more applicable becaus e it comprises shodhana (ayurvedic cleansing therapy that is used to remove toxins from the body) and shaman chikitsa (ayurvedic medicines are used internally and externally to that reduce, suppress, and eliminate disease symptoms). Charaka describes three different modalities viz. apakarshana (elimination therapy), (breaking the pathogenesis of diseases) and nidaana parivarjan (avoid the diseases causing and aggravating factors) in management of micro and macro organisms tend to produce co mmunicable diseases.[12] Some other Ayurvedic procedures and protocols like dincharya (daily regimen), ritucharya (seasonal rasayan chikitsa ) and achar rasayan (behavioral therapy ) also help various infectious dis eases.[13] Nidaana Parivarjana Chikitsa ( Avoidance of disease causing and aggravating factors) : Nidan parivarjan means to avoid the known causative factors of a particular disease.[14] It can be followed by lifestyle modification such as dincharya (daily regimen), ritucharya (seasonal regimen) and sadvritta (rules of good conduct) . Here WHO instructions should follow to prevent the infection of SARS -CoV -2.[15] Regularly and thoroughly clean hands with an alcohol -based hand rub or wash with soap and water at least 20 seconds. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing . Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Practice respiratory hygiene . Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs. Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people. Apakarshana Chikitsa (elimination therapy): Apakarshana is the process by which the unwanted components removed or eliminated from the body by using a various purificatory process like may help to eliminate the toxins or unwanted components from the body. As COVID -19 spreads by droplet so here nasal installation might be helpful to protect the organism to enter into the lungs through nasal route. Because after putting two -three drops of sesame oil or any other medicated oil like anu tail or sarab indu taila in each nostril, it will lubricate the nasal passage and strengthen the inner mucus membrane to hold off the foreign bodies. Prakriti Vighata Chikitsa (breakup the pathogenesis of diseases): Prakriti vighata means by which destroy the favorable environment for growth of organisms and that stop the disease processed. Basically Ayurvedic pharmacology karma (action) of particular drugs. According to Charaka the drugs those having the taste of katu (pungent), tikta (bitter), kashaaya (astringent), and properties of kshra (alkali), ushna (hot), that aids to decreases the unwanted substances or toxins or foreign body from the body[16], so that body can produce more defensive activity against the organisms. There are some single drugs (astringent) taste, and ushna (hot) property that might stop the re plication of SARS -CoV -2 and reduce the symptomatic relief of COVID -19. Among them past studies also and Medical R esearch 83 and Piper nigrum[22], has the antiviral effects against respiratory infection in human. Rasayan Chikitsa ( Rejuvenation therapy ): COVID -19 is an immune responsive disease , the immune response is required to remove the virus SARS -CoV -2 infection and to prevent disease progression f rom mild to severe stages.[23] So rejuvenation therapy would be very supportive from the attack of communicable and infectious diseases like COVID -19. Aacharya Charak also describe the rejuvenation therapy may be used as prophylactic for communicable disea se with minimal precautions.[24] Specifically, immunomodulatory effects. Either single or combined use of above plants may boost up the immunity in human and that may help to less chances to be affects by SARS -CoV -2 infection. World Health Organization state that the mental and psychosocial well - being is very crucial in different target groups during the outbreak of COVID -19.[30] Here achara rasayan (behavioral therapy ) should follow for maintaining a healthy state of physically, mentally, socially and spiritually.[31] Because the behavioral therapy may enhance the positive emotions and experiences of life, which promote the production of immunity. The regular practice of behavioral therapy makes the person more ethical, social, moral and religious so that the internal environment of the body can be mai ntained and the disease process can be stopped . Vayam (Exercise): Exercise is an essential component for promotion of health and curing the disease of a patient. It is the easiest way that keeps the person free from various physical and mental disorders a nd assistance to rejuvenation and longevity without any medication.[32] Globally 6% of death are responsible due to physical inactivity according to WHO.[33] Acharya Caraka says exercise is the process of physical activity that alleviate the imbalanced bod y humors, stimulate the digestive fire and brings the firmness, strength and increase the immunity.[34] So, one can achieve healthy and longer life by performing exercise daily can prevent many diseases like COVID -19. Pathya (Wholesome food): According to Ayurveda, the wholesome food is referred as the \"Greatest Medicine.\" The wholesome food is the wellbeing of human growth but unwholesome food is the root of all diseases.[34] The wholesome food nourishes the mind, body and soul and proper quantity provide s strength, vigor, good complexion and nourishes the tissues.[36] The food based on age, lifestyle, climate, health conditions and body constitution.[37] Nutrition has a significant role in supporting the immune system.[38] Immune system is the key to prev ent infection and disease. So a healthy, balanced diet that contains vitamins A, B6, B9, B12, C, D, and E, and the minerals iron, selenium, copper and zinc can support the immune system. It might be advantageous to fight against COVID -19 although there is no evidence that prevents the effects of COVID -19. Sattvavajaya Chikitsa (Mind Control Therapy): Basically, mind control therapy includes replacement of emotions, assurance and psycho -shock therapy. Mind control therapy is applied in varying forms in all kinds of diseases, but specially indicated in mental diseases.[39] According to Ayurveda the mind can control by correction of misconceptions, self -realization, adaptations of prophylactic measures, better inter -person relationships, change negative thoug hts, high level of awareness etc.[40] Thus, this way mind control therapy can play a significant role in the maintenance of a pleasant state between the body and mind, and can use as a prophylaxis of various diseases including newly emerging diseases like COVID -19. CONCLUSIONS The pandemic COVID -19 infection is a global burden, no doubt that will impact on every aspect of life, so until the invention of any vaccination and curative treatment the regular practice of above therapeutics or technique may prote ct the incidence of COVID -19 and may come down the mortality rate of COVID -19.
