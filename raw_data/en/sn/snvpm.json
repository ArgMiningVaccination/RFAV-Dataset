This includes a wide spectrum of patients including patients admitted for medical/surgical management due to their primary pulmonary diagnosis. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 2 This standard of care does not apply to patients with cystic fi brosis (CF) or lung transplant for standard of PT practice. For informat ion regarding the physical therapy ( PT) management of patients with CF please refer to Standard of Care: Cystic Fibrosis . For information regarding the management of patients after lung transplant please refer to Standard of Care: Inpatient Management of the Patient Status Post Lung Transplant . Indications for Treatment: Understanding normal and abnormal pulmonary physiology is important for PTs in the acute care setting in order to distinguish whether a patient has restrictive or obstructive disease. The PT treatment of these two types of pulmonary dise ase varies and understanding this physiolo gy helps to direct the therapy intervention and treatment plan. Normal Pulmonary Physiology In healthy, normal pulmonary physiology , respiration occurs as a result of diffusion, perfusion, and ventilation. Respiration is the process of gas exchange i n the lungs facilitated by diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of gases from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. Oxygen (O 2) naturally diffuses into pulmonary capillaries to oxygenate the body while carbon dioxide (CO 2) diffuses i nto alveoli for exhalation. Perfusion is the amount of blood flow to the lungs which allows this diffusion to occur. Ventil ation is the mechanical movement of air into and out of the lungs. The normal ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio is 0.8 as alveolar ventilation is ~4 L/min and pulmonary blood flow is ~5 L/min. Ventilation is optimized in areas of least resistance such as areas where alveoli are more expanded. Perfusion is greatest in gravity dependent areas; therefore in sitting the upper lobes ini tially receive more ventilation while perfusion is greatest at the base of the lungs. In supine perfusion is greatest in the posterior lung fields while ventilation is greatest in anterior lung fields. Impaired Pulmonary Physiology In some cases of im paired pulmonary physiology a venous admixture is created which is a mixing of unoxygenated blood with oxygenated blood. This has two causes: an anatomic shunt, and a low V/Q ratio. An anatomic shunt occurs when blood bypasses alveoli; in the lungs this occurs when bronchial venous blood (deoxygenated) drains into pulmonary veins (oxygenated) in conditions involving consolidation , such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema . A low V/Q ratio occurs when there is insufficient alveolar ventilation to fully oxygena te all of the blood passing through pulmonary capillaries. A physiological shunt describes blood that is not oxygenated due to inadequate ventilation. Physiological dead space is wasted oxygen which is not absorbed by blood due to impaired diffusion. Obstructive lung disease Obstructive lung disease is a disease of the airways that produces obstruction to expiratory airflow. This obstruction may be caused by different mechanisms that decrease the size of the bronchial lumen and/or increase the resista nce to expiratory airflow. Common signs and symptoms of obstructive lung disease are dyspnea on exertion (DOE), cough, secretion production, tachypnea, hypoxemia, decreased breath sounds.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a. Definition: COPD is a generic term referring to lung diseases that cause air trapping resulting in hyperinflation if the lungs. It is most commonly a combination of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema is the destruction of the alveolar walls and enlargement of the air spaces distal to terminal bronchioles. It is associated with bullae which are large air collections within a thin outer wall which can cause spontaneous pneumothorax. Chronic bronchitis is the hypersecretion of mucus that begins in large airways and eventually leads to the thickening of airway walls and airway obstr uction. The diagnosis criteria for chronic bronchitis are the presence of a productive cough for three months in two successive years with other causes of chronic mucus production ruled o ut. b. Cause: An abnormal inflammatory response in the lungs resulting in increased lung compliance, larger lung volumes, and air trapping as a result of premature closure of the airways. Smoking is a major cause of COPD. c. Signs and symptoms: Barrel chest, dyspnea on exertion (DOE), cough, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, prolonged exhalation, decreased breath sounds 1,2 d. Medical Management : Goals are to relieve symptoms and prevent progression via smoking cessation and pharmacotherapy to reduce airflow limitations with bronchodilators and anti -inflammatory agents. B. Asthma: a. Definition: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways with episodes of acute inflammation. These acute episodes can cont ribute to airway remodeling or thickening of walls in large and small airways. b. Causes: Asthma is thought to be caused by environmental and genetic factors. c. Signs and symptoms: Classic signs and symptoms are wheezing, chest tightness, dyspnea which are often precipitated by exercise, cold air, exposure to allergens or viral respiratory infections. d. Medical Management : Focus is on emphasizing the importance of long term control as opposed to simply treating episodes of exacerbation. This includes eliminat ion of factors that worsen symptoms such as allergens. Pharmacologic therapy is used to reverse and prevent bronchoconstriction. Short term \"rescue\" medications act to reverse acute bronchospasm. Examples of these are Albuterol and Atrovent. Long term \"controllers\" act as anti -inflammatory, long acting bronchodilators such as inhaled corticosteroids that prevent bronchoconstriction. Pulmonary function tests can be used t o assess severity and rate the effectiveness of therapy . C. Cystic Fibrosis (CF): see Standard of Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 4 D. Bronchiectasis: a. Definition: Bronchiectasis is irreversible dilation of one or more bronchi with chronic inflammation and infection. b. Causes: Bronchiectasis is caused by bronchial wall injury as a result of fibrotic chang es caused by a restrictive lung disease such as sarcoidosis and interstitial fibrosis in which the airway is pulled outward resulting in fixed dilation of the airways. It can also be caused by bronchial lumen obstruction from slow growing tumors or fibrot ic strictures due to prior infection such as tuberculosis. c. Signs and symptoms: The hallmark sign of bronchiectasis is a cough with chronic sputum production with 3 layers: white frothy top layer, mucoid inner layer, and a purulent bottom layer. Other sign s and symptoms include dyspnea and fatigue. d. Medical Management : Focuses on reducing the number of exacerbations and improving quality of life. This includes antibiotics for acute infections, nebulized medication, bronchodilato rs, and secretion clearance. Restrictive lung disease (RLD) Restrictive lung disease is a group of diseases which cause abnormal reduction in pulmonary ventilation due to decreased compliance of the lung and chest wall. This decreases lung volumes and increases the work of breathing . Pulmonary Causes A. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): a. Definition: IPF is an immunologically mediated inflammatory process involving the alveolar wall which progresses to fibrosis and decreased compliance of the lung architecture2. b. Causes: IPF usually begins with an initial acute injury or infection and causes a progressive decline in lung function. c. Signs and Symptoms: Decreased total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), functional residual capacity (FRC), res idual volume (RV), decreased arterial partial pressure of O 2 (PaO 2), bibasilar end -inspiratory dry crackles, decreased breath sounds, cyanosis, digital clubbing, DOE progressing to dyspnea at rest, repetitive non -productive cough, weight loss, fatigue, inc reased work of breathing d. Medical Management : Corticosteroids are the gold standard treatment while other pharmacologic treatment includes aggressive treatment of infection. Smoking cessation is also important. Lung transplantation is also used; for more information please see Standard of Care: Inpatient Management of the Patient Status Post Lung Transplant. B. Asbestosis a. Definition: Asbestosis is a diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrotic disease. b. Cause: Asbestosis is caused by exposure to asbestos with un clear pathophysiology. It is thought that asbestos fibers cause alveolitis in respiratory bronchioles which progresses to peribronchiolar fibrosis. c. Signs and Symptoms: Decreased PFTs, clubbing of nail beds, DOE progressing to dyspnea at rest, chronic cough which may or may not be productive d. Medical Management : The focus of treatment is on symptomatic support such as smoking cessation. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 5 C. Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) a. Definition: BPD is a disease characterized by acute and chronic lung changes resulting in inflammation of lung parenchyma . b. Cause: BPD occur s in survivors of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who have been mechanically ventilated and received high concentrations of O2 for long periods of time . c. Signs and Symptoms: wheezing, impaired airway clearance, dyspnea d. Medical Management : Bronchodilators D. Atelectasis a. Definition: The incomplete expansion of alveoli or loss of volume of all or part of a lung. b. Causes: Can be caused by the collapse of alveoli caused by a pneumothorax or compression of the alveoli as a result of interstitial or pulmonary edema. It can also be caused by a post -operative incision causing the inability or unwillingness to cough effectively or take deep breaths leading to secretion retention. The obstruction of airways as a result of tumors, enlarged lymph nodes can also cause atelectasis. c. Signs and Symptoms: dyspnea, increased work of breathing d. Medical Management : Focuses on deep breathing, incentive spirometry, coughing, and airway clearance techniques. If these techniques are not sufficient bronchoscopy can be performed to suct ion secretions which may be causing pneumonia (BOOP) a. Definition: Necrosis of the respiratory epithelium allows fluid and debris to enter bronchioles and alveoli causing obstruction and eventually atelectasis. This is followed by an inflammatory response which causes fibrotic changes in the bronchial tree and alveoli . b. Cause: There are a few causes including toxic fume inhalation, viral or bacterial agents, and it can be associated with organ transplantation and other diseases such as IPF. c. Signs and Symptoms: Decreased PFTs, hypoxemia, expiratory wheezing, dyspnea, increased respiratory rate, non -productive cough. d. Medical Management : Focus includes supp lemental O2, fluid balance, and corticosteroids . Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 6 F. Pneumonia: a. Definition: An inflammatory process of lung parenchyma classified as either community acquired pneumonia (CAP) or hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) (nosocomial). b. Cause: Begins with an infection in the lower respiratory tract caused by various microbes. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or aspiration. The most common bacteria causing CAP is streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Patients most at risk for HAP have one or more of the follow ing factors: NG tube, intubation, dysphagia, tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation, lung injury, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, advanced age, or high O 2 concentrations. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when foreign material is inhaled into the lungs (most commonly food, liquid, vomit). c. Signs and Symptoms: Bacterial presents with an a brupt onset with lobar pleuritic pain, . Viral presents an insidious onset with patchy diffuse bronchopulmonary infi ltrates, moderate fever, nonproductive cough, myalgia, normal WBC count. Aspiration presents with dyspnea, wheezing, productive cough, and fatigue. d. Medical Management : Antibiotics, pathogen specific if possible or multiple antibiotics if not. O xygen an d mechanical ventilation/non -invasive ventilation may be necessary . G. Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) a. Definition: Severe hypoxemia and increased permeability of the alveolar -capillary membrane which allows excess fluid and plasma protein to leak i nto interstitial fluid and alveoli causing decreased gas exchange. b. Cause: Caused by acute lung injury via trauma, aspiration, inhaled toxins, shock, sepsis, primary pneumonias and metabolic causes. May resolve completely, however, in some patients signifi cant lung damage occurs. The longer the patient is on mechanical ventilation and high O 2 concentration, the poorer the long term prognosis. c. Signs and Symptoms: Tachycardia, dyspnea, increased and shallow respiratory rate, cyanosis, increased anxiety d. Medical Management : Focuses on treating the underlying cause and supporting gas exchange via mechanical ventilation. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 7 H. Bronchogenic carcinoma: a. Definition: A malignant growth of abnormal epithelial cells arising in a bronchus classified into 4 types: Table 1: Bronchogenic Carcinoma2 I. Pleural Effusion a. Definition: The accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. b. Cause: Capillaries in the visceral pleura receive blood via low pressure pulmonary circulation while capillaries in parietal pleura receive blood via high pressure arterial circulation. When fluid formation and fluid reabsorption is not balanced, fluid ac cumulates in the pleural space which restricts the lungs from expanding fully. The fluid is either transudate or exudates. Transudate is fluid with low protein content which accumulates due to change in hydrostatic pressure within pleural capillaries. T his can be caused by CHF, left ventricular failure, cirrhosis, pericardial disease, PE, peritoneal dialysis, or atelectasis. Exudate is fluid with high protein content which accumulates due to changes in permeability of pleural surfaces. This can be ca used by parasitic or fungal infections, tuberculosis, bronchogenic carcinoma, or sarcoidosis. c. Signs and Symptoms: Tachycardia, dyspnea, increased respiratory rate d. Medical Management : Focus on treating the underlying cause will usually cause the pleural e ffusion to resolve. If it does not resolve a thoracentesis or chest tube is used to drain the effusion. Type Squamous C ell Carcinoma Small Cell Carcinoma Adenocarcinoma Large Cell Carcinoma Incidence of all Lung Cancers 50% 30% 15% 15% Frequent Sites of Incidence Majority are centrally located tumors 75% of the time arises in centrally located proximal lesion, often with lymph node involvement Majority are peripherally located tumors Majority are subpleural Growth rate Relatively slow Extremely rapid Moderate Rapid Metastatic Tendencies Slow; to hilar lymph nodes, liver, adrenal gland, lymph nodes Rapid; to brain Operability Good Almost none Poor Poor Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 8 J. Sarcoidosis a. Definition: Multisystem disease which is characterized by noncaseating epitheliod granulomas in many organs. The lung is the most involved organ. b. Cause: There is no known etiology of sarcoidosis. c. Signs and Symptoms: Dyspnea, cough, fatigue d. Medical Management : Focus is on suppressing alveolitis and granuloma formation via corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Causes A. Pulmonary edema a. Definition: An increase in the amount of fluid within the lung interstitial spaces and alveoli. This usually results when capillary filtration exceeds fluid removal. b. Causes: Caused by increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure secondary to left ventricular failure. This causes increased alveolar capillary membrane permeability as in ARDS2,3. c. Signs and Symptoms: The hallmark symptoms of pulmonary edema are decreased breath sounds with wet wheezing, increased work of breathing, and pink frothy sputum as well as shortness of breath, cyanosis, and increased res piratory rate. d. Medical Management : Focus is on decreasing cardiac preload via venodilators, inotropic agents, and diuretics as well as optimizing ventilation with supplemental oxygen. B. Pulmonary emboli (PE): a. Definition: Thrombi travel from systemic veins t hrough the right side of the heart into pulmonary circulation where they lodge in branches of the pulmonary arteries. This creates a physiological dead space in which ventilation is in excess of perfusion and therefore the V/Q ratio is increased and perfu sion cannot be completed due to blockage. PE stops the blood flow to certain areas of the lung leading to decreased or halted perfusion to pulmonary capillaries. This occlusion causes edema and hemorrhage into surrounding lung parenchyma and the lack of blood flow causes coagulative necrosis of alveolar walls. This causes an increase in alveolar dead space as a portion of the lung is being ventilated but not perfused. b. Cause: Most commonly caused by a lower extremity thrombus which is usually secondary to bedrest, long periods of travel, orthopedic surgery, or obesity. c. Signs and Symptoms: Acute onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, rapid s hallow breathing pattern, cough d. Medical Management : Focuses on anticoagulation, supplemental oxygen , and in some cases pulmon ary embolectomy for large PEs. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 9 Musculoskeletal Causes A. Diaphragmatic paralysis or paresis a. Cause: Caused by a lesion in the neurological or muscular system. Unilateral paralysis or paresis is most commonly caused by injury of the phrenic nerve from bronchogenic carcinoma or surgical resection and open heart surgery. b. Signs and Symptoms: Possible paradoxical breathing, decreased breath sounds in base of affected side, dyspnea, orthopnea, morning headaches secondary to decreased O 2 and increa sed CO 2 retention c. Medical Management : If the lesion is bilateral then mechanical ventilation may be required. B. Kyphoscoliosis: a. Definition: A combination of excessive anteroposterior and lateral curvature of the spine with angles 70 -120 degrees. Decreased chest wall compliance causes increase in work of breathing and alveolar hypoventilation. Over time this can cause structural changes in the vessels and thickening of pulmonary arteriolar walls leading to cor pulmonale. Kyphoscoliosis greater than 120 deg rees are associated with severe RLD and respiratory failure. b. Cause: Kyphoscoliosis can be idiopathic, congenital or develops in response to a neuromuscular disease. c. Signs and Symptoms: Decreased breath sounds over the compressed lung, DOE, decreased exer cise tolerance, increased accessory muscle use, and hypoxemia. Neurological Causes A. Spinal cord injuries (SCI) a. Definition: Cervical injuries which result in inspiratory and expiratory muscles weakness or paralysis. b. Cause: The cause of SCI is often traumati c such as a motor vehicle accident or diving accident. c. Signs and Symptoms: If diaphragm use is retained, breathing dynamics are altered leading to paradoxical breathing. d. Medical Management : Focus is on strength and endurance training of the remaining ventilatory muscles. B. Demyelinating Diseases a. Definition: A demyelinating disease of the motor neurons of the peripheral nerves. b. Signs and Symptoms: Rapid bilateral ascending flaccid motor paralysis, shortness of breath, and decreased breath sounds with 10 -20% of patients developing acute respiratory failure. C. Progressive Degenerative Diseases a. Definition: Progressive degenerative disease of the nervous system involving upper and lower motor neurons. b. Signs and symptoms: Weakness of respiratory muscle s, decreased breath sounds, progressive weakness beginning with hands and feet, DOE c. Medical Management : Treatment focuses on comfort.

Definition: The most commonly fractured ribs are 5 -9 as these are less protected than ribs 1 -4 and are anchored both anteriorly and posteriorly. Pain from rib fractures is what causes restrictive impairment as patients are reluctant to breathe deeply. Rib fractures may be accompanied by a hemothorax. b. Cause: Usually traumatic c. Signs and symptoms: Pain, s hallow breathing, self -splinting on side of fracture d. Medical Management: Focus is on pain control. E. Flail chest a. Definition: Anterior and posterior fracture of the same rib resulting in a free floating segment of the rib. This is often associated with lung contusion. b. Cause: Usually caused by blunt trauma. c. Signs and Symptoms: shallow breathing, decreased lung volumes, pain, chest wall deformity d. Medical Management : Mechanical ventilation may be required if patient's respiratory rate exceeds 40 breaths/min. W ith severe displacement of rib segments surgical stabilization may be required. ICF model4 Body Structure: s410 structure o f cardiovascular system, s430 structure of respiratory system, s710 structure of head and neck region, s720 structure of shoulder region, s760 structure of trunk Body Function: b440 respiration functions, b445 respiratory muscle functions, b450 additional respiratory muscle functions, b455 exercise tolerance functions, b460 sensations associated with cardiovascular and respiratory functions, b450 additional respiratory functions, b740 muscle endurance functions Activity and Participation: d450 walking, d455 moving around, d230 carrying out daily routine, d640 doing housework, d540 dressing Contraindications / Precautions for Treatment: Understanding medical procedures, tests, lab values and oxygen delivery systems are important for PTs in the acute care set ting in order to m ore accurately make a prognosis , determine a treatment plan, and make recommendations for oxygen deli very during functional activity. Awareness of specific lines and tube s specific to patients with pulmonary disease is important for efficient and safe management during mobilization. Oxygen Delivery Systems: 5,6 A. Nasal cannula (NC): NC is the most commonly used device and is intended to be used for O2 flow rates 1 -6 L/min. Humidification can be used as O 2 above 3 -4L/min can cause dry nasal mucosa7. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 11 B. Simple mask/Face Mask (FM): Beneficial for patients who are mouth breathers and is intended to be used with O 2 flow rates 5 -10L/min. Humidification can be used as O 2 concentrations above 4L/min can cause dry nasal/oral mucosa8. C. Shovel Mask: Can be used for the administration of aerosolized medications and for administration of controlled percentages of O 2 at levels slightly higher than the simple mask (10 -12L/min) or FiO 2 is regulated between 35 -100%9. D. Venturi Mask: Provides greater flow of O 2 and combines room air with O 2. This is convenient as it c an be converted to trach collar for portable delivery8. E. Non-rebreather mask (NRB): The mask and reservoir 60 -80% FiO2 or above 10 L/min. Humidification is not used as it would alter the percent of O 2 delivered8. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 12 F. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): Provides one level of positive airway pressure (PAP) in order to maintain airway patency. CPAP is used as a treatment for sleep apnea10. G. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP): Provides pressure support with inhalation and a lower level of pressure support during exh alation. This decreases the work of breathing and reduces carbon dioxide (CO 2) retention by preventing airway collapse during exhalation. BiPAP can be portable, can consider using it with patients on non - rebreather11. H. Endotracheal (ET) tube: An artificial airway inserted into the trachea that can be oral or nasal. It is usually a last resort effort when other means of ventilation have failed. The four primary reasons for utilizing an ET tube are upper airway obstruction, inability to protect the lower airway from aspiration, inability to clear secretions from lower airways, and a need for positive pressure mechanical ventilatory assistance12. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 13 I. Tracheost omy tube: An artificial airway inserted into the trachea13. Lines/Tubes/Drains14 A. Pleural chest tube: Used to drain fluid, blood (hemothorax) or air (pneumothorax). The chest tube drainage unit consists of three chambers. The drainage chamber collects the chest drainage, the water seal chamber provides negative pressure for the chest tube unit. It permits air and fluid to exit the pleural space whil e preventing air from entering. The suction control chamber is connected to wall suction and should create a gentle bubbling. a) Considerations for PT: The chest tube drainage unit should be maintained in the upright position at all times so that the fluid can be measured. Chest tubes are removed based on how much they are draining so precise measurement is important . After a thoracic surgery, if a patient has a chest tube to suction it cannot come off of suction for mobility purpos es. In this case extra suction tubing can be connected to the wall or for out of the room activity a portable suction unit can be used. These are usually located on the thoracic walkers. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 14 Surgical Procedures A. Bronchoscopy15: A flexible scope is used for diagnosis or treatment to directly visualize neoplasms, strictures, or stenosis and to suction the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree for removal of secretions, foreign bodies, or for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). B. Thoracentesis16: Percutaneous needle aspiration of pleural fluid. May be used as diagnostic test or therapeutic procedure to relieve respiratory distress caused by a large pleural effusion. A complication of the procedure may include a pneumothorax. On the day of the thoracentesis, consider scheduling physical therapy following the procedure and once the patient is cleared by chest x -ray, since the patient should be less dyspneic with exertion . Monitor oxygen saturation during PT treatment after thoracentesis. C. Video Assisted Thora coscopic Surgery (VATS) : Minimally invasive procedure usually requiring 3 small incisions for surgical instruments and camera. It is used for biopsy, wedge resection , lobectomy, and pleural resection. D. Wedge resection: Removal of lung parenchyma without regard to segment division (a portion of more than one segment but not a full lobe).15 This is the most common procedure for peripher al parenchymal carcinoma. E. Lobectomy: The resection of one or more lobes of the lung; this is the most common procedure for isolated lesions.15 F. Pneumonectomy: The removal of an entire lung. This is the most common procedu re for bronchial carcinoma, emphysema, multiple lung abscesses, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, and mesothelioma.15 G. Pleurectomy: The removal of part of the parietal pleura, the extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) is most commo nly performed for mesothelioma. In this procedure a thoracotomy approach is used to perform a broad dissection involving the diaphragm and division of the pericardium in order to remove the lung, lymph nodes, and pleura. The diaphragm and pericardium are repaired during surgery.17 H. Intraoperative Heated Chemo (IOHC): Chemotherapy agent is heated and administered to open chest cavity for 1 -2 hours and then drained. This is often performed with an EPP. I. Pericardial window: Resection of an area of pericardium for the treatment of a pericardial effusion.18 J. Claggett Window: Lateral incision with removal of several rib segments to create a \"window\". An incisio n is made to deflect the skin and muscle. The ribs are resected and then muscle and skin are pulled down over the edges of the window. The wound is packed with solution soaked Kerlix to provided cleaning and promote tissue growth. The window is left op en for 4 -6 weeks allowing tissue growth and then is surgically closed with a muscle flap. This is used to treat empyema or bronchopleural fistula. K. Esophagectomy: The removal of a portion or the entire esophagus. This may be performed via cervical, transt horacic, or incisions or laparoscopically (minimally invasive or Ivor -Lewis esophagectomy). The patient may require increased supplemental oxygen for up to 8 hours following the procedure and may have decreased activity tolerance. 19 L. Lung transplant: see to Standard of Care: Inpatient Management of the Patient Status Post Lung Transplant. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 15 Non-Procedure related A. New or Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The following are signs and symptoms of a PE and are indicative of an emergent medical situation. Notify the RN/MD immediately if the patient develops rapid onset of tachypnea, anxiety, lightheadedness, tachycardia, chest pain, dysrhythmia, hypotension, decreased SpO 2. If you are treating a patient wit h a known PE, determine whether the patient is therapeutically anticoagulated prior to treatment. Generally patients will be started on Heparin with a bridge to Coumadin for long term anticoagulation. 3,15,20 B. Anticoagulation: Therapeutic INR is 2.0 -3.0. PTT can also be used to determine therapeutic anticoagulation. The reference range for PTT is 23 -36 seconds and generally the goal for PTT is to be 60 -80 seconds. An inferior v ena cava (IVC) filter may be placed when patients are at high risk for developing a new or recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or cannot be anticoagulated. Patients are usually on bed rest for 4 -6 hours after the procedure. Physical therapy may resume once activity orders are advanced. INR does not have to be within therapeutic range after the filter is placed.21 C. Supratherapeutic INR: If the INR is 4.0 -5.0 exercise should be held. For INR greater than 5.0-6.0 exercise should be held but evaluation and continuation of the patient's current level of mobility is appropriate. The goals of therapy should be to determine discharge plan, maximize patient safety, and minimize the effects of bedrest. For INR greater than 6.0 bedrest or decreased level of activity should be considered. If the INR is not likely to be corrected quickly (within 2 days) a discussion with the team should take place to weigh the risks of bleeding against the risks of bedrest.22 D. Pneumothorax: Air enters the pleural space which decreases the natural negative pressure of the pleura causing the lungs to recoil or collaps e.14 An open pneumothorax is when the pleur al space is open to the atmosphere and air is able to move freely in and out of the pleural space through an opening in the chest. This is usually caused by trauma such as a gunshot wound, stab wound, or car accident. A closed pneumothorax is when the ch est wall remains intact. Air enters the pleural space through a rupture of the lung and visceral pleura. A spontaneous pneumothorax occurs for no obvious reason. Relevant Tests A. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): A measure of flow rates, lung volumes, gas exchange and respiratory muscle function. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is a measure of maximal exhaled volume after a maximum inhale. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) is a measure of the forced expiratory volume in the first second and is used in diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary disease. FEV 1 is decreased in obstructive disease. The FEV 1/FVC ratio is decreased in obstructive disease and normal or increased in restrictive disease. Pulmonary disease is classified as obstructive if the FEV 1/FVC ratio is less than 70% of predicted norms. Pulmonary disease is classified as restrictive if the FEV 1/FVC ratio is greater than or equal to 80% of predicted norms.23 B. Arterial blood gas (ABG) : PaO2 is the partial pr essure of dissolved O 2 in plasma with a normal range of >80mmHg. PaCO2 is the partial pressure of dissolved CO 2 in plasma with a normal range of 35 - 45 mmHg. pH is the degree of acidity or alkalinity in the blood with a normal range of 7.35 -7.45. HCO 3 is the level of bicarbonate in the blood with a normal range of 22 -28mEq/Liter. It is typically documented as PaO 2/PaCO 2/pH/HCO 3. The interpretation of ABGs can be broken down into a few steps. First determine if the pH, pCO 2, and HCO3 are acidotic or a lkalotic. First look at Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 16 the pH; if under 7.35 it is acidotic, if over 7.45 it is alkalotic. Next look at the pCO 2; if under 35 it is alkalotic, over 45 it is acidotic. Last look at the HCO 3; if under 22 it is acidotic, if over 26 it is alkalotic. After determining if these are acidotic or alkalotic, match the pH with either CO 2 or HCO 3. If both the pH and the CO 2 are acidotic then it is respiratory acidosis. If the pH and the HCO 3 are both acidotic then it is a metabolic acidosis. Conversely if the p H and CO 2 are both alkalotic then it is respiratory alkalosis. If the pH and HCO 3 are both alkalotic it is metabolic alkalosis. The next step is to look to see if the CO 2 or HCO 3 go in the opposite direction of pH; if so there is compensation by that sys tem (respiratory or metabolic). For example if the pH is acidotic, the CO 2 is acidotic, and the HCO 3 is alkalotic then this indicates respiratory acidosis with partial compensation by metabolic alkalosis.24,25 Evaluation: Past Medical History (PMH) : All relevant past medical and surgical history. In patients with respiratory disease it is important to note the type of disease, the onset/duration of disease, any past procedures specifically related to the disease. Include any diagnosis that may have an impact on the patient's functional or respiratory status. History of Present Illness (HPI): Reason for admission including chief complaint, onset and duration of pertinent symptoms such as increased DOE, change in sputum production, recent PFTs, recent hospitalizations and any relevant events leading up to the hospitalization including any outsi de hospital information. Hospital Course: May include BWH emergency department (ED) course, medical workup and treatments, procedures and complications, supplemental oxygen requirements, any significant changes in vital signs or labs, dates of extubation, ventilator weaning, sedation weaning, consulting services and recommendations, and reason for PT consult. Social History : Information regarding a patient's home environment, current/potential barriers to returning home, family or caregiver support, occup ation, history of tobacco use, asbestosis exposure and any other family, professional, social, or community roles as appropriate. It is also important to ascertain the patient's goals and expectations of returning to previous life roles. For patients wit h respiratory disease, this may also include any prior participation in a pulmonary rehab program, recent rehab stays, or home services. Prior functional and endurance level : Patient's typical daily routine, ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), participation in any exercise routines or programs, history of falls. In this population is important to ask specific questions regarding their baseline endurance level and O 2 requirements. Some examples of specific questions are : What are your O2 needs at home both at rest and with activity? What is your home O 2 setup and who manages it? How far are you able to walk in the house without having to sit down because of shortness of breath? Do y ou have to sit down to perform any activities at home such as brushing your teeth or preparing meals? If you do these things standing up do you find yourself to be short of breath?

Bronchodilators: beta -adrenergic, xanthine derivative, anticholinergic a. Primary use: To relieve bronchospasm associated with obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and exercise induced bronchospasm. b. Mechanism of Action: i. Anticholinergics: Blocks action of acetylcholine in bronchial smooth muscle causing bronchodilation. Examples include Atrovent and Spiriva. ii. Beta 2 agonists: Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by acting on beta 2 receptors located in bronchiole smooth muscle with little effect on heart rate as predominant effect on cardiac tissue is mediated via beta 1 receptors. These are short acting and are commonly referred to as \"rescue\" inhalers. Examples include Albuterol, Epinephrine and Salmeterol. c. Implications for PT: The use of a bronchodilator immediately before PT intervention will increase the patient's tolerance to activity and increase their ability to clear secretions. Depending on the specific medication it should be administered within 30 minutes prior to initiation of therapy and are effective for 1 -12 hours. B. Glucocorticoids (corticosteroids): a. Primary use: To stabiliz e and limit bronchoconstriction of the airways in patients with asthma and COPD. b. Mechanism of Action: Inhibits the production of pro inflam matory products while also increasing production of anti inflammatory proteins. Examples include Dexamethasone, Prednisolone, Prednisone, Hydrocortisone and Cortisone. c. Implications for PT: term use of corticosteroids can cause proximal muscle weaknes s and osteoporosis27 C. Leukotriene Inhibitors: a. Primary use: Used for long term control of asthma and COPD as they decrease inflammation. b. Mechanism of Action: Decreases inflammation of respiratory tissues by blocking leukotriene receptors on respiratory cells. These are usually used in conjunction with glucocorticoids as they enhance the anti -inflammatory properties of glucocorticoids. Examples include Zyflo, Singulair, and Accolate. c. Implications for PT: side effec ts include fatigue, nausea, vomiting D. Mucolytics: a. Primary use: Decreases the viscosity of respiratory secretions. b. Mechanism of Action: degrade disulfide binds in mucus making mucus less viscous. Examples include Mucomyst and Mucosil. c. Implications for PT: If taken before PT, they may assist in airway clearance. E. Expectorants: a. Primary use: Facilitation and ejection o f mucus b. Mechanism of Action: Increases the secretion of thin watery mucus in upper airways. Examples include guaifenesin. c. Implications for PT: If taken before PT, they may assist in airway clearance.

Primary use: These are usually administered prophylactically to prevent bronchospasm which is initiated by specific activities such as exercise and exposure to allergens in patients with asthma. b. Mechanism of Action: Inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators. Examples include Intal, Nasalcrom, Tilade. c. Implications for PT: If a patient experiences exercise induced asthma it will be helpful for the patient to utilize this medication within 30 minutes of initiation of PT session. G. Antitussives: a. Primary use: Suppresses ineffective, dry coughing a ssociated with common cold or minor throat irritations. b. Mechanism of Action: Blocks overly active receptors or increases the threshold for cough center in the brain. Examples include Codeine and Dextromethorphan. c. Implications for PT: may be helpful befor e activity if the cough is limiting patient's function. H. Decongestants: a. Primary use: Relieves upper respiratory congestion and mucous discharge. b. Mechanism of Action: Causes vasoconstriction in mucosal vasculature by stimulating alpha receptors. Examples include Ephedrine, Afrin, Phenylephrine, and Pseudoephedrine. c. Implications for PT: side effects include cardiac irregularities, HTN, dizziness I. Antihistamines: a. Primary use: Decreases inflammation and bronchoconstriction associated with hypersensitivity rea ctions such as allergic rhinitis. b. Mechanism of Action: Block H receptors in order to decrease mucosal congestion and irritation. Examples include Zyrtec, Benadryl, Claritin and Allegra. c. Implications for PT: M ay be helpful before activity to reduce sympto ms, can usually be taken every 4 -8 hours . Examination A. Subjective: T his is a good time to note whether the patient has 1 -2-3 word dyspnea B. Observation: Lines and tubes (specifically chest tubes method of oxygen delivery and amount), patient position and ap pearance. C. Posture: Barrel chest is increased anterior/posterior diameter of the chest commonly seen in patients with COPD. Pectus excavatum is a congenital deformity of the chest in which the sternum caves in and in severe cases can effect respiration. Pectus carinatum is a deformity of the chest in which the sternum and ribs protrude outwards. Kyphosis is an overcurvature of the thoracic spine, scoliosis is an irregular lateral curvature of the spine. Shoulder position should also be note d such as rounded or elevated. D. Cognition/Mental Status: Level of alertness, ability to follow motor commands, level of safety awareness, emotional lability, learning style and learning barriers. Consider screening with RASS28, CAM29, or consultation of Occupational Therapy.

F. Pulmonary: a. Breath sounds via auscultation Table 2: Breath Sounds1,2,15 b. Voice Sounds: If consolidation is suspected voice tests can be performed to confirm this. For whispered pectoriloquy the patient whispers \"1, 2, 3\". The test is positive for consolidation if the phrase is heard clearly in the distal lung fields. For bronchopho ny the patient says \"ninety nine\" repeatedly. The test is positive for consolidation if the phrase is heard clearly in the distal lung fields. For egophony the patient says \"e\" repeatedly. The test is pos itive for consolidation if the letter \"a\" is hear d in the distal lung fields.

Use a functional balance assessment (e.g. Ti netti Balance Test, Berg Balance Test, Dynamic Gait Index, Timed Up and Go) when possible. Gross sitting and standing statements may be used if patients are unable to perform standardized test. I. Integumentary: Include surgical incisions, edema, presence of ulcers, skin quality, digital clubbing, cyanosis. J. Musculoskeletal: ROM, specifically of shoulders and ribs and strength which should include functional assessment and manual muscle testing. Specifically note inspiratory and expiratory muscle weakness. Ex piratory muscle weakness can cause an inability to cough and increase pulmonary infections. Inspiratory muscle weakness can cause hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and atelectasis.

Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 23 Goals : PT goals for patients with primary pulmonary pathology include promoting functional independence, maximizing gas exchange, increasing aerobic capacity, respiratory muscle endurance and patient's knowledge of the condition and management.15 A. Examples of short term goals: a. Demonstrate independent pacing and monitoring of fatigue and/or SOB b. Demonstrate independent exercise and endurance program c. Maintain SpO2 > 95%* at rest on least amount of supplemental oxygen(* or SpO2 as indicated by MD orders) d. Maintain SpO2 > 92%* with activity on least amount of supplemental oxygen(* or SpO2 as indicated by MD orders) e. Report moderate or less effort (or RPE <3/10) with all functional activities f. Improved distance on two, six or twelve m inute walk test g. Independent with breathing exercises to maximize ventilation h. Independent with breathing techniques during activity to maximize ventilation (such as pursed lip breathing, paced breathing etc.) i. Independent with airway clearance Treatment Planning / Interventions Established Pathway ___ Yes, see attached. _X_ No Established Protocol ___ Yes, see attached. _X_ No Pulmonary Specific Interventions1,2,15 Airway Clearance Techniques : manual or mechanical procedures that facilitate mobilization of secretions from the airways. This is indicated for patients with impaired mucociliary clearance, excessive pulmonary secretions, and ineffective or abs ent cough. An inhaled bronchodilator given prior to airway clearance will optimize the intervention. A. Postural Drainage (PD): Assumption of specific body positions that allows gravity to assist with draining secretions. This can be used alone or in conju nction with other techniques such as percussion, vibration and shaking. The most affected lung segments should be treated first and the patient should be encouraged to take deep breaths while in the PD position and encourage coughing between positions . Continuous tube feeding should be interrupted during airway clearance if patient is being fed via NG tube as positions in which if the head is lowered may cause aspiration. If patient is being fed via G tube or J tube this is not a concern as the tube is d irectly inserted into the stomach (G tube) or jejunum (J tube). Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 24 B. Percussion: Loosening of secretions either manually or with a mechanical device. It is most effective if performed in conjunction with PD positions. Manual perc ussion consists of rhythmic clapping with cupped hands over the affected lung segments. Clapping over bony prominences and surgical incisions should be avoided. Mechanical percussion devices such as the Vest are electrical ly or pneumatically driven. Precautions include anticoagulation, osteoporosis, rib fractures, metastatic cancer to the ribs, recent pacemaker placement, and uncontrolled bronchospasm. Contraindications incl ude unstable hemodynamic status, open wounds on thoracic area, PE, subcutaneous emphysema, or recent skin grafts over thorax. C. Vibration: Loosening of secretions either manually or with a mechanical device which is most effective if performed in conjunction with PD positions. Manual percussion is performed with the palmar aspect of the PT's hands in full contact with patient's chest wall. The patient takes a deep inspiration and on expiration the PT's hands provide a downward pressure with quick oscillations. This is performed until secretions ar e mobilized or as long as the patient is able to tolerate it. Mechanical vibration may be more difficult to coordinate with patient's breathing cycle. D. Acappella and Aerobika: These devices provide positive expiratory pressure as well as oscillations upon exhalation. The amount of expiratory pressure is adjustable. The patient takes a deep inhalation and exhales into the device which may stimulate coughing. E. Active Cycle of Breathing: Forced expiratory technique based on optimal airflow and avoidance of a cough which can be performed in any position. The patient performs quiet breathing for a few breaths followed by a mid to large inhalation which is then huffed out. The cycle is repeated multiple times. Huffing may be sufficient to clear secretions or p atient may feel the need to cough in order to clear secretions F. Autogenic Drainage: Controlled breathing to help clear secretions consisting of 3 parts. Unsticking mucus is low level lung breathing. This is done by inhaling a normal breath, holding for 1 -3 seconds and then exhaling completely. This is repeated for 1 -3 minutes or until crackles are heard on exhalation. The next step is collecting mucus. The patient takes a slightly deeper breath, holds for 1 -3 seconds and exhales but not as deeply as in previous step. This is repeated for 1 -3 minutes or until crackles are heard. Evacuating is the last step in which the patient takes a slow deep breath and holds for 1 -3 seconds and forcefully huffs air out. G. Mechanical Aids for Coughing: devices and techni ques involving manual or mechanical application of forces to the body or intermittent pressure changes to the airways in order to assist inspiratory and expiratory muscle function. Inspiratory aids provide air under pressure during inhalation (intermitten t positive pressure ventilation). Expiratory aids provides negative pressure to the airway during expiration. An abdominal thrust can be applied during expiration. Breathing Strategies: Techniques to maximize ventilation H. Pursed lip breathing: used to decrease dyspnea by slowing respiratory rate, decreasing resistive pressure drop across airways which decreases airway collapse during expiration (which occurs in COPD) . Patient inhales through the nose with mouth closed and then exhaled slowly through pu rsed lips. This is i ndicated for patients with dyspnea at rest and/or with exertion, or wheezing . Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 25 I. Paced Breathing: volitional coordination of breathing during activity . Patient breathes in at the beginning of activity and out during the activity . This c an be combined with pursed lip breathing or diaphragmatic breathing . It is i ndicated for patients with low endurance, dyspnea on exertion (DOE), fatigue, anxiety, and tachypnea . J. Inspiratory Hold Technique: prolonged holding of the breath at maximum inspiration. This keeps alveoli inflated and allows redistribution if oxygen to alveoli with different time constraints and through the pores of Kohn. Patient breathes in maximally and holds breath for 2 -3 seconds with relaxed exhalation. This can be co mbined with vibration to assist in airway clearance. It is indicated for patients with hypoventilation, atelectasis, and ineffective cough. K. Stacked Breathing: A s eries of deep breaths which build on the previous breath without expiration until maximum in spiratory volume is reached . Each inspiration is followed by a brief inspiratory hold . Sniffing may be used to help facilitate learning of this technique . This keeps alveoli inflated but also slowly increases inspiratory volume to keep pain levels low w hile increasing ventilation. This is i ndicated for patients with hypoventilation, atelectasis, ineffective cough, pain, or an uncoordinated breathing pattern. L. Diaphragmatic Breathing: O utward motion of the abdominal wall while reducing upper rib cage moti on during inspiration . This is u sed to decrease accessory muscle use. It c an be used in any position although may be easiest to learn in supine or semi -Fowler position with posterior pelvic tilt with patient's hands on their own abdomen for tactile feedb ack. Sniffing may be used to help facilitate learning of this technique . Instruct the patient to sniff 3 times and exhale slowly . Progress patient to 1 slow sniff and repeated until patient is breathing in a relaxed manner . The s coop technique may also be used to help facilitate learning diaphragmatic breathing . In this technique the p atient is in side - lying or semi -Fowler position with posterior pelvic tilt . On exhalation the PT scoops their hand up and under the patient's anterior thorax while i nstructing the patient to \"breath into my hand\" . This is i ndicated for patients with hypoxemia, tachypnea, atelectasis, anxiety, and Breathing: P romotes intercostal expansion during inspiration . This c an be used unilaterally or bilaterally . The p atient is sidelying on uninvolved side with UE abducted overhead and the PT gives a stretch to intercostals before inspiration and then continues to hold pressure during inspiration . This c an also be performed seated fo r bilateral intercostals and combined with bilateral UE abduction . For bilateral impairment the PT gives pressure to bilateral ribs before and during inspiration . This is i ndicated for patients with asymmetrical chest wall expansion, localized lung conso lidation or secretions, asymmetrical posture, and shallow respirations . N. Upper Chest Inhibiting Technique: I nhibiting the upper chest can help the patient recruit the diaphragm during inspiration . This s hould be used only after other techniques have been a ttempted . The p atient is sidelying or supine and the PT performs the scoop technique with one hand while the other hand rests on the patient's chest . The PT's hand follows patient's chest to expiratory resting position and does not move during inspiratio n providing a downward pressure on the chest. This is i ndicated for patients with excessive use of accessory muscles during breathing Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 26 O. Thoracic Mobilization Techniques : Increases the ability of the thorax to expand during breathing. Simple positioning ca n be very effective for this technique. For anterior chest wall mobility place a towel roll vertically along the thoracic spine while patient is in supine. For lateral chest wall mobility place a towel roll or pillows horizontally under the ribs while pa tient is in sidelying. The arm can be flexed or abducted overhead to further facilitate the stretch . This is indicated for patients with impaired chest wall mobility, hypoventilation, paradoxical breathing, impaired trunk muscle performance or tightness, ineffective cough. P. Butterfly: The patient sits unsupported with the PT standing either in front or behind. The PT assists patients to abduct shoulders into butterfly position while breathing audibly with the patient. During inspiration the arms are brou ght into further abduction, during expiration they are lowered. The PT slows their breathing pattern and arm movement gradually. This is indicated for patients with impaired chest wall mobility, hypoventilation, impaired trunk muscle performance or tight ness, and ineffective cough. Strengthening Strategies: A. Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT): Increasing ventilatory capacity and decreasing dyspnea through strengthening and endurance training of inspiratory muscles. a. Early stage strengthening consists of sniffing technique (see Diaphragmatic Breathing above). Straws can be used for light resistance. The patient inhales slowly through a straw without causing dyspnea. The next stage is resisted inhalation in which the PT places their hands bel ow the patient's ribs on either side of the thorax. Before inspiration PT gives a small amount of resistance to the diaphragm by pushing up and in throughout inspiration; no resistance is given during expiration. Weights can also be used in this method b ut the PT must ensure that the patient is able to maintain comfortable breathing without the use of accessory muscles. Patients with poor strength will find strengthening in sitting difficult, the supine position prevents the abdominal contents from pushi ng into the diaphragm therefore allowing further abdominal excursion. The Quality of contraction should be monitored throughout the session as the patient should not be \"pushing\" with their abdominal muscles. b. Handheld training devices produce resistance by decreasing the radius of the device's airway. The patient inhales through the device at a level that does not induce adverse effects such as dyspnea, or decreased O2 saturation. This is indicated for patients with intact lungs such as patients with ne uromuscular disease or patients on mechanical ventilation trying to wean off of the ventilator. c. Deep Breathing Exercises involve the use of incentive spirometer 10x/hour with a focus on slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing. This is indicated for patients with atelectasis. Incentive spirometers are not used at BWH but the same principles can be used without a device.

All rights reserved 27 Frequency & Duration Patients will have follow -up physical therapy treatments based on individual need. The frequency of treatment for each patient will be determined by the potential for gains with skilled therapy, the acuity of the medical condition, and the ability of the patient to complete an activity/exercise prescription independently or with the assistance of other healthcare sta ff members. Refer to the BWH Guidelines for Frequency of Physical Therapy Patient Care in the Acute Care Hospital Setting, Cardiovascular/Pulmonary Practice Pattern. Patient / family education It is the role of a physical therapist to discuss realistic e xpectations regarding function, appropriate level of assist that the patient requires from family, and anticipated rehabilitation progression. Often this entails providing emotional support to the patient and family as needed. Education of conceptual ide as, e.g. energy conservation; self monitoring; exercise/activity related interventions, exam findings, airway clearance techniques, and recommendations for discharge is important. The department has the following handouts available for those with visual l earning styles: individualized home exercise p rograms , What You Need to Know about Exercise and Activity after Thoracic Surgery , Energy Conservation for Patients and Families. Recommendations and referrals to other providers: Discuss the patient's need for additional services with the primary team. A patient may benefit from the following services if appropriate: A. Occupational Therapy: Appropriate for a patient who presents with cognitive or perceptual impairments, UE weakness or tone, or any other impairment that affects his or her ability to perform activities of daily living independently or for a patient who has UE splinting and/or adaptive equipment needs. B. Speech and Swallowing: Appropriate for a patient who presents with impairments that affec t his or her ability to swallow without difficulty and/or who presents with a new language impairment. C. Respiratory Therapy: Appropriate for a patient with bronchopulmonary hygiene needs and complicated oxygen delivery needs beyond the typical set -up avai lable on the patient care floor. The respiratory therapists are also responsible for all ventilator care and may be able to assist with ambulating patients on portable ventilators who are appropriate to do so. D. Care Coordination: Appropriate for a patient who has a complicated discharge situation and the care coordination team is not already involved. E. Social Work: Appropriate for a patient who has a complicated social history and he or she requires additional support or counseling; coping with prolonged ho spital admissions F. Chaplaincy: Appropriate if a patient requires spiritual support or counseling. G. Nutrition: Appropriate for a patient who would benefit from counseling and recommendations for adequate nutrition while at BWH. Re-evaluation: Re-evaluation will occur when current short term physical therapy goals have been met and the patient still has skilled PT needs, significant change in medical status occurs, and/or within 10 days from the previous evaluation. Standard of Care: Pulmonary Disease Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Brigham and Women's Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services. All rights reserved 28 Discharge Planning : Commonly expected outcomes at discharge Discharge planning will occur on an individual basis depending on the patient's medical, physical and social needs and is a coordinated effort that occurs with the physician, nurse, care coordinator, therapist(s), the patie nt and his or her family. Transfer of Care If further physical therapy treatment is warranted, recommendations will be provided to the patient, family, and physician team for appropriate additional rehabilitation services once discharged from the acute c are setting. For example, if the patient has significant impairments and functional limitations and/or complicated medical needs at the time of discharge from the acute care hospital, he or she may be discharged to an acute or sub -acute rehabilitation faci lity, skilled nursing facility, or other extended care facility. Patients are frequently discharged with home O2 and the PT may be asked for recommendations regarding how much O2 a patient requires with activity. Home PT may be recommended for patients who require a home safety evaluation, have not met their short -term goals, or to address ongoing body impairments or activity/participation restrictions. Outpatient PT may be recommended for patients who have continued body impairments or activity/participati on restrictions and who are able to leave their house. Outpatient Pulmonary Rehabilitation May be appropriate for patients with ongoing aerobic or activity tolerance limitations. This is a multidisciplinary intervention designed to reduce symptoms, optim ize functional status through exercise, education, psychosocial and outcomes assessment. It provides further education in a group setting which can be very supportive for patients with chronic disease. The diagnoses approved for pulmonary rehab are COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer and lung cancer surgery, lung volume reduction surgery befor e and after lung transplantation.
