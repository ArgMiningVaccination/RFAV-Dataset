Success Stories \"I wanted to let you know some of the results I've experienced over the last three weeks. For starters I have lost 7 pounds but that's not what I'm so excited about. The biggest change that I've had in my body is solid sleep - the kind where you lay your head down and then wake up in the morning. No tossing or turning and no waking up in the middle of the night! For this one reason only I will make sure that my diet changes very little after these 3 weeks. I haven't had coffee at all and feel so much better, not needing it in the morning to wake up anymore. I'm looking forward to a cup of Teecino every now and again on cold mornings but for the most part I don't have any cravings for coffee OR sweets for that matter. The other crazy thing is that my teeth are whiter cause I'm not drinking coffee! I feel healthier and more alert. My memory is not foggy and when I wake in the morning I'm awake and not groggy. I've had two different medical procedures during this time and both required fasting which was not a problem at all. I feel like because I had started this program and was in the process of cleaning my body out the procedures went extremely well! I'm sure there are more things that have changed and when I think of them I will let you know. The three weeks haven't been easy but my body was begging for the change and I'm glad that I stuck with it!!\" -A. Mumford\"Yeah it was 5 days of caffeine with drawl headaches and migraines, but yesterday I completed a physical, 20 lbs. lighter than a year ago, blood pressure back down to normal, and the crazy nurse got really excited over the color of my blood, said it was full of iron just by looking at it, a dark maroon color, something she doesn't get to see too often because nobody eats enough veggies. I know the cholesterol and Triglycerides will be good and knowing that in 21 days I made myself healthier is worth posting on Facebook, the SP cleanse is the real deal.\" \u2014 J. Kerr \"I just wanted everyone to know that my husband and I finished the 21 day cleanse last week and we have put ourselves back on it. We loved everything about it. He lost 17lbs and I lost 10 1/2. We both felt great. What I loved most about the diet is that it fixed all of my digestive problems and sleep issues. Everyone who just started, stick with it. It is sooooo worth it!\" -S. Kerr \"My husband and I just finished the 21 day cleanse and we loved it! Just wished I would have done this a long time ago. I always attributed my fatigue and fogginess to being a mom and over 40- but truly it was my diet, for I felt truly 10 years younger while on the cleanse. I also have virtually no sugar cravings anymore. Once off the cleanse I had a cup of coffee while on vacation and it didn't even dawn on me to put sugar in it ( usually I put 2 packs in). Thank you so much Julie for all your support through this and encouragement. We are very grateful and look forward to continuing this \"new journey\"-C. Shea \"Today is my day 21! When I started I was looking forward to this day as being the end but recently realized that this is a new beginning for me. This cleanse has helped me so much and many of my symptoms have begun to clear and there is no way I am going to trade in how good I feel by going back to eating junk like I was. Thank you Scott and Julie for all the help and encouragement!\" \u2014 L. Brewer \"Great news! I have been on the cleanse for over a week, Jim about 10 days. We are doing well, lots of energy and feeling clean! Jim is down more than 12 pounds!! He is excited to be eating some protein today! Thanks for hooking us up with this!!\" -M. Thompson \"I recently completed a 21 day cleanse through Powersource Chiropractic. The program and related supplements were derived from whole grains and vegetables. I felt very well supported throughout the program with Juli, Scott, and their staff. They made themselves available to answer any and all questions. Now, I have greater energy and happiness. I never thought I'd be able to overcome the temptation of sugar and sweets. I'm thrilled with my increased willpower and weight loss, but mostly I'm glad to be feeling happy again. I plan to continue healthy eating as a permanent change in my life. Thank you Powersource for helping me get back on the right track!\" -L.
