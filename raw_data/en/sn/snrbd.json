Talent and money are flowing into Canada's largest city as never before. Between 2016 and 2020, Toronto gained more tech jobs, almost 70,000 of them, than any North American city bar San Francisco. Meanwhile, last year, in the depths of a pandemic, VCs invested $1.2 billion in Toronto companies, including bumper raises from Wealthsimple, A.I. venture Deep Genomics and healthcare startup Maple. Even two or three years ago, rounds in the tens of millions were major news. Today, they're almost routine. And as the city's startup scene matures, more VCs are chasing Series A and B deals. The Innovation Economy Council has tracked the rise of accelerators in the city, and analyzed data collected from 36 accelerators and incubators across the GTA. According to its recent survey, these hubs are supporting 5,293 startups across more than 11 sectors. Sixteen hubs of those surveyed are embedded in academic institutions, a trend that began in 2010 with the creation of DMZ at Ryerson. There are eight hubs that specialize in innovation in the arts, six focus on social entrepreneurship and 14 receive some kind of funding from the city. These hubs take the raw materials of an entrepreneur's ideas and ambition and mould them into viable businesses. Combined, they have connected more than 30,000 startups with the mentors, talent, capital and space they need to get their products to market and create sustainable jobs. 1974 Harbourfront Centre 1987 Toronto Fashion Incubator 1989 Toronto Business Development Centre 1999 Access Community Capital Fund 2000 MaRS 2008 The Remix Project 2010 DMZ Ryerson 2012 Canadian Film Centre (CFC) Canada's Music Incubator (CMI) Scadding Court Community Centre School for Social Entrepreneurs Creative Destruction Lab 2013 Centre for Entrepreneurship (CfE) , Humber College Impact Centre, UofT York Entrepreneurship Development Institute The Hub , UofT Scarborough 2014 HELIX , Seneca College 2015 StartGBC, George Brown indiefilmTO Legal Innovation Zone, Ryerson SheEO Social Venture Zone, Ryerson Innovation York , York 2016 LatAmStartups BEST , York U Innovates The Big Entrepreneurship UofT UPPLift GENIAL, York U 2018 Artscape Daniels LaunchPad Centre for Emerging Artists & Designers, OCAD TribalScale 2020 OneEleven (originally launched in 2013, closed and relaunched in 2020) A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 4 Networking on a city scale As the above timeline shows, the idea of an innovation hub is not new. The need for centres to nurture would-be innovators was understood in the 1970s, when the city's first cultural incubator was founded at Harbourfront. But the idea needed time to gather steam. It wasn't until the opening of Toronto Business Development Centre in 1989 that the city gained its first dedicated hub for entrepreneurs across a range of sectors; the launch of MaRS in 2000 was one of the most significant additions in terms of its scope and number of organizations it now supports. It takes a village to create a business \u2014 in this case, a village of hubs at different levels of entry. There has been a great proliferation of academic hubs over the last seven years, and this has greatly increased the support of tech-based startups. The academic centres are pipelines that connect growing startups to bigger hubs and to the venture capital backers they need. Some of Toronto's best - known startups have followed this route, including infectious-disease venture BlueDot, which was the first in the world to warn of the risk from COVID. It began at U of T before joining MaRS for support to commercialize its disease-monitoring platform internationally. Beyond the tech geeks Much of the attention focuses on the downtown tech sector, where IP-heavy startups cluster within a stone's throw of universities, research hospitals and Bay Street. But that is only part of the story. Toronto's innovation ecosystem is as broad as it is deep. Hubs serving small businesses and early- stage entrepreneurs tend to be focused outside of the downtown core, such as the School for Social Entrepreneurship, Parkdale Centre for Innovation and York Entrepreneurship Development Institute. In terms of sheer numbers, some of the city's biggest hubs support artists. The opening of Artscape Daniels Launchpad and OCAD University's Centre for Emerging Artists and Designers in 2018 have provided thousands of creatives with new spaces to work and exhibit. The city's entrepreneurial energy also runs through its diverse neighbourhoods and suburbs, where colleges and a growing number of community organizations are developing programs that help owners get small businesses off the ground. Though many of the city's hubs have work to do in tracking diversity, the numbers that are available are broadly positive (with the exception of Indigenous entrepreneurs, who remain vastly underrepresented). Almost half of companies supported by the hubs have at least one female founder, while 60 percent have at least one Black founder or another person of colour on their founding team. This support system is helping Toronto tap into its reserves of entrepreneurial energy wherever they bubble up. It has created an ecosystem that tilts toward Canada's advantages in digital technologies, healthcare, clean energy and creative industries, while making room for new business models that push social innovation. It is also helping break Canada's habit of pouring money into startups, only to see them acquired by American firms once they begin to scale. Today, Toronto has an encouraging crop of enterprise software companies that are growing through strategic partnerships with corporates, rather than being bought by them. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 5A crucial moment Toronto has moved past the stage of trying to kick start its innovation economy; it's now vying for a place in the top tier of startup cities. But it is not there yet. Its companies are still under-capitalized in comparison with those in the U.S. and they grow more slowly as a result. And for all its growing clout, Toronto has yet to produce the kind of iconic unicorn that cements a city's status as an innovation heavyweight. Make no mistake, Toronto is up against global cities like Boston, New York and London in a race for talent, capital and ideas. They, too, are investing heavily in their innovation infrastructures and opening new centres to spur entrepreneurship and economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic. To compete with these deep-pocketed rivals, Toronto will have to be smart and nimble in supporting its startups. The past year has clearly highlighted the integral role governments play in fostering and sustaining core parts of our society. While innovation obviously cannot happen without innovators themselves, the infrastructure within which they work can make an enormous difference. As research gathered for this report shows, Toronto has constructed an impressive system of hubs. The city's innovation community now needs to amplify the network effect of these organizations. At the same time, new ways will have to be found to address the gaps that remain, particularly for entrepreneurs from under-represented groups. To build strategically for a healthy and more equitable economy after the pandemic requires a clear- eyed assessment of the city's strengths and weaknesses. This report aims to provide that. In the pages that follow, we offer a snapshot of an ecosystem at a crucial juncture. Toronto's innovation economy will be shaped for years by the trajectory of its recovery after COVID. Fast-moving startups are poised to lead the city's rebound; the challenge will be to ensure that the rising economic tide lifts all boats. By addressing the shortfalls in its innovation ecosystem now, Toronto can build back better and emerge even stronger than before. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 6The survey To effectively measure the level of support currently available in the city to innovators, surveys were sent out to 59 hubs that support startups, entrepreneurs and artists working in a variety of sectors, including food, social enterprise, finance, biotech, cleantech and creative industries. We heard back from leaders of 16 academic hubs and 20 non-academic hubs, who answered both quantitative and qualitative questions about their programs; in addition, 26 supplementary interviews were conducted. (Note: More detail on each hub is provided in the appendix.) 36 organizations were surveyed, of which: 17 provide accelerator support 20 are incubators 8 provide co-working space 14 city funded 440 people collectively employed 30,000+ startups served all years in operation 5,293 startups served in 2020 TOP INDUSTRIES digital and mobile media creative industries cleantech TOP SERVICES capacity building training and courses network connections mentorship A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 7 The h ubs surveyed Academic 1.

These include MaRS as well as 16 centres o utside Toronto, such as Invest Ottawa and Kingston 's Launc h Lab. Academic hubs T hese are ofte n structure d as umbre lla organizations with numerous attache d sub-orga nizations working independentl y under the purview o f the ma in grou p. At the Universit y of T oronto, for example, Universit y of Toronto Entrepreneur ship (UTE), conta ins a variety o f accelerators under its u mbrella, such as the Healt h Innovation Hub, the U of T Instit ute for Aerospace Stud ies and the Ea rly Stage Technolo gy A ccelerator. Academic hu bs differ in who the y wor k wit h.

Non-academ ic hubs These centres o ffer specific programming and are frequentl y tightly focused on a specific sector . Examples can include everything from Artscape Daniels Launchpad, which is focused on creatives, to OneEleven, a not-f or-profit innovation incubator. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 9Toronto's innovative ecosystem Early support for entrepreneurship focused on creative and cultural organizations, such as Harbourfront and the Toronto Fashion Institute, as the city looked to shake off its staid image as a boring banking town. When TFI launched in 1987, its aim was to \"play an essential role in the growth and promotion of the Canadian fashion community,\" and that goal reflects a desire endemic to Toronto at the time, and arguably that even lingers now: to be a significant player on the world stage. A bird's eye view of innovation in Toronto reveals that the city is, in terms of sheer numbers, still largely dominated by creative ventures. (Digital media, which includes enterprise software, fintech, AI and machine learning, is a close second). Collectively, the hubs serve 5,293 startups. A further 1,272 are undefined (hubs didn't have data on what industries the startups are in). That leaves 4,021 startups supported by the hubs in industries that are broken out as in the chart below. But upon c loser inspection, the ecosystem is far richer and more varied. Creative hubs, because they often work with individual artists, skew the overall number of who is supported. Collectively, all the hubs surveyed support more than 2,000 artists; Artscape alone supports more than 1,100 artists and creative people. However, because an individual artist and a startup with 10 employees both technically count as \"one\" entity supported, to gain an accurate picture of support in Toronto, it helps to separate out the creative hubs . A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 10 MaRS, as a RIC and the largest hub of digital and mobile media, fintech and other digital sectors, also significantly affects the numbers. MaRS, which receives a relatively small amount of funding by the City of Toronto ($120,000 of the hub's $30 -million budget), serves 1,244 ventures, concentrated in digital and mobile media, enterprise, health, legal and cleantech industries. Because these ventures represent 24 percent of all the ventures served by Toronto's hubs, they skew the data toward those industries. As such, to have a closer look at the sectors supported by the other hubs, it's helpful to separate out MaRS as well as the creative institutions. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 11While it took a decade after the launch of MaRS for hubs at post-secondary institutions to emerge, they now make up more than half of all the hubs in the city. Essentially, these hubs have built a pipeline through which the many research projects at academic centres can be commercialized, says Jon French, the director of University of Toronto Entre preneurship. \"Based on lessons learned from looking at accelerators in the U.S. and globally \u2014 both inside and outside universities \u2014 there was a recognition that accelerators help scale entrepreneurial education, mentorship, resources, networks and more,\" he says. By extension, in fostering and investing in those supports, there would be structural effects \u2014 that \"even graduates who did not build companies could apply entrepreneurial thinking to other opportunities.\" In the past few years, academic-affiliated hubs have developed considerable strength in key areas, and work with the majority of advanced manufacturing, cleantech, health, construction, social initiatives, digital media and legal ventures. It 's also revealing to compare the different sectors supported by hubs that receive funding from the City of Toronto and those supported by hubs that draw its funding elsewhere. There are distinct areas of focus. The majority (64 percent) of the digital and mobile media ventures and 80 percent of the creative ventures are from hubs that receive city funding, as are 50 percent of both the cleantech and construction ventures. Hubs that do not receive funding from the city, on the other hand, are largely working in other sectors. Excluding MaRS-supported ventures, all of the legal, 99 percent of the social, 97 percent of the food business and 98 percent of the retail/enterprise ventures are supported by hubs that receive no city support, as well as 92 percent of the education and 90 percent of the health ventures . A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 12By avoiding an overlap of support, the city is able to fill in any gaps left unserved by hubs that do not receive funding through the city. In this way, the city plays a key role in fostering a broad scope of innovation. Strong areas of growth Among Toronto's strengths are its many world - class health research facilities. As such, incubators such as MaRS or Health Innovation Hub at the University of Toronto have helped foster a climate of success in biotech and health tech. One such example is LSK Technologies, which emerged out of University of Toronto's UTEST and Health Innovation Hub. LSK started with a small kit to rapidly test for the Zika virus, which spread in South America and elsewhere in 2015 and 2016. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, LSK pivoted to produce a COVID-19 rapid test, and was awarded a $500,000 federal grant to develop the technology. It shows what can happen when all the components of a university-based accelerator work together. This project saw the combined efforts of \"all of those different elements of faculty, student collaboration, multiple accelerators, pivoting being based on university, IP, or research,\" says UTE's Jon French. \"And turned that into a commercializable business.\" Also out of UTEST, Deep Genomics is a company that works on AI, RNA and automation, of particular importance given that RNA is central to the development of new COVID vaccines. The venture also joined MaRS in 2015, a good example of the increasingly rich and interconnected ecosystem. In 2020, the company raised $40 million in Series B financing, and continues to grow. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 13 In a similar vein, Toronto's deep and broad legal community makes it a fertile space for merging legal and tech. Ryerson's Legal Innovation Zone seeks to focus on innovation in legal services, with a particular emphasis on reducing barriers and expanding access. \"For far too long, the vast majority of individuals and small- and medium-sized enterprises have been locked out of legal services because of high costs, inefficiency and other access issues,\" says Hersh Perlis, director of LIZ. \"This past year, we have hosted thousands of people at our various online conferences and webinars with experts from around the world trying to push for change.\" Among its programs are attempts to reform family law, virtual law classes and a new international virtual tech entrepreneurship program. Toronto is also branching out into other new sectors. For instance, under the umbrella of Innovation York, YSpace Markham started the province's first accelerator focused on scaling food and beverage companies in the consumer- packaged goods space in 2019. To date, it has supported 16 ventures, which are now selling products in more than 400 retail locations. As well, DMZ Ryerson launched a Cybersecurity Accelerator Program in 2020 \u2014 a sector that is increasingly significant and in need of innovative ideas. The city's innovation economy is, however, still dominated by more \"traditional\" tech -focused field s like digital and mobile media, enterprise software and fintech. Almost a third of Toronto's startups fall under that category and many have seen incredible growth in recent months. In February 2021, Tealbook, which develops cloud-based products to unify and synchronize supplier data for businesses, announced $18 million in Series A financing. In March 2021, the online learning startup Disco raised an oversubscribed $6-million seed round. And the recent sale of Wattpad for $750 million \u2014 one of the largest exits in Toronto history \u2014 is a further indication of the comparative scale of digital media versus other sectors. Tellingly, Disco's co -founders have roots in the Toronto scene \u2014 Candace Faktor had worked as the general manager of Wattpad and Chris Sukornyk is also the founder of Chango, a performance marketing platform that sold for $120 million in 2015. The talent pool in Toronto is deepening. Success, however, isn't necessarily limited to technical ventures or startups. For instance, 80 percent of graduates of OCAD's Centre for Emerging Artists and Designers go on to start their own businesses. Many graduates of the Remix Project go on to careers in the music industry, including Adel Nur, who is one of Drake's managers, and Juno winner Jessie Reyez. And collectively, the more than 240 startups supported by TFI create between 400 and 700 jobs each year, and 65 percent of the ventures are revenue-generating. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 14 From 2015 to 2021: How the city has progressed To help gauge the breadth and depth of today's innovation community, it's helpful to look at the intended strategy. In 2015, the city outlined a vision for Toronto's startup and creative industries in From Concept to Commercialization , highlighting the challenges and areas that needed more support, and provided an overall picture of the state of the startup ecosystem. Its key recommendations were threefold: Toronto should work to strengthen the ecosystem around startups; the city should support regional growth by focusing on where sectors converge, particularly in fruitful convergence between tech and established sectors, such as law, retail and education; and finally, the city should support development of entrepreneurship in Toronto neighbourhoods by focusing on community development. There are no objective metrics to judge whether the city has achieved these goals. However, some changes are apparent . Strengthening the innovation infrastructure As seen in the timeline above, the number of organizations dedicated to supporting entrepreneurship and creative activity has seen massive growth in the last few years. A full 17 of the hubs surveyed for this report have launched since 2015. Those include academic expansion, such as the rise of accelerators at York University, social initiatives such as SheEO and Parkdale Centre for Innovation, arts organizations such as indiefilmTO and the Centre for Emerging Artists and Designers at OCAD University, as well as private hubs such as OneEleven and The Big Push. By any metric, that is a profound expansion of the range and scope of innovation infrastructure in the city. As Jane Kearns, vice president of Growth Services at MaRS, says, \"In a pretty short time we've built an incredibly strong innovation ecosystem in Toronto \u2014 and frankly, in Canada. \" A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 15 Regional economic growth and sectoral convergence The city's 2015 report outlined some specific goals for sectoral convergence: Support the expansion of businesses in food, fintech, manufacturing, construction and cleantech, while also fostering growth in urban music, as well as places for artists and designers to showcase work. On this latter, artistic focus, the city appears to have had reasonable success. In 2015, a group of local filmmakers founded indiefilmTO to help nurture the independent film scene in Toronto. And the emergence of Artscape Daniels Launchpad, which opened its doors in 2018, has had a large impact. In its second year of operation, it signed on more than 1,000 members and its programming engaged approximately 4,500 creatives. As a place for people in the arts to showcase work, OCAD's Centre for Emerging Artists and Designers (CEAD) offers an instructive example. CEAD has partnered with Partial Gallery, which is an online portal for artists to sell or rent their work. There are, however, some business sectors that the 2015 report suggested focusing on that still represent a very small portion of Toronto's innovation context. Construction and green building constitute just 0.8 percent of all ventures; cleantech represents a healthier 12.2 percent of ventures; advanced manufacturing is at 1.4 percent of those surveyed. If the city wishes to see an increase in the representation of these sectors, further support may be warranted. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 16 Integration into communities Incubators and hubs are, by definition, meant to foster particular sorts of companies, entrepreneurship or creative endeavours, which means their primary aim is to help a particular set of people achieve success. So, when it comes to who may participate, among the various hubs, there is no single eligibility standard. This is due to the varying goals of the hubs, from introducing the idea of entrepreneurship to commercialization. Some academic hubs, such as Humber College's Centre for Entrepreneurship, HELIX and StartGBC at George Brown College, allow anyone from the community to enter its programs. Other academic programs explicitly aim to commercialize intellectual property produced by students, professors and graduates of the university, and thus limit participation to those individuals. At Innovation York, for example, the commercialization aspects of the program deal only with York students and professors, while broader entrepreneurship programs focused on training individuals in the basics of starting and building a business are open to anyone in the community. The majority of hubs and accelerators in the city are located in the downtown core. The density of support that these hubs provide falls off in the inner suburbs, particularly in the northwestern and northeastern corners of the city, which, it should be noted, are among the city's most economically depressed and demographically diverse. What follows is a chloropleth map that shows the density of entrepreneurs supported by 56 percent of the hubs in Toronto. The darker the colour, the more entrepreneurs supported in that area. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 17 A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 18 A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 19 Since 2018, when its programs began, more than 300 individuals have accessed one or more of its entrepreneurship programs, and success for its participants is measured in many different ways. \"We provide them with the tools to pave their own way to thei r entrepreneurship journey,\" says Ayaa Mohamad, who is a manager in community development and engagement at Scadding Court. And these programs are often the first step. \"Someone may decide it's not the best time to pursue entrepreneurship or they might realize that they need to access industry-specific training in relation to their field, and so we'll refer them to other incubator programs or coworking spaces that can help them reach the launch stage of their businesses.\" A prime example of this network effect is Edinson Castillo, who came from Peru to study at Greystone College for international business management. After finishing the Newcomer Entrepreneurship Hub program at Scadding Court, he joined the LatAmStartups Incubator and the HELIX Incubator at Seneca College to help expand his company, InnScience, which imports and exports lab equipment to South America. The company is developing a multilingual platform to support applied research by connecting industries and scientists. Impacts of the programming at these community- oriented hubs are often measured in ways beyond capital raises and jobs created. As Chryssa Koulis, who heads up the School of Social Entrepreneurship, says, \"If we have made a transformational change in a person's life, we coun t that as a success, whether they launch an enterprise or not.\" In that sense, the community entrepreneurship hubs serve quite a different purpose than, say, the large academic hubs. While the latter are often focused on large-scale, global-impact companies, community hubs like Scadding Court aim for local, small-scale entrepreneurship with programming designed to lower the barriers to opening a business or social venture, rather than necessarily immediately scaling up. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 20Diversity, inclusion and representation in the tech ecosystem The increase of Black Lives Matter protests after the killing of George Floyd and the lingering after-effects of the MeToo movement have pushed questions of equity and diversity to the forefront. Indeed, many hubs surveyed for this report stated that in addition to their current programs, they were in the process of instituting more changes as a result of an increased awareness of issues surrounding identity and equity . City demographics 52% Toronto's population identifies as \"visible minorities\" <1/2 All residents are first-generation immigrants to Canada 44% of Torontonians have a first language other than English or French The good news is that many of the ventures served by the hubs reflect aspects of Toronto's diverse population. Based on the data from the hubs that track diversity numbers, women, Black and BIPOC co-founders are well represented. The bad news, however, is that not enough of the hubs are tracking this information, and more support is particularly needed for Indigenous founders. While women founders still face many challenges accessing capital and scaling companies, their participation rates at innovation hubs are encouraging. Gender initiatives are starting to move the dial. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 21\"For a number of years, there has been an emphasis on supporting women-identifying entrepreneurs or students, and getting more women in tech, more women in STEM, more women in entrepreneurship access to capital.\" Some of those programs happen in the hubs themselves, but others function through outreach or get involved earlier in the pipeline. Creative Destruction Lab, for example, has an apprentice program for high-school students, and girls in particular, to address the gender imbalance of those who apply for programs. More than 900 students have participated in the program in which they get to spend a day with mentors, ask questions and keep in touch after the program has ended. Several hubs are dedicated to helping women entrepreneurs. SheEO is a Canada-based model with chapters in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and the U.K., in which women and non-binary people support each other through collectively gathering capital. Sponsors, referred to as activators, contribute to the fund each month, and each year the group chooses five entrepreneurs to receive an interest-free loan and a year of coaching. \"When SheEO first started, a lot of the women who were signing up as 'activators' were later in their careers. They knew the inequities, and they were just sick of it, so they said, 'I'm going to give money,' \" says Hannah Cree, a venture in residence. \"In the last two years, our 'activator' base has expanded. There's a lot of professionals who are all helping each oth er. It's become a network of women.\" Accelerators and hubs are launching new initiatives within their own programs. In 2020, the Canadian Film Centre launched the Fifth Wave initiative, which positions itself as Canada's first feminist accelerator for women in digital media. The program offers mentorship, outreach and an intensive four-month bootcamp style program for 10 qualifying companies. There are still gender disparities, however, especially at the leadership level. While there are a number of initiatives aimed at women, there are still comparatively fewer women executives. Krista Jones, vice president of venture services at MaRS, suggests this may be a question of lead time \u2014 that \"we haven't had enough time for the female - led companies to grow up through the ecosystem and make it to the scale-up stage .\" Supporting racialized entrepreneurs is becoming more of a focus for many of the hubs. Gray Graffan, director at the Hub UofT Scarborough reports that the startup incubator is on track to double the number of Black-led startups, and that close to 75 percent of the founders it supports are people of colour. Other incubators have started targeted programs. The Black Youth Design Initiative at OCAD's Centre for Emer ging Artists and Designers, for example, focuses on intergenerational mentoring with intensive on-site programs. And last June, the DMZ announced a $1-million program expansion of its Black Innovation Fellowship , which provides mentorship, events and connections to industry, capital and alumni. The dearth of First Nation, M\u00e9tis and Inuit entrepreneurs currently supported by the innovation hubs is striking. According to the 2016 Census, Indigenous peoples make up less than 1 percent of the city's population. Of the 36 hubs covered by this report, only 14 (39 percent) track information about Indigenous identity. Of those 14 hubs, only six report supporting ventures with at least one Indigenous founder. As a result, the median value of ventures supported by the hubs with at least one Indigenous founder is zero. This underscores the need for Toronto's hubs to track Indigenous identity among the founders of the ventures they support . The creation of the Indigenous Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, slated to open in 2022, is a welcome step in removing barriers facing First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit entrepreneurs in the city. Jon French, University of Toronto A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 22But deliberate and sustained effort across the ecosystem is required. \"There's a level of intentionality that you need to set in order to include different perspectives,\" says Nataly De Monte, director of CFC Media Lab. \"We've had to make adjustments in how we communicate and approach these communities with heightened sensitivities to foster an anti-oppression, anti-racist and radical inclusivity. But it's so necessary in creating a more equal and just world.\" When the Canadian Film Centre launched its Fifth Wave Initiative, it pledged to serve a minimum of 30 percent diverse and underrepresented women. It set up an advisory board and decided to concentrate the next Fifth Wave cohort solely on BIPOC women. Plus, the centre has partnered with the National Film Board, Ford Foundation and ImaginATIVE to help Indigenous storytellers develop virtual reality projects. One key issue when it comes to diversity is measurement: To gauge the success of diversity initiatives, a baseline is necessary. Many organizations surveyed for this report have not gathered diversity, equity and inclusion data. This is starting to change. At Innovation York, for example, diversity metrics have been incorporated into the organization's annual fiscal reporting for the first time this year. As the university physically expands with a new campus in York Region, one of IY's hubs \u2014 YSpace \u2014 is working toward geographic and demographic inclusivity in its programming going forward. UTEST is working to establish new initiatives and baseline measurements for Black and Indigenous entrepreneurs . The innovation pipeline and questions of access During the survey, many of the hub leaders highlighted that more attention also needs to be paid earlier in the entrepreneurship pipeline. To that end, Ryerson's DMZ created Base Camp, an eight-week intensive program that runs during the summer for high- school students. \"We're trying to get them excited and also more aware of the entrepreneurship world,\" says Abdullah Snobar, executive director of the DMZ Ryerson and chief executive officer of DMZ Ventures. \"We help them with mentorship and design thinking and coaching and training.\" Similar to the apprentice program offered by CDL, the aim is to catch individuals before they make decisions about where and what to study so that they may continue to grow Toron to's ecosystem . However, questions of gender, race and sexuality are not the only ones that have an effect on accessibility and diversity. MaRS's Krista Jones points to the question of class or economic mobility specifically in relation to startups. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 23We have a class problem in startups,\" says Jones. \"Innovation is still a rich man's job, not just because of the attitudes around it \u2014 you have to have the ability to draw a low salary. Angel financing is hard: People don't want founders to take salaries at the start. But you might not come from a rich family and you actually need to pay your rent, and you need to be able to raise money for it.\" As Jones suggests, the fact that early-stage financing is called the friends and family round speaks to the implicit assumptions about having access to capital and being part of a social or economic milieu that has sufficient funds to be investing at all. For some entrepreneurs, a little money can go a long way. Access Community Capital provides microloans (up to $15,000) to marginalized people who aren't able to qualify for loans or funding through regular channels but have viable business ideas; it also launched a women's accelerator program for new Canadians in 2019. \"Success can be from where they were at,\" says Otis Mushonga, ACC's manager of program and services. He points to Yashelle Jackson, who started Securegard, a retail security company, and \"went from getting T4s to giving T4s,\" and Ryan Knights, the founder of a waterless car-washing business, who started a summer program to support Black youth. \"It might not be big,\" says Mushonga. \"But these all have ripple effects in the community.\" It's clear that support and opportunities need to be provided across the entire entrepreneurial journey \u2014 from learning business skills and doing market research to accessing capital and addressing regulatory hurdles. To be sure, the City has played a key role in early stage support. As we emerge from the pandemic, this may be an area of where further support is needed. Indeed, the net effect entrepreneurs have on the city should not be played down. Whether it's at the neighbourhood level, like Knight's c ar wash, or on a national scale, like virtual health provider Maple, startups are the engine of the economy. Ventures at the other end of the pipeline also require support, especially as they develop from late-stage startups to mature companies and look to expand in new markets. Last year, MaRS launched its Momentum program to help these future drivers of Canadian prosperity, with the aim of accelerating each toward $100-million in revenues within five years. Advisors provide strategic support around such issues as raising capital, attracting talent and selling abroad. Many of the companies in Momentum are creating rich intellectual property, such as Synaptive's robotic digital microscope used in brain surgeri es and Blue J Legal's artificial intelligence platform , which predicts the outcomes of tax and employment law cases. Blue J Legal, which began at the University of Toronto, now has offices in New York City and Washington plus Toronto. It's yet another example of the power of the ecosystem. A CITY OF ENTREPRENEURS Building a supply chain of innovation 24 Building an innovation supply chain Toronto has created an impressive innovation engine. A decade or two ago, the city's entrepreneurs had little choice but to be lone wolves and build their businesses through their own grit and determination. Today, they are part of a community of founders and creatives with a support system of incubators and accelerators that reaches into almost every part of the city. That network has been vital to founders like Joshua Wong, CEO of Opus One. His smart-energy- grid startup is on course to make $100-million in annual revenue by 2025, and he credits some of that success to having peers he could relate to. \"I fell a lot over the last 10 years, and Toronto's innovation community helped pick me up,\" he says. Undeniably, COVID dealt Toronto's innovation ecosystem a blow, and it felt the sting of layoffs and closures. But the past year also demonstrated the value of what has been built. Toronto's startups are nimble: In times of stress, they will bend, not break. After a period of adjustment, they quickly got back to hiring. Opus One is planning to grow its staff to 150 as it expands globally to meet demand for clean power. Boast.ai, which helps other companies navigate the complex process of applying for R&D tax credits, was recently recruiting for at least 20 positions. Toronto's startups also supply ideas and technologies that provide flexibility to the entire economy. Many of the digital pivots made by Canada's largest companies have been executed using software built by startups. As the economic recovery gathers pace, the city's hubs are continuing to develop to meet startups' changing needs. After successfully moving online during the pandemic, many hubs are now mulling hybrid models that blend digital and in-person programming, making them more accessible to more people. Access Community Capital is working on expanding its accelerator program for female entrepreneurs beyond the GTA to the whole of Ontario. York University's BEST initiative for would-be tech entrepreneurs has plans to move into a building five times its current footprint. Meanwhile, Humber's Centre for Entrepreneurship is working on plans for a makerspace. But entrepreneurs are a restless bunch. Talent and capital are footloose and still operate in a largely borderless world, even as protectionist sentiments rise. To maintain its upward path, Toronto will have to keep investing in its innovation ecosystem and removing barriers to entrepreneurship wherever they are found. Our interviews for this report uncovered several areas where there is still work to do. These range from complex social issues, such as addressing the underrepresentation of Indigenous entrepreneurs, to business matters, such as the desire for greater marketing support for startups, and even prosaic problems, such as the expense of registering a business in Ontario. The survey shows key areas well covered by hubs that don't receive funding from the city, which can help illuminate sectors where Toronto support could have an outsized impact. Plus, given the challenges of the past year, further support of the creative sector as well as community-level entrepreneurs, both of which have been especially hard hit this past year , would help in the post-pandemic recovery. The fact remains that entrepreneurs who found a business are taking a leap of faith. Unfortunately, most will fall. But the ones who fly will create jobs and lift their communities with them. Toronto has built a solid network of hubs to support its entrepreneurs. Now, it has to ensure that they receive tailored help at all points along their journey, to tip the odds a little more in their favour.
