We have since grown to nineteen clinicians caring for patients at two Morgantown locations, Suncrest Towne Center and Coombs Farm. As an extension to our original vision, we are now excited to announce our newest addition: The Mindbody Center. The Mindbody Center provides a space for both Natural Resilience and Resilient Kids practitioners to offer complementary and alternative mental health services to current clients and to provide wellness opportunities for the community. Services include experiential and educational groups, meditation, yoga and other movement therapies, acupuncture, and health coaching.
