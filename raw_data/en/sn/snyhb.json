Inherent in the granting of this degree is the fact that students have observational, communicational, motor, intellectual, conceptual, behavioral and social skills that enable them to practice their profession. A candidate for the M.D. degree must have abilities and skills of five varieties including: observation; communication; motor; intellectual-conceptual abilities; behavioral and social attributes; and stamina. Candidates can request reasonable accommodations, if needed, to meet these essential functions by following the University policies and procedures and contacting the Office for Disability Services as outlined at the end of this document. Under all circumstances, a candidate should be able to perform these outlined essential functions in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Therefore, the use of an intermediary in the clinical setting is ordinarily not permitted. 1. Observation Candidates must be able to acquire a defined level of information in both the clinical and basic sciences. Such information is presented via demonstrations, experiences, lectur es and small -group teaching exercises. Gaining such information will require the candidate to be able to observe material at a distance and close- at-hand (such as slides and overhead projections), and organisms and structures through a microscope. In first and second year clinical preceptorship and in the clinical sciences, candidates will be required to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close- at- hand and to interpret radiographs and other graphic images and digital or analog represe ntations of physiological phenomenon (such as EKGs). Hands -on experience will also be required in learning how to perform a complete physical examination on patients. The observation and information acquisition noted above will require candidates to have functional use of visual, auditory and somatic sensations or the functional equivalent. 2. Communication A candidate should be able to communicate effectively and efficiently, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, a ctivity, and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to respectfully communicate effectively, efficiently and sensitively with patients, their families, faculty, peers and all other members of the health care team. Communication includes not only speech but reading and writing or the functional equivalent. 3. Motor Candidates must be able to directly perform palpation, percussion, auscultation, and other basic diagnostic procedures. Candidates must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide basic medical care, such as airway management, placement of catheters, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and application of pressure to control bleeding, simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision or the functional equivalent. 4. Intellectual -Conceptual Abilities Candidates must possess measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and problem - solving ability. They must have the intellectual capability to increase their fund of information and knowledge base through various media as well as from course materials, scheduled conferences, lectures, rounds, current literature and journals; and to make appr opriate evaluations of clinical circumstances. Analytical problem -solving skills are critical in medicine and candidates must be able to perform in a timely manner, tasks utilizing such skills. 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes Candidates must possess the emotional and physical health required for full utilization of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the d evelopment of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to function effectively under stress. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, appropriate hygiene and appearance, interpersonal skills, interest, and mot ivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and education processes. Students will be judged during the course of study on their acquisition of the knowledge necessary for the practice of medicine, their ability to perform the essential skills noted above, and their intellectual, physical and behavioral capacities to meet the requirements of the School's curriculum. 6. Stamina Candidates must possess the stamina, energy and endurance to complete the full curriculum of required courses, electives and other activities under the established School policies. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads, adapt to changing environments, display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical findings of many patients. NJMS complies with all applicable laws concerning applicants and students with disabilities. NJMS will endeavor, if requested, to provide reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified applicants and matriculated students with disabilities unless: (a) such accommodations impose undue hardship to the institution, or (b) direct threats of substantial harm to the health and safety of others due to the disability and cannot be eliminated by any reasonable accommodations, or (c) such accommodations fundamentally alter the educational program or academic standards. Technological accommodations may be available to assist individuals with a variety of disabilities and may be permitted, but ordinaril y the use of human intermediaries who may substitute their power of selection and observation in place of the student's will not be permitted. A student whose behavior or performance raises questions or concerns pertaining to his or her ability to fulfill the essential functions may be required to obtain evaluation and/or testing by a health care provider designated by the School, and to provide the results to the Campus Student Health Service, the Dean of the New Jersey Medical School and/or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs of the New Jersey Medical School for the purpose of determining whether the student is fit to pursue the educational program. If the student is deemed fit to pursue the program, the School reserves the right to require actions recommended by the health care provider, including further testing, counseling, monitoring, leave of absence, etc. Note about Immunizations: Enrollment and continued enrollment of accepted students at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School is conditional, based on the results of certain laboratory tests and fulfillment of current immunization and health requirements (as determined by Rutgers and/or NJMS) in order to determine their ability to perform all essentials functions.

Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Code of Professional Conduct Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 I. PURPOSE To establish the NJMS companion policy to the RBHS policy entitled \"Student Rights, Responsibilities and Disciplinary Procedures,\" hereinafter referred to as \"the Policy.\" It was developed to comply with Section V. A. 2. of \"the Policy\" which calls for each school within the University to have such a code in place. II. ACCOUNTABILITY Under the Dean, the Committee on Academic Integrity (CAI) (hereinafter referred to as \"the Committee\" ) will be responsible for educating the students regarding ethical issues, monitoring the academic integrity policy and serving as the hearing body for all student disciplinary actions at NJMS. This committee will assess the nature and severity of the violation(s) and report its findings to the Dean. III. APPLICABILITY All Students who enroll at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School will be expected to abide by the Code throughout their course of study and will be informed that violations of the Code will be consi dered with the gravest concern and may be punishable with sanctions as severe as suspension or dismissal. IV. BACKGROUND RBHS Policy: Student Rights, Responsibilities and Disciplinary Procedures (refer to https://policies.rutgers.edu/) V. POLICY THE RUTGERS NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT The Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Code of Professional Conduct (hereinafter referred to as \"the Code\") sets forth general principles of integrity as well as expectations for behavior consi stent with the ethical study and practice of medicine as described in the American Medical Association (AMA) code of ethics and the American Board of Internal Medicine's Project Professionalism . The latter defines professionalism as aspiring to \"altruism, accountability, excellence, duty, service, honor, integrity and respect for others,\" and identifies several issues that can have a negative impact on these elements (\"Professionalism in Medicin e: Issues and Opportunities in the Educational Environment,\" Project Professionalism, p. 4- 10, American Board of Internal Medicine, 1995, Philadelphia, Pa). With permission from Tina Greco, adapted from the Student Handbook for the New Jersey Graduate Program in Public Health 1992- 1994 Introduction We, the students of Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, believe that the medical community holds a public trust. At the heart of our profession is the trust of the physician- patient relationship, which depends on individuals of the medical community living by standards worthy of that trust. Due to the sensitive and confidential nature of our work as physicians we must, as individuals, observe high standards of honesty and integrity. We must also make diligent ef forts to ensure that high standards are upheld by our colleagues and peers. This is necessary to safeguard the public trust and ensure the integrity of our profession for future generations. Furthermore, we believe that it is possible to attain these high standards in a professional school setting through both individual and group awareness and commitment. It is our hope that by adopting these principles into our personal and professional lives, we can promote a culture of professionalism and positively influence our present community here at New Jersey Medical School, and the many future communities we will serve as physicians. This standard of integrity must apply to everyone alike, regardless of rank or seniority. Upon entry into medical school, student s accept responsibility for honesty and integrity as part of a sacred tradition dating back to the Hippocratic Oath. The Code is a modern day affirmation of the Oath's values. The Code states that the individual is responsible for acting with honesty and integrity during all academic activities. The individual is also responsible for reporting incidents of academic dishonesty committed by or observed in other members of the community. Allegiance cannot be to individual advancement or personal considerations , but must be to the integrity of the medical profession and the good of the community. Violations of the Code will be handled as matters of the gravest concern, punishable where appropriate by suspension or expulsion from our academic community. Section I - Definitions Acknowledging the high professional and ethical standards that physicians are expected to exhibit, the students of the New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) have adopted the following as guidelines for professional conduct. Students are expected to exercise good judgment when questions of a professional or ethical nature arise. NJMS student responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following: to be aware of and to abide by all applicable federal, state and local civil and criminal laws and regulations; to be aware of and to abide by all applicable University, RBHS, and School policies, rules, procedures and standards, both general and academic; to be responsible for personal and professional integrity and honesty in all acade mic activities; to treat all members of the community (faculty, staff, students, patients) with respect and understanding and to resolve conflicts with other members of the NJMS community in a respectful and constructive manner. to hold themselve s to high standards of academic integrity. This includes the accurate and honest reporting of clinical and research data, as well as ensuring that the rules regarding all examinations and coursework are adhered to. to do their utmost to ensure a safe and f riendly environment for patients. This includes maintaining accurate notes, following up promptly on results of diagnostic studies and serving as a patient advocate. Additionally, students will maintain strict confidentiality regarding patient information. to adhere to all generally recognized standards of professional and ethical conduct and to help ensure that high standards of professional and ethical conduct are upheld by fellow students, colleagues and peers by reporting incidents of academic and profe ssional dishonesty observed in others. SECTION II - Violations It is expected that by this point in their education, medical students should already be aware of what constitutes a breach of academic integrity and inappropriate professional behavior. The following behaviors are examples of breaches in professional conduct. A. Cheating: the use of inappropriate or unacknowledged materials, information, or study aids for any written or clinical exam. Students must obey rules governing NJMS depart mental examinations and NBME examinations and their administration. The use of books, notes, tape recorders, electronic devices, calculators, or conversation with others is prohibited, unless specifically noted otherwise. Students may not request others (including commercial term paper companies) to conduct research or prepare any work for them without crediting the source for the work that was used. Students may not submit identical work or portions thereof for credit without approval of the instructor. B. Stealing: to take something without right or permission, usually in a surreptitious way, e.g., to take another student's personal belongings, or to take equipment from the hospital for personal use. C. Forging: falsely making or altering a document, e.g., to sign an attending physician's name on a prescription or a written report. D. Fabrication: the invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise. \"Invented\" or changed information may not be used in any laboratory experiment or other academic exercise without authorization from the instructor, e.g., it is improper to analyze one sample in an experiment and then \"invent\" data for other required analyses based on that one sample. Similarly, it is improper to report laboratory values or chest radio graphs as normal if the appropriate tests were never ordered or performed. E. Plagiarism: the representation of the works or ideas of another as one's own. To avoid plagiarism, every direct quotation must be identified by quotation marks or by appropriate indentation and must be cited in the text or by a footnote or endnote. (Student Note Service is exempt for the purpose of this Code, provided it adds an appropriate disclaimer prior to distribution.) Plagiarism can often be a subtle issue. Any ques tions as to what constitutes plagiarism should be discussed with a faculty member. F. Denying Others Access to Information or Material: to deliberately impede the progress of another student or scholar or deny them access to scholarly resources intended for general consumption, e.g., intentionally giving other students false or misleading information; making library material unavailable to others by stealing, defacing, or hiding books or journals, or by deliberately misplacing or destroying reser ve materials; or by intentionally altering computer files that belong to another. G. Unprofessional Conduct: Students must conduct themselves appropriately as befits a member of the medical community. Unprofessional conduct includes, but is not limited to, a pattern of: unmet professional responsibilities; a lack of effort towards self - improvement and adaptability; diminished relationships with faculty, staff, and peers; and diminished relationships with patients and families. H. Vandalism: The defacing of cam pus property or destruction of property of members of the community is considered unprofessional behavior and in violation of the Code. I. Unauthorized Use of Drugs and/or Alcohol are in violation of the Code. It is unprofessional to participate in patient care while impaired. J. Improper use of Information Technology resources/networking- Improper use includes using email to harass members of the Rutgers community, disrupting operation of networks through illegal acts, using unauthorized accounts, and inappropriately taking equipment/materials from computer laboratories. Section III - Committee on Academic Integrity The Committee on Academic Integrity (CAI) will be responsible for educating the students and faculty regarding ethical issues, monitoring the academic integrity policy and serving as the hearing body for all student disciplinary actions at NJMS. The committee shall meet at least once a semester on a schedule to be publicly announced, and as needed to deal with cases referred by the Dean. A. Composition: The committee will be composed of six medical students and five faculty members of whom at least two are administrators, one a clinical faculty member, and one a basic science faculty member, for a total of eleven members. The members will elect one student member and one faculty member to serve as co-chairs. B. Selection Process 1. Students: The Student Council Appointments Committee will select students who will serve until their graduation. Each appointed student must be in good academ ic standing at the time of appointment, and must maintain good academic standing in order to serve on the Committee. Alternates will be selected for each position in the event that a committee member becomes personally involved in a hearing, falls out of good academic standing, or chooses to withdraw from the Committee for personal or professional reasons. 2. Faculty: Faculty members of the committee will be chosen by the Dean. There will be no term limits for any of the faculty positions. Alternates will be selected for each position in the event that a committee member becomes personally involved in a hearing, is on a temporary leave of absence, or chooses to withdraw for personal or professional reasons. Section IV - Committee Procedures The primary proce dural guidelines for the Committee are described in the RBHS Policy on Student Rights, Responsibilities and Disciplinary Procedures. Students should refer to this Policy for the procedures to be followed. In case of discrepancy, the Policy is to be conside red the overriding document. An outline of the procedure is as follows: A. A request for disciplinary action against a student may be made in writing to the Dean by any student, faculty member, or administrative officer within thirty (30) working days of an alleged infraction or the discovery of an infraction. B. The Dean or his/her representative may attempt to resolve the matter informally through mediation by an administrative officer of the School or by some other means. If the Dean or his/her representa tive concludes that the matter cannot or should not be resolved in this manner, he/she shall refer it to the Hearing Body of the School (i.e., the Committee on Academic Integrity) within ten (10) working days of the Dean's decision. C. Following receipt of the request, the Committee will meet to review the case and schedule a hearing. If the Committee has questions concerning the Dean's request or the basis for the charges, it may seek clarification from the Dean prior to scheduling a hearing. D. The Committee shall forward to the Accused and to the Complainant written notice of the complaint and of the time, date and place of the hearing, which shall be held within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of a request from the Dean. This time may be extended at the request of the Accused if the Accused is unable to appear, but the accused must provide the Committee with a suitable date within a reasonable time frame. E. The Committee shall convene to hear the complaint and make recommendations for action t o the Dean. A complete description of hearings procedures can be found in the University Policy section V.F.4, and are summarized below. 1. Quorum: At least 7 members (2 of whom must be faculty members) must be in attendance. In order to vote, a mem ber must be present for the entire proceeding. Those members not present for the entire proceeding may offer their opinions during deliberations, but may not vote. Non- voting members do not count toward the above quorum requirements. The student co- chair w ill not vote, except in case of a tie. 2. Hearing Procedures: The hearing will be conducted according the guidelines set out in the Policy, as follows: a. Witnesses may be called by any participant. Relevant materials may be presented if advance copies are provided to each participant. The Committee may at any time request submission of documents or an appearance by anyone involved in the matter, and may conduct as many hearing sessions as necessary to complete its consideration of the Complaint, within the time period designated in this procedure. b. Students may consult private legal counsel at any time for advice. Students or legal counsel may submit to the Committee any documents or other evidence relevant to the matter at any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing. However, legal counsel shall not be permitted to appear at the proceedings of the Committee. c. The burden of proof shall rest with the Complainant. d. The Chair of the Committee shall rule on all procedural matters in accordance with this polic y, with the procedural rules of the School, and with generally accepted terms of fundamental fairness. Whenever necessary, the Chair may seek the advice of the Office of General Counsel in procedural matters. Committee procedures shall, at a minimum, insur e: i. that witnesses be heard in the presence of the Accused, but outside the presence of other witnesses; the Hearing Body may request the presence of the Complainant during the testimony of other witnesses, in whole or in part. ii. that tape recordings of the hearing, excluding all deliberations by the Committee, shall be made by the School; any participant may, at his/her own expense, obtain a copy of the recording or a transcript, or employ a court stenographer during the hearing. 3. Completion of the Hearing: The Committee will complete its hearing procedures within forty (40) working days of the commencement of the hearing, and submit to the Dean, with copies to the complainant and to the accused, within seven (7) working days thereafter, a written recommendation, including any findings of fact made by the Committee, and a reporting of the total vote tally of the Committee's decision, without reference to individual votes. 4. Recommendations: The recommendations of the C ommittee may consist of any or no disciplinary action as outlined in Section V of the Code and should be based on the factual findings, the severity of the violation, and any procedures, policies or codes of the School or of the University. 5. All notices an d correspondence to the Accused shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or hand -delivered with a receipt to be signed; receipts shall be retained by the School. 6. Exceptions: After the Committee makes its recommendation, but before a final decision by the Dean, all parties may submit requests for exception in writing. As per the policy these must be submitted within five (5) working days of the Committee's recommendations. 7. Decision: The Dean or his/her designee shall render, within a reasonable period of time, a final decision on disciplinary action to be taken and shall provide written copies of the decision to the Accused, the Complainant and the Committee. 8. Appeals: Within five (5) working days of receipt of the Dean's decision, the student may submit a written appeal to the RBHS Chancellor. The RBHS Chancellor may, at his or her discretion, seek information and consult with any other party, including the Accused, Complainant, Committee and the Dean, and shall render, within a reasonable period of time, a written decision and shall provide written copies of the decision to the Accused, the Complainant, the Committee and the Dean. The decision by the RBHS Chancellor is not subject to appeal. 9. Confidentiality: All proceedings of the Committee are considered confidential, and all parties involved, including the Complainant and Accused are expected to maintain confidentiality. Failure to do so will be considered a breach of professional behavior a nd is itself a violation of the Code. SECTION V - Recommended Sanctions Academic dishonesty is a serious offense and is therefore subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Violations will be reviewed by the Committee in accordance with the procedure stated in the Policy. This body will assess the nature and severity of the violation(s) and report its findings to the Dean, including any recommendations for action. Depending on the severity of the offense as determined by the hearing body, one of the suggested levels of disciplinary action cited below may be recommended to the Dean. A majority vote will be required to recommend such sanctions with the exception of Level V Disciplinary Actions, which will require a two- thirds vote of the Committee. The description of these sanctions is not all -inclusive. The Dean will make the final decision on any violation. The following list is a description of the levels of sanctions that the Committee may recommend to the Dean. Recommendations for sanctions will be made on an individual basis. No Action In the event that the student is found innocent of the allegations brought against him/her, the matter will be dropped with no further action taken. Furthermore, all information pertaining to the case will be destroyed and no record shall be kept of the incident or the proceedings. The hearing body (i.e., Committee on Academic Integrity) shall reserve the right to terminate the investigation or dismiss the proceedings at any time should they feel suc h action is warranted. In the event that the Committee finds a student guilty of an infraction for which no action is deemed necessary by the Committee, the Committee will recommend that finding to the Dean. Level One The student shall receive both a writ ten and an oral reprimand from the Dean or his/her representative concerning the offense. A record of the incident will be kept in the Committee's files until the student graduates. The Committee's files may not be used to prepare any official written or o ral communications about the student, including dean's letters. If the incident involves a course assignment or requirement, there may be a recommendation that either no credit be given for the assignment/requirement or a make -up assignment be given if appropriate. Level Two The student shall receive both a written and an oral reprimand from the Dean or his/her representative concerning the offense. A record of the incident will be kept in both the committee's files and the student's official file until th e student graduates. As above, a recommendation may be made that either no credit be given for an assignment/requirement or a make- up assignment be given if appropriate. A failing grade may also be recommended for the assignment or relevant portion of the involved course. Level Three The student shall receive both a written and an oral reprimand from the Dean or his/her representative concerning the offense. A record of the incident will be kept in both the committee's files and the student's official file until the student graduates. A notice will be placed in the s student' official file that s(he) is considered to be on \"Academic Disciplinary Probation\" until graduation. A recommendation will also be made that the student receive a failing grade for the assignment, examination or course involved if appropriate. Level Four The student shall receive both a written and an oral reprimand from the Dean or his/her representative concerning the offense. A record of the incident will be kept in both the committee's files and the student's of ficial file until the student graduates. The student will be suspended for a minimum of one semester from the medical school. A notice of \"Academic Disciplinary Suspension\" will be placed in the student's official file and remain for the designated period. A permanent indication of the violation will be included in the student's file. If the recommended sanction involves failure of a course or suspension, an explanatory note will be included on the student's transcript. Readmission is automatic. The faculty determines the level at which academic level the student will re -enter. Level Five Violations at this level represent the most serious breaches of academic integrity and will result in the expulsion of the student from the School, defined as a severing of affiliation between the student and the New Jersey Medical School. A permanent indication of both the violation and the expulsion will be placed in the student's official file as well as the committee's files. Section VI - Status of the NJMS C ode of Professional Conduct Amendments to the NJMS Code may be proposed by the Committee on Academic Integrity on its own motion at any time. All proposed amendments will be circulated to the Student Council for review/comments before being voted upon by the Committee. A proposed amendment must be approved by majority vote of the committee members, and then forwarded to the Committee on Student Affairs and Faculty Council for review and approval. To insure that all NJMS students are knowledgeable about the contents and provisions of the Code, it will be published in the NJMS Student Handbook and presented during orientation for first -year students. By Direction of the Dean: Associate Dean for Student Affairs Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Guide to Professional Conduct Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 Students are expected to demonstrate professionalism as pa rt of the requisite competencies for all courses in New Jersey Medical School. Since all of the attributes of professionalism cannot be tested on a written examination or an OSCE, patterns of behavior (as observed throughout the continuum of training and within the educational environment by faculty, staff, patients and residents) play an important role in making these determinations. The American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) defines professionalism in medicine as requiring the physician to serve the interests of the patient above his or her self -interest. Professionalism aspires to s ervice, honor, altruism, respect for others, excellence, accountability, integrity and duty (SHARE AID). New Jersey Medical School celebrates these attributes in its students and expects the following behaviors at all times from students: 1. Characteristics and Responsibilities Attend required classes, laboratories, seminars, conferences, and clerkships unless you have an excused absence. Report all absences immediately to your course director and supervising physician. Complete all assignments accurately, thoroughly, legibly, and in a timely manner. Check email and regularly for course and school assignments and other school related obligations. Fulfill responsibilities to patients and healthcare professionals promptly. Be open, positive, truthful, and non-judgmental. Do not be arrogant, abusive , or condescending. Do not abuse alcohol or drugs. Dress in a neat, clean, professionally appropriate manner. Do not harass others physically, verbally, psychologically, or sexually. Do not discriminate on the basis of age, sex, race, religion, disability, or sexual orientation. Use communal resources (equipment, supplies, and funds) responsibly and equitably. Adhere to regulations and policies such as those governing fire safety, hazardous waste disposal, and universal precautions. Avoid providing professional care to members of your family or intimate friends. Do not misrepresent or falsify actions and/or information (e.g. patient, laboratory tests, research data). Report any violations of the NJMS Honor Code to course director or Dean of Student Affairs. 2. Self-Improvement and Adaptability Acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses in the area of professional conduct. Identify ways to correct your weaknesses. Seek advice from faculty, peers, or others if you need help to make changes. Accept responsibility for errors. You are not expected to be perfect. Just acknowledge the error and take any necessary steps to correct the situation. Do not react with abuse, anger, or defensiveness when receiving criticism. Do not respond to criticism by blaming yourself or by blaming others Do respond to criticism with self -esteem: \"Here's a chance to learn something. I'll ask for additional feedback, define the problem, and propose a solution.\" Learn from experience so you won't make the same mistake repeatedly \u2014and so you will more quickly achieve professional competence. Explore your own feelings about topics such as cultural diversity, sexuality, spirituality, and death and dying so you can better deal with such topics. Maintain professional composure despite fatigue and stress. Do not be overly critical or verbally abusive during times of stress. Notify the responsible supervisor if anything interferes with your ability to perform clinical tasks effectively. Develop a support system, good dietary habits, recreation, disease prevention, exercise, and outside interests to optimize your physical and emotional health. 3. Relationships with Patients Establish rapport with patients and their families --and be sensitive to their feelings, needs, and wishes. Be considerate of each patient's privacy and modesty, and respect each one's cultural, psychological, and spiritual values. Treat patients with kindness, gentleness, empathy, and compassion. Do not have romantic or sexual relationships with patients or their family members. Be familiar with University Hospital's \"Patient's Bill of Rights.\" Clearly identify yourself and your level of training to patients and staff. (i.e., \"I am a first-year medical student from New Jersey Medical School.\") Never be verbally or non -verbally rude, arrogant, or patronizing. Allow time for patients to give information, express opinions, and ask questions. Take time to answer questions from patients and their family members. Speak clearly and directly to the patient --and use words the patient can understand. Work with an interpreter whenever necessary. Resolve misunderstandings quickly. Obtain permission before doing anything that might be unpleasant or painful to the patient and warn the patient if a procedure will cause discomfort or pain. Share patient information only with members of the health care team that are involved in the patient's care\u2014 and do so only where you will not be overheard (i.e. not in an elevator). Do not engage in unsupervised patient care in areas or situations where you are not adequately trained. 4. Relationships with Healthcare Team Members Function appropriately and cooperatively within the healthcare team. Exhibit verbal and non- verbal behavior that is not rude, arrogant, or patronizing. Be punctual, and apologize when late or give reason for being so. Speak clearly and directly to team members. Give specific, constructive, non- judgmental feedback to others. Identi fy and attempt to resolve misunderstandings. Accept and discuss emotional issues when appropriate. Complete assigned tasks or negotiate alternatives if unable to do so. Give prior notice of intended absence. Report research results honestly in scientific and scholarly presentations and publications. Give proper credit and responsibility to colleagues and others who participated in research when publishing and presenting reports. Identify team members who may need help due to stress or substance abuse. Adapted from \"A Strategy for the Detection and Evaluation of Unprofessional Behavior in Medical Students\", Academic Medicine, Vol. 74, No. 9, September 1999, with the introduction adapted from the American Board of Internal Medicine Project Profess ionalism materials. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Standards of Professionalism Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 10/05/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 10/06/2020 Appropriate professional behavior is a fundamental component of preclerkship and clinical competency. In addition to clinical performance and medical knowledge, interpersonal skills need to meet New Jersey Medical School standards. Interpersonal skills are described here as including (1) professional attributes and responsibilities; (2) self -improvement and adaptability; (3) effective relationships with patients; and (4) effective relationships with other members of the faculty, student body and members of the health care team. Each student should be familiar with the NJMS Guide to Professional Conduct and the NJMS Code of Conduct, the companion documents to this policy. We must set a standard for the attainment of professionalism that is as high as those f or the attainment of the cognitive skills. While cognitive competencies are judged in blocks of time (courses and clerkships), professionalism must be assessed and tracked over the continuum of the student's medical education and career. Accountability for the professional development of students and the evaluation of their professionalism is the responsibility of all pre -clerkship and clerkship evaluators despite the relatively short course/clerkships, changing sites and the perception that this is a subje ctive area. To address lapses in professionalism, New Jersey Medical School employs a multi -tiered, developmental approach. A student whose behavior does not meet a standard, as defined above, is reported on either the Pre -Clerkship and Clerkship Years or Institutional Professionalism Form. Subsequent action is taken in a manner appropriate to both the severity of the infraction and the student's position along the continuum of the curriculum. Each step of the process allows the student to appeal any decis ions and actions taken. The language on the forms was chosen to define the minimum standard of behavior the student has not met. The intent of each form is to identify a student with behavior(s) that does not meet a standard so that a plan of professional development may be instituted promptly. If you have an experience with a student that does not meet the standards stated above, the following steps must be taken: 1. The Course Director/Clerkship Director/Faculty/Administrator must discuss the situation with the student and inform them that they are going to present the incident(s) to the Pre - Clerkship or Clerkship Professionalism Subcommittee. 2. The incident should be presented to a subcommittee of the Pre -Clerkship Curriculum Committee or Clerkship Curriculum Committee depending on the student's phase in the curriculum. The subcommittee will be made up of all faculty members of these committees. a. The student will meet with the Chair of the relevant subcommittee to be informed of the subcommittee process and their rights. b. The subcommittee will meet within 10 days of the experience that led to the concern. i. The Course Director/Clerkship Director/Faculty/Administrator bringing the incident(s) to the relevant committee will describe the situation. ii. The student will be asked to address the committee to explain their perspective on what happened and any factors that the committee needs to consider. c. The relevant committee will decide if it is appropriate to complete a Professionalism Form. If appropriate, the form is completed by the Course Director/Clerkship Director/Faculty/Administrator fifteen (15) business days from the clerkship or course end date or the date of incident, whichever is later. 3. The student must sign to acknowledge receipt a nd review of the form. 4. The form is submitted to the Office of Student Affairs and is placed in the student's file. For students in the pre -clerkship years: a. If one or two professional forms are submitted for a student in the first two curricular years, the student is required to be counseled by the ADSA, who will arrange a plan for professional development. The form and the plan for professional development will not be referenced in the MSPE (Medical Student Performance Evaluation). The ADSA will report on these students to the CSA (Committee on Student Affairs) on a bi -monthly basis. b. If a student receives more than two forms in the first two curricular years then the student will be required to appear before the CSA. After meeting with the student, the CSA will decide whether or not the content of the forms, the professional development plan(s), and the meeting with the CSA will be referenced in the MSPE under the adverse action question in the academic history section. c. If a student receives more than two forms in the first two years and a subsequent form in the third or fourth year then the student is required to appear before the CSA and the forms, the professional improvement plan(s), and the meeting with the CSA shall be mentioned in the MSPE under the adverse action question in the academic history section. For students in the clerkship years: a. If student receives one form in the third or fourth year and has had no prior forms submitted on their behalf, the student is required to be counseled by the ADSA, who will arrange a plan for professional development. The form and the plan for professional development will not be referenced in the MSPE (Medical Student Performance Evaluation). b. If the student receives two or more forms in the th ird/fourth years then the student is required to appear before the CSA and the forms, the professional development plan(s), and the meeting with the CSA will be mentioned in the MSPE under the adverse action question in the academic history section. For s tudents who will have professionalism forms mentioned in the MSPE: The student may appeal having the professionalism forms in their MSPE by writing the Dean within 10 business days of the CSA meeting. The Dean will review the professionalism form s, the committee's decision, the student's written appeal, and will decide whether the CSA action will stand and the forms will be mentioned in the MSPE. For students not receiving a form: If the Pre -Clerkship or Clerkship Professionalism Subcommittee decides not to complete a form, but believes the student would benefit from counseling by the ADSA, they will refer the student without this being a part of the student's record.

PURPOSE Rutgers New Jersey Medical School has a responsibility to foster professional development with the goal of provid ing humanistic and compassionate health care by all members of the New Jersey Medical School community, including medical students, graduate students, resident physicians, facul ty, volunteers and other staff who participate in the educational process. We believe that teaching and learning should take place in a climate of mutual respect where students are evaluated based upon accomplishment , professionalism and academic performance . We are committed to maintaining a positive learning environment and the highest standards of behavior in the teacher -student relationship . The diversity of members of the academic community , combined with the intensity of inter actions that occur in the health care setting , may lead to incidents perceived as or actually of mistreatment or unprofessional behavior . New Jersey Medical School maintains its commitment to preventing student abuse and the highest standards of profession alism through education, by providing support for those who are subjected to mistreatment , and by responding with corrective action to incidences of abuse and unprofessionalism . This policy addresses the behaviors required from all those who are in training sites, including faculty members, residents, nurses, staff, or students in a teaching role. It is intended to ensure an educational environment in which students, staff, volu nteers, and faculty may raise and resolve issues without fear of intimidation or retaliation. The Dean of New Jersey Medical School oversees the implementation of this policy. This policy on mistreatment prevention and response and the learning environme nt has four main components: 1. A statement of New Jersey Medical School's standards of behavior with regard to mistreatment, including: a definition of mistreatment; examples of types of mistreatment; persons who may be the object or perpetrator of mistrea tment; and the purpose of the policy on mistreatment. 2. A plan for the ongoing education of the New Jersey Medical School community concerning these standards of behavior and professionalism and the process by which they are upheld. 3. A description of the New Jersey M edical School process for responding to allegations of mistreatment. 2 4. A description of options that are available to all members of the New Jersey Medical School for reporting incidences of unprofessional behavior exhibited by anyone in the learnin g environment. II. STANDARDS The following statement is excerpted from a report by the AMA Section on Medical Schools in cooperation with the AMA Student and Resident Sections and reflects the policy of the New Jersey Medical School: The teacher -learner relationship should be based on mutual trus t, respect and responsibility. This relationship should be carried out in a professional manner in a learning environment that places strong focus on education, high quality patient care, and e thical conduct. In the teacher -learner relationship, each party has certain legitim ate expectations of the other. For example, the learner can expect that the teacher will provide instruction, guidance, inspiration and leadership in learning. The teacher expects the learner to make an appropriate professional investment of energy and intellect to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to become an effective physician. Both parties can expect the other to prepare appropriately for the educational inte raction and to discharge their responsibilities in the educational relationship with unfailing honesty. Certain behaviors are inherently destructive to the teacher -learner relationship. Behaviors such as violence, sexual abuse or harassment, inappropriate conduct or discrimination based on personal characteristics must never be tolerated. In addition, negative, disrespectful, or demeaning comments about or references to patients, families, or other members of the health care team are inappropriate. Other behavior can also be inappropriate if the effect interferes with professional development. Behavior patterns such as making habitual demeaning or derogatory remarks, belittling comments or destructive criticism fall into this cate gory. On the behavioral level, abuse may be operationally defined as behavior by medical school faculty, residents, or students which is disapproved by society and by the academic community as either exploitive or punishing. The NJMS Teacher -Learner Relationship and The Learning Environment in Medical Education Policy addresses the behaviors required from all those who are in training sites, including faculty members, residents, nurses, staff, or students in a teaching role. It is intended to ensure a psychologically safe educational environment in which students, staf f, volunteers, and faculty may raise and resolve issues without fear of intimidation or retaliation As per the NJMS Academic Equity in the Medical School Learning Environment Policy , students who believe that assessment of their performance may have been negatively affected by bias should report this to either course or clerkship/site director, Associate/Assistant Deans for Education, the Associate Dean for Students Affairs or Executive Vice Dean or through the Learning Environment and Professionalism reporting system. AAMC Definition of Mistreatment: \"Mistreatment either intentional or unintentional occurs 3 when behavior s hows disrespect for the di gnity of others and unreasonably interferes with the learning process.\" Examples of inappropriate behavior or situations that would be unacceptable include: Physical contact, including any physical mistreatment or assaults such as hitting, slapping, kicking, throwing objects or threats of the same nature Verbal abuse (attack in words, or speaking insultingly, harshly) Comments and jokes of stereotypic or et hnic connotatio n, visual harassment (display of derogatory cartoons, drawings or posters) Inappropriate or unprofessional conduct that is unwarranted and reasonably interpreted to be demeaning or offensive Requiring a student to perform tasks intended to humiliate, control, or intimidate the student Unreasonable requests for a student to perform personal services Grading or assigning tasks used to punish a student rather than to evaluate or improve performance Purposeful neglect or exclusion from learning opportunities as means of punishment Sexual assault or other acts of sexual violence Sexua l harassment Disregard for student safety Microaggressions are the daily, commonplace interactions (verbal, nonverbal, behavioral, environmental), whether intentional or unintentional , that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults towards members of marginalized groups. While constructive criticism is appropriate in certain circumstances in the teacher -learning process, it sh ould be handled in such a way as to promote learning, avoiding purposeful student humiliation. Feedback that has negative elements is generally more useful when delivered in a private setting that fosters discussion and behavior modification. All feedback should focus on behavior rather than personal characteristics and should avoid pejorative labeling. III. EDUCATION AND PREVENTION A. To promote a n environment respectful of all individuals, the New Jersey Medical School will provide ongoing education to students, residents, fellows, faculty, and other staff that emphasizes the importance of professional and collegial attitudes and behavior. The materials and methods for providing this education will be the respons ibility of the Executive Vice Dean, the As sociate Dean for Student Affairs and the New Jersey Medical School Office of Education . B. Education of the New Jersey Medical School community concerning mistreatment and professional behavior serves to promote a positive learning environment. This is characterized by attitudes of mutual respect and collegiality. Education will alert all members of the New Jersey Medical School community to expected standards of behavior. Education will also inform persons who believe they have been mistreated of the ave nues for redress and will inform all concerned parties of the policies and processes for responding to allegations of mistreatment and unprofessional behavior . 4 C. The methods for disseminating and providing information and education to the specific group s are described below , subject to annual review by the Executive Vice Dean : 1. Medical Students a. The policy will be included in the Student Handbook . b. The topic will be addressed at all orientations . c. Each department will be required to include this topic in the course polic ies for each preclinical course and each clinical rotation . 2. Resident Physicians and Fellows a. The policy will be included in the Resident Handbook . b. The topic will be addressed at the annual resident physi cian orientation . c. The clinical department chairs will be encouraged to ensure all their fellows and residents are cognizant of the policy. 3. Faculty and Graduate Students a. An informative written message will be sent each year from the Dean's Office to all departmental chairs. b. The D ean will direct the chairs to distribute the information to all faculty and graduate students within their respective departments and a member of the Dean's Office will present the poli cy at departmental meetings on an annual basis . c. Chairs will also direct the course directors, clerkship directors, and program directors to convey this information to all adjunct faculty who participate in the teaching process in order to ensure that a ll faculty are cognizant of the policy. 4. Nursing and Other Clinical/Support Staff An informative written message will be sent each year from the Dean's Office to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer at University Hospital to explain the policy and to request its distribution t o all staff interacting with New Jersey Medical School trainees. 5. Faculty and Staff at All Affiliate Sites Affiliation agreements with all training sites will reference the policy and delineate expe ctations regarding distribution of the information contained in the policy to faculty and staff at the site. An informative written message will be sent each year from the Dean's Office to the Associate Dean or designated educational site director and Chief Medical Officer at each training site to explain the policy and to request its distribution to all staff interacting with New Jersey Medical School trainees. D. The Learning Environment and Professionalism Subcommittee of the Curriculum, Academic Prog rams and Policies Committee (CAP2) will monitor influences (positive and negative) throughout the learning environment . The Subcommittee will develop and conduct appropriate strategies to enhance positive and mitigate negative influences , as well as identify and promptly correct violations of professional standards . The Subcommittee will meet quarterly and report to (CAP2) . They will review the results of student evaluations of courses and clerkships as it relates to the learning environment and may choose to survey students and other groups to ascertain further information regarding positive and negative influences in this arena. They also will review the AAMC GQ results relating to the learning environment. At these quarterly meetings the Associat e Dean for Student Affairs and the Executive Vice Dean will report on incidents that have been brought to them regarding concerns about the learning environment and 5 unprofessional behavior with personal identifiers redacted. Based on these sources of information the Learning Environment and Professionalism Subcommittee will make recommendations regarding the need for interventions (e.g., faculty and staff education and development ) to address issues that are leading to a sub -optimal learning environment and these will be presented to CAP2 for consideration. The decision and final recommendations of this committee will be presented to the Faculty Council and Dean for consideration. Feedback on the success of implemented changes and programs is monitored by CAP2 , the Faculty Council and Dean. IV. COMMUNICATION OF COMPLAINTS AND RESOLUTION MECHANISMS Due to the sensitive natu re of such complaints and the need to occasionally deal with these issues either without the consent of the reporter or without revealing the identity of the reporter, a number of mechanisms need to be in place for resolution and communication of the resolution of the issue. The faculty and administration must be able to assure learners that they will be \"protected\" when making truthful reports of abuse or unprofessional behavior by others , even when their identity must be disclosed. Such reporting is a professional obligation on the students' part as members of our educational community. Members of our educational community including faculty and staff who witness others being abusive to learners or exhibiting unprofessional behavior are also expected to report these incidents. This will help to create a better learning environment for all. A complaint should be reported as soon as possible but not more than 90 (ninety) days after the alleged incident. Several avenues (listed below) are open to the student who experiences an incident of inappropriate behavior and mistreatment or is the witness to unprofessional behavior . The same pathways may be used by faculty and staff who witness abusive and/or unprofessional behavior. In situations where the observed behavior does not involve a learner , the faculty and staff members also have the option of addressing the issue with a supervisor of the person exhibiting the behavior. A. Informal Pathway 1. Addressing the Issue Directly The student may consider speaking directly with the person. If the behavior stems from a misunders tanding or a need for increased sensitivity, the person will often respond positively and stop. Open communication may clarify any misunderstanding or issue(s) and lead to a successful, informal resolution. 2. Counseling and Guidance A student, who has concerns about the learning environment, may speak with the Course or Clerkship Director, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs, a Faculty Mentor, the New Jer sey Medical School Ombudsperson , or a peer advisor. All involved parties must agree upon all inf ormal resolutions. For tracking purposes, a written record of the resolution must be filed with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs; however, this can be done without reference to specific names. 3. Consultation with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs 6 If Steps 1 or 2 are not successful or appropriate, a student must refer the complaint to the Associate De an for Student Affairs, who may make one last attempt at informal resolution. B. Formal Re solutions via University Policy Once an alleged mistreatment has been identified there are multiple tiers of formal resolution. Resolution of reported actions which are not egregious or reported in an anonymous fashion will be up to the discretion of the course or clerkship director and other members of NJMS administr ation. For tracking purposes, a written record of the resolution must be filed with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Any actions identified in the University Policies on sexual assault, sexual harassment , bullying and other types of harassment , or other violations of ethics or codes of conducts, must be reported and h andled in accordance with policies that address these violations . Resolution of reported actions which are recurrent or egregious will be reviewed by the Vice Dean who will follow the procedures below: Initial Inquiry 1. Inquiry into a violation of these standards of conduct committed by any individual will be initiated after a written complaint is filed with the Executive Vice Dean . The complaint should be filed within 90 (ninety) days of the violation. 2. The complaint must be detailed and specific, and accompanied by appropriate documentation. The Executive Vice Dean has the responsibility to protect the position and reputation of t he complainant. 3. Upon receipt of a properly documented complaint, which has been made in good faith, the Executive Vice Dean shall inform the respondent of the nature of the charges and identify the complainant. The Executive Vice Dean shall also appoint an inquiry officer, who may not be a member of the same department as, or collaborator with, the complainant or respondent. The inquiry officer shall have no conflicts of interest or appearance of conflict of interest in the matter and have appropriate bac kground to judge the issues being raised. They must be a faculty member of the New Jersey Medical School. An inquiry officer will be appointed within two weeks of the receipt of a properly documented complaint and the complainant and respondent will be notified. The Executive Vice Dean shall also make every effort to protect the identities of both complainant and respondent with respect to the l arger community. 4. The inquiry officer shall gather information and determine whether the allegation warrants a formal investigation. They shall then submit a written report to the Executive Vice Dean, the complainant, and the respondent. The report shall st ate what evidence was reviewed, summarize relevant interviews, and include conclusions. This report shall ordinarily be submitted within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written complaint by the Executive Vice Dean. If the inquiry officer finds that a fo rmal investigation is not warranted, the complainant shall be given the opportunity to make a written reply to the officer within 15 calendar days following receipt of the rep ort to the Executive Vice Dean. I f the inquiry officer finds that a formal invest igation is warranted, the respondent shall be given the opportunity to make a written reply to the report within 15 calendar days following submission of the report to the Executive Vice Dean. Such replies shall be incorporated as appendices to the report. The entire preliminary inquiry process shall be 7 completed within 60 calendar days of the receipt of a properly documented complaint by the Executive Vice Dean unless circumstances clearly reveal that in the interests of the parties involved the process be expedited or warrant a delay. In such cases the record of inquiry shall detail reasons for the delay. 5. If the report of the inquiry officer finds that a formal investigation is not warranted, the Executive Vice Dean may (i) initiate a formal investigation despite the recommendation of the preliminary inquiry officer , or (ii) not initiate a formal investigation, but take such other action as the circumstances warrant, or (iii) drop the matter. The Executive Vice Dean ordinarily shall complete the review wit hin 10 days of receipt of the report. The Executive Vice Dean shall inform the concerned parties of the decision. In the event the Vice Dean determines not to initiate a formal investigation, the Executive Vice Dean shall, as appropriate, protect the position and reputation of the complainant if the complaint is found to have been made in good faith. 6. If no formal investigation of the respondent is conducted, sufficient documentation shall be kept on file to permit a later assessment of the reasons tha t a formal investigation was not deemed warranted. 7. If the report of the inquiry officer finds that a formal investigation is warranted or the Executive Vice Dean decides the matter should be pursued through a formal investigation , the Executive Vice Dean s hall: notify the complainant and respondent; initiate a formal investigation as provided below: Formal Investigation and Resolutions via University Policy (refer to policies.rutgers.edu and http://uhr.rutgers.edu/policies -resources/policies -procedures for additional inform ation) At the present time there exist formal University Policies on Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment , Equal Employment Opportunity and Code of Ethics . There is also an established process for r eporting compliance and ethics concerns which outline responsibilities of the student or employee, and the roles of the Office of Human Resources of the respondent, and of the supervisor of the respondent. Any formal investigation and resolut ion process must comply with the guidance offered in these policies. Appropriate investigatory procedures will be utilized in situations where a formal in vestigation is deemed necessary. A ll resolutions , including but not limited to the imposition of dis cipline, shall be approved by the Dean or his designee and will comply with the procedures set forth in University policies and/or applicable collective bargaining agreements. Student complaints against fellow students are governed by the Student Rights, Responsibilities and Disciplinary Procedures P olicy. Affiliate Sites For faculty and staff at affiliate sites the Executive Vice Dean will inform the Associate Dean or designated educational site director at the affiliated site responsible for overseeing the training of New Jersey Medical School students of any complaint that is brought and findings of the initial inquiry. F ormal investigations and resolutions of these matters involving faculty and staff at affiliate sites will be determined by the approp riate administrators at those sites in keeping with their institutional policies . 8 Procedures 1. If the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the Executive Vice Dean is the respondent or in any other way has a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest, they is obligated to remove them self from the case during any inquiry, investigation , or resolution , and the De an shall appoint someone else to assume responsibility for monitoring and carrying out these procedures. 2. Complete records of all relevant documentation on cases treated under the provisions of this policy shall be preserved in the Office of the Executive Vice Dean for at least ten years. 3. Retaliation against any member of the school community who comes forw ard with a complaint or concern is prohibited. If an individual believes that they are being subjected to retaliation as a result of coming forward with a concern or a complaint, they should refer the matter to the Executive Vice Dean and/or the Ethics and Compliance Helpline . False Complaints and Refusal to Cooperate: The intentional filing of a false complaint is a violation of this and other University policies and may subject such person to discipline up to and including termination or, in the case of a student, dismissal from the School. Refusal to cooperate with/or participate in an investigation is a violation of this policy and may subject such per son to discipline, except for refusal to participate by victims of sexual violence . Anyone who believes that they have been the subject of a false complaint may file a complaint with the Executive Vice Dean and/or the Ethics and Compliance Helpline. If evidence of an intentional false complaint has been found, appropriate disciplinary action will be under taken. This provision is not intended to discourage complaints in those instances where an individ ual believes in good faith that discrimination, harassment and/or inappropriate conduct in the learning environment has occurred. V. PLANS FOR MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT As indicated above, the Learning Environment and Professionalism Subcommittee will monitor positive and negative influences on the learning environment and make recommendations regarding corrective interventions. These recommendations are considered by CAP2 and voted on and then are presented to the Faculty Council and Dean for con sideration. A separate quarterly report will also be provided by the Executive Vice Dean to the Faculty Council and Dean regardin g incidents of mis treatment or problems in the learning environment that are reported via the formal channels delineated above.

DEFINITIONS: A. Matriculant - A student is considered a matriculant of New Jersey Medical School upon his/her formal admittance to the Doctor of Medicine degree program and attendance on the first day of classes. A student is considered a matriculant until graduation, withdrawal, or dismissal. B. Enrollment Status - A student in the Doctor of Medicine degree program is considered actively enrolled while pursuing coursework, clerkships, or while enrolled in a special independent study, or scholars program. Students actively enrolled in the Doctor of Medicine degree program are considered full -time enrollees. With the exception of scholars programs, all periods of enrollment are calculated when assessing satisfactory academic progress. C. Good Standing - Most students are admitted to medi cal school in academic good standing, which indicates that their academic performance is satisfactory at the time of admission. Students will continue in this status provided the student performs in a satisfactory or better fashion in all academic work. Academic work includes all courses, clerkships, acting internships, required USMLE Step 1 and 2 examinations, the NJMS Graduation OSCE, and electives. D. Advancement - Advancement is defined as a student's ability to advance from course to course, or clerkship to clerkship, within a given academic year. A student's eligibility to advance, or progress, through each year's curriculum is governed by the NJMS Advancement and Promotions policy. E. Promotion - Each student's achievement of the educational goals and objectives of the School is evaluated in summative manner at the conclusion of each academic year. A student who has satisfied the requirements for given curricular year is eligible for promotion to the next year of study in the curriculum. A student's promotion from one year to the next is governed by the NJMS Advancement and Promotions policy. F. Leave of Absence (also refer to NJMS Procedure to Request a Leave of Absence) -Students may request a leave of absence from their studies per the NJMS Procedure to Request a Leave of Absence Policy. While on a leave, a student is considered separated from the school; leave of absence (LOA) is a period of non- enrollment. Students on a leave of absence are not considered to be enrolled nor actively working toward the M.D. degree. The maximum duration of a leave per request is one calendar year. A student may not exceed a cumulative total of twenty -four months leave during his/her matriculation in the Doctor of Medicine degree program. G. Academic Difficulty - Academic difficulty is defined as having an unremediated conditional pass grade, course/clerkship failure, or being in clear danger of conditionally passing or failing a course/clerkship. H. Special Independent Study Program - A program of study during which time a student is required to remediate or complete academic work and/or exams that serve to complete specific degree requirements. Time spent in a special independent study program will be applied toward the six year maximum time frame permitted for completion of the Doctor of Medicine degree requirements. I. Academic Probation - Students who demonstrate a pattern of unsatisfactory or marginal academic and/or professional performance may be placed on academic probation. Conditions of academic probation will be communicated to the student in writing. The purpose of probation is to give a student specific notice of academic or professional performance deficiencies and an opportunity to correct those deficiencies. The length of the probationary period may vary but it must be specified at the outset and be of sufficient duration to give the student a meaningful opportunity to remedy the identified performance problem(s). Most often the student will be placed on a special independent study program while on academic probation. Depending on the student's performanc e during probation, the possible outcomes of the probationary period are: removal from probation with a return to good academic standing; continued probation with new or remaining deficiencies cited; non- promotion to the next year with further probationary training required; or dismissal. A student will remain on probation until the probation status is removed, regardless of the student's enrollment status. J. Academic Suspension - A student may be suspended due to a failure to meet academic standards or a violation of the school or university policies. During a period of suspension, a student is barred from enrollment for a specified period of time. There may be requirements placed upon the student for activities that must be undertaken and fulfilled during the period of suspension in order for the student to be eligible for reinstatement or readmission. K. Withdrawal - Withdrawal is a voluntary, permanent resignation from NJMS by a matriculated student. Students considering withdrawal should discuss the matter with their advisor(s) and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. The withdrawal mechanism is not intended to serve as an outlet to avoid dismissal due to academic failure or disciplinary reasons. A student wishing to withdraw must submit a written request to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs who may approve or refer such requests to the Committee on Student Affairs for its action. The status of withdrawn is not considered an active academic status, but a terminal one. L. Dismissal - Reasons for dismissal from NJMS include, but are not limited to: 1. Failure of the same course or course equivalent twice, whether taken intramurally or extramurally. 2. Failure to uphold professional standards as described in the NJMS Code of Conduct or other generally accepted standards of the medical profession and/or Rutgers. 3. Failure to satisfy conditions imposed by the Committee on Student Affairs as a requirement for continued enrollment. 4. Failure to complete all pre-clerkship and clerkship requirements within six academic years, 5. Failure to pass USMLE, Step 1 and Step 2 CK within the specified timeframe(s). 6. Failure to satisfy NJMS Advancement and Promotion Policy and USMLE Step policy guidelines. 7. Failure to abide by any and all NJMS, RBHS, and Rutgers institutional policies. The status of dismissed is considered an involuntary separation and not considered an active academic status, but a terminal one. VI. ADVANCEMENT AND PROMOTION POLICY A. The Committee on Student Affairs shall routinely review the academic progress of all matriculated students and take appropriate actions when warranted. In addition to regularly scheduled advancement and promotions meetings, the Committee on Student Affairs shall review the progress of any student when his/her academic perfo rmance warrants action per this policy. B. Appeals 1. Students have the right to appeal this policy to the Committee when compelling mitigating circumstances can be documented. Such appeals must be made in writing at least four (4) days prior to the Committee meeting. Additionally, the student must meet with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or his/her designee at least one week prior to the date of the Committee meeting. A student who submits an appeal to the Committee must be available to meet with Committee membership on the date of the meeting. Decisions of the Committee will be conveyed to the student verbally and in writing. 2. Students have the right to appeal all decisions rendered by the Committee on Student Affairs to the Dean of NJMS within ten (10) business days of the Committee's action. The appeal to the Dean must be presented in writing, and must include exceptions to the Committee's findings. The Dean shall render, within a reasonable period of time, a final decision on the matter and provide written copies of the decision to the student, the Offices of Student Affairs and Registrar and the Committee on Student Affairs. C. Doctor of Medicine Program Requirements for Degree 1. All students, including those in approved dual degree or extended programs, are expected to enroll every semester after the first term of their degree program and must complete all requirements for graduation in six years or less, excluding leave(s) of absence, approved dual degree or scholars programs. Students are subject to the degree requirements and academic rules and regulations of their graduating class. 2. The faculty and administration of NJMS are dedicated to helping all students successfully complete each academic year. Towards this end, students who experience difficulty early in a given semester will be required to meet with a team consisting of Student Affairs and Center for Academic Success and Enrichment staff members who will apprise them of the available support services. Students will be required to meet with a content specialist and learning specialist (CASE team member) to design and implement an academic learning plan contract to include deliverables provided to the team members . Student must continue meeting with CASE team members until achieving a score clearly outside the margin of failure as determined by CASE team members. 3. All courses and clerkships must be completed in accordance with the advancement and promotion rules for each year. In addition to the successful completion of coursework/clerkships in years 1 through 4, each student must successfully pass USMLE Step 1, and Step 2 CK . Questions about degree requirements should be referred to the Office of the Registrar. 4. S ervices available to students in academic difficulty include tutoring and counseling; review classes and individual sessions with faculty members may be arranged at the mutual agreement of students and faculty members . Students should be familiar with the NJMS Policy: Good Standing and Participation in Academic and Extracurricular Activities. 5. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine must exhibit the requisite knowledge and skills to complete the prescribed course of study. In addition, they must a lso possess personal qualifications and attributes deemed necessary to perform the duties of the medical profession. Specifically, all candidates are expected to exhibit unimpaired judgment and behavior consistent with the responsibilities of the medical profession. Accordingly, the school reserves the right to dismiss a student for either academic or non- academic reasons and will therefore consider such factors as professionalism, honesty, ethical conduct, and responsibility to duty in the evaluation of its students. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with all pertinent NJMS, RBHS, and University policies. D. Year 1, Phase 1 Advancement and Promotions Policy 1.

DEFINITIONS: A. Matriculant - A student is considered a matriculant of New Jersey Medical School upon his/her formal admittance to the Doctor of Medicine degree program and attendance on the first day of classes. A student is considered a matricula nt until graduation, withdrawal, or dismissal. B. Enrollment Status - A student in the Doctor of Medicine degree program is considered actively enrolled while pursuing coursework, clerkships, or while enrolled in the Doctor of Medicine degree progr am are considered full -time enrollees. With the exception of scholars programs, all periods of enrollment are calculated when assessing satisfactory academic progress. C. Good Standing - Most students are admitted to medical school in academic good standing, which indicates that their academic performance is satisfactory at the time of admission. Students will continue in this status provided the student performs in a satisfactory or better fashion in all academic work. Academic work includes all courses, clerkships, acting internships, required USMLE Step 1 and 2 examinations, the NJMS Graduation OSCE, and electives. D. Advancement - Advancement is defined as a student's ability to advance from course to course, or clerkship to clerkship, within a given academi c year. A student's eligibility to advance, or progress, through each year's curriculum is governed by the NJMS Advancement and Promotions policy. E. Promotion - Each student's achievement of the educational goals and objectives of the School is evaluated in summative manner at the conclusion of each academic year. A student who has satisfied the requirements for given curricular year is eligible for pr omotion to the next year of study in the curriculum. A student's promotion from one year to the next is governed by the NJMS Advancement and Promotions policy. F. Leave of Absence (also refer to NJMS Procedure to Request a Leave of Absence) - Students may request a leave of absence from their studies per the NJMS Procedure to Request a Leave of Absence Policy. While on a leave, a student is considered separated from the school; leave of absence (LOA) is a period of non- enrollment. Students on a leave of absence are not considered to be enrolled nor actively working toward the M.D. degree . The maximum duration of a leave per request is one calendar year. A student may not exceed a cumulative total of twenty -four months leave during his/her matri culation in the Doctor of Medicine degree program. G. Academic Difficulty - Academic difficulty is defined as having an unremediated conditional pass grade, course/clerkship failure, or being in clear danger of conditionally passing or failing a course/clerk ship. H. Special Independent Study Program - A program of study during which time a student is required to remediate or complete academic work and/or exams that serve to complete specific degree requirements. Time spent in a special independent study program will be applied toward the six year maximum time frame permitted for completion of the Doctor of Medicine degree requirements. I. Academic Probation - Students who demonstrate a pattern of unsatisfactory or marginal academic and/or professional performance may be placed on academic probation. Conditions of academic probation will be communicated to the student in writing. The purpose of probation is to give a student specific notice of academic or professional performance deficiencies and an opportunity to correct those deficiencies. The length of the probationary period may vary but it must be specified at the outset and be of sufficient duration to give the student a meaningful opportunity to remedy the identified performance problem(s). Most often the student will be placed on a special independent study program while on academic probation. Depending on the student's performance during probation, the possible outcomes of the probationary period are: removal from probation with a return to good aca demic standing; continued probation with new or remaining deficiencies cited; non -promotion to the next year with further probationary training required; or dismissal. A student will remain on probation until the probation status is removed, regardless of the student's enrollment status. J. Academic Suspension - A student may be suspended due to a failure to meet academic standards or a violation of the school or university policies. During a period of suspension, a student is barred from enrollment for a specified period of time. There may b e requirements placed upon the student for activities that must be undertaken and fulfilled during the period of suspension in order for the student to be eligible for reinstatement or readmission. K. Withdrawal - Withdrawal is a voluntary, permanent resigna tion from NJMS by a matriculated student.

Students should be familiar with the NJMS Policy: Good Standing and Participation in Academic and Extracurricular Activities. 4. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine must exhibit the requisite knowledge and skills to complete the prescribed course of study. In addition, they must also possess per sonal qualifications and attributes deemed necessary to perform the duties of the medical profession. Specifically, all candidates are expected to exhibit unimpaired judgment and behavior consistent with the responsibilities of the medical profession. Acco rdingly, the school reserves the right to dismiss a student for either academic or non -academic reasons and will therefore consider such factors as professionalism, honesty, ethical conduct, and responsibility to duty in the evaluation of its students. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with all pertinent NJMS, RBHS, and University policies. D. Year 1, Phase 1 Advancement and Promotions Policy 1.

Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 03/07/2022 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 04/5/2022 I. PURPOSE: To establish rules and regulations governing satisfactory academic progress of NJMS students. II. ACCOUNTABILITY: Under the Dean, and with the assistance of the Offices of Student Affairs and Registrar, the Committee on Student Affairs is charged with the responsibility for reviewing the satisfactory academic progress of all students matriculated at the New Jersey Medical School. The Committee o n Students Affairs shall report decisions satisfactory academic progress to the Faculty Council for its action. III. APPLICABILITY: This policy shall apply to all students who matriculate at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. IV. REFERENCES: NJMS Promotion Policy NJMS Grading Policy NJMS USMLE Step 1 and Step 2CK Policy V. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) A. Satisfactory Academic Progress is the appropriate successful completion of degree requirements, according to published increments, that lead to degree completion within known completion limits. Sound academic principles require that students be required to maintain standards of satisfactory academic progress. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress during any established increment may be placed on financial aid probation and/or an academic plan, suspended and/or dismissed. Students who are placed on financial aid probation and/or an academic plan, suspended and/or dismissed will be informed of their status in writing. Students will be reviewed on an annual basis. B. Qualitative Standard: In order to successfully complete a course, a grade of Honors, High Pass, Conditional Pass or Pass must be earned. Students not making satisfactory academic progress are thos e students whose academic performance puts them at risk of failing to complete the preclerkship (years 1 and 2) or clerkship (year 3 and 4) curriculum in three years, respectively. In addition, a student must complete the USMLE Step 1 in two attempts and the USMLE Step 2CK in two attempts per exam, as specified in the NJMS USMLE Policy, in order to make satisfactory academic progress. If each of these Step exams are not passed by the attempts granted pursuant to the NJMS USMLE Policy, the student is not making satisfactory academic progress. A student who has not passed Step 2CK and/or CS by the expected graduation date but has completed all of the graduation requirements will not be enrolled as full time and will not be eligible for financial aid. C. Quantitative Standard: Students not making satisfactory academic progress are those who do not meet the minimum credits earned requirements at the conclusion of each academic year as specified below: Year 1: 0 credits Year 2: 40 credits Year 3: 68 credits Year 4: 93 credits Year 5: 117 credits Year 6: 151 credits Transfer credits are not included in minimum credits earned calculations. Credits associated with courses graded with an \"EXT -Exempt\" grade will be calculated as credits earned towards minimum quantitative standards. Periods of special independent study i n which the student is remediating or completing work towards completion of degree requirements will be applied toward the six year maximum completion time frame for students in the doctor of medicine degree program. Periods of leave are excluded from the six -year maximum. Students who do not complete the doctor of medicine degree program within ten years from the date of matriculation, which includes periods of leave, non MD - PhD scholars years, and independent study, are not making satisfactory SAP. Students enrolled in the MD/PhD dual degree program must complete the doctor of medicine program within 12 years from the date of matriculation, including periods of leave, MD/PhD scholars years, and special independent study. D. Notification of Lack of Satisfact ory Academic Progress: Following the annual evaluations notification will be transmitted in writing from either the Associate Dean of Student Affairs or registrar to all students who have not met the standards for satisfactory academic progress, with copie s to the Rutgers Office of Financial Aid. The notification shall indicate the nature of the deficiency, any methods that may be available for correcting the deficiency and any consequences that have resulted or may result, such as financial aid probation and/or an academic plan, suspension or dismissal. E. Appeal for Financial Aid Eligibility: Students who wish to appeal their SAP status may do so in writing to the Committee on Student Affairs in accordance with the appeal mechanism set forth in Section VI . B. of the NJMS Promotions Policy. Exceptional circumstances warranting an appeal and possible exception include death of a relative and injury or illness of the student. 1.) A signed appeal letter request that must include a detailed statement of the facts and circumstances supporting the appeal and why the student believes the determination should be changed. 2.) All information supporting the appeal. The student will be notified in writing of the final decision regarding the appeal. F. Financial Aid Probation: Financial Aid Probation is awarded to a student if an appeal has been approved. While on Financial Aid Probation the student is eligible to receive financial aid funding for one term. G. Academic Plan: An Academic Plan is created for a student who will not be able to complete the necessary bench marks to regain SAP status within the period of time on financial aid probation of one term. The Academic Plan includes bench marks that must be completed successfully for each successive term in order to co ntinue on the plan and continue to be eligible for financial aid. H. Standards for SAP Established upon Matriculation: Standards for SAP which are distributed to students upon matriculation are applicable for the duration of a student's continuous matriculation in the same program unless any changes in standards are made. I. Documentation: All data regarding SAP and appeal actions will be maintained by the Office of Student Affairs. J. Dismissal or Withdrawal: Students who are dismissed or voluntarily or involuntarily withdraw from the school are not making satisfactory academic progress and are not eligible to receive financial aid. K. Dissemination: This policy shall be published in the same manner as other academic policies of the school, including on l ine publication and inclusion in all new editions of the Student Handbook. This policy is reviewed on an annual basis. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 02/01/2021 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 03/3/2021 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I. PURPOSE: To establish the role of the United State Medical Licensing Exam in the promotion of and as a graduation requirement for NJMS student s. II. ACCOUNTABILITY: Under the Dean, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs shall enforce this policy. III. APPLICABILITY: The USMLE Step 1 policy will apply to all students who entered NJMS in the fall of 2011 or thereafter, as well as any s tudents who entered prior to that date but subsequently became members of the Class of 2015.

Recording passing scores on USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK are requirements for graduation. IV. POLICY: A. USMLE STEP 1 1. All students are required to sit and record a score for USMLE Step 1 after the satisfactory completion of the second year and prior to starting third year clerkships or beginning a dual degree, scholars, or other academic enhancement program that follows second year coursework. All students must sit and record a score for t he USMLE Step 1 exam by the deadline established for their class by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. In order for a student to be eligible to request an extension of the deadline date established for their class to sit for Step 1, they must meet one of the following criteria: 1. Obtained a grade of CP (Conditional Pass) in any Phase 1 course; 2. Obtained a grade of \"F\" in a competency (either in Year 1 or Year 2); On an annual basis, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs, in conjunction with the Office of Education, will determine additional criteria to be considered which will be reviewed and approved by the Committee on Student Affairs at their January meeting. All students who are granted an extension of the USMLE Step 1 examination by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs will be placed on a special independent study program for the purpose of preparing for the exam. While on the independent study program, each student will be afforded full -time status, assessed tuition and the special independent student program will be noted on the MSPE (Dean's Letter). The time spent enrolled in the special independent study program counts towards the time each student is given to complete the clerkship years. 2. All students who sit and record a score for USMLE Step 1 by the deadline will be allowed to start their third year, a dual degree, scholars, or other academic enhancement program pending the school's receipt of USMLE Step 1 scores. Students who fail their initial attempt of USMLE Step 1 will be given one more opportunity to pass the examination. The second attempt must be made within six months of the date that NJMS receives notification of the failing score on the first attempt. Periods of leaves of absence do not alter the deadline. Students who fail their initial attempt of USMLE Step 1 must meet with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Students will have the following options with regard to coursework in- progress at the time they receive notification of failure: a. they may comple te the remaining clerkship weeks but will be required to postpone the shelf exam; a grade of \"Incomplete/S\" will be recorded on the transcript); b. they may withdraw from the clerkship and forfeit all credit. 3. Regardless of whether stude nts choose option 2a or 2b, students will be precluded from continuing on to their subsequently scheduled clerkship, dual degree, scholars, or other academic enhancement program, until they sit and record a second score for USMLE Step 1. After choosing option 2a or 2b, students will be placed in an independent study program for a period of no more than sixteen weeks. If a student was previously placed on a special independent study program for the purpose of preparing for USMLE Step 1, the total period of time on a special independent study program cannot exceed sixteen weeks. If a student requires the full six months to prepare for the second attempt of USMLE Step 1, the student will be required to take a personal leave of absence after the special independent study program expires through the start date of their next scheduled clerkship, dual degree, scholars, or other academic enhancement program. Students will be permitted to begin their next scheduled clerkship, dual degree, scholars, or other academ ic enhancement program pending receipt of their second USMLE Step 1 score. 4. Students enrolled in a special independent study program or on a personal leave of absence for the purpose of preparing for the first attempt or re -examination of USMLE Step 1 are required to remain in weekly contact with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and/or the Director of the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment. 5. Students who fail to comply with this policy for passing USMLE Step 1, and/or fail to pass on the second attempt, will be immediately dismissed from NJMS. B. USMLE STEP 2 CK 1. Students must sit and record a score for USMLE Step 2 CK after satisfactory completion of all third -year requirements and by the deadline established for their class by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. 2. Students who fail their initial attempt of USMLE Step 2 CK will be given one more opportunity to pass the examination. The second attempt of the exam must be made by the re -examination deadline date communicated to the students by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. 3. Students will be allowed a maximum of two attempts to pass the USMLE Step 2 CK exam. Students who fail to comply with this policy and/or fail to pass the exam on the second attempt will be immediately dismissed from NJMS. *A student may appeal this policy to the Committee on Student Affairs. By Direction of the Dean: ___________________________ Associate Dean for Student Affairs Modification approved March 2020 Purpose: In response to the COVID -19 crisis, certain modifications are required to be made to the NJMS USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK Policy and the NJMS Advancement and Promotion Policy. These modifications will be in effect for the current rising 3rd year students. These modifications are not intended to represent a permanent change in the New Jersey Medical School graduation requirements; they are intended to be introduced as a temporary change to the current graduation requirements. Additionally, these requirements do not represent a change in NJMS' learning objectives. The flexibility and fairness in the options below do not require changing the current registration of lottery numbers and sequences. As of May of 2021, NJMS will revert back to the version of these policies currently in place. Modifications and Desired Outcomes: 1. For USMLE Step 1: A student may take the exam choosing one of the following options, which they will select based on advisement by the Office of Student Affairs. a. After the dedicated period of study following the second year curriculum. b. Delay one third year clerkship (with the exception of Internal Medicine) to fourth year and use the time originally assigned to that clerkship to complete the Step 1 exam. The time to complete the clerkship in fourth year will come out of their flexible time and will not change the number of electives that they must complete in fourth year. The timing of the completion of the moved clerkship will be linked to the established fourth year sequences as to spread out the students doing this and not burdening clerkship enrollment limits. c. After the third year curriculum is complete. The time students take to study for and complete Step 1 following third year will be deducted from the fourth year flexible time and not change the number of electives completed in fourth year. 2. Students who fall under the current \"delay\" mechanism for academic reasons or other reasons will be enco uraged to take options b or c and will not receive additional time if they select option a. 3. There will be no notation in the MSPE of the options that students choose as they are all offered by the school. 4. We have designated 5/31/2020 as the date by which students taking option a for students taking the exam before third year starts. These dates remain tentative because the school and Prometric Centers may be closed longer due to the COVID -19 situation. 5. Any student pursuing a dual degree following the com pletion of their second year (MD/PhD students) must chose option \"a\" in 1 above. 6. Promotion into third and fourth year will not be contingent on passing Step 1. 7. There is no change to the policy in effect for students who fail Step 1, regardless of which option they choose. Modification approved June 2020 Due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the USMLE Announcement (5/26/2020) of the suspension of the administration of the USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) Examination, members of the class of 2021 will not be required to sit for and pass prior to graduation. Section: Office of Education Policy Name: NJMS Grading Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Date: 6/21/23 Academic Programs and Policies Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 7/11/23 Phase I Grading System (Years 1 and 2) 1. All courses during the first two years of medical school will be graded using a categorical system with five levels as noted below, except for the Foundations of Body Systems course, which will be graded Pass/Fail. These grades are reported to the Registrar's Office and recorded on the student's transcript. H - Honors HP - High Pass P - Pass CP - Conditional Pass F- Fail a. Conditional Pass \"CP\" - This grade will be awarded to any student who has not successfully demonstrated mastery of the course requirements, including learning objectives and professionalism standards. The remediation would allow a student to further develop his/her understanding of that field of study, which would then be reassessed. If the student successfully demonstrates mastery of the course requirements following remediation, the student will be eligible for promotion to the following year. The grade of \"CP\" will remain on the student's transcript. If the student fails to successfully demonstrate mastery of the course requirements after remediation and reassessment, then the \"CP\" will be converted to an \"F\" on the students' transcript. If a grade of \"F\" is earned, then the student will be required to repeat the course. b. Fail \"F\"- This grade will be awarded to any student who fails to successfully demonstrate mastery of the course requirements. If a grade of \"F\" is earned, then the student will be required to repeat the course. 2. In addition to the letter grades above, each student will receive a numerical grade that will be reported to the Registrar's Office and will become a part of the students ' academic record. The numerical grade will not be displayed on the students' transcript. All earned numerical grades will be used in calculating rankings and for internal purposes of comparing student performances within and across courses. If a student earns a grade of \"CP\", the numerical grade associated with the \"CP\" will be utilized in summary rankings. If a grade of \"F\" is earned and the student is required to repeat the course, both the numerical grade associated with the original \"F\" grade and the numerical grade earned in the repeat year will be utilized in summary rankings. Phase 2 Grading System (Year 3) The grading scale for 3rd year clinical clerkships is as follows **: H - Honors HPD - High Pass with Distinction HP - High Pass P - Pass F - Failure I/R - Incomplete: Missing Requirements (see below) I/S - Incomplete: Repeat Shelf Exam (see below) WD - Withdrawal **Third year electives are graded Pass/Fail. In addition to the letter grades above, each student will receive a numerical grade in their clinical clerkships that will be reported to the Registrar's Office and will become a part of the students' academic record. The numerical grade will not be displayed on the students' transcript. All earned numerical grades will be used in calculating summary rankings and for internal purposes of comparing student performances within and across courses. Phase 3 Grading System (Year 4) H - Honors HP - High Pass P - Pass F - Failure I/R - Incomplete: Missing Requirements (see below) I/S - Incomplete: Repeat Shelf Exam (see below) WD - Withdrawal Students are to receive individual evaluations of their clinical performance either halfway through the clerkship or at the end of a rotation in a given hospital, whichever occurs first. The evaluation may be verbal or written. The department will inform students of their progress and discuss with them whatever is needed for improvement. If any aspect of student performance is seriously deficient, the Office of Student Affairs will be notified and, together with the department, confer with the student about remediation. Incomplete (I/R and I/S) Grades: The grade of \"Incomplete\" is a temporary grade which indicates that a final grade could not be determined at the time grades were due to the Registrar's Office. Incomplete grades should only be awarded to a student if that student has sought prior permission and approval from the course director to delay completion of a portion of the course or course component. If the student does not meet the criteria to award an Incomplete, the grade of \"F\" will be entered. Clerkship directors are responsible for notifying students of any assigned Incomplete grades. Students may not advance into subsequent clerkships if more than one incomplete or failed clerkship is recorded and unremediated. I/R - Incomplete, missing requirements I/R: this notation will indicate a student's failure to satisfactorily complete a graded course requirement on or before the first attempt (the attempt must occur on or before the final day of the course in order for this designation to be used). This includes any item that is due at the end of the course or clerkship, such as, but not limited to: Deferral of shelf exam Patient and/or procedure logs Make -up days/shifts Write -ups, case presentations or other assigned projects Return of any departmentally supplied equipment, including scrubs , meal cards, etc. When a student is assigned a grade of I/R, the student will then have one month from the end date of the clerkship to complete the missing requirements unless otherwise stated by the course or clerkship director. If a student fails to complete the stated requirements, a grade of \"F\" will be entered as the student's final grade. If an \"F\" is earned due to the failure of the student to complete course requirements per the deadline(s) established by the clerkship director, the highest grade that the student can earn upon repetition of the clerkship or completion of missing requirements is \"P - Pass. When clerkship directors submit a final course grade of \"Fail\" to the Registrar, they are to include their student -specific recommendations for the remediation (e.g., repetition of the clerkship, re-examination, completion of missing requirements and/or repetition of weeks). When a student successfully remediates a failing grade, the failing grade and the second grade will both appear on the transcript. I/S - Incomplete, repeat shelf exam I/S: this notation will indicate a student's failure of a NBME shelf exam at the end of a course or clerkship, provided that their clinical performance was passing (grade of \"Pass\" or higher) at the time the exam was taken. To remove this grade, a student must repeat the Shelf exam according to the Shelf reexamination deadlines established for students by the Office of Student Affairs. The maximum amount of time afforded to a student to remediate a failed Shelf exam in years three and four may not exceed one calendar year from the end date of the clerkship. If the student does not meet this deadline(s), the grade \"I/S\" will be changed to a grade of \"F\" on the student's transcript. If the Shelf re-exam is passed, the Incomplete will be changed to a passing (P) grade. The numerical grade recorded on the initial grading form will not change. If the re-exam is failed, the Incomplete will be changed to a failing grade (F), whether or not the student was repeating the year at the time of the re-examination. The student will then be required to remediate the failure in a manner determined by the department (e.g., assignment to a resident for designated weeks of clinical skills enhancement and/or didactic tutoring, enrollment in a clinical science review course for a specified period of time, repetition of all or part of the clerkship, etc.,). Regardless of the remediation plan, the student will be reregistered for the clerkship. The student must pass the shelf exam at the end of the designated remediation period. If a grade of \"F\" is earned and the student is required to reregister for the course, both the numerical grade associated with the original \"F\" grade and the remediated grade will be utilized in summary rankings. A student may not take a shelf exam in the same clerkship more than three times. If a student fails a shelf exam three times s(he) will be dismissed. Time Frame for Submission of Final Grades (Years 1 -4) Timely submission of grades is essential to inform students about their final performance in courses and clerkships allowing them to self -assess and receive academic support if needed. In addition, timely submission of grades is critical for determining wh ether students are making Satisfactory Academic Progress and eligible to move into the next phase of their education. To ensure compliance, monitoring is done by the Office of the Registrar and the Associate Dean for Education. Course and clerkship site directors are responsible for submitting final course/clerkship grades within 3 weeks of the final day of the course or clerkship. The Associate Dean for Education will be notified of non -compliant courses or clerkship rotations that have not submitted al l grades at the end of this 3 -week period (internal submission deadline). Non-compliant individuals will receive personalized follow -up (e -mail or discussion) from the Associate Dean of Education. At week 4 post -course/clerkship, the Executive Vice Dean will be notified of non -compliant courses or clerkships that have not submitted the final grades. Non -compliant individuals will receive personalized follow -up (e -mail or discussion) from the Executive Vice Dean and the appropriate department chair will be notified. This process will ensure all final grades are submitted within the LCME deadline of 6 weeks. Section: Office of Education Policy Name: NJMS Student Grade Appeal Procedure Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 12/7/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 12/18/2020 Final grades submitted by faculty to the Office of the Registrar are presumed to be accurate and final. A student who has questions about a grade received in a course/clerkship should seek to resolve the issue by first consulting with the course/clerkship director. If the matter has not been resolved after consultation, and the student believes there are grounds for appealing the grade, the student must submit a written appeal to the respective Department Chair within thirty days (30) days of the date the f inal grade was recorded in the Office of the Registrar. The student must provide clear documentation that demonstrates an error in the grade calculation or the evaluation. The student must also provide evidence of the level of achievement in support of the particular grade that the student believes he/she should have been awarded. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Registrar must be copied. The Department Chair will have ten (10) business days to accept or reject the student's appeal. The Depart ment Chair will notify the student, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Registrar's Office of his/her decision in writing. If a change in grade is warranted, the chair will submit a memo detailing the grade change to the Registrar under separate cover. If the Department Chair rejects the student's appeal, the student has the right to appeal this decision to the Dean of NJMS within ten (10) business days of the Department Chair's action. The appeal to the Dean must be presented in writing; the Dea n shall render, within a reasonable period of time, a final decision on the matter and provide written copies of the decision to the student, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and the Registrar. Section: Office of Education Policy Name: Appeals of Online Examinations Due to Technical Difficulties Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Academic Programs and Policies Date: 8/3/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 10/6/2020 Although any loss of connectivity or other technical interruption that might be experienced during a web -based school or NBME examination may not affect the total time allotted for the examination, students experiencing such incidents must alert the examination Proctor during the examination. Students who believe that their examination performance may have been affected adversely by technical difficulties encountered during the administration of a school or web- based NBME examination may appeal to the Course or Clerkship Direct or for a re -examination. Any student wishing to make such an appeal must: 1) have notified the proctor at the time(s) the interruption(s) occurred, 2) notify the examination Proctor of their intent to appeal before leaving the examination room and 3) notif y both the Course or Clerkship Director and the Office of Education of their intent to appeal by email no later than 11:59PM on the day of the examination. Appeals failing to fulfill these requirements will not be considered. The Course or Clerkship Direct or will then consider the student's appeal only after a corroborating Test Administration Report has been obtained from the NBME. If the student's appeal is accepted, the student will be assigned an Incomplete notation for the Course or Clerkship as approved by the Office of Education. The student's original school or Subject Examination score will then be disregarded and the student will be permitted to retake the Course or Clerkship's school or Subject Examination; the score received on that second admini stration of the Subject Examination will be used to compute the student's final Course or Clerkship grade. Section: Office of Education Policy Name: Education Integrity and Conflict of Interest Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Date: 3/20/2019 Academic Programs and Policies Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 4/2/2019 In order to maintain the integrity of the evaluation process in all courses, clerkships, electives and graduation requirements, a student should never be graded by a faculty member or a non -faculty physician, who has seen the student as a patient. Students who choose to seek medical care from physicians within the faculty practices cannot subsequently choose or be assigned to rotate with those physicians as faculty preceptors in core clerkships or electives, as this is a conflict of interest. Students should never be graded by an evaluator with whom they have a relationship, family member or friend. Similarly, students cannot be evaluated by an individual, who is in a group practice with a relative or friend of a student. A conflict of interest might occur when a faculty or staff member has a relationship that may conflict with, or prevent, a person from carrying out duties or exercising good judgm ent in an independent way, with matters that involve grading or evaluation. It is the responsibility of the faculty member to communicate a potential conflict with a course, clerkship, selective or elective director or Student Affairs Dean. Where there is a potential for conflict, faculty should decline supervision in any educational activity that will result in a grade or evaluation. In one may exist, the student must notify a Student Affairs Dean of the potential conflict. STUDENT CONFLICT OF INTERESTS ATTESTATION I, , attest that I have received and read the Education Integrity and Conflict of Interests Policy. Moreover, I agree that I will make the required notifications as outlined above. I acknowledge that failure to provide required notification o f potential conflicts will result in a report to my Department Chair (for a faculty) or a submission of a Professional Conduct Form (for a student).

Faculty with significant teaching, assessment, and educational leadership responsibilities, including course and clerkship directors, must complete training in diversity, equity, and inclusion. 7. Students who believe that assessment of their performance may have been negatively affected by bias should report this to either course or clerkship /site director, Associate/Assistant Deans for Education, the Associate Dean for Students Affairs or Executive Vice Dean or through the Learning Environment and Professionalism reporting system. 8. Review of assessment data occurs regularly at multiple levels for the purpose of ensuring equity in assessment and identifying inequities which can be addressed. 9. In the event that national or local exigent events create a disruption to learning for a large number of students, the school will consider altering the curriculum delivery to allow student time to process these events while ensuring they meet milestones of academic achievement and graduation requirements . This will be communicated to all students. 10. Individual students who experience trauma from internal or external events related to race or other social - political factors which disrupt their learning, should contact the Associate Dean for Student Affairs for an excused absence or late-take of an exam without risk of incurring academic penalty.

Universal precautions also apply cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid - though risk of HIV from these is unknown. Body fluids for which universal precautions do not apply (risk of transmission of HIV and HBV from these fluids/materials is extremely low or non -existent) Feces Nasal secretions Sweat Sputum Tears Urine Vomitus ***unless they contain visible blood Precautions Breast milk: occupational exposure risk has not been reported Saliva: universal precautions do not apply, but general infection control practices (using gloves for digital examination of mucous membranes and endotracheal tube suctioning, and handwashing after exposure to saliva) are recommended Special precautions are recommended for dentistry because blood spatter can occur; gloves, masks and protective eyewear or face shields should be worn How do we define an exposure? An exposure to bloodborne pathogens must include both an infected fluid and a portal of entry. Portals of entry include percutaneous (through the skin), mucous membrane (oral, anal, vaginal), or cutaneous through non- intact skin. The risk of HIV transmission after exposure to body fluids from an HIV -infected patient is generall y low. Risks associated with the main routes of exposure are as follows: o Percutaneous exposure - Risk with an HIV -positive source, approximately 0.3%; risk is increased by hollow -bore needles, visibly bloody devices, deep injuries, and source person with t erminal illness reflecting higher titer of HIV o Mucous membrane exposure - Risk with an HIV -positive source, approximately 0.09%; risk is increased with a high viral load in the source and large -volume exposure Use of Protective Barriers Protective barriers reduce risk of exposure of the health care worker's skin or mucous membranes to potentially infective materials - Gloves, masks, gowns, and protective eyewear - Gloves reduce the incidence of contamination of hands, but cannot prevent penetrating injuries due to needles or other sharp instruments Universal precautions are intended to supplement rather than replace recommendations for routine infection control -such as handwashing - Take care when handling/cleaning/disposing needles , scalpels, and other sharp instruments DO NOT RECAP used needles by hand DO NOT REMOVE USED NEEDLES FROM SYRINGES BY HAND DO NOT BREAK, BEND, MANIPULATE USED NEEDLES BY HAND Dispose syringes, needles, and scalpel blades and other sharp instruments in punc ture-resistant containers for disposal Use protective barriers appropriate for the procedure being performed or when exposure is anticipated IMMEDIATELY AND THOROUGHLY WASH HANDS AND OTHER SKIN SURFACE that is contaminated with blood, body fluid containing visible blood, or other body fluid to which universal precautions apply. A Few Words About Gloves Use gloves when you have cuts, scratches or other breaks in your skin Use gloves in situations where you judge that hand contamination with blood may occur Use sterile gloves when procedure involves contact with normally sterile areas of the body Use gloves for procedures involving contact with mucous membranes, unless other wise indicated Change gloves between patients Do not wash or disinfect gloves Who is at risk for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV infection)? Current or former injection drug users, including those who injected only once many years ago Recipients of clotting factor concentrates made before 1987 Chronic hemodialysis patients Persons with known exposure to HCV, such as: - Health care workers after needle sticks involving HCV -positive blood - Recipients of blood or organs from a donor who tested HCV+ Persons with HIV infection Children born to HCV positive mothers How soon after exposure do persons develop symptoms: average time is 4- 12 wks (but can range 2 -24 wks) Immune Globulin is not effective for post exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis C Evaluation of Exposure and Risk of Exposure Every exposure should be evaluated for potential to transmit HBV, HCV and HIV based on the type of body substance and the route and the severity of exposure - Blood filled hollow needle or bloody device suggest higher risk of exposure than a needle that was most likely used for giving an injection Evaluation of exposure source is crucial - Person whose blood or body fluid is the source of occupational exposure should be evaluated for HBV, HCV and HIV infection - If status of source patient is unknown, then source patient should be tested - Testing of the exposure source should be performed as soon as possible --- MAKE SURE TO REPORT EXPOSURES AS SOON AS THEY OCCUR SO SOURCE STUDIES CAN BE FOLLOWED UP ON/ORDERED ASAP! Follow up testing after HIV exposure can range from 4 months to 6 months, depending the HIV antibody or antigen tests available (typically testing occurs at baseline, 6 weeks and 4 months, but may extend to 6 months). Guidelines for Post Exposure Prophylaxis - PEP (2013) (1) PEP is recommended when occupational exposures to HIV occur; (2) the HIV status of the exposure source patient should be determined, if possible, to guide need for HIV PEP; (3) PEP medication regimens should be started as soon as possible after occupational exposure to HIV, and they should be continued for a 4- week duration; (4) PEP medication regimens should contain 3 (or more) antiretroviral drugs for all occupational exposures to HIV; (5) expert consultation is recommended for any occupational exposures to HIV (6) close follow -up for exposed personnel should be provided that includes counseling, baseline and follow -up HIV testing, and monitoring for drug toxicity; follow -up appointments should begin within 72 hours of an HIV exposure; **PEP is recommended after exposure to an HIV -positive patient. When the HIV status of a patient is unknown, provision of PEP should be evaluated on a case -by-case basis with expert consultation. Things to keep in mind about PEP When indicated, PEP should be initiated as soon as possible (ideally 2 hours and generally 72 hours) after exposure. The approach to PEP depends on the type of exposure, the source, and the HIV status of the source. o Follow -up measures should include the following: o Refraining from donation of blood, tissue, sem en, or organs o Avoiding sexual intercourse or using barrier precautions; avoiding breastfeeding; informing the provider if the at -risk healthcare worker is pregnant o Follow -up HIV antibody testing at 6 weeks and 4 months o Rechecking of CBC, renal function, and hepatic function at 2 weeks IMPORTANT: What do I do if I have a potential exposure? After a needle stick or skin exposure to blood or bodily fluids or splash to eyes, the following procedure should be followed: 1. Wash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water; flush splashes to mucous membranes like the nose or mouth with water, irrigate eyes with water, saline, or irrigants available by eye wash stations; 2. Immediately notify the supervising resident, attending physician and nursing supervisor at the hospital/site where you are rotating; 3. During normal business hours, contact Student Health Services at 973 -972-8219 (90 Bergen Street, Suite 1750, Newark) for prompt evaluation, treatment, or referral to the treatment facility c losest to you. During non -business hours, immediately go to the ED of University Hospital or the NJMS affiliate nearest to you. Please be sure to identify yourself as a NJMS student exposed to a blood borne pathogen. 4. Regardless of injury site, NJMS student s should follow up at Student Health Services at 973- 972-8219. 5. Complete an incident report at myrehs.rutgers.edu, route it to your supervising attending or resident for signature. From alternate sites, may use the paper form https://riskmanagement.rutgers.edu/files/inj- stu-pub-pdf It is afterhours and I was seen in ED for my blood borne pathogen exposure, now I am being billed by the hospital: what do I do? As a medical student you do not have workers compensation insurance. Make sure to give your health insurance card/information to ED. All blood borne pathogen exposure evaluation and treatment costs have to be billed to your insurance first. Unreimbursed expenses will be covered through the school. Contact the Student Affairs Office at 973- 972-4783 (MSB B648) to report the incident and for assistance with any bills you receive. Infections and other environmental hazards you may be exposed to Healthcare workers have a high risk of contact with infectious agents due to the various types of activities involved with their jobs and the possibilities of contamination.

APPLICABILITY: This policy shall apply to all third and fourth year students who enroll at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. IV. RELATED POLICY: Refer to policies.rutgers.edu. V. POLICY Participation in learning experiences is essential for the development of competent physicians. Attendance is expected at all scheduled activities, including lectures, conference, rounds, clinical assignments, on- call, and preceptorships. A clerkship or elective director may grant a student an excused absence from a mandatory clerkship or elective session for the following reasons: personal illness; birth of a child; an appointment with a healthcare provider or to receive healthcare services; mandatory jury duty; serious illness or death of an immediate family member1; serious illness or death of a non- family member by the approval of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs; residency interviewing; or by approval of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Modification June 2020 Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the following modifications in the Attendance Policy for Clinical Clerkships were mad e: 1. Flexible days will not be approved during a clerkship that is only three weeks or less in duration. 2. Students who are absent for more than five consecutive or cumulative days within a clerkship or elective due to an illness will be required to take a leave of absence from the School. The clerkship/elective director will determine how remaining clerkship/elective requirements must be fulfilled, but this will not include repetition of the entire clerkship/elective. Students will be allowed to make up the missed time if this is required by the clerkship/elective director at a time that is agreed upon by the clerkship/elective director, and the Associate Deans for Student Affairs an d Education. This time may be made up during fourth year if this is judged to be optimal by the clerkship/elective director, and the Associate Deans for Student Affairs and Education. The above will remain in force for Academic Year 2020 -2021. Thereafter, the policy will be as stipulated as follows: \"Students must notify the respective clerkship/elective director or designee of his/her expected absence on or before the scheduled start time of the clerkship/elective. The student may not leave a message or wr ite an email; they must speak to the clerkship/elective or designee and be granted the excused absence. The clerkship/elective director may require appropriate documentation. In the event that the clerkship/elective director or designee is not available, t he student must contact the Associate Dean for Student Affairs.\" The remainder of the policy is unchanged. Unexcused absences are not permitted and will result in failure and repetition of the clerkship/elective. All excused absences must be made- up; any time not made -up will result in a grade of \"I/R - Incomplete/Requirements.\" Students who are absent for more than five consecutive or cumulative days within a clerkship or elective will be required to take a leave of absence from the School. When a studen t is placed on a leave of absence, the clerkship/elective director will determine how remaining clerkship/elective requirements must be fulfilled, which may include, but is not limited to, repetition of the entire clerkship/elective. Students have one fle xible day that they can utilize during each of the third year clerkships, which are not required to be made up. The date the student requests needs to be approved by the Clerkship Director. A maximum of one day can be requested per clerkship. Flexible days will not be approved during the following: third year electives; on days that there are mandatory sessions or events; immediately before or after a University recognized holiday; if the Clerkship Director thinks that it will cause a hardship for the clinical service. In response to events or notifications of escalating, and/or severe weather and/or other disasters and catastrophic emergencies, the RBHS may decide to implement curtailment of operations procedures described in the \"Inclement Weather and Emergency Curtailment of Operations\" policy. Hazardous weather, disasters, catastrophes, and other emergencies do not automatically cause curtailment procedures to be placed into effect; a decision to implement curtailment procedures must be ma de and communicated by the appropriately designated University or RBHS officials. For the purpose of inclement weather or other disasters and catastrophic emergencies, students shall not be deemed or characterized as \"essential or emergency\" personnel as these designations are defined by law. Pursuant to Rutgers and RBHS policies, students shall not be compelled or required to report to their duties nor should they be adversely affected by their absence (ie. evaluations and/or grading), as the absence shall be deemed an excused absence. Please note that all excused absences due to such emergencies will be addressed at the clerkship level. Clerkship and elective directors are obligated to enforce this policy.

The breadth of clinical training sites enriches the student's learning experience, as the student is exposed todiverse patient populations and health care environments. S tudents are expected to make their own travel arrangements when assigned to an affiliate site. If a student does not own an automobile, it is expected that the studentwill carpool, ma ke full use of public transit systems, or secure another method of transportation that will insure their prompt arrival at the site. I f a student cannot fulfill the NJMS essential functions for admission, matriculation and program completion or travel to affiliate sites, the student should requestaccommodations through the NJMS Access to Accommodations Policy. In the absenceof approved accommodations, failure to secure adequate transportation to an affiliatesite cannot be used as an excuse for tardiness or absenteeism. B y Direction of the Dean: Associate Dean for Student Affairs Section: Office of Education Policy Name: NJMS Scheduled Hours for Pre -Clerkship Student Curricular Activities Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Academic Programs and Policies Date: 12/13/22 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 12/23/22 This policy is enacted to provide a statement of the expectations that govern the hours of scheduled activities for NJMS students during the pre -clerkship years of their undergraduate medical education. This is designed to maximize student learning time and opportunities for unstructured, independent, and self -directed learning within the precle rkship curriculum. Medical students in the pre -clerkship years of their education should have, on average, no more than 25 hours of scheduled educational activities as indicated on official NJMS calendars (such as the course calendar or block schedule) with a maximum of 28 hours in any given week . This expectation includes all scheduled course sessions. In addition to scheduled in -class hours, out of class assigned activities (including pre - and post - session assignments) must not exceed on average 10 hours per week with a maximum of 12 hours in any given week . This expectation does not include study undertaken by students, individually or in groups, that is not a scheduled curricular activity. Thus, any given week should not exceed 40 hours in total o f scheduled educational activities and out of class assigned activities. In rare circumstance s, moderate exceptions to these limits may be made with approval from the Associate Dean for Education. (Note: the Policy on Medical Student Duty Hours governs the hours of activities for NJMS students during the clerkship years.) Section: Office of Education Policy Name: NJMS Medical Student Duty Hours Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Date: 7/17/2019 Academic Programs and Policies Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 8/6/2019 Medical students in the final two years of their education should be expected to assume a level of supervised patient care responsibility commensurate with their level of training and their demonstrated clinical skills. In order to advance their clinical c ompetency and prepare them for postgraduate medical education, this level of responsibility should be established at the highest level that is consistent with exemplary patient care and safety. In addition to advancing their clinical skills, medical students must have ample opportunity to consolidate their learning through self -study. Their level of clinical responsibility should allow adequate time for study, review, and preparation for required formative and summative evaluations. Finally, student responsibilities should be commensurate with a balanced life- style that allows adequate time for other non- educational tasks and healthy behaviors. NJMS recognizes the effects of fatigue and sleep depr ivation on learning, clinical activities, and health and safety. Therefore, we are committed to providing meaningful educational experiences within the limits of the following medical student duty hour standards: Student duty hours should conform to the c urrent ACGME standards applied to resident education. Specifically, students should not exceed an AVERAGE 80- hour weekly schedule across any four -week period. All required clinical and scheduled educational and assessment activities are to be included in t he duty hour estimates. Students should not be required to exceed 24 continuous duty hours plus 4 additional hours for patient turnover.* Students must be allowed 1 full day off in 7 averaged over 4 weeks. Teaching days, examination days, and other scheduled educational activities do not count as days off. However, time spent on reading and independent self -study does count as time off from scheduled duty hours. Students must not be required to complete overnight call on the evening prior to an examinatio n or performance based assessment. Duty - free intervals between assigned clinical/educational activities should be at least 8 hours long. Mandatory NJMS holidays (these apply to third year students ONLY) may be counted as days off in compliance with the \"1 in 7\" policy. Call rooms will be available for all students who feel too fatigued to safely get home. *Limited and carefully justified exceptions to this policy may be permissible. It is recognized that students do not work the consistently demanding and lengthy hours of resident physicians. In addition, their educational experiences in many areas are of limited duration. Maximizing their opportunity to experience some clinical or educational opportunities may from time to time justify exceeding the normal duty hours policy. Examples of justifiable exceptions might include, but are not limited to, the following: A student -initiated request to participate in or observe a medical activity or procedure that must occur beyond the 80- hour policy. A student -initiated request to waive or alter the 'days off' policy in order to accommodate a special event (e.g. attend a special conference, attend a wedding, birth, or funeral, etc) or ensure continuity of care or experience with a particu larly valuable or interesting clinical case. This policy was revised by the NJMS Clinical Curriculum Advisory Subcommittee on 5/7/14; approved by the Committee on Curriculum and Academic Programs and Policies 5/2014 and by Faculty Council on 5/14/14. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Changes in Training Site Assignment Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 8/3/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 8/20/20 Lottery systems are used to determine training and clerkship sites in all four years of medical school. At any point, a student may make a request to switch a training or clerkship site assignment. Students are advised to meet with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs (ADSA) if they think they have a situation that warrants special consideration and a switch of a training or clerkship site. If the ADSA determines that the circumstances warrant a change in the site, the ADSA will work with the Course or Clerkship Director to ensure that the student's request is accommodated without the change in schedule negatively impacting the educational quality during the Course or Clerkship. Students may at any point, also request a change in training site due to a learning environment concern. These matters will be deliberated following consultation with the Executive Vice Dean and Associate Dean for Education and acted upon in a timely fashion so as to remove students from adverse settings. Section: Office of Education Policy Name: Medical Student Assessment in Courses and Clerkships: Narrative Assessment Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Date: 1/15/2020 Academic Programs and Policies Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 2/4/2020 RELEVANT LCME STANDARDS: 9.5 Narrative Assessment PURPOSE AND SCOPE: Faculty assessment of a student's performance, including their non- cognitive achievement, is essential to their ability to reflect and improve. This type of assessment is best achieved in small group or individual learning settings. This policy applies to: Course and clerkship directors Teaching faculty, including graduate students, residents, and fellows who participate in the teaching and evaluation of medical students Medical Students POLICY: Narrativ e assessment will be provided if a student has four or more sessions in a small group or clinical setting of 12 or fewer students with the same instructor at each session of a preclinical course (years 1 and 2). Narrative assessment will be provided to all students participating in each clinical clerkship or clinical elective (years 3 and 4). PROCEDURE: The course directors will be responsible for determining if their course contains a type of teacher - student interaction listed above and mus t include narrative assessment. The clerkship directors will be responsible for including narrative assessment for all clinical clerkships and electives. CAP2 is responsible for reviewing and Section: Office of Education Policy Name: Mid -Course and Clerkship Feedback Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Date: 2/19/2020 Academic Programs and Policies Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 3/3/2020 RELEVANT LCME STANDARDS: 9.7 Formative Assessment and Feedback 8.6 Monitoring of Completion of Required Clinical Experiences PURPOSE AND SCOPE: Students benefit from faculty feedback about their performance, both as an external measure of achievement and in informing how they may continue to improve. It is essential to provide feedback while a clerkship is in progress so that students have an opportunity to improve or to remediate deficiencies before the end of the course or clerkship. This policy applies to course and clerkship directors, site directors, other supervising physicians and residents, and medical students. POLICY: 1. For courses and clerkships of four weeks (or longer) duration, students must receive formative feedback by the mid -point of that course/clerkship. 2. Pre-clerkship Curriculum : this formative feedback may include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. pre-exam study questions; 2. post-exam review sessions; 3. feedback during small group, laboratory, OSCE, and simulation ses sions 4. preceptor and peer -to-peer feedback; and 5. self-directed learning reflections. 3. Clerkship Curriculum: 1. Students must receive feedback from supervising physician and/or clerkship or site director midway through the clerkship. 2. The mid -clerkship feedback fo rm must be completed with a review of the electronic log of required clinical experiences as well as an assessment of the student's performance in comparison to clerkship objectives. 4. Course and clerkship directors are responsible for ensuring each student receives mid - course and mid- clerkship feedback. Students are able to comment on whether they received mid- clerkship feedback in the Clerkship Evaluation after each clerkship. Aggregate data on compliance with mid- course/clerkship feedbac k is distributed yearly to the Pre -Clerkship Curriculum (PCC) Clinical Curriculum Subcommittee (CCC). PROCEDURE: 1. Formative feedback will be provided to all courses via the methods described in policy. 2. Mid way through a clerkship, the supervising physician and/or clerkship or site director provides feedback to the medical student. 3. Each student should discuss any outstanding Required Clinical Experiences with the supervising during the mid- clerkship feedback. 4. Students log whether they ha ve received mid -clerkship feedback in the end of clerkship evaluation form. Section: Office of Education Policy Name: Medical Student Supervision Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Date: 12/14/2020 Academic Programs and Policies Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 12/18/2020 Purpose: To ensure that medical students in clinical learning situations involving patient care are appropriately supervised at all times in order to ensure patient safety and student safety, that the level of responsibility delegated to the students is appropriate to their level of training and that the activities supervised are within the scope of practice of the supervising health professional. Scope: This policy covers all faculty, residents (includes interns, residents and fellows) and other licensed health pr ofessionals (for example, nurses; herein after referred to as staff) who supervise medical students in situations involving patient care. Definitions: A. Level of Participation for History Taking and Physical Exams Minimal: the student is present during the history taking and is a complete observer. Moderate: the student may assist in the history taking and/or physical examination. Full: the student performs most or all history taking and/or physical examination. All third and fourth year students have had appropriate training and may independently perform patient history and physical exams. B. Level of Participation for Procedures: Minimal: the student is present during the procedure and is a complete observer. Moderate: the student may assist in the procedure. Examples include positioning of a retractor or assisting in positioning a patient during a procedure. Full: the student performs most or all of the procedure under the appropriate level of supervision. The student must have an appropriate training in the procedure. An example would be venipuncture, suturing of minor lacerations, placement of a foley catheter. C. Level of Supervision: Students may perform procedures only with direct supervision or with indirect supervision immediately available from an appropriately privileged faculty member or resident. In the case of staff members, direct supervision must be provided. Direct Supervision - the supervising professional is physically present with the student and patient. Indirect Supervision: I. With direct supervision immediately available - the supervising professional is physically within the hospital or other site of patient care, and is immediately available to provide direct supervision. II. With direct supervision available - the supervising professional is not physically present within the hospital or other site of patient care, but is immediately available by means of telephone and/or electronic modalities, and is available to provide direct supervision. Oversight - the supervising professional is available to provide review of procedures/encounters with feedback provided after care is delivered. Responsibilities and Requirements: A. Faculty, residents and staff will be made aware annually of the training that students have received based on the level of students they are expected to supervise (e.g. community preceptors will receive infor mation about the first year student competencies.) B. Departments are responsible for informing their faculty of clinical encounters and procedures that students may perform. C. Supervising health professional: Faculty must be authorized in the procedure the student is performing in order to function as the supervising physician. The level of participation by the student must be consistent with their training and previous experience and should address the goals and objectives of the relevant rotation. If a faculty member is uncertain as to the appropriate level of involvement for the student, they should contact the clerkship or site director. When the faculty is supervising the student, they must be physically pr esent with the student and the patient. Faculty may be immediately available for specified procedures.4 Residents may provide supervision to a medical student performing a procedure based on the resident's privileges. If a resident is privileged to perform a procedure with indirect supervision available or with oversight available, then they may supervise the student either directly or be immediately available for specified procedures. The level of participation by the student must be consistent with their training and previous experience and should address the goals and objectives of the relevant rotation. If a resident is unsure as to the appropriate level of involvement for the student, they should contact the clerkship or site. Staff may supe rvise a student performing a procedure if the procedure is within the scope of practice for that professional. Examples include vaccination, intravenous catheter placement and insertion of a Foley catheter. The staff member must directly supervise the stud ent. If the staff member is unsure as to the appropriate level of involvement for the student, they should contact the attending supervising the student. Students are required to inform patients of their role and responsibilities in the patient's care. Supervising residents, staff and faculty must ensure that the patient is properly informed of the student's involvement. Students may participate (and are encouraged to do so) in obtaining informed consent for procedures but they cannot do so without direct supervision by an appropriately privileged physician or healthcare professional director. Medical student activities c annot be billed for under any circumstances except as permitted by CMS regulations, immediately available for specified procedures. The level of participation by the student must be consistent with their training and previous experience and should address the goals and objectives of the relevant rotation. If a resident is unsure as to the appropriate level of involvement for the student, they should contact the clerkship or site director. If at any time a student notes inadequate supervision, they can rep ort to the clerkship director, Associate Dean for Education, Associate Dean for Student Affairs or the Executive Vice Dean. In addition, students can report anonymously any concerns through the end of the clerkship evaluation. Responsible for Compliance Clerkship Director Department Chair Curriculum Committee (CAP2) Note: LCME Standard 6, Element 6.2 Required Clinical Experiences Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: Residents as Teachers Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Curriculum, Date: 2/19/2020 Academic Programs and Policies Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 3/3/2020 PURPOSE AND SCOPE: To outline how Rutgers NJMS graduate medical education programs prepare residents and fellows for their role in teaching medical students. Residents and fellows play an important instructional role in the clinical education of medical students. In order to fulfill that responsibility, residents and fellows need to be familiar with the comp etencies and milestones expected of third and fourth year medical students and have orientation and faculty development resources available to enhance their teaching and assessment skills. At Rutgers NJMS, we value the role residents and fellows play in t he teaching and learning of medical students. We believe in the importance of supporting residents and fellows in their roles as teachers and providing excellent training for this role. POLICY: 1. All Rutgers NJMS students must work with residents and/or fellows for a minimum of four weeks in clinical clerkship rotations. 2. All incoming residents and fellows are required to attend GME New Resident and Fellow Orientation, which includes an orientation to their roles and responsibilities as teachers. 3. Residents and fellows who will teach medical students participate in departmental clerkship orientations where they receive a copy of the clerkship objectives. 4. Residents and fellows who evaluate or assess medical students receive an annual update with the NJ MS goals and objectives as well as all relevant clinical policies, including duty hours, student mistreatment, and professionalism, via the GME database management system, New Innovations. 5. The Rutgers NJMS Office of Education offers teaching development workshops to help faculty, residents, fellows, and instructors improve teaching skills. Attendance is monitored centrally by the DIO and Associate Dean for Education. PROCEDURE: 1. The GME resident orientation covers the following topics: i. Rutgers NJMS Goals and Objectives ii. Rutgers NJMS Student Mistreatment & Duty Hour Policies iii. Overview on providing effective feedback, both verbal and written 2. Each department/clerkship is responsible for distribution and education on clerkship specific goals and objectives, required clinical encounters. 3. Attendance for resident as teachers sessions is collected and monitored centrally by the Office of GME. Note: LCME Standard: Element 9.1 Preparation of Resident and Non- Faculty Instructor Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Good Standing and Participation in Academic and Extracurricular Activities Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 I. PURPOSE: To define the meaning of good standing and establish guidelines for participation in academic and extracurricular activities. II. ACCOUNTABILITY: Under the Dean, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs shall enforce this policy. When necessary, the Student Affairs Committee may enforce this policy. III. APPLICABILITY: All Rutgers New Jersey Medical School enrolled students. IV. POLICY: Good standing status denotes that a student is eligible to continue in or to return to the Doctor of Medicine program at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Students not meeting the standards of satisfactory academic progress or whose good standing is at risk due to course failures or incomplete grades are expected to review and decide, with the assistance of all available counseling and advising, which extracurricular activities to terminate because they interfere with studying and which to retain because they play an important part in personal need or development. To this end, a meeting with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs is mandatory. Students who do not exercise good judgment in managing their coursework with other activities may be subject to restrictions with respect to participation in extracurricular activities. Restrictions may be imposed by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and/or the Student Affairs Committee. V. PROCEDURE: Students should be aware of their academic standing and balance their academic and extracurricular activities accordingly. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and/or the Student Affairs Committee may impose restrictions on academically at- risk students. By Direction of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Taking Time for Scholars Experience Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 9/21/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 9/25/2020 Students may participate in scholarly experiences that are not part of the NJMS curriculum. These experiences are done in addition to the curriculum, and depending on the timing and length of the experience may result in the student extending their time in medical school beyond the traditional four years. Students maintain full -time enrolled status during these experiences. There are three mechanisms for approval of experiences that result in an extension of the student's graduation date. 1. Students accepted into a NJMS Distinction Program (e.g., Distinction in Research Program) that requires additional time beyond the traditional four years will be approved for the extension in time after providing written documentation of acceptance into the program to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs (ADSA) and the Registrar. 2. Students accepted into an external research or scholars program (e.g., NIH Medical Research Scholars Program) that requires additional time beyond the traditional four years will be approved for the extension in time after providing written documentation of acceptance into the program to the ADSA and the Registrar. 3. Students may develop their own scholarly experience with supervising faculty at NJMS or an external institution. If this experience re sults in an extension of the student's graduation date the student must seek approval from the Committee on Student Affairs (CSA). The student must provide the CSA with a plan for the scholars period that includes a description of the experience, length of time requested, learning objectives and goals, responsible supervisor(s), and the reason for pursuing the activity. They must also provide a letter from the supervisor(s) confirming the experience, learning objectives and goals, and their willingness to provide supervision and oversight of the experience. Prior to the CSA meeting these documents will be reviewed by the Associate Dean for Education, who will determine if the proposed learning objectives and goals are appropriate. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Guidelines for Students Attendance at Conferences Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 Attendance at meetings can be an enriching educational opportunity for medical students, particularly if the student has conducted research, had clinical experiences that relate to the conference topic(s), or the meeting further contributes to the student's professional development. Attendance at conferences also offers the opportunity to meet others who work in the basic science and medical fields, and furthers the possibility of establishing collaborations. A student who wishes to attend a conference that conflicts with course/cl erkship activities will be expected to make -up all missed course/clerkship activities, when possible. Additionally, the student must satisfy the following conditions: 1. Be in good academic standing; 2. 2.Present a paper or poster at the conference representing his/her own work. If a student is not presenting a paper or poster, the student must have a formal letter of recommendation from a faculty member detailing the educational benefit to the student; 3. Submit a formal request, at least 45 days in advance of the expected absence(s), to the Course or Clerkship Director, with a copy to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. This request must include the student name, date of request, the student email address, the student's phone number, the title of the course/cle rkship the student is requesting an absence from, the conference name, the date(s) the student will be in attendance at the conference, the date(s) the student will be absent from the course/clerkship, and a proposed plan to make up the absence and activit ies missed from the course/clerkship, when possible. Once received, the course/clerkship director and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs will review the request within ten (10) business days. The student will be consulted if more information is needed. In general, attendance at a conference will not be permitted if the student is in academic difficulty. Students should refrain from registering for the conference or making travel arrangements until the request has been approved. If attendance at a conference is permitted, the student is expected to remind the course/clerkship director of his/her planned absence three (3) days prior to the absence, and make up the missed activities as approved. Additionally, any costs associated with attendance at the conference are the responsibility of the student. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Procedure to Request a Leave of Absence Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 Non-Medical: 1. The student must submit a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs requesting a Leave of Absence and explaining the reason(s) for the request. 2. Requests for a Leave of Absence by students in good academic standing will be acted upon by the Dean of Student Affairs. Appeals of the Dean's decision may be made to the Committee on Student Affairs. 3. Ordinarily, students in academic difficulty will not be granted a Leave of Absence. However, requests for a Leave of Absence by students in academic di fficulty will be forwarded by the Dean of Student Affairs to the Committee on Student Affairs for action. Students will be notified of approval/disapproval by letter. 4. Conditions which must be met before the student is permitted to return may be attached to the Leave of Absence by either the Dean of Student Affairs or the Committee on Student Affairs. 5. Students who have been granted a Leave of Absence shall notify in writing the Dean of Student Affairs of their intention to return, no later than 6 weeks before their intended return. 6. Maximum duration of medical and/or personal leave is one year. A student may not exceed a cumulative total of twenty -four months leave during his/her matriculation in the Doctor of Medicine degree program. 7. If after the maximum permissible period of a leave of absence the student does not return, it will result in an administrative withdrawal of the student from the medical school. B. Medical: 1. Requests for a medical Leave of Absence should be made in writing to the Dean of Student Affairs, and must include a letter from the student's licensed health care professional and, at the discretion of the Dean of Student Affairs, a health care professional designated by the school documenting the need for a medical leave. 2. Upon return from a medical Leave of Absence, a letter from the student's licensed health care professional and, at the discretion of the Dean of Student Affairs, a health care professional designated by the school certifying readiness of the student to return to school is required 6 weeks prior to the intended return. 3. Maximum duration of medical and/or personal leave is one year. A student may not exceed a cumulative total of twenty -four months leave during his/her matriculation in the Doctor of Medicine degree program. 4. If after the maximum permissible period of a leave of absence the student is not found fit to return, it will result in an administrative withdrawal of the student from the medical school. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Procedure to Request a Withdrawal Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 Withdrawal is a voluntary permanent resignation from the MD program at NJMS by an enrolled student. Students considering withdrawal should discuss the matter with their advisor(s) and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. The withdrawal mechanism is not intended to serve as an outlet to avoid dismissal due to academic failure or disciplinary reasons. The following procedures should be followed when requesting a withdra wal from the MD program: 1. The student must submit a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs requesting a withdrawal from the program. The letter must explain the reason(s) for the request. 2. Requests for a Withdrawal by students in good academic standing will be acted upon by the Dean of Student Affairs. 3. Ordinarily, students in academic difficulty will not be granted a withdrawal; rather, they will be subject to the NJMS Advancement and Promotion Policy. However, requests for a withdrawal by stude nts in academic difficulty will be forwarded by the Dean of Student Affairs to the Committee on Student Affairs for action. Students will be notified of approval/disapproval by letter. 4. If approved, the date of withdrawal will be noted on the academic trans cript. 5. If a student ceases to attend without requesting a leave of absence or a withdrawal from the program, the Dean for Student Affairs will attempt to contact the student by phone, email, and by certified return- receipt mail. If the student fails to res pond to outreach efforts within 15 business days, the Dean for Student Affairs, in conjunction with the course/clerkship directors, will determine the last date of attendance and process an administrative withdrawal from the program. An administrative with drawal is considered a permanent status. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Deregistration Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 The cancellation of a student's enrollment or registration for any period of time is referred to as deregistration. Deregistration is an administrative action taken when a student fails to fulfill a professional obligation or established administrative deadline while enrolled in medical school. Examples of professional obligations and/or administrative deadlines include, but are not limited to: 1. non-payment of fees, fines or bills 2. failure to remove a financial aid, student loan, library, parking or other University encumbrance 3. failure to meet an immunization requirement deadline or address immunization non- compliant status 4. failure to submit missing academic paperwork, such as an official academic transcript 5. failure to submit enrollment /registration data information, or 6. failure to adhere to other internal, publicized deadlines established by the school or University administration. The NJMS Office of the Dean, Office of Education, or any other administrative area may initiate the deregistration process. When a student is deregistered, the Registrar will notify the student that he/sh e is not permitted to attend any educational or school -related activities, such as lectures, small group sessions, labs, clinic, rounds, exams, OSCEs, etc., while deregistered. The Course Director(s) will also be notified. During a period of deregistration, the student will be assigned a grade of zero (0) for missed educational or school -related activities. The Registrar will re-register the student once the student satisfies any and all professional or administrative obligations. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Tuition and Refund Policy Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 Rutgers New Jersey Medical School abides by the assessment of tuition and fee policies set forth in University and RBHS Policy (refer to policies.rutgers.edu for additional information): Stude nts who withdraw, take an official leave of absence, or are dismissed from the University during the first third of the semester will be granted an 80% tuition refund. No refunds will be made after this time; fees will not be refunded at any time. Detailed information regarding tuition refund deadlines for each class can be found on the NJMS Academic Calendar. When the NJMS Registrar receives a request for leave of absence or withdrawal, a Status Change Form is processed and, if eligible, the student's account is adjusted accordingly. If the student is eligible for a refund, they will receive the amount via check or direct deposit from the Cashier's Office. Students who receive aid should contact Financial Aid to discuss the return of funds i f applicable. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Policy on Student Privacy, Student Records Access, and Amendment of Student Records Prepared and Approved by: Committee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (\"Rutgers\") complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\") and makes public announcement of the law. Under FERPA, a Rutgers student has the right to inspect and review his/her education records within 45 days of the date Rutgers receives a proper request for access to such records. The institution is not required to permit students to review records including information about other students, financial records of their parents, or confidential letters of recommendation if they waived their right of access. The student has the right to request amendment of education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Rutgers shall obtain the prior consent of the student before disclosing personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, EXCEPT to the extent FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. FERPA permits disclosure to Rutgers officials with legitimate educational interest in the records being sought. A Rutgers official is a person employed by Rutgers in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Governors or Board of Trustees, a student serving on an official committee such as a disciplinary hearing board, or a student who is assisting another school official in performing his or her job responsibilities. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill their job responsibilities. Rutgers New Jersey Medical School students requesting amendment of education records should write to the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Registrar responsible for the record and clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the record custodian denies the request to amend the record, the student will be notified of the decision and advised of their right to a formal hearing. A student will obtain additional information on the hearing procedure after an amendment request has been denied. If, as a result of the hearing, the University decides that the challenged information is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student, it will amend the reco rd and notify the student in writing. If the University does not agree that the record should be changed, the student will be permitted to place a statement contesting the decision. The statement would remain part of the academic record and should be included whenever the education record is sent to any party. Section: Office of Student Affairs Policy Name: NJMS Policy and Procedures for Student Record Access: Instructions to Faculty and Staff Prepared and Approved by: Commi ttee on Student Affairs Date: 08/03/2020 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: 08/21/2020 Handling of Student Data by Faculty and Staff Any faculty or staff member with access to student data is responsible for its proper handling. No matter what the form or content, the faculty and staff member are accountable for handling student records in accordance with the law and University policy. Student Record Access FERPA requires that anyone accessing private student records have a \"legitimate educational interest\" for the information. Examples include: Performing a task that is specified in their position description or contract Performing a task related to a student's education or to student discipline Maintaining safety and security on campus Obligation to Release Record Information NJMS is not obligated to release directory information to anyone. FERPA only states that an institution MAY release information, but there is no obligation to do so. Deceased Students The privacy rights of a stude nt expire with that student's death. Student Workers Students who perform institutional functions may be deemed \"school officials\" with a \"legitimate educational interest\" in accessing designated educational records of other students. The same requirements and responsibilities for a full time school official exist for student workers. Student workers must be trained on FERPA no different than if they were faculty or staff. Subpoenas All subpoenas are first reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel to de termine the appropriate course of action. Crisis Situations/Emergencies If non -directory information is needed to resolve a crisis or emergency situation, the University may release that information if the institution determines that the information is \"necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals.\" Factors considered in making this assessment include, but are not limited t o: the severity of the threat to the health or safety of those involved; the need for the information; the time required to deal with the emergency; and the ability of the parties to whom the information is to be given to deal with the emergency. Posting G rades It is a violation of FERPA to publicly post grades either by the student's name, student identification number or social security number. Instructors can assign students unique numbers or codes that can be used to post grades. However, the order of t he posting must not be alphabetic. Returning Assignments Leaving personally identifiable, graded papers unattended for students to view is not allowed. Student Correspondence All Rutgers University students, staff, and instructors are assigned a university managed email account to be utilized for purposes of official correspondence. Instructors may notify students of their individual grades via email, provided the email is sent from a University email account, to a University email account. Notification of grades may also be made via the use of a course management website. Students must access their grades after providing their RU NetID and password. Access to Other Student Records Instructors are considered \"school officials\" and have access to class roster s and basic information for students enrolled in their classes. Instructors may not access other student academic records without demonstrating a \"legitimate educational interest\" in such information. Parents Requesting Information Student educational record information is protected under FERPA and parents may not have access to it unless the student has completed the FERPA release form that specifically identifies what information may be released to the parent(s). Letters of Recommendation Written permission of the student is required for a letter of recommendation if any information included in the recommendation is part of the \"education record\" (grades, GPA and other non- directory information). Section: Office of the Dean Policy Name: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Policy Prepared and Approved by: Institutional Planning & Development Date: January 10, 2022 Approved by: Faculty Council Date: February 8, 2022 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We at NJMS recognize that diversity, equity, and inclusion enhances our ability as an academic community to foster innovation and excellence. NJMS has a longstanding traditi on of commitment to diversity through its extensive pipeline programming that begins at the pre- college through faculty levels to address social, economic, and racial inequities. The diversity of our nation, combined with a shortage of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds in the health professions, presents a significant challenge for medical education and academic medicine. We at NJMS are resolutely responding to the need for a diverse healthcare workforce that meets the diverse needs of our patients, the community, the state and the nation. We are committed to support diversity initiatives with a focus on recruitment and retention efforts of individuals that have been historically underrepresented (Hispan ic/Latinx, Black/African American), women, and first -generation students inclusive of their advancement and presence in leadership roles. We are cognizant of the evolving landscape of diversity and will continue to evolve identified groups. Our Policy dire cts our efforts toward the NJMS Strategic Plan and the NJMS DEI Plan in alignment with RBHS and Rutgers University: Recruit Retain and Develop a Diverse Community Recruit, retain, and develop a student body that represents the state of New Jersey, particul arly those who are historically underrepresented. Recruit and retain faculty and residents that represents the state of New Jersey, particularly those who are historically underrepresented. Recruit, retain, and develop senior administrative staff (faculty and non- faculty) that represents the state of New Jersey, particularly those who are historically underrepresented. Promote Inclusive Scholarship and Teaching Review and modify NJMS curriculum to promote an understanding of diversity and equity across all educational domains. Value and support research that advances an understanding of diversity, inclusion, equity, and social justice. Define Sustainable and S ubstantive Community Engagement Meaningfully engage our local community through mutually beneficial collaborations. Cultivate an understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion through community engaged service- learning initiatives beginning from pre -school and through all levels of education. Improve the health of the community through service and research projects that promote health equity. Build Capacity of Leaders to Create Inclusive Climates Equip NJMS leadership, faculty, and support staff to a ddress issues pertinent to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Promote an institutional culture that enables internal stakeholders (leadership, faculty, residents, students, and staff) to intervene respectfully when faced with instances of inequity. Devel op an Institutional Infrastructure to Drive Change Create a repository of institutional data aimed at measuring metrics related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Establish continuous quality improvement (CQI) pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclus ion metrics. Diversity Categories and Definitions While our school supports a diverse and inclusive environment, the diversity categories identified in the medical school's Strategic Plan that guide recruitment and retention activities for medical student s, faculty, and senior administrative staff include: Medical Students Faculty Senior Administrative Staff Black or African American Black or African American Black or African American Latino/Hispanic Latino/Hispanic Latino/Hispanic First generation college student and/or economically disadvantaged Women Women Women for Leadership Roles RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Policy Name: Students Rights, Responsibilities, and Disciplinary Procedures Approval Originally Issued: 06/07/1995 Revisions: 1/10/2010, 4/22/2013, 8/14/2020 1.

The responsibilities of faculty, staff and student members to make themselves available to participate when needed in the hearing process shall be established upon their appointment. b. Such rules shall, in the case of joint programs between Schools of the University and outside institutions, establish procedures to govern hearings affecting students in those programs. So long as principles of academic fairness are included, the procedure of either institution may be employed at the discretion of the Dean, considering such factors as which School has administrative responsibility for the student and which School awards the degree from the program. c. Such rules may contain a code of student rights and responsibilities, establishing rules of conduct and standards of personal and professional behavior. 2. Such rules will be available to students when adopted or amended through convenient means such as the Student Handbook. H. Jurisdiction 1. Action initiated under either academic or disciplinary procedures does not preclude subsequent or simultaneous action under the other or under the University's research misconduct procedures. 2. If a complaint alleging a disciplinary infraction is submitted to the Dean, the Dean may determine that the allegation warrants academic action instead of or in addition to the disciplinary procedure, and may forward the matter to the appropriate body for recommendations. The Dean may also ref er the student for an evaluation pursuant to University policy, Student Essential Functions. See EXHIBIT for a sample letter. 3. If a complaint alleging a disciplinary infraction during a student's enrollment or other participation in University activities i s submitted after the student has graduated or otherwise terminated the relationship with the University, the complaint may, at the Dean's discretion, be submitted to the Hearing Body in accordance with this policy and procedure.

Except for such reports and communications made pursuant to this policy, and to the extent permitted by FERPA and other applicable laws, all proceedings and deliberations conducted pursuant to this policy and procedure will be considered confidential and may not be released or disclosed by any participant without permission from all of the involved parties or without valid subpoena or court order. VI. EXHIBIT Sample letter: STUDENT REFERRED FOR EVALUATION AS PART OF DISCIPLINARY PROCESS EXHIBIT SAMPLE LETTER: STUDENT REFERRED FOR EVALUATION AS PART OF DISCIPLINARY PROCESS [Date] [Student Name and Address] Dear [Student]: Your well -being and safety are of great concern to me and your faculty. Because we are concerned about your well -being, and in light of recent incidents related to the current disciplinary process in which you are involved, you are being referred to [name of doctor/counselor/practice] for an evaluation to determine your fitness to continue as a student at the [Rutgers University - School]. This referral is being made after careful examination of information of concern presented through the disciplinary process. During the disciplinary hearing, the following incidents were related to the hearing body: A report by a faculty member of a recent statement you made during a heated debate with a fellow student over a class assignment. It was reported that you said \"if your lousy work influences my grade, you're going to regret it, something bad will happen to you.\" The faculty member who reported this statement was very upset by the remark and believed it to be serious. Earlier in the year, several students in your study group reported that you told them that if you did not do well this semester, you would hold them responsible and \"there would be trouble.\" When approached about this remark, you admitted making the statement, but insisted that it was a joke. On another occasion, you were interrupted by a school administrator while engaging in a loud, angry confrontation with a fellow student. Although you later apologized, the fellow student reported feeling threatened. The Rutgers University - [Name of School] Essential Functions for participation in courses includes the following requirement: \"E. Behavioral and Social Skills The student must demonstrate emotional stability with appropriate interpersonal relationships and communic ation skills. He/she must be able to exercise good judgment and sustain an attention level necessary to complete all responsibilities promptly; be attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and develop mature, sensitive, professional and effective relationships with patients/clients (in well and diseased states from every gender, socioeconomic status and cultural group) and health care workers. The student must be able to tolerate taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. He/she must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical setting. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, appropriate hygiene, appearance, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are required throughout the admissions and educational processes. A student whose behavior or performances raises questions concerning his or her ability to fulfill the essential functions may be required to obtain evaluation and/or testing by a health care provider designated by the School, and to provide the results to the Campus Student Health Service or Office of Disability Services for the purpose of determining whet her the student is fit to pursue the educational program. If the student is deemed fit to pursue the program, the School reserves the right to require actions recommended by the health care provider, including further testing, counseling, monitoring, leave of absence, etc.\" We are requiring that you submit to an evaluation that will assist us in determining your ability to safely participate in the School's educational program; this includes your continued clinical contact with patients in health care facilities and classroom participation. Please note that the results of this evaluation will be shared with my office and University officials, as may be deemed necessary, to help ensure your safety and well -being. Following the evaluation, if you wish to view the results, please contact me directly and I will arrange for you to review the results in the presence of an appropriate healthcare provider who will be available to assist with questions.

Who Should Read This Policy The policy covers all faculty, staff, and students within Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, School of Health Related Professions, Rutgers School of Dental Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Graduate School of Biomedical Sci ences, School of Public Health, and School of Nursing (former UMDNJ School of Nursing). 2. Related Documents (refer to policies.rutgers.edu for additional information) 3. The Policy A. The University is committed to a policy of non- discrimination against enrolled students and applicants to the University's educational programs who are otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities and otherwise qualified individuals with a relationship or association with a person with a disability, or otherwise qualified individuals with a record of a disability. B. The University will, if requested, provide reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified enrolled students and applicants wit h disabilities unless: (a) such accommodations impose an undue hardship to the institution, or (b) direct threats of substantial harm to the health and safety of others due to the disability cannot be eliminated by any reasonable accommodations available t hat would allow the student to perform the essential functions, or (c) such accommodations fundamentally alter the educational program or academic standards. Requests for accommodations must be made in accordance with each legacy UMDNJ School's accommodati ons policy and procedures and must be made in advance to allow appropriate time for evaluation. Accommodations, when approved, are applied prospectively and will not be made retroactively. C. Each legacy UMDNJ School/educational program shall define the essential functions of its curriculum with input from faculty and staff who are involved in developing and teaching the curriculum. Any changes to these essential functions shall be reviewed by the Offices of Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Disability Services for Students, and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs prior to adoption. D. Applicants for admission to educational programs, accepted students and enrolled students shall be fully informed of the essential functions by means of inclusion in application forms for admission, student catalogs, student handbooks and/or other student informational material. E. RBHS Schools shall not make any inquiries of applicants for admission regarding the existence, nature or severity of disabilities prior to acceptance, but may inquire about the ability of applicants to meet the published essential functions of the educational program, with or without reasonable accommodations. RBHS Schools may not require pre-acceptance medical histories or physical examinations, but may condition enrollment post-acceptance on the results of a medical history and physical examination to det ermine ability to perform the essential functions. F. Accepted applicants may be requested to acknowledge ability to meet the essential functions by signing the following (or equivalent) statement: \"I have read and understand the foregoing essential functions. If I require any accommodation in order to satisfy the functions, I agree to request accommodation promptly and understand that the RBHS School will evaluate the reasonableness of the accommodation before acting on the request.\" G. RBHS Schools may make inquiries of enrolled students as to disabilities and/or require medical examinations only if such inquiry or examination is related to the educational program and ability of the student to fulfill the essential functions of the educational program. If an enrolled student requests an accommodation because of a disability, information and documentation by health- care professionals may be requested of the student in order to make a determination of the student's ability to continue the educational program sat isfactorily, with or without reasonable accommodation. All medical records relating to students' disabilities will be kept confidential in a file separate from academic records. H. Each RBHS School/educational program shall develop specific policies and proc edures to ensure the initiation of an interactive process with: a. applicants with confirmed disabilities who request accommodation; b. enrolled students who have confirmed disabilities and request accommodation; and c. enrolled students who request evaluation for a disability and request accommodation. These policies and procedures shall be published annually in the RBHS School's official literature. I. Each RBHS School/educational program shall develop procedures to evaluate and document: a. whether a condition identified by an accepted applicant or enrolled student is recognized as a disability under state or federal law without regard to mitigating factors, such as prescribed medication or other auxiliary aids and/or services, that may ameli orate or eliminate the disability(ies); and b. whether an accepted applicant or enrolled student with a disability is otherwise qualified to satisfy the essential functions for completion of the educational program; and c. the reasonableness and feasibility of providing accommodations to otherwise qualified applicants or students with a disability as defined by state or federal law; and d. whether (and what) reasonable accommodations are available that would allow the otherwise qualified accepted applicant or enrolled student with a disability to fulfill the essential functions without a direct threat to the health or safety of others, without fundamentally altering the educational program or the essential functions or lowering academic st andards, and without creating undue hardship to the institution; and e. the implementation and monitoring of reasonable accommodations which have been approved for the enrolled student or accepted applicant. J. Each RBHS School/educational program shall identify the person(s) or office(s) in charge of implementing and interpreting the above- mentioned policies and procedures, and receiving, investigating and resolving student complaints concerning disabilities; this information shall be included in the School's publications. K. The Office of Disability Services for Students is an additional resource and source of advice to the RBHS Schools with regard to their responsibilities under ADA and other applicable state and federal laws. This Office is also responsible for educational and training activities under the ADA. It will develop and conduct training sessions as well as publish and circulate pertinent materials to inform new and current members of admissions committ ees concerning appropriate and inappropriate topics for interviews; and to educate student affairs administrators, faculty and appropriate others who interact with students concerning their responsibilities and obligations under the ADA. In addition, this Office will assist in evaluating the costs to the RBHS Schools for providing accommodations, as well as identify non- RBHS resources for obtaining assistance. L.

Policy Name: Student and Housestaff Ombuds at Revisions: 11/22/11, 04/17/13 1. Who Should Read This Policy All Rutgers University faculty, staff, and students within Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, School of Health Related Professio ns, Rutgers School of Dental Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Public Health, and School of Nursing (former UMDNJ School of Nursing). 2. Related Documents (refer to policies.rutgers.edu for additional information) 3. The Policy DEFINITIONS A. Student & Housestaff Ombuds are appointed by the Dean of each RBHS school as outlined in section 1. Student & Housestaff Ombuds' responsibilities are typically a collateral function assigned to a faculty or staff member, and focuses on providing Ombuds services to their school's students and housestaff. B. Ombuds refers to the schools' Student & Housestaff Ombuds. C. A visitor is a student or member of the housestaff who voluntarily communicates with their school's Student and Housestaff Ombuds, in order to express a concern, seek guidance, or impart information. D. A third party is a member of the University community who is contacted by an Ombuds, in order to obtain i nformation, or for the purpose of addressing a visitor's concern. E. Notice is a formal communication of a University -related issue or concern by a visitor or a third party to Rutgers through established formal channels. POLICY A. Each RBHS Dean shall designate an individual at his/her School as an Ombuds to serve as a resource for students and housestaff, and to guide them in the evaluation of options for resolving University - related concerns. Student & Housestaff Ombuds will be independent of the offices and individuals who have notice, compliance, regulatory, enforcement, adjudicatory and disciplinary functions with respect to students and housestaff. The Student & Housestaff Ombuds will have the ability to approach any individual within the School or University administration to facilitate problem resolution. B. The Student & Housestaff Ombuds will have a set term, which may be renewed by the Dean at the end of each term, and may be removed during any term only for good cause. C. The RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs is responsible for setting the minimum training and certification standards for all Student & Housestaff Ombuds. D. Confidentiality i. Except as noted in Sections VI.D.3. and VI.D.5., Ombuds hold all communic ations with those seeking assistance in strict confidence, and do not disclose confidential communications unless given express permission to do so by the visitor. ii. The University does not consider communications made to Student & Housestaff Ombuds, to be notice to the University or any of its Schools and component business units. Ombuds neither act as agents for their School or the University, nor do they accept noti ce on its behalf. However, Ombuds may refer visitors to the appropriate place where formal notice can be made. iii. Ombuds will disclose confidential information when there appears to be an imminent risk of serious harm to either an individual, property, or to the University, where there is no other reasonable option. Except in emergent situations, when disclosure is co ntemplated, Student & Housestaff Ombuds should first notify the RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for his/her concurrence. Except under emergent circumstances, the determination of whether this risk exists is to be made only by the RBHS Vice Chance llor for Academic Affairs at his/her discretion. Student & Housestaff Ombuds will also disclose confidential information when required to do so by law, after first receiving concurrence from the RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Visitors will be advised prior to disclosures being made under this section. Any such disclosures will be made in a manner and to the extent possible, of protecting the identity of the visitor. To prevent individuals from divulging information with an incomplete understandi ng of this possibility, the limitations on the confidentiality of communications to the Ombuds shall be clearly written, published, distributed and explained to students and housestaff before any consultation with an Ombuds. iv. When third parties are contact ed by an Ombuds, in order to obtain information or in furtherance of addressing a concern from an originating visitor, these communications too, will be kept confidential. v. Ombuds will not testify at any formal process within the University, and shall resist testifying in any formal process outside of the University. Confidential communications may be disclosed if a Student & Housestaff Ombuds is mandated to do so through court order or subpoena, and after first notifying the RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. In such instances, the University will vigorously seek to limit the scope of the disclosure. vi. Student & Housestaff Ombuds may maintain and provide their Dean, and senior management with demographic, statistical and trending data, so long as visitors' confidentiality is not compromised. Ombuds may identify trends, issues and concerns about policies and procedures, including potential future issues and concerns, without breaching confidentiality or anonymity, and provide recommendations for responsibly addressing them. The RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs will ensure consistency in data collection, and that the data collected adheres to the Ombuds' standards of practice. Written records or reports about specific i ndividuals or cases will not be maintained. vii. The decision to waive confidentiality, under Sections VI.D.3. and VI.D.5., belongs solely to the RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, rather than to any party at issue. Requests for Student & Housestaff Ombuds to waive confidentiality must be forwarded to the RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for concurrence. By taking advantage of the services offered by an Ombuds, visitors implicitly agree to also be bound by these rules of confidentiality. viii. Communications made under this subsection between Student & Housestaff Ombuds and the RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, relating to specific visitors or concerns, are not considered a disclosure of confidential information under this policy. ix. Members of the University community may not inquire about confidential communications made to or by an Ombuds. b. Neutrality/Impartiality i. Ombuds are designated neutrals, and thus remain unaligned and impartial, and should not engage in any situation which could create or give the appearance of a conflict of interest. 1. If a specific concern brought to a Student & Housestaff Ombuds relates to an individual who is in a supervisory/subordinate \"chain of command\" position, or is a member of the same department, the Student & Housestaff Ombuds must refer the visitor to the RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for a referral to another Student and Housestaff Ombuds who is not in a supervisory/subordinate \"chain of command\" position. 2. If a specific concern brought to a Student & Housestaff Ombuds relates to an individual with whom the Student & Housestaff Ombuds shares a professional or personal relationship and which may impact, or appear to impact, on the Student & Housestaff Ombuds neutrality, then that visitor should be referred to the school's alternate Student and Housestaff Ombuds, if one has been appointed, or to the Student and Housestaff Ombuds of another school. The RBHS Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs may be of help in making this referral. ii. Ombuds advocate for fair and equitably administered processes, and do not advocate on behalf of any individual, the School or University. iii. Ombuds have a responsibility to consider the legitimate concerns and interests of all the individuals affected by the matter under consideration, helping to develop a range of responsible options to resolve problems and facilitate discussion to identify the best option. They may provide students and housestaff with information on resources available within and outside of the University, clarify policies and procedures, and serve as a neutr al informal conflict resolution office. Ombuds will not advocate for the exercise of a particular option. That decision remains solely with the individuals involved. iv. Ombuds may bring to management's attention those policies and procedures that are inherently unfair, or are applied in an unfair manner, or may be failing to accomplish what was intended. Ombuds may suggest (but not mandate or implement) corrective action. c. Indivi dual's Responsibility to Report This policy does not diminish an individual's responsibility to report illegal or wrongful conduct under the University or School's Code of Conduct/Honor Code, or as specified under University policies, such as: Student Rig hts, Responsibilities & Disciplinary Procedures. d. Protection Against Retaliation The University strictly prohibits retaliation against any member of the University community, including students and housestaff, because they have communicated with an Ombuds. All allegations of retaliation should be reported to the Ethics & Compliance Helpline. E. EXHIBIT What Ombuds Offices DO; What Ombuds Offices DO NOT DO EXHIBIT What Ombuds Offices DO; What Ombuds Offices DO NOT DO Adapted from information provided by the International Ombudsmans Association What Ombuds Offices DO: Listen and discuss questions, concerns, and complaints Help evaluate various options to address concerns Answer questions or help find others who can Explain University policies and procedures Facilitate communication between people Advise individuals about steps to resolve problems informally Advise individuals about formal and administrative options Mediate disputes to seek \"win-win\" resolution of problems Make appropriate referrals when informal options do not work Point out patterns of problems/complaints to administrators Suggest to administrators changes to policies and procedures What Ombuds Offices DO NOT DO: Participate in formal grievance processes Serves as an \"agent of notice\" for the School or University Make administrative decisions for administrators Reverse administrative decisions or findings Conduct formal investigations Determine \"guilt\" or \"innocence\" of those accused of wrong- doing Assign sanctions to individuals Maintain permanent records, notes, or reports identifiable to specific visitors Policy Name: Student Accident and Health Insurance Approval Authority: RBHS Chancellor Originally Issued: 07/01/87 Revisions: 05/17/12, 04/17/13 1.

Policy Name: Student Use of Personally Owned Mobile Communication Devices/Recording Devices Approval Authority: RBHS Chancellor Originally Issued: Revisions: 6/20/2013 1. Who Should Read This Policy All Rutgers University students within Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, School of Health Related Professions, Rutgers School of Dental Medicine, New Jersey Medical School, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Public Health, and School of Nursing (former UMDNJ School of Nursing). 2. Related Documents (refer to policies.rutgers.edu and http://uhr.rutgers.edu/policies - resources/policies- procedures for additional information) A. Rights & Responsibilities for the Use of University -Accessed Electronic Information Systems B. Issuance and Use of Mobile Communications Devices 3. The Policy DEFINITIONS A. Mobile Communication device is defined as any Cell Phone, Pager, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), MP3 player, headphone, Bluetooth device, or any other wireless device that could be used to access the Rutgers network. B. Recording device is defined as any device used to record or intercept any wire, electronic, oral or visual communication, to include, but not limited to, mobile communication devices, including those with picture messaging, tape recordings, other photo devices and the transmission of images through e- mail systems. BACKGROUND The use of personal mobile communication devices and other electronic devices has expanded rapidly. The University does not wish to unreasonably constrain the use of these devices; however, it has a broader responsibility to: (1) ensure that they are used in an appropriate manner; (2) ensure the integrity of proprietary information; (3) preserve the privacy of employees and students, and (4) ensure that unauthorized surveillance does not breach the reasonable expectation of privacy in the learning environment. POLICY A Mobile Communication Devices - Students are required to exercise discretion and restrict the use of personal mobile communication devices, in any educational setting to the extent required by the facility in which the educational experience takes place and in accordance with this policy. B Recording Devices - As a general rule, recording devices and camera- equipped devices (including mobile communication devices) and their uses are restricted in accordance with state and federal regulatory guidelines concerning unauthorized surveillance. Students shall not use the picture- taking functionality of mobile communication devices in the educational setting, unless specifically authorized to do so. Unauthorized use of cameras at any University -owned facility, including designated research areas, restrooms, or exercise areas without the express written consent of the department manager is not allowed. C. Recording Conversations - It is expected that students will respect the privacy of other individuals in the educational setting, and that secret recording of individuals without their knowle dge is not compatible with the mission of universities to foster an open exchange of ideas. While realizing that recordings may serve many legitimate academic purposes, the University does not condone recording of individuals who are unaware that such recordings are being made. In order to promote an environment of trust and collegial academic sharing, the University expects that any recording will be done only with the prior consent of the parties involved. Covert/secret recording of any conversation or meeting occurring at the educational setting, including any classroom or other educational experience, or conversations or meetings offsite that deal with educational matters of official concern is prohibited. Examples of such conversations or meetings are discussions with a counselor or investigator, student counseling sessions, student advisement sessions, grade appeals, disciplinary hearings, etc. Students are also prohibited from arranging for others to do any recording of conversations , phone calls or other educational activities, unless specifically permitted by the University. D. In compliance with the privacy regulations contained in the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA), visual and recording devices shall not b e used in patient care areas. F. The University shall not be liable for the loss or damage of personal cell phones, multimedia devices or other recording devices brought into the educational setting. G. Failure to comply with the provisions of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from an academic program, depending on the severity of the infraction. Procedures for Adjudicating Alleged Violations of Academic Integrity in RBHS Schools I. Academic Integrity Procedural Requirements for RBHS Schools A.

Students may be accompanied by a non- attorney advocate during the hearing to consult privately with the student and, at the student's request, to present a final statement on the student's behalf. No other participation by the advocate is permitted. (d) The burden of proof shall rest with the complainant. The standard of proof shall be the preponderance of the evidence standard (i.e., it is more likely than not that the student committed the offense). (e) The Chair of the Hearing Body shall rule on all procedural matters in accordance with this policy, with the procedural rules of the School, and with generally accepted terms of academic fairness.

Examples of possible disciplinary actions include, but are not limited to: Dismissal of charges: dismissal of the complaint and removal of the complaint from University records. Reprimand: a written statement by the Dean to the student involved, with a copy of the letter placed in the student's file. Probation: a specific period of time dur ing which conditions may be placed on the student's enrollment, and the student's academic achievement and/or conduct monitored by the School; findings by the Hearing Body of additional disciplinary infractions during this period will result in the dismiss al of the student. Suspension: a specific period during which the student is barred from enrollment. Dismissal: the severing of the affiliation between the student and the School. Withholding of degree or certificate: temporary or permanent withholding of degree or certificate. Degree or certificate revocation. vii. that the Hearing Body recommendations are supported by no less than a majority vote of the members hearing the matter. (f) All notices and correspondence to an accused student shall be sent certified mail, return receipt requested, or by another method providing confirmation of delivery, and such receipts or confirmations shall be retained by the School. (g) The student may seek the advice of faculty or students who are not involved in the matter in question and who do not hold an administrative position in the School constituting a potential conflict of interest. Following the Dean's submission of the matter to the Hearing Body, neither School nor other Rutgers University administrative officers, faculty, staff or representative may advise an accused student or his/her representative in any matter relating to the disciplinary action, except for an explanation of the procedures to be followed. Administrative officers whose p ositions may constitute a conflict of interest may not advise an accused student in any matter pertaining to the alleged infraction. The Dean may designate an administrative officer to participate in the hearing in order to present testimony or materials on behalf of the School. E. Within five (5) working days of receipt of the Hearing Body's recommendation, any party may submit written exceptions to the Dean. F. The Dean may review any education records of involved students, seek information, and consult with any other party, including the student, complainant, and members of the Hearing Body. Except in extraordinary circumstances (notice of which shall be provided by the Dean to the accused student and the complainant), the Dean or his/her designee shall, within thirty (30) working days of the last submission by any party of written exceptions by any party, render a final decision on disciplinary action to be taken and shall provide written copies of the decision to the student, the complainant, and Hearing Body members. The Dean's decision shall be rendered earlier if the accused student is expected to graduate before the expiration of this thirty working day period. G. Within five (5) working days of receipt of the Dean's decision, the accused student may submit a written appeal to the RBHS Chancellor. RBHS Chancellor may, at his or her discretion, review any education records of involved students and seek information and consult with any other party, including the student, complainant, members of the Hearing Body, and the Dean. Except in extraordinary circumstances, (notice of which shall be provided by the Dean to the accused student and the complainant) the RBHS Chancellor shall, within thirty (30) working days, render a non- appealable written decision and shall provide written copies of the decision to the student, the complainant (other than another student), Hearing Body members and the Dean. Such a decision shall be rendered earlier if the accused student is expected to gr aduate before the expiration of this thirty working day period. H. The School shall retain all records, notices, correspondence, tapes, and transcripts pertaining to any action taken pursuant to this policy for a period of seven (7) years following the concl usion of the action. I. The Office of Senior Vice President and General Counsel may advise the Hearing Body and any administrative officer on the interpretation of this policy and any other legal or procedural question at any time, except that no legal couns el shall be present during the taking of testimony by the Hearing Body. J. There shall be no action taken to suspend or expel a student from school prior to completion of these disciplinary hearing procedures, unless, in the judgment of the Dean or his/her designee, the continued presence of the student poses a substantial and immediate danger to the welfare or safety of any person or property. The Dean may, in such cases, take action to prevent harm prior to and during the conduct of a hearing; the Hearing B ody shall convene as rapidly as possible to render recommendations. A student suspended in this manner shall be given an opportunity to appear personally before the Dean or his/her designee to discuss the alleged misconduct and whether the student's continued presence poses a substantial and immediate danger to himself/herself, to others, and/or to property. Alternatively, action may be taken pursuant to the University policy Student Involuntary Leave of Absence and Involuntary Withdrawal . K. Delays in any time period requirements in disciplinary procedures may be made by written agreement by the accused and the Dean or his/her designee, and, in the case of a matter before a Hearing Body, by the Chair of the Hearing Body. II. Specific School Rules for Disciplinary Procedures A. Each School shall adopt procedural rules to govern the conduct of disciplinary hearings in conformity with Section V of the University Policy Document governing these procedures and with the specific needs of the School. a. Such rules shall establish the number (which shall be no less than three individuals), term and manner of appointment of Hearing Body members, alternates, and the Chair. The responsibilities of faculty, staff, and student members to make themselves available to participate when needed in the hearing process shall be established upon their appointment. b. Such rules shall, in the case of joint programs between Schools of the University and outside institutions, establish procedures to govern hearings affecting students in those programs. So long as principles of academic fairness are included, the procedure of eit her institution may be employed at the discretion of the Dean, considering such factors as which School has administrative responsibility for the student and which School awards the degree from the program. c. Such rules may contain a code of student rights and responsibilities, establishing rules of conduct and standards of personal and professional behavior. B. Such rules will be available to students when adopted or amended through convenient means such as the Student Handbook. III. Jurisdiction A. Action initiated under either academic or disciplinary procedures does notpreclude subsequent or simultaneous action under the other or under the University's research misconduct procedures. B. If a complaint alleging a disciplinary infraction is submitted to the Dean, the Dean may determine that the allegation warrants academic action instead of or in addition to the disciplinary procedure and may forward the matter to the appropriate body for recommendations. The Dean may also refer the student for an evaluation pursuant to University policy Student Essential Functions . C. If a complaint alleging a disciplinary infraction during a student's enrollment or other participation in University activities is submitted after the student has graduated or other wise terminated the relationship with the University, the complaint may, at the Dean's discretion, be submitted to the Hearing Body in accordance with this policy and procedure. Revocation of a degree or certificate may be recommended by the Hearing Body t o the Dean.

Definitions A. Discrimination is defined as an intentional or unintentional act which adversely affects employment or educational opportunities on the basis of membership in one or more protected classes. Rutgers provides equal employment opportunity to all its employees and applicants for employment regardless of their race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, gender identity and expression, disability, genetic information, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, marital status, civ il union status, domestic partnership status, military service, veteran status, and any other category protected by law. Rutgers considers as a basis for selection in employment only those characteristics which are demonstrably related to job performance or requirements. B. Harassment is conduct directed toward an individual or group based on membership in one or more protected classes. Such conduct must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter an individual's employment conditions, or a student's educational opportunities1 which, in turn, creates an unreasonably intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment for employment, education, or participation in University activities. 1. A person does not have to be the direct and immediate target of harassment to complain about it. Harassing behavior toward others may be so offensive, demeaning, or disruptive as to constitute a hostile work or academic environment, though not specifically directed at the observer or individual lodging the complaint. A single, isolated incident of harassment may, based on the facts and circumstances, create a hostile environment. Conduct alleged to constitute harassment will be evaluated according to the objective standard of a reasonable person. 2. Sexual Harassment includes any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other unwelcome written, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: i. submission to such conduct is made, explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's education, employment, or participation in a University activity; ii. submission to, or rejection of, such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for decisions affecting that individual's academic standing, employment status, or participation in a University activity; or iii. such conduct is severe or pervasive enough to unreasonably interfere with an individual's academic or work performance or participation is a University activity, or to create an intimidating, hostile, or abusive work or educational environment. Sexual harassment may be committed by anyone regardless of gender identity and may occur between members of the same or different sexes. Further, harassment based on a person's sex is not limited to instances involving sexual behavior. That is, harassment on the basis of sex may occur without sexual advances or sexual overtones when conduct is directed at individuals or groups because of their sex. This is often referred to as sex or gender harassment, and such conduct violates this Policy. 3. Examples of conduct that may constitute or support a finding of harassment in violation of this Policy include, but are not limited to, the following types of behavior: PHYSICAL CONDUCT a. Unnecessary or unwanted physical contact b. Blocking someone's path or impeding movement c. Physical interference with work d. Physical assault e. Deliberate destruction of property NON- VERBAL CONDUCT a. Display of offensive material or objects b. Suggestive or insulting gestures, sounds, or whistles VERBAL CONDUCT a. In some instances, innuendo or other suggestive, offensive, or derogatory comments or jokes about sex or a protected group listed in Section I b. Extortion, overt threats, or intimidation c. Obscene or harassing messages sent via computer or left on an answering machine or voice mail 1 A student's educational opportunities refer to his or her learning environment (academic performance and/or academic opportunities), living environment (campus housing accommodations), and ability to participate in activities made available by Rutgers. 6. The Policy I. POLICY Rutgers University is committed to a working and learning environment for all faculty, staff and students that is free from discrimination and harassment. The University strictly prohibits discrimination and harassment based on membership in certain enumerated protected classes (\"protected classes\"). These classes are race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, gender identity and expression, di sability, genetic information, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, military service, veteran status, and any other category protected by law. Harassment is a form of discrimination a nd, therefore, harassment directed toward an individual or group, or experienced by an individual or group, based on membership in a protected class, also violates University policy. Discrimination and harassment compromise the integrity of the University and unfairly interfere with the opportunity for all persons to fully participate in the academic, work, and living environment at Rutgers. The University recognizes the human dignity of each member of the Rutgers community and believes that each member has a responsibility to promote respect and dignity for others so that all employees and students are free to pursue their educational and work goals in an open environment, participate in the free exchange of ideas, and share equally in the University's employment and educational opportunities. To achieve this end, the University strives to foster an academic, work, and living environment that is free from discrimination and harassment on the basis of membership in the protected classes referenced above. At the same time, the University is committed to the principles of academic freedom and believes that vigorous discussion and debate, as well as free inquiry and free expression, are an integral part of the University community. 2 II. SCOPE This Policy will ap ply to complaints of discrimination and harassment including certain forms of sexual misconduct, as defined above, except as specifically excluded below. This Policy applies to all areas of University operations and programs, including the conduct of all U niversity employees and student employees that arises out of their employment status, as well as to the conduct of all interns, volunteers, vendors, contractors, subcontractors, and others who do business with the University. A. Sexual Harassment Prohibited by Title IX Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. This includes certain forms of sexual harassment and sexual violence that interfere with a person's equal access to the University's educational programs and activities. Related federal regulations mandate a speci fic grievance process that the University must follow in cases in which sexual harassment prohibited by Title IX is alleged. The Title IX Policy and Grievance Procedures, Policy 60.1.33 the forms of sexual harassment that are prohibited by Title IX (\"Covered Sexual Harassment\") and describes the ways in which Rutgers will respond to reported instances of Covered Sexual Harassment, as required by law. As discussed in further detail in the Ti tle IX Policy, Covered Sexual Harassment includes: 2Depending on the nature of the alleged misconduct, claims of sexual harassment made against University employees or third parties may be covered by this Policy or the Title IX Policy. All policies are subject to amendment. Please refer to the Rutgers University Policy Library website (policies.rutgers.edu ) for the official, most recent version. 1. An employee conditioning education benefits on participation in unwelcome sexual conduct (i.e., \"quid pro quo\" harassment); 2. Unwelcome conduct that a reasonable person would determine is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the University's education program or activity; 3. Sexual assault; 4. Dating violence; 5. Domestic violence; and 6. Stalking In order for the Title IX Policy to apply, the alleged conduct must: (i) meet the definition of Covered Sexual Harassment; (ii) have occurred in the United States; and (iii) have occurred in a Rutgers education program or activity (which may include conduct that occurs in the workplace or in the course of performing one's job duties at Rutgers). The Title IX Policy applies in all cases that meet these parameters, regardless of whether the parties to the complaint are students, employees (faculty and staff) or third parties. Allegations of sexual harassment that fall within the scope of the Title IX Policy must be handled in accordance w ith the Title IX Policy and are excluded from the scope of this Policy (the Discrimination Policy). However, this Policy utilizes a broader definition of sexual harassment than the Title IX Policy, set forth above, consistent with other State and federal l aws that also prohibit sexual harassment. Therefore, complaints of sexual harassment alleged to have been committed by employees or third parties that do not fall within the scope of the Title IX Policy may still be investigated under this Policy. All reports and complaints of alleged sexual harassment will be evaluated by the Director of the Office of Employment Equity (the Title IX Coordinator for Employees) to determine whether the alleged conduct falls within the scope of the Title IX Policy. If some or all of the reported conduct falls within the scope of the Title IX Policy, such allegations will be handled in accordance with the Title IX Policy. If not, the Director will determine whether the alleged conduct, if true, would constitute prohibit ed sexual harassment under this Policy, and, if so, proceed in accordance with the Discrimination, Harassment, Workplace Violence, and Ret aliation Complaint Process: Complaints Against University Employees and Third Parties (\"Complaint Process\") .3 III. DESIGNATION OF UNIVERSITY OFFICES AND EMPLOYEES Throughout this Policy, the University office and/or employee(s) who will typically perform certain roles or duties are identified. However, the University may designate other University offices or employees to perform any roles or duties described in this Policy where necessary to effectuate this Policy. IV. ROMANTIC, DATING, INTIMATE AND/OR SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS Romantic , dating, intimate, and/or sexual relationships that occur in the student -teacher context or in the context of employment supervision or evaluation present special problems. These types of relationships are especially vulnerable to exploitation due to the difference in power and the respect and trust that are often present between a teacher and a student, a 3 Note that if the Complaint is initially filed under the Title IX Policy, but is determined by the Title IX Coordinator not to meet any of the elements set forth above, the dismissal procedures set forth in the Title IX Policy will apply, and the matter may be referred for review under this Policy. supervisor and a subord inate, or a senior and junior colleague in the same unit. As a result of this power differential, a student or subordinate's \"voluntary\" participation in a romantic, dating, intimate and/or sexual relationship with an individual in a position of power or a uthority does not alone demonstrate that the conduct was welcome. The attempts of a teacher to show a romantic interest in a student may constitute sexual harassment. Similarly, a supervisor's display of a romantic interest in a subordinate may constitute sexual harassment. University Policy 60.1.32: Policy on Consensual Relationships in Academic Settings prohibits certain consensual relationships involving students and sets forth the requi red procedures employees must follow to report certain relationships and avoid/eliminate any related conflicts of interest. In addition, the University also strongly discourages romantic, dating, intimate and/or sexual relationships between University emp loyees where there is an imbalance of power because one individual is in a position to make decisions which may affect the educational opportunities, employment or career of the other. These relationships include supervisor/subordinate relationships and any other relationships between individuals wherein one individual has the power to make decisions that may have an impact, either direct or indirect, on the employment, career or educational opportunities of the other. Employees in romantic, dating, intimate and/or sexual relationships must recuse themselves from decisions that may have a direct or indirect impact on the employee with whom they are in a relationship. Those who fail to do so and/or abuse their power in such circumstances may be found to have violated this Policy. An abuse of power may be, but is not limited to, promising an employee a promotion, or providing preferential academic or employment opportunities to an individual based on a romantic, dating, intimate and/or sexual relationship. Any individual who engages in a romantic, dating, intimate and/or sexual relationship with someone over whom he or she has supervisory responsibility must inform his or her immediate supervisor of the relationship, so that the University can take action to make changes that eliminate the conflict of interest. If the University determines it is unable to eliminate the conflict of interest in a relationship between employees, the employees will be provided with the opportunity to decide which of the two will resign their employment. Failure to give proper notice to the appropriate supervisor may result in disciplinary action and/or the denial of legal representation and indemnification in the event that a lawsuit based on the relationship is filed. V. ACADEMIC FREEDOM The classroom and other instructional settings ( e.g., studio, laboratory) present special problems because academic freedom protects the expression of ideas, even when the idea or its expression may be perceived to be offensive, if conduct or statements which are the subject of a complaint are germane to the subject matter taught. The educational process is predicated upon the free exchange of ideas, and this Policy shall not be interpreted to prohibit free expression protected by the First Amendment. The National American Association of University Professor's (AAUP) Statement on Professional Ethics provides that professors should avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure provides that Professors should not introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject. Accordingly, if conduct or statements which are the subject of a complaint occur in an instructional context and are germane to the subject matter being taught, wide latitude is required for professional judgment in determining the appropriate content and presentation of the academic material being taught. Therefore, harassment in violation of this Policy wi ll not be found to exist in an instructional setting unless the conduct or statements which are the subject of a complaint are not germane to the subject matter taught and: are directed toward an individual or group based on one or more of the protected classes listed in Section I above; are sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter an individual's educational environment; create an objectively hostile learning environment; and are, in fact, perceived as hostile by the complainant. VI. REPORTING DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT Any member of the University community alleging discrimination or harassment on the basis of membership in any of the protected classes is encouraged to report it immediately to the Office of Employment Equity.4 University supervisors and managers are required to inform the Office of Employment Equity of any reported conduct prohibited by this Policy involving other employees. This means that these individuals are required to report all relevant details, including the names of the individual who made the report, the alleged victim, the alleged Respondent, any witnesses, and other known relevant facts. One does not have to be the direct target of the discrimination or harassment to report it. Complaints against stude nts, arising out of their conduct as students, are addressed by University Policy 10.2.11: Code of Student Conduct and the RBHS Students Rights, Responsibilities, and Disciplinary Procedures Policy.5 Any individual who believes that he or she has been the victim of a crime (including but not limited to forced physical contact and/or sexual violence) also has a right, and is encouraged, to report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Questions about law enforcement assistance and involvement may be directed to the Chief of Police at Rutgers University -New Brunswick, Rutgers University -Newark, and Rutgers University -Camden. The University is committed to responding to reports and complaints of discrimination and harassment promptly, fairly, and with sensitivity, as outlined in the Discrimination, Harassment, Workplace Violence, Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation Complaint Process: Complaints Against University Employees and Third Parties (\"Complaint Process\") .6 Upon completion of the Complaint Process, the University will take appropriate corrective action consistent with the results of the investigation. Sanctions may include discipline up to and including termination of employment, consistent with the terms of all University Policies concerning personnel actions and the terms of all applicable collective negotiations agreements. In addition to any sanction, the University may also recommend training, counseling or other support services to the Respondent. 7 The University will maintain confidentiality as to discrimination and harassment complaints, and the investigation of those complaints, to the extent possible. Only those who have a need to know will be told the identity of the parties to a complaint. In some instances, a complainant may choose to take no action (including f iling a formal complaint) or to defer action until a later date in order to maintain anonymity. In these instances, the University reserves the right to determine whether it is necessary to initiate a 4 The Director of the Office of Employment Equity supervises the operation of the Discrimination, Harassment, Workplace Violence, Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation Complaint Process: Complaints Against University Employees and Third Parties . The Office is also a resource for all members of the University community, and is responsible for arranging education and training for the community regarding the Policy and the Complaint Process. Contact information for the Director is 848- 932-3973 or employmentequity@hr.rutgers.edu. 5 Additional information about complaints against students can be found at http://studentconduct.rutgers.edu/ or by contacting the Office of Student Conduct, which responds to such complaints, and can be reached at 732- 932-9414 orconduct@echo.rutgers.edu. 6 Available at https://uhr.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/userfiles/DiscriminationHarassmentComplaintProcess.pdf http://uhr.rutgers.edu/policies -resources/policies -procedures/policy -and-compliance- guidelines/discrimination-and . 7 Complaints of discrimination or harassment against vendors, contractors, subcontractors, and others who do business with the University will be handled by the Director of the Office of Employment Equity. University Action and investigate the reported conduct in order to protect the University community. The Director of the Office of Employment Equity will consider various factors in this assessment, such as the availability of independent evidence of the allegations, the nature of the allegations and/or whether there have been similar complaints about the same Respondent. If the Director initiates a University Action, the Director will notify the Complainant, but the Complainant will not be required to participate in the process. VII. RETALIATION The University prohibits retaliation against individuals who, in good faith, assert their rights to bring a complaint of discrimination or harassment as defined in this Policy, participate in a discrimination or harassment investigation, or protest the alleged discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. No person may intimidate, t hreaten, coerce or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege under this Policy. Retaliation is an offense separate from the original complaint of discrimination, and will be considered independently from the merits of the underlying complaint. Individuals who believe they have been subjected to retaliation should report the conduct to the Office of Employment Equity. VIII. FALSE STATEMENTS All parties and witnesses to a complaint and/or investigation are prohibited from knowingly making false statements and from knowingly submitting false information during the complaint and investigation process. Knowingly making a false statement or knowingly submitting false information may subject the party or witness to discipline. Anyone who believes that he or she has been the subject of a false complaint may meet with the Director of the Office of Employment Equity to discuss the allegations. The filing of a complaint that does not result in a finding of prohibited conduct is not alone evidence of the intent to file a false complaint.

Policy Statement Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, is committed to fostering an environment that is safe and secure and free from sexual and gender -based discrimination and harassment, sexual violence, dating and domestic violence, stalking and other related mis conduct. The University recognizes its responsibility to increase awareness of such misconduct, prevent its occurrence, support victims, deal fairly and firmly with alleged offenders, and diligently investigate reports of misconduct. In addressing these is sues, all members of the University must come together to respect and care for one another in a manner consistent with our deeply held academic and community values. This Policy sets forth how the University defines and addresses sexual and gender -based harassment, sexual violence, stalking and relationship violence and related complaints made against University employees, student employees and third parties doing business with the University. 2. Reason for Policy To foster a safe and non- discriminatory University environment and comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (\"VAWA\") and other applicable laws. This policy specifically addresses sexual and gender -based discrimination and harassment. The University also prohibits other forms of discrimination and harassment covered by Policy 60.1.12, the Policy Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment . Depending on the nature of the allegations, additional University policies may also be implicated. The Office of Employment Equity and/or the Respondent's Department will determine whether potential violations of other policies will also be investigated based on the allegations contained ina complaint. As a general matter, the Office of Employment Equity will also conduct investigations into violations of the Policy Prohibiting Discrimination a nd Harassment, (60.1.12) and the Policy Prohibiting Workplace Violence (60.1.13) , and, where a complaint or report implicates those policies in addition to this Policy, the Office of Employment Equity may simultaneously investigate whether violations of multiple policies have occurred. 3.

POLICY This policy applies to conduct committed by University employees and third parties and prohibits a broad range of behaviors focused on sex and/or gender that may or may not be sexual in nature. Sexual harassment, sexual violence, sexual exploitation, gender -based harassment, stalking, and relationship violence (including dating and domestic violence) are all forms of misconduct that are prohibited by this Policy and will not be tolerated by the University. The University is committed to fostering an environment that is safe and secure and free from sexual and gender -based discrimination and harassment, sexual violence, dating and domestic violence, stalking and other related misconduct. The University recognizes its responsibility to increase awareness of such misconduct, prevent its occurrence, support victims, deal fairly and firmly with offenders, and diligently investigate reports of misconduct. In addressing these issues, all members of the University must come together to respect and care for one another in a manner consistent with our deeply held academic and community values.1 II. SCOPE This Policy governs sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, gender -based harassment, stalking, relationship violence (including dating and domestic violence), and related misconduct allegedly committed by a current Rutgers University employee (including faculty, staff, and student employees) and/or third parties (such as interns, volunteers, vendors, contractors, and subcontractors) that either: Occurs on any University campus or property, or in connection with any University program(s) or activity(ies); Creates a hostile environment for University employees or University students; or Involves a complaint by a University employee or Universit y student arising out of the Respondent's employment status with the University or third party's business or relationship with the University. A. Complaint Parties Throughout this Policy \"Complainant\" refers to the person making the allegation(s) of prohibited conduct and \"Respondent\" refers to the person alleged to have committed the prohibited conduct. When the Complainant is someone other than the victim of the alleged conduct, the victim also will be deemed the Complainant for pur poses of the rights and options available under this Policy. B. Complaints Against Students If the Respondent is a University student, acting in his or her capacity as a student, please refer to the Student Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence, Relationship Violence, Stalking, and Related Misconduct . C. Designation of University Offices and Employees Throughout this Policy, the University office and/or employe e(s) who will typically perform certain roles or duties are identified. However, the University may designate other University offices or employees to perform any roles or duties described in this Policy where necessary to effectuate this Policy. III. PROHIBIT ED CONDUCT This Policy prohibits the following conduct, as well as attempts to commit and/or aiding or inciting others to commit these acts. Please note that these definitions are behavioral definitions, not legal or criminal definitions. Definitions of c riminal violations can be found in the University's annual Safety Matters Report . A. Sexual Harassment. Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other unwelcome written, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: submission to such conduct is made, explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's education, employment, or participation in a University activity; 1 For additional information on discrimination and harassment based on other protected categories, see Policy Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment, 60.1.12; Code of Student Conduct, 10.2.11; Academic Freedom Policy, 60.5.1; Workplace Violence Policy, 60.1.1; RBHS Students Rights, Responsibilities and Disciplinary Procedures. Policies are linked in the Related Documents section on Page 1. submission to, or rejection of, such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for decisions affecting that indivi dual's academic standing, employment status, or participation in a University activity; or such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic or work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for that individual's employment, education, or participation in a University activity. Sexual harassment may be committed by anyone regardless of gender identity and may occur between members of the same or opposite sex. A \"hostile environment\" exists when unwelcome conduct of a sexual or gender -based nature has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic or work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for that individual's employment, education, living environment or participation in a University activity. A person does not have to be the target of harassment to complain about it. Harassing behavior toward others may be so offensive, demeaning, or disruptive as to constitute a hostile work or academic environment, even if the harassment is not specifically directed at the observer or individual lodging the complaint. Alleged harassment will be evaluated according to the objective standard of a reasonable person. A single, isolated incident of sexual or gender - based harassment may, based on the facts and circumstances, create a hostile environment. B. Gender -based Harassment. Gender -based harassment refers to acts of aggression, intimidation, stalking, or h ostility based on gender, gender identity, or gender -stereotyping. Gender -based harassment can occur if individuals are harassed either for exhibiting what is perceived as a stereotypical characteristic of their sex, or for failing to conform to stereotypi cal notions of masculinity or femininity. To constitute harassment, the conduct must unreasonably interfere with an individual's employment, education, or participation in a University activity, or create an unreasonably intimidating, hostile, demeaning or offensive work, academic, or living environment. C. Sexual Intimidation. Sexual intimidation refers to threatening behavior of a sexual nature directed at another person or group that reasonably leads the target(s) to fear for their physical well-being or t o engage in sexual conduct for self -protection. Examples of sexual intimidation are threatening to sexually assault another person or engaging in indecent exposure. D. Sexual Exploitation. Sexual exploitation refers to non -consensual abuse or exploitation of another person's sexuality for the purpose of sexual gratification, financial gain, personal benefit or advantage, or any other non- legitimate purpose. Examples of sexual exploitation include, but are not limited to: observing another individual's nudity or sexual activity or allowing another to observe nudity or sexual activity without the knowledge and consent of all participants; non-consensual streaming of images, photography, video or audio recording of sexual activity or n udity, or distribution of such without the knowledge and consent of all participants; exposing one's genitals in non- consensual circumstances; or inducing incapacitation for the purpose of making another person vulnerable to non- consensual sexual activity. E. Sexual Assault or Non -Consensual Sexual Contact. Sexual assault or non- consensual2 sexual contact refers to any one or more of the following acts: 2 In matters arising under this Policy in which a party's consent to sexual contact is at issu e, the definition of \"consent\" set forth in Policy 10.3.12, Student Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence, Relationship Violence, Stalking, and Related Misconduct , shall apply . Touching of an unwilling or non-consenting person's intimate parts (such as genitalia, groin, breast, buttocks, or mouth under or over a person's clothes). Touching an unwilling person or non- consenting person with one's own intimate parts. Forcing an unwilling person to touch another's intimate parts. Pene trating an unwilling person orally, anally, or vaginally with any object or body part. This includes, but is not limited to, penetration of a bodily opening without consent, through the use of coercion, or through exploitation of another's inabil ity to give consent. Penetrating an unwilling person orally, anally, or vaginally with any object or body part by use of force, threat, and/or intimidation. F. Relationship Violence. Relationship violence refers to any act of physical, sexual, and/or psychological harm against an individual by a current or former intimate or romantic partner, or by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common. Intimate or romantic partners may be dating, cohabitating, married, separated or divorced, and may b e of the same or different sex. Dating violence and domestic violence are both considered \"relationship violence\" under this Policy. G. Stalking. Stalking refers to any course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to b e fearful of serious harm or danger to themselves or to individuals close to them. Examples of stalking include non-consensual communication and physical contact; following or pursuing the other person; waiting or showing up at locations visited by the other person; spying on a person; trespassing; vandalism; gathering of information about a person from others; or manipulating and controlling behaviors such as threats to harm oneself or threats to harm someone close to the victim. H. Retaliation. Retaliation refers to any act of intimidation against individuals who, in good faith, assert their rights to bring a complaint under this Policy, including individuals who file a third- person report, or participate in an investigation, or pro test the alleged conduct or retaliation. Retaliation can take many forms, including sustained abuse or violence, threats, and intimidation. Any individual or group of individuals, not just a Respondent or Complainant, can be responsible for retaliation. Retaliation is considered a separate offense from the original complaint, and will be considered independently from the merits of the underlying complaint. Individuals who believe they have been subjected to retaliation should report the conduct to the Office of Employment Equity. IV. ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES Sexual relationships that occur in the student -teacher context or in the context of employment supervision or evaluation present special problems. These types of sexual relationships are especially vulnerable to exploitation due to the difference in power and the respect and trust that are often present between a teacher and a student, a supervisor and a subordinate, or a senior and junior colleague in the same unit. Ther efore, the University strongly discourages sexual relationships between individuals where there is an imbalance of power where one individual is in a position to make decisions which may affect the educational opportunities or standing or employment or car eer of the other. A student or a subordinate's \"voluntary\" participation in a sexual relationship with an individual in a position of power or authority does not alone demonstrate that the conduct was welcome. Therefore, the attempts of a teacher to show a romantic interest in a student may constitute sexual harassment. Similarly, a supervisor's display of a romantic interest in a subordinate may constitute sexual harassment. Employees in romantic relationships must recuse themselves from decision making when the decisions at issue may have an impact, either direct or indirect, on the employee or student with whom they are romantically involved. Those who abuse their power in such circumstances may be found to have violated this Policy. An abuse of power may be, but is not limited to, inflating a student's grade, promising an employee a promotion, or providing preferential academic or employment opportunities to an individual based on a romantic or sexual relationship. Any individual who engages in a c onsensual romantic or sexual relationship with someone over whom he or she has supervisory or educational responsibility must inform his or her immediate supervisor of the consensual relationship, so that the University can take action to make ch anges that eliminate the conflict of interest. In the case of a relationship between two employees in which the University determines it is unable to eliminate the conflict of interest, the employees will be provided with the opportunity to decide which of the two will resign their employment. Failure to give proper notice to the appropriate supervisor may result in the denial of legal representation and indemnification in the event that a lawsuit based on the relationship is filed. In addition, failure to give proper notice to the appropriate supervisor may result in disciplinary action. V. ACADEMIC FREEDOM The classroom and other instructional settings ( e.g., studio, laboratory) present special problems because academic freedom protects the expression of ideas, even when the idea or its expression may be perceived to be offensive, if conduct or statements which are the subject of a complaint are germane to the subject matter taught. The educational process is predicated upon the free exchange of ideas, and this Policy shall not be interpreted to prohibit free expression protected by the First Amendment. The National AAUP's Statement on Professional Ethics provides that professors should avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. The 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure provides that Professors should not introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject. Accordingly, if conduct or statements which are the subject of a complaint occur s in an instructional context and are germane to the subject matter being taught, wide latitude is required for professional judgment in determining the appropriate content and presentation of the academic material being taught. Therefore, harassment in violation of this Policy will not be found to exist in an instructional setting unless the conduct or statements which are the subject of a complaint are not germane to the subject matter taught and: are directed toward an individual or group based on one or more of the protected classes listed in Section I above; are sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter an individual's educational environment; create an objectively hostile learning environment; and are, in fact, perceived as hostile by the complainant. VI. REPORTING PROHIBITED CONDUCT The University strongly encourages all members of the University community to report all conduct prohibited by this Policy as promptly as possible so that the University can investigat e and respond effectively. If an administrator, supervisor, or faculty member receives a complaint of conduct allegedly in violation of this Policy, he or she has an affirmative duty to promptly report it to the Office of Employment Equity. Failure to do s o in accordance with this Policy is a violation of University policy and may lead to disciplinary action. Administrators, supervisors, and faculty members should not investigate complaints they receive, nor evaluate whether the complaint rises to the level of a University policy violation. A. Options for Reporting The Office of Employment Equity A complaint against a University employee, (including faculty, staff, and student employee) or third party (such as interns, volunteers, vendors, contractors, and others who do business with the University) shall be reported to the Director of the Office of Employment Equity (\"Director\") who also serves as the Title IX Coordinator for Faculty and Staff. Lisa Grosskreutz, Director of the Office of E mployment Equity, Title IX Coordinator, Faculty and Staff3 University Human Resources 57 US Highway 1, ASB II, Cook Campus 848-932-3979 Lisa.grosskreutz@rutgers.edu If a Complainant wishes to commence a formal investigation, he or she may file a Formal Complaint Form with the Office of Employment Equity.4 The Director of the Office of Employment Equity or his or her designee is available to answer any questions about commencing a formal investigation. The University encourages all members of the University community to report incidents of prohibited conduct regardless of whether the Complainant or victim has yet decided whether or not to f ile a formal complaint form. Complaints Against Students: Information about reporting complaints against University students is contained in the Student Policy. As a general matter, a complaint against a student arising out of his or her conduct as a student (as opposed to his or her conduct as a student employee) should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator for Students.5 Questions about the appropriate office to report conduct committed by a University student may be directed to either the Office of Em ployment Equity or other Title IX Coordinator. Law Enforcement Unless otherwise required by law, Complainants may choose to report crimes of sexual violence to the Rutgers University Police Department (\"RUPD\"), and/or the state or local police department or the county prosecutor's office where the incident(s) occurred. The RUPD officers are trained to assist victims of sexual assault, dating violence and domestic violence. RUPD personnel are familiar with state and local law enforcement processes and can explain what happens when sexual violence is reported to law enforcement. RUPD personnel can also accompany an individual requesting support to the local police department or prosecutor's office, though they cannot serve as a substitute for legal advic e on these matters. While RUPD may work cooperatively with state or local law enforcement authorities, the criminal justice system is independent of the University's internal investigations. Law enforcement authorities, including the RUPD, do not determine whether a violation of this Policy has occurred. Additional information on the RUPD intake process can be found in Rutgers' annual security report, Safety Matters Report . B. Reports by Student Com plainants 3 The Director of the Office of Employment Equity serves as the Title IX Coordinator for Faculty and Staff. However, complaints may also be made to another Title IX Coordinator. Title IX Coordinators serve as the central points of contact for complainants of sexual misconduct and oversee the administration of this Policy in a neutral and equitable manner. The Title IX Coordinators are also responsible for overseeing the University's response to all reports and complaints of sexual misconduct, and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems revealed by such reports and complaints. The University's Title IX Compliance Officer and Central Title IX Coordinator is Judy Ryan, Enterprise Risk and Institutional Compliance Officer, and she can be reached at 1 World's Fair Drive, Suite 3200, Somerset, NJ 08873, 732-235 -5304, Judy.ryan@rutgers.edu. Contact information for additional Title IX Coordinators can be found in the Resources Supplement . 4 Complaint Forms can be returned to the Office of Employment Equity, 57 US Highway 1, ASB II, Cook Campus, 848- 932-3973, Fax: 732 -932- 0049. 5 Such complaints are addressed by Policy 10.3.12 the Student Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence, Relationship Violence, Stalking, and Related Misconduct. Contact information for the Title IX Coordinators for Students can be found in the Resources Supplement . The University recognizes that student Complainants may be most comfortable disclosing sexual violence and other prohibited conduct to a University employee they know well, such as a faculty member, a supervisor, a coach, or a resident advisor. These \"non- confidential\" employees will protect and respect Complainants' privacy to the greatest extent possible and share information only on a need- to-know basis; however, they cannot serve as a confidential resource for Complainants. Any University employee (othe r than the confidential resources identified in the Resources Supplement ), who receives a student complaint about conduct prohibited by this Policy or the Student Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence, Relationship Violence, Stalking, and Related Misconduct, is required to inform the appropriate Title IX Coordinator about the incident.6 Incidents that involve an allegation that an employee or third party has violated this Polic y should be directed to the Director of the Office of Employment Equity, who serves as the employee Title IX Coordinator. Incidents that involve an allegation about a student's conduct should be reported to the appropriate Title IX Coordinator for Students . 7 Once a report is made, the Title IX Coordinator will work with the alleged victim to assess any request for confidentiality or anonymity, and to determine how to respond to the report in a way that will stop and prevent recurrence of the alleged misconduct and provide remediation to the victim. C. Confidentiality The University will reveal information about its investigations of conduct prohibited by this Policy only to those who need to know the information in order to carry out their duties and responsib ilities. Individuals with questions about who may receive such information should contact the Office of Employment Equity (\"OEE\"). OEE expects that all parties, witnesses and support persons involved in an investigation will respect the integrity of the procedures and the legitimate privacy interests of the parties and witnesses. This does not prohibit either a Complainant or Respondent from obtaining the assistance of family members, counselors, therapists, clergy, doctors, attorneys, union representative or similar resources. D. Confidential Resources There are various \"confidential\" resources available throughout the University, including advocates, counselors, clergy and healthcare providers. These are people that, in general, are not obligated to share any personally identifying information about a report of prohibited conduct (such as the Complainant, victim or Respondent's name) with the Office of Employment Equity, a Title IX Coordinator, law enforcement, or other University administrator. A report to a confidential resource will not trigger an investigation or disciplinary action under this Policy. Confidential resources can offer the following assistance: Provide information about how to file a complaint with the University or law enforcement; Direct the individual to other forms of protection and support, such as victim advocacy, accommodations, and/or health or counseling services; Arrange for medical care and accompany the individual, or arrange for someone to accompany the individual, to seek such care; and Provide individuals with immediate and long- term help. 6 Certain employees designated \"Responsible Employees\" are required to report all potential incidents of sexual misconduct. Responsible employees include those who have the authority to take action to redress sexual misconduct, those given the duty of reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator, or anyone a student would reasonably believe to have that duty. This Policy requires that all faculty and staff not designated as a Confidential Resource relay such reports to the Title IX Coordinator. 7 Camden, New Brunswick, Newark and RBHS each have an assigned Title IX C oordinator. Contact information is available in the Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence, Relationship Violence, Stalking, and Related Misconduct by Employees and Third Parties Resources Supplement (\"Resources Supplement \"). The Resources Supplement contains a complete list of the confidential resources at Rutgers University -New Brunswick, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Rutgers University - Newark and Rutgers University -Camden. University employees and students may use these confidential resources whether or not they make a report to a Title IX Coordinator or participate in the University investigation proceedings, disciplinary process, or criminal process. E. Requests not to Disclose the Complainant's Identity in Connection with a Report to the University The Director of the Office of Employment Equity is responsible for assessing requests by Complainants and/or victims not to disclose their identity to anyone else, including the person who allegedly committed the prohibited conduct. While such a request may limit the University's ability to investigate and respond to a report, the Director of the Office of Employment Equity, in consultation with the RUPD, victim advocates, or other relevant University administrators (as appropriate), will consider the request in light of the University's commitment to provide a safe and non- discriminatory environment for all University members, and will honor the request whenever possible. Similarly, a Complainant and/or victim may request that the Office of Employment Equity not commence an investigation at all. In either case, the Office of Employment Equity will promptly notify the individual making the request whether the University will be able to honor it. Whether or not the University is able to grant a request to keep the Compla inant's and/or victim's identity confidential, University personnel will reveal information about investigations and disciplinary proceedings pursuant to this Policy only to those who need to know in order to carry out their duties and responsibilities. Th is means that the Director of the Office of Employment Equity, or his or her designee, may disclose the identity of the Complainant/victim to, for example, the investigators assigned to the case, potential witnesses, and University administrators involved in the disciplinary process and/or any requests for interim measures or accommodations. F. Reports from Third Parties and Anonymous Reports In cases where an incident is reported to the Office of Employment Equity or the RUPD by someone other than the alleged victim (by a coworker, faculty member, resident advisor, friend or roommate, or witness, for example), the Office of Employment Equity will promptly notify the alleged victim that a report has been received. This Policy will apply in the same manner as i f the victim had made the initial report and that individual will be considered the Complainant for purposes of this Policy, even though the initial report did not originate with that individual. The Office of Employment Equity will make every effort to meet with the alleged victim to discuss available options and on- campus and off -campus resources. Reports from an anonymous source otherwise will be treated in the same manner as a report from the alleged victim. As always, the victim/Complainant is not required to participate in any resulting investigation or disciplinary process and the Director of the Office of Employment Equity will assess any requests to keep the identity of the Complainant/victim confidential, or not to commence an investigation. G. Unkno wn/Non -University Offenders The University will investigate reports of incidents affecting University employees or students that are committed by individuals who are not members of the University community or whose identity is not known to the extent it is able. The University will take appropriate actions designed to protect affected students and others in the University community, and to remediate the impact of the incident for the Complainant/victim. VII. INTERIM REMEDIAL MEASURES In all cases, the University will take appropriate steps designed to mitigate the effects of the alleged prohibited conduct, prevent its recurrence, and make accommodations for the Complainants involved. Such interim measures may include, but are not limited to, academic, residential, and work accommodations; increased monitoring, supervision, or security at locations or in connection with activities where the alleged incident occurred; training and educational materials for the campus community; and/or other prot ective measures to separate the Respondent from the community, if appropriate. Under appropriate circumstances, available academic, residential and work -related accommodations may include: No Contact Order. A no contact order is an official University dir ective that serves as notice to an individual that they must not have verbal, electronic, written or third party communications with another individual. Violations of a no contact order may be subject to discipline. Academic accommodations such as tutoring, assistance in transferring to another section of a lecture or laboratory, assistance in arranging for incompletes, leaves or withdrawal from campus, or rearranging class schedules, and Housing accommodations such as facilitating changes in on- campus housing or assistance in exploring alternative housing off-campus. Employment accommodations such as arranging for temporary or permanent alternate University employment, different work shifts, etc., to the extent feasible and/or permitted by respective labor agreements. Transportation and parking accommodations. Both parties may request a temporary reassignment, if appropriate, to other work duties and responsibilities, other work locations, other work groups/teams, or alternative supervision/ management. Complainants can make a request for interim protective measures with the Director of the Office of Employment Equity (\"Director\") in the course of reporting conduct prohibited by this Policy. Interim protective measures may be taken in the immediate aftermath of an incident and/or while an investigation or a disciplinary action is pending. It is not necessary to file a complaint under this Policy, participate in the adjudication process, or file a criminal complaint in order to request services or accommodations from the University. The Director will work with other University offices, such as Title IX Coordinators, Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, individual University supervisors, Disability Services, Public Safety, etc., to arrange interim protective measures or accommodations for Complainants in light of the circumstances and information available at the time. The Director will seek to minimize unreasonable burdens on either party; however, every reasonable effort will be made to allow the Complainant to continue in his or her academic, University housing, and/or University employment arrangements. Following a report of an incident, the Complainant will be provided written notice of the interim measures and accommodations that may be available. The Respondent will be provided such notice if and when it is determined that an investigation or informal resolution will proceed. Whatever the outcome of the hearing process, a Complainant may request ongoing or additional accommodations and the Director, in consultation with appropriate University officials, will determine whether such measures are appropriate. The University will provide information about interim measures and accommodations only to those who need to know in order to make them effective. Complainants also should refer to the Resources Supplement for additional assistance both on and off campus. Failure to comply with interim measures or accommodations is a violation of University policy and may lead to additional disciplinary action. VIII. INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES Complaints against University employees will be reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Discrimination, Harassment, Workplace Violence, Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation Complaint Process: Complaints Against University Employees and Third Parties (\"Complaint Process\") . Additional information specifically pertaining to violations of this Policy is outlined below: A. Timely Investigation - Every effort will be made to conclude the investigative process within 60 calendar days from the time the investigation commences, not counting any appeal. Given the many variables and factors that may arise in such cases, additional time may be needed in some cases. The Office of Employment Equity may extend any time frame f or good cause, and will communicate any deviation from the 60- day time frame in writing to both the Complainant and the Respondent simultaneously, along with a new timeline and explanation of the reason for the extension of time. The investigative process for investigating and responding to reports under this Policy will continue during any law enforcement proceeding or civil proceeding. The investigation may need to be temporarily delayed while the police are gathering evidence but the investigation will be resumed once the police department has completed its evidence- gathering and generally will not wait for the conclusion of any related criminal proceeding. B. Standard of Proof - Allegations of conduct prohibited by this Policy will be evaluated under a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard, reached when a reasonable person, after a careful balancing of available information, would conclude that it is more likely than not that a violation has occurred and the individual/organization charged is responsible for the violation. IX. FALSE ACCUSATIONS Knowingly making a material misstatement of fact may subject the complainant to discipline. Anyone who believes that he or she has been the subject of a false complaint may meet with the Director of the Office of Employment Equity to discuss the allegations. The filing of a complaint that does not result in a finding of prohibited conduct is not alone evidence of the intent to file a false complaint. X.

The Policy I. Academic Integrity As an academic community dedicated to the creation, dissemination, and application of knowledge, Rutgers Univ ersity is committed to fostering an intellectual and ethical environment based on the principles of academic integrity. Academic integrity is essential to the success of the University's educational, research, and clinical missions, and violations of academic integrity constitute serious offenses against the entire academic community. The principles of academic integrity require that a student: make sure that all work submitted in a course, academic research, or other activity is the student's own and created without the aid of impermissible technologies, materials, or collaborations. properly acknowledge and cite all use of the ideas, results, images, or words of others. properly acknowledge all contributors to a given piece of work. obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with the student's interpretation or conclusions. treat all other students ethically, respecting their integrity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This principle requires that a student neither facilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct their academic progress. uphold the ethical standards and professional code of conduct in the field for which the student is preparing. Adherence to these principles is necessary to ensure that: proper credit for ideas, words, images, results, and other scholarly work, no matter the form or media , is attributed to the appropriate individual(s). all student research and work are fairly evaluated, and no student has aninappropriate advantage over others. the academic and ethical development of all students is fostered. the reputation of the University for integrity, ethics, scholarship, and professionalism is maintained and enhanced. Failure to uphold these principles of academic integrity threatens both the reputation of the University and the value of the degrees awarded to its students. Every member of the Univer sity community, therefore, bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld. To uphold these principles, the University administration is responsible for: working with faculty, staff, and students to foster a strong institutional culture of academic integrity, providing effective educational programs that create an understanding of and commitment to academic integrity, and establishing equitable and effective procedures to deal with allegations of violations of academic integrity. All members of the University share the collegial responsibility for educating students about the importance and principles of academic integrity. Faculty members are expected to inform students of the part icular requirements regarding academic integrity within their specific courses, to make reasonable efforts to minimize academic dishonesty, and to respond appropriately to violations of academic integrity. Additionally, faculty members are strongly encouraged to provide a statement concerning academic integrity and a link to the Academic Integrity Policy on their course syllabi. Students are responsible for understanding the principles of academic integrity and abiding by them in all aspects of their work at the University. Students are also encouraged to help educate fellow students about academic integrity and to bring all alleged violations of academic integrity they encounter to the attention of the appropriate authorities. To create a strong culture t hat promotes academic integrity, Rutgers has adopted the following honor pledge to be written and signed on examinations and major course assignments submitted for grading: On my honor, I have neither received nor given any unauthorized assistance on this examination (assignment) . Some professional schools may have codes of professional conduct that impose additional requirements such as requiring students to report observed violations of academic integrity by others and to self -report such violations. The University may require that students: write and sign this pledge on examinations and major assignments submitted for grading; take an online academic integrity tutorial and pass an online examination on academic integrity in their first semester at Rutgers; and affirm that they understand the Rutgers Academic Integrity Policy and will abide by it in all of their academic work. II. Applicability of the Policy This Academic Integrity Policy applies to all schools and academic units of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Also, most professional schools have codes of professional conduct that students are required to follow. The code of professional conduct for a particular professional school can be found in the student handbook or equivalent document of that school. Each professional school has the responsibility to educate its students about its code of professional conduct and the penalties for violations. Students are responsible for understanding and adhering to the requirements of this policy and the code of professional conduct for the particular professional school in which they are enrolled. III. Academic Integrity Violations A. Types of Violations This section describes various ways in which the principles of academic integrity can be violated. Examples of each type of violation are provided in this policy. However, neither the types of violations nor the lists of examples are exhaustive. Plagiarism : Plagiarism is the use of another person's words, ideas, images, or results, no matter the form or media, without giving that person appropriate credit. To avoid plagiarism, a student must identify every direct quotation using quotation marks or appropriate indentation and cite both direct quotation and paraphrasing properly according to the accepted format for the particular discipline or as required by the instructor in a course. Some common examples of plagiarism are: Copying word for word (i.e. quoting directly) from an oral, printed, or electronic source without proper attribution. Paraphrasing without proper attribution, i.e., presenting in one's own words another person's written words or ideas as if they were one's own, regardless of the nature of the assignment. Incorporating into one's work graphs, drawings, photographs, diagrams, tables, spreadsheets, computer programs, or other non- textual material from other sources, regardless of format, without proper attribution. Cheating : Cheating is the use or possession of inappropriate or prohibited materials, information, sources, or aids in any academic exercise. Cheating also includes submitting papers, research results or reports, analyses, and other textual or visual material and media as one's own work when others prepared them. Some common examples are: Prohibited collaboration: receiving research, programming, data collection, or analytical assistance from others or working with another student on an assignment where such help is not permitted. Copying another student's work or answers on a quiz or examination. Using or having access to books, notes, calculators, cell phones, technology, or other prohibited devices or materials during a quiz or examination. Submitting the same work or major portions thereof to satisfy the requirements of more than one course without permission from the instructors involved . Preprogramming a calculator or other device to contain answers, formulas, or other unauthorized information for use during a quiz or examination. Acquiring a copy of an examination from an unauthorized source before the examination. Having a substitute take an examination in one's place. Submitting a purchased or downloaded term paper or other materials to satisfy a course requirement. Submitting as one's own work a term paper or other assignment prepared, in whole or in part, by someone else. Fabrication : Fabrication is the invention or falsification of sources, citations, data, or results, and recording or reportin g them in any academic exercise. Some examples include the following: Citing a source that does not exist. Making up or falsifying evidence or data or other source materials. Falsifying research papers, reports, or other documents by selectively omitting or altering data that do not support one's conclusions or claimed experimental precision. Falsifying patient or client records. Falsely documenting experiential and/or internship opportunities that did not occur. Providing falsified excu ses, documents, or other information to excuse late or missed assignments, or to justify regrading. Facilitation of Dishonesty : Facilitation of dishonesty is deliberately or carelessly allowing one's work to be used by other students without prior approval of the instructor or otherwise aiding others in committing violations of academic integrity. A student who deliberately facilitates a violation of academic integrity can be subject to the same sanctions as the student who receives the impermissibl e assistance, even if the facilitator does not benefit personally from the violation. Some examples are: Collaborating before a quiz or examination to develop methods of exchanging information. Knowingly allowing others to copy answers to complete a quiz or examination or assisting others to do so. Distributing an examination from an unauthorized source before the examination. Distributing or selling a term paper to other students. Taking an examination for another student. Allowing other students access to your work in violation of course policies. Academic Sabotage: Academic sabotage is deliberately impeding the academic progress of others. Some examples are: Intentionally destroying or obstructing another student's work. Stealing or defacing books, journals, or other library or University materials. Altering computer files that contain data, reports, or assignments belonging to another student. Removing posted or reserve material or otherwise preventing other students' access to it. Misrepresenting the contributions of others in the group to give more credit to one particular student for one's gain. Violation of Research or Professional Ethics : Violations in this category include both violations of the code of ethics specific to a particular profession and violations of more generally applicable ethical requirements for the acquisition, analysis, and reporting of research data and the preparation and submission of scholarly work for publication. Some examples are: Violating a canon of the ethical code of the profession for which a student is preparing. Using unethical or improper means of acquiring, analyzing, or reporting data in a course research project, a senior thesis project, a master's or doctoral research project, grant -funded research, or research submitted for publication. Misuse of grant or institutional funds. Violating professional ethics in performing one's duties as a Teaching Assistant or Graduate Assistant. Violations Involving Potentially Criminal Activity : Violations in this category include theft, fraud, forgery, or distribution of illicitly obtained materials committed as part of an act of academic dishonesty. Some examples are: Unauthorized acquisition of an examination from a faculty member or electronic files. Selling, buying, or distributing an examination. Forging a change- of-grade form. Falsifying a University transcript. B. Levels of Violations Violations of academic integrity are generally divided into three categories: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 1 violations may occur as a result of inexperience or lack of malicious intent by the person committing the violation. Level 2 violations include misconduct of a more serious character or misconduct that affects a major, significant, or essential portion of work done to meet course requirements. These violations demonstrate premeditation or may have posed harm to others. The student alleged to have committed the violation may have one or more previous violations. Level 3 v iolations represent the most serious breaches of conduct. They may involve a serious violation of a professional code of conduct; may include extreme cases of dishonesty and maliciousness or violations of law; and/or are likely to cause direct harm to others. The procedures for adjudicating alleged violations of academic integrity are different for Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 violations. The following examples of violations are not exhaustive. Classification of a given violation is heavily dependent on the exact facts and circumstances of the violation as determined by the Academic Integrity Facilitator (who is appointed in each School to investigate and adjudicate alleged academic integrity) in consultation with the campus Office of Student Conduct or equivalent. 1. Level 1 Violations Level 1 violations are less serious violations of academic integrity. They may occur because of inexperience or lack of understanding of the principles of academic integrity and are often characterized by a relatively low degree of premeditation or planning on the part of the student committing the violation. These violations are generally quite limited in extent, occur on a minor assignment or quiz, or constitute a small portion of a major assignment and/or represent a small percentage of the total course work. Below are a few examples of violations that are most often considered Level 1, at least when committed by an undergraduate student as a first -time offense. Plagiarism on a minor assignment or a very limit ed portion of a major assignment. Unpremeditated cheating on a quiz or minor examination. Prohibited collaboration with another student on a homework assignment. Unauthorized sharing of course materials. Citing a source that does not exist or that one has not read on a minor assignment. Signing in for another student via attendance sheet or clicker in a course where attendance is graded. 2. Level 2 Violations Level 2 violations are serious violations of academic integrity that affect a more significant portion of the course work compared to Level 1 violations or are an alleged second violation of this policy. Level 2 violations are often characterized by substantial premeditation or planning and clearly dishonest or malicious intent on the part of the student committing the violation. Below are some examples of violations that are most often considered Level 2. A second violation. Substantial plagiarism on a major assignment. Copying or using unauthorized materials, devices, or collaboration on a major exam. Making up or falsifying evidence or data or other source materials for a major assignment, including falsification by selectively omitting or altering data that do not support one's claims or conclusions. Distribution of cour se materials for financial gain. Facilitating dishonesty by another student on a major exam or assignment. Intentionally obstructing another student's work. Participating in an organized cheating scheme. 3. Level 3 Violations Level 3 violations are serious breaches of conduct, may involve a serious violation of a professional code of conduct, may include extreme cases of dishonesty and maliciousness, violation of law, and/or are likely to cause direct harm to others. Below are some examples of violat ions that are most often considered Level 3. Any violation involving potentially criminal activity. Coordinating an organized cheating scheme. Having a substitute take an examination. Cheating and/or plagiarism on a capstone project, thesis, or dissertati on. Intentionally destroying another student's work. Falsifying patient or client records. When a student is accused of one or more Level 3 violations that include alleged violations of law or a professional code of conduct, or when it is reasonable to believe that the student is likely to cause direct harm to others, they may be removed from a course, clinical, or internship setting on an interim basis, with the approval of the dean of the school. The student shall be immediately informed in writing of any interim removal and has the right to appeal to the campus Chief Academic Integrity Officer (who is responsible for administering the Academic Integrity Policy on each campus). IV. Sanctions Any violation of academic integrity is a serious offense subject to appropriate sanctions or penalties. Violations of academic integrity may result in academic penalties, educational sanctions, and/or disciplinary sanctions, and are not limited to the examples below. A. Academic Penalties Requirem ent to re- submit the assignment or complete an alternate assignment. A grade reduction for assignment or course. A failing grade for the assignment. A grade of F in the course. A grade of XF in the course, where applicable. B. Educational Sanctions An assigned paper or research project related to ethics or academic integrity. Participation in a workshop or seminar. Service to the University community. C. Disciplinary Sanctions Disciplinary reprimand. Disciplinary probation. Dismissal from a departmental or school program. Denial of access to internships or research programs. Loss of appointment to academic positions. Loss of departmental/graduate program/school endorsements for internal and external fellowship support and employment opportuni ties. Removal of fellowship or assistantship support. Suspension for one or more semesters. Requiring a delay in the completion of a professional program. Dismissal from a graduate or professional program. Expulsion from the University with a permanent notation of disciplinary expulsion on the student's transcript. Degree or certificate revocation. Note: Any of these sanctions may have an impact on financial aid, scholarship, or fellowship eligibility, or scholastic standing. V. Policies for Addressing Alleged Violations of Academic Integrity A. Standard of Proof The standard of proof in academic integrity cases is by the preponderance of the evidence, which means that the person or hearing panel deciding the case finds that it is more likely than not that the accused student is responsible for the alleged violation. B. Reporting and Adjudicating Alleged Violations Procedures for adjudicating alleged violations of academic integrity are described at academicintegrity.rutgers.edu. C. Withdrawal and Assignment of Grades during the Disciplinary Process Once a student has been notified of an alleged violation of academic integrity related to a course, the student may not drop the course until the disciplinary process is completed. Students may request permission to withdraw retroactively from the course after the disciplinary process is completed unless the sanction issued includes an F or XF grade in the course, or a C grade for graduate students. If the student wishes to withdraw from all courses while a case is pending, that request must be approved by the Dean of the school in which the student is enrolled, in consultation with the Academic Integrity Facilitator. If a faculty member must submit a final course grade before the disciplinary process for an alleged violation of academic integrity is completed, the accused student shall be given a TZ grade or similar (e.g., Incomplete) until the disciplinary process is completed. D. Removal of an XF Grade Requests for removal of the X from an XF grade must be submitted in writing to the appropriate Campus Appeals Committee. Such requests will not be considered until at least 18 months from the time of the violation that resul ted in the XF. In order for the request to be granted, the student, at a minimum, following the original violation, must have an exemplary record with respect to academic integrity, must have completed a Rutgers academic integrity workshop or seminar, and must satisfactorily answer a required series of essay questions on why the X should be removed. The Campus Appeals Committee shall make the final decision concerning the request. If the request is denied, the student must wait another year to submit another request.
