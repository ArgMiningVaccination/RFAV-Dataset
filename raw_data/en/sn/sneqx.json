All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonpro fit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone is president of the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. C. D. Mote, Jr., is president of the National Academy of Engineering. The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of em inent members of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of me dical care, research, and education. Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg is presiden t of the Institute of Medicine. The National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broa d community of science and technology with the Academy's purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone and Dr. C. D. Mote, Jr., are chair and vice chair, respectively, of the National Research Council. www.national-academies.org Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Although children represent nearly 25 percent of the U.S. population, current state and local disaster preparedness plans often do not include specific considerati ons for children and families. The preparedness and resilience of co mmunities related to children will require a systems framework for disaster preparedness across traditional and nontraditional medical and public health stakeholders, including community organizations, schools, a nd other partners in municipal planning. BACKGROUND On June 11 and 12, 2013, the Institute of Medicine Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Catastrophic Events convened a workshop in Washington, DC, to discuss disaster preparedness, response, and resilien ce relative to the needs of children and families, including children w ith special health care needs. Participants included traditional a nd nontraditional medical and public health stakeholders from across federal, state, and local government, 1This report has been prepared by the workshop rapporteurs as a factual summary of what occurred at the workshop. The planning committee's role was limited to planning and convening the workshop.

Chapter 2 provides background on some of the issues surrounding planning for children in disasters, an overview of the recommendations from the 2010 National Commission on Children and Disasters (NCCD) report, and progress thus far in integrating the n eeds of children into preparedness planning. Chapter 3 discusses leveraging health care coalitions to meet the needs of children in disasters, while Chapter 4 focuses on tools and studies done to augment state and local planning for children. Chapter 5 includes provider, hospital, insurer, and health system perspectives on the challenges of funding preparedness and response activities. The importance of public health part nerships and collaboration with community organizations in planning is discussed in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7, some of the specific n eeds of children during response are discussed (functional needs, nutritiona l needs, family reunification, temporary child care). Chapters 8 and 9 focus on the importance of tracking mental and behavioral health recovery of children and families, as well as strategies to foster resilience, and interventions that promote the social and economic well-being of children. Finally, Chapter 10 looks at the recovery experience after Hu rricane Sandy from child and family agencies and their plans moving forward. Resources and other materials from the workshop can be found in the appendixes, and, specifically, a paper that was commissioned for this workshop is provided in Appendix G, and a resource list of all the tools mentioned throughout the report can be found in Appendix F. HIGHLIGHTED TOPICS 3 Throughout the 2-day workshop, a va riety of themes emerged across multiple workshop presentations and discussions. The following topics were highlighted by Anderson and the session chairs in summary statements at the close of the wo rkshop. Each of these topics will be discussed at greater length throughout the report. 3Rapporteurs' summary based on the presen tations, discussions, and summary remarks by the meeting and session chairs.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary4 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Ongoing concerns: National advocates remain concerned regarding children's needs and trends. The ability to make progress is impeded by the federal fiscal crisis and competing institutional and organizational priorities. Although the NCCD report provides good baseline recommendations, there are still other areas that need attention. Federal engagement: Federal partners are engaged and trying to move issues and policies related to children's disaster preparedness forward. There are working groups at the White House, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and others, and there are actions being taken on the NCCD recommendations. Need for central coordination: The 2013 Pandemic and All- Hazards Preparedness Act reauthorization includes a new advisory committee on children and disasters, but as of yet it has not been appointed. Lack of centralized information and resources: Many participants stressed the need for a national clearinghouse of tools and resources. There were numerous examples of tools and trainings shared at the workshop, and many lessons learned and best practices were shared from recent events such as Hurricane Sandy, the tornadoes in Joplin, Missouri, and Moore, Oklahoma, and the Newtown, Connecticut, sc hool shooting. However, there is no centralized location to share these resources across jurisdictions, or any way for those who need them to easily find them. Similarly, there is no central coordination of the various recovery assets available to indi viduals from federal, state, and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, and others. Since the workshop, the Administration for Children and Families has created a webpage of early childhood disaster resources organized for providers, children and families, and policy makers. 4 Building and sustaining health care coalitions: Successful coalition building involves sharing information, working together to set and achieve goals, and developing formal relationships of commitment. Throughout the workshop, there 4See http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs epr/early-childhood (accessed November 12, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryINTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW 5 were what Anderson called \"world-c lass examples of coalitions.\" The operational question is how to replicate these examples, and to expand them beyond pediatric providers and hospitals. Broader engagement of stakeholders: There are many dif- ferent settings and systems that serve children. Many speakers and participants stressed the need to build partnerships across sectors (e.g., behavioral health, public health, medical services, human services, educational systems, emergency management systems, community organizati ons) with a constant focus on children as they are, and in the environments where they live. Some participants who had previously worked with only clinical and emergency partners highlighted the need for more training and planning with community partners, and suggested thinking more broadly about collaborating with other child-serving community groups that can contribute to community preparedness. o Youth: Youth involvement in preparedness fosters resilience, and youth can serve as messengers to their peers and parents. Hearing from Ashley Houston from FEMA's Youth Preparedness Council, it became more apparent that engaging youth today will ensure future generations of better prepared adults. Social media can be a powerful outreach tool. o People with disabilities: Several presentations stressed the importance of planning for the evacuation, transport, and sheltering needs of children with disabilities or access and functional needs. Presenters said that people with disabilities, or their representativ es, should be included in planning groups, and children with disabilities should have a say in their own evacuation and transportation plans when they are old enough. o Community providers/private physicians: Concerns were raised about the need to better integrate private-sector practitioners into local disaster planning. A key barrier to preparedness at the practice level is the lack of payment for time spent in preparedness activities (as these are not reimbursable). o Child care providers: Participants at the state and national level raised many child care-related issues, from the importance of getting child care up and running after a Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary6 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES disaster, to temporary child care in shelters, to the difficulties locating and communicating with impacted pro-viders in a disaster, including both family- and center-based providers. Several participants discussed the importance of including child care providers as stakeholders in pre-paredness planning, and increasing the focus on plans for sheltering in place and communication with parents. They also highlighted barriers to the preparedness, response, and recovery of child care facilities. Financing: There was much interest in finding new models of financing preparedness efforts and care during disasters to make sure that resilience, preparedness, and response for children and families are integral parts of preparedness planning. As Scott Needle of the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida highlighted, making the business case for financing preparedness is challenging, as disasters are low-frequency events with a low financial return on investment, but can have a huge economic impact. Insurance reimbursement pays for intervention, not for preparedness. However, hospitals that are more prepared before a disaster will have better outcomes and less need for reimbursement assistance. Participants discussed the relevance of dual use capabilities to preparedness, noting that improved day-to-day operations can reap benefits for emergency preparedness. Ability to surge: There were many concerns expressed about pediatric bed capacity and the ability to surge when needed, especially noted by Patricia Frost of Contra Costa County. How can the best practices of some institutions and regions be developed into a national model? Exercises and drills: Participants repeatedly stressed the importance of drills and of exercising preparedness plans. Beyond practice, there also needs to be some level of competency. Speakers and participants called for national-level pediatric exercises and suggested that pediatric preparedness exercises should perhaps be a regulatory requirement for hospitals. Workarounds versus safety and quality: It was discussed that in the absence of feasible solutions to complex preparedness and response problems, workarounds ar e often developed. However, this raised concerns from a patient safety and quality of care Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

It was suggested th at process engineers also be included in preparedness planning. Disaster education: While emergency preparedness is built on the strength of everyday health systems, professionals and the public should be better informed about their expected roles in a disaster, especially related to children. To be effective, pediatric training for providers must be built on comprehensive education and training in disaster management and emergency preparedness for all our nation' s public health and health care providers, adult as well as pediatric. It must also ensure that pediatric-specific basic education and training in pediatric disaster management and emergenc y preparedness is offered not only to health care providers who have dedicated their professional lives to the care of child ren, but also to adult health care providers who in times of contingency or crisis may be called on to treat children until definitive pediatric care is available. Jeff Upperman presented innovative strategies on developing competencies in health care professionals, but more emphasis is needed both for providers and the general public on their role in disasters. Lessons learned versus actions taken: Disasters create moments of opportunity for advocacy and action. It is important to seize these moments when the public and policy makers are engaged to make change. Irwin Re dlener of the National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health pointed out that lessons learned are nothing if they do not lead to action. Some suggested that after the near-steady stream of recent man-made and natural disasters and emergencies, the moment of opportunity is now. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The basic goal with respect to disasters is to make children, families, and communities more resilient and less vulnerable. Adults and children may initially persevere following a traumatic event, but the resilience can erode the longer recovery takes, and the more stressful the recovery process is over time. Progress continues to be made in the implementation of recomm-endations in 11 categories from the 2010 report authored by the National Commission on Children and Disasters. This report begins with an overview of the specific impact of disasters on children by Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. He explained the important differences between lessons learned and lessons acted on, and realistic goals to keep in mind regarding children in these precarious situations. This is followed by a re view of the recommendations from the 2010 National Commission on Children in Disasters (NCCD) report and updates on progress being made in different sectors around the country. NEEDED FOCUS ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES There are tremendous deficiencies in the data needed to plan appropriately for children, said keynote speaker Redlener, and as a Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Children have very long memories, he continued, and the impact of the trauma associated with both the disaster itself, and prolonged or difficult recoveries, can last a very long time. Lessons Learned Versus Actions Taken People often look back at their experiences and call them \"lessons learned.\" But Redlener highlighted the need to differentiate between something that happened, and something that happened that led to preventive actions to mitigate future adverse events. He offered several examples from the events that occu rred between October 24, 2012, and May 31, 2013. During this 7-month period, there were 9 major incidents: Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast; the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut; bombings at the Boston Marathon; an explosion in a fertilizer plant in West, Texas; letters containing Ricin mailed to officials in Washington, DC; massive flooding in the Midwest; two EF5 tornadoes within 2 weeks in Moore and El Reno, Oklahoma; and a bridge collapse in Mount Vernon, Washington. Four of these incidents happened in 1 week, between Monday and Friday of April 15 through April 19 (Boston bombings, W est explosion, DC Ricin letters, and Midwest flooding). Children's Near Misses Data are difficult to obtain, but it is estimated that across these 9 events there were 176 fatalities, 46 of which were children or adolescents (26 percent). Redlener also described some of the \"close calls\" in these events, situations that could have easily been far worse with respect to child injuries and fatalities. For example, during Hurricane Sandy, the New York University Langone Medical Center evacuated neonates from its neonatal intensive care unit. Ph otographs of people carrying tiny newborn babies down a dark hospital stairwell were front-page news. While evacuation helped to ensure continued intensive care, Redlener suggested that, had we learned fro m Hurricane Katrina and taken action to protect generators, fuel supplies, electrical systems, etc., there may not have been a need to move these delicate patients. In Boston, there happened to be very few children at the marathon finish line when the bombs detonated. What if, Redlener said, there had been a third-grade Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryCHILDREN AND DISASTERS 11 class watching the end of the marathon at that time? In West, Texas, the plant explosion caused extensive damage to the middle school and high school. Because the explosion happe ned after school hours, the middle school students were gone, and although the high school track team was returning to the school from an event, they decided to stop along the way for something to eat, delaying their return to school. Although hundreds of schools are in Oklahoma's \"Tornado Alley\" (most without appropriate storm cellars or other safe havens), the Moore, Oklahoma, tornado only destroyed one school (killing seven people in the school). In Mount Vernon, Washington, there were no children in the vehicles that plunged into the water when the bridge co llapsed. Thankfully, there was not a school bus on the bridge at that time, he noted. Turning Learning to Action The questions, Redlener said, are what are we actually learning from these events and near misses, and how fast are we filling the gaps in preparedness and response that are identified? During only 215 days the country faced a hurricane superstorm, a school shooting, terrorism, an industrial accident, severe flooding, tornadoes, and infrastructure failure. Disasters are not going away. More severe weather is inevitable. Pandemic viruses continue to emerge. The country faces potential cyber attacks, nuclear plant meltdowns, improvised nuclear devices, chemical spills, earthquakes, and the list goes on. Are we learning from these tragedies and close calls? For example, it is clear that children must be protected in schools. Alabama now requires newly built public schools to have ad equate protection from tornadoes, but Redlener said he was not aware of any similar action in the Oklahoma State Legislature thus far. There is limited understanding about how to protect backup generators in hospitals. There is also a lack of preemptive evacuation protocols. Shelters, even those designated for families, are often ill prepared for children, lacking diapers, cribs, and baby food. Recovery Once the initial disaster event is over, it can take a very long time for a community to return to a normal level of functionality. When a community is at high risk for furthe r disaster events, Redlener said, the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary12 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES goal is not to achieve the pre-event normal, but rather to achieve a new normal with better infrastructure and st ability. Redlener referred to the recovery of infrastructure as \"fa\u00e7ade recovery.\" The buildings are rebuilt, the infrastructure is repaired, and there is the appearance of recovery. The recovery of the impacted population, however, takes much longer. He noted that surveys done 3, 5, and 7 years after Hurricane Katrina still indicated ongoing effects of the trauma. Redlener also described the concept of \"resilience erosion\" (see Figure 2-1). People, including childre n, can initially persevere through a traumatic event. Children are buffered from stress by resilient adults who protect them through the period of trauma and recovery, and transmit a sense of resilience. However, the longer recovery takes, and the more stressful the recovery process is, the more difficult it is for the adult to remain a resilient buffer for the children. After weeks, months, and even years of waiting for the situation to improve, parents who were once strong begin to lose their ability to provide an emotional and functional safety net for their children. Adding to th e stress is the lack of any central function that coordinates the various recovery assets available from federal, state, and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, the Red Cross, insurance companies, banks, and others. Instead, individuals who have been affected by the disaster must navigate the highly complex bureaucratic process on their own. Setting and Achieving Goals The basic goal with respect to disasters is to make children, families, and communities less vulnerable, and more resilient and safe. Toward this end, the 2010 NCCD report recommends specific actions to be taken to improve preparedness, response, and recovery for children (NCCD, 2010; discussed further by Schonfeld and Dodgen in the next section). In setting and achieving goals, there is what Redlener called a \"denom-inator problem.\" If achievement is thought of as a fraction, what has been completed is the numerator and what is still needed is the denominator. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryCHILDREN AND DISASTERS 13 FIGURE 2-1 Resilience erosion. SOURCE: Redlener presentation, June 10, 2013. Government agencies are often interested in the numerator, and issue long lists of the progress that has been made. But the denominator of \"continuing needs\" is huge, he said, and because of this, children are still at risk. Through focusing more on the denominator\u2014what is still left to be done\u2014more needs can be identified. There are definitely wins, Redlener stressed. There is leadership buy- in to the concept that children need to be protected, there is embedded pediatric expertise throughout government, and there are many advocates. But federalism and politics run counter to national disaster planning. Washington's priorities are not necessarily the end user's pri- orities, and it is the local governments who determine how and when they will spend money and what their priorities are. Further, the research base on children and disasters is insufficient, and preparedness and response funding continues to be cut. Redlener pointed out that in com- parison to fiscal year (FY) 2010, the President's submitted budget for FY 2014 shows funding for the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) cut by 35 percent, state and local preparedness programs cut by 62 percent, and the elimination of the Academic and Public Health Preparedness Centers that had been promised a 5-year lifespan. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary14 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES There are many community-based programs addressing pre- paredness. But Redlener suggested that the scale is too large to be handled solely on a local basis. High-functioning community-based models of children's preparedness are necessary, but are not replacements for government initiatives and large-scale funding. In conclusion, Redlener said that wi th regard to children we should be hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, but given the economy, the political deadlock, and children's status among national priorities, we are instead hoping that we keep dodging the bullets. 2010 NATIONAL COMMISSION ON CHILDREN AND DISASTERS RECOMMENDATIONS The NCCD 2010 Report to the President and Congress 1 provided recommendations in 11 major categories (see Appendix H). David Schonfeld, director of the Nationa l Center for School Crisis and Bereavement and former Commission member, shared his perspective on some of the progress made thus far in 8 of the 11 categories (omitting the last 3 due to time constraints). Integration The first NCCD recommendations on disaster management and recovery are really about integration, Schonfeld said. Recommendation 1.1 from the report is to \"distinguish and comprehensively integrate the needs of children across all inter- and intra-governmental disaster management activities and operations.\" The recommendation specifies further that children should not be grouped in an \"at-risk\" category, but should instead be pulled out for separ ate consideration. Schonfeld listed several examples of how the needs of children are now being considered 1The National Commission on Children and Disasters was authorized under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, signed into law by President Bush on December 26, 2007 (P.L. 110-161). The Commission was charged with examining children's needs relative to disaster preparedness, response, and rec overy, and the status of existing laws, regulations, po licies, and programs relevant to meeting such needs. The final Commission findings and r ecommendations were delivered to President Obama and Congress in October 2010. The Commission wa s terminated in April 2011, per its charter. See http://www.ahrq.g ov/prep/nccdreport for further informati on (accessed September 8, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryCHILDREN AND DISASTERS 15 in planning, response, and recovery efforts, including the establishment of children's working groups at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as significant focus on the needs of the children by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recommendation 1.1 also specifies that \"the Executive Branch at all levels of government should estab lish and maintain permanent focal points of coordination for children in disasters that are supported by sufficient authority, funding and policy expertise.\" Schonfeld said that significant progress has been made in incorporating pediatric subject-matter expertise and policy expertise. However, he noted that there are concerns about the permanence of these efforts and whether the experts actually do have sufficient authority to effect change on an ongoing basis. Of particular concern is the adequacy of funding. One opportunity to enhance integration comes under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act reauthorization, which calls for the establishment of a National Advisory Committee on Children in Disasters. According to Schonfeld, it is expected that this committee will have sufficient resources, support, and potential influence. But, as noted earlier by Anderson, there is uncertainty on wh ere this committee will live, which reinforces the overall need for cen tralization for these issues and resources. One gap in integration highlighted by the NCCD was the lack of inclusion of education, child care, juvenile justice, and child welfare systems into disaster planning, training, and exercises. Progress in this area has been hindered in larg e part by funding reductions. These partners are struggling to simply meet their core missions, and there is little to no supplemental funding to meet specific disaster preparedness response goals. If this is not remedied, Schonfeld said, much of the considerable progress that has been achieved stands to be lost. Mental Health Recommendation 2.1 in the report states that \"HHS should lead efforts to integrate mental and beha vioral health for children in public health, medical, and other relevant disaster management activities.\" Although there has been progress in this area, Schonfeld said that funding limitations have compromised the federal agencies and the non- federal partners' ability to enhance pr e-disaster preparedness in pediatric Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary16 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES disaster mental and behavioral health (e.g., psychological first aid, bereavement support, brief supportive in terventions). Such preparedness training would be geared toward me ntal health professionals and other individuals who work with children (e.g., teachers). With regard to preparedness training, Schonfeld cautioned that \"just-in-time\" training is usually not in time. As an example, he described meeting with the school staff just after the shooting in Newtow n, Connecticut. He observed that it was very difficult for the staff to process any information or training at that point. Recommendation 2.4 calls for strengthening the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) to better meet the mental health needs of children and families. Schonfeld said that follow-up conversations (after the NCCD disb anded) with representatives of the CCP indicated that FEMA was generally in agreement with the changes recommended by the Commission, and was seeking mechanisms to implement them. Although overall progress toward successful imp-lementation is not yet clear, there are some examples. Schonfeld cited the Crisis Counseling Grant awarded to New Jersey in response to Hurricane Sandy, which includes a community liaison, numerous children's spec- ialists, and an intervention-based program to ensure that children's dis-aster mental health needs are addr essed effectively and efficiently. Similar efforts are also under way in Oklahoma. Child Physical Health and Trauma Recommendation 3.1 calls on Congress, HHS, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA to ensure the availability of and access to pediatric medical counter measures. A recent Government Accountability Office report found that significant progress has been made in furthering the developm ent of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for children; incorporating chil dren's needs into planning at the state and local levels; and devel oping and distributing dosing and administration guidance materials for parents and other caregivers (GAO, 2013). There has also been attention to increasing the relative proportion of MCMs in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) that can be used for children. Pediatric expe rts now advise on the content of the SNS to ensure that pediatric need s are represented, and emergency use authorizations (EUAs) have been developed proactively so that stockpiling of MCMs used under E UAs is permitted. Despite this Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryCHILDREN AND DISASTERS 17 progress, challenges remain in the development, testing, and purchasing of sufficient pediatric MCMs. Most worrisome, Schonfeld suggested, is the erosion of funding to support the SNS, which threatens the ability to maintain even the current level of readiness in the SNS for pediatric MCMs. Recommendations 3.2 and 3.3 advise HHS and the Department of Defense to enhance pediatric capab ilities of their disaster medical response teams and to ensure that health professionals who may treat children during disasters have adequate pediatric disaster clinical training. In this regard, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) 2 has made significant efforts to increase the number of providers with pediatric expertise, but Schonfeld said that this effort by NDMS does not translate directly to comprehensive pe diatric readiness in the field. The NCCD also recommended establishing a formal regionalized pediatric system of care to support pediatric surge capacity during and after disasters. Schonfeld highlighted the NCCD's concern that the country is not yet prepared to accommodate a surge in pediatric emergency medical trauma that may occur during a disaster, although, as of yet, no North American emergency to date has overwhelmed intensive care unit services on a widespread basis since the modern development of the field of critical care. However, planners are not optimistic that this will always be the case, and important progress on Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care has been made in recent years (Kissoon, 2011). Another recommendation in this area calls for prioritizing the recovery of pediatric health and mental health care delivery systems in disaster affected areas. There has been no progress in establishing a funding mechanism to support the restoration and continuity of for-profit health and mental health services for children, and this remains a significant vulnerability, Schonfeld said. 2The NDMS is a federally coordinated system to provide disaster medical care to the nation. The mission of NDMS is to \"temporar ily supplement federal, tribal, state and local capabilities by funding, organizing, tr aining, equipping, deploying and sustaining a specialized and focused range of public health and medical capabilities.\" For further information, see http://www.phe.gov/prepared ness/responders/ndms/Pa ges/default.aspx (accessed September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary18 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Emergency Medical Services and Pediatric Transport Recommendation 4.1 states that \"the President and Congress should clearly designate and appropriately resource a lead federal agency for emergency medical services with primary responsibility for the coord-ination of grant programs, research, policy, and standards development and implementation.\" Although Schonfe ld opined that this remains a need not only for disaster preparedn ess, but also for optimizing routine pediatric emergency medical services across the country, this view may not be uniformly shared across the emergency medical services (EMS) community. Given that EMS interfaces with so many different federal agencies, creating one federal lead ma y not solve issues that reach across so many areas. Schonfeld described the commission's call for efforts to \"improve the capability of emergency medical services to transport pediatric patients and provide comprehensive pre-hospital pediatric care during daily operations and disasters,\" and to \"develop a national strategy to improve federal pediatric emergency transport and patient care capabilities for disasters.\" The limited federal and state capability to accommodate a major pediatric surge requiring transport of a large number of pediatric patients is a significant vulnerability. Disaster Case Management The single recommendation in this area, Section 5, states that \"disaster case management programs should be appropriately resourced and should provide consistent holis tic services that achieve tangible positive outcomes for children and families affected by disasters.\" Further, \"government agencies and NGOs [nongovernmental org-anizations] should develop voluntary consensus standards on the essential elements and methods of disaster case management including pre-credentialing of case managers and training that includes focused attention to the needs of children and families.\" Case management of a family is much more than making sure they have a place to live temporarily, Schonfeld explained. To this end, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is developing a model of case management that provides more com- prehensive services and addresses the needs of children and families Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryCHILDREN AND DISASTERS 19 more appropriately.3 Schonfeld noted, however, that these standards have not yet been broadly adopted. Child Care and Early Education In Section 6, the NCCD recommended that \"Congress and HHS should improve disaster preparedness capabilities for child care,\" including requiring states to include disaster planning, training, and exercising within the scope of minimum health and safety standards for child care licensure or registration, and requiring Head Start Centers to have disaster preparedness capabilities and to provide basic disaster mental health training for their staff. 4 There is some growing interest in disaster preparedness among Head Start Programs. Schonfeld cited as an example a recent workshop sponsored by the American Academy of Pediatrics at the Head Start Leadership Institute in Washington, DC. In addition, ACF issued a proposed regulation that would require emergency preparedness and response planning for providers serving children who are receiving child care development fund assistance. Such planning would include provisions for evacuation and relocati on, sheltering in place, and family reunification. Despite these efforts, most of the recommendations in this section have not yet been implemented, and the state of readiness of child care in early education is a major gap, Schonfeld said. The ongoing concern is that schools, child care, and early education centers are not sufficiently prepared to recover prom ptly from natural disasters and they remain potential soft but high-impact targets for terrorism. Elementary and Secondary Education Moving to Section 7 of the NCCD report, Schonfeld conveyed the commission's concerns about the limite d funds available to improve the preparedness of schools and school districts. The recommendations in this section call for DHS and FEMA to partner with the Department of 3Update: The Disaster Case Management Concept of Operations is now online; see http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohsepr/disaster-case-management (accessed Novem- ber 1, 2013). 4The Head Start Emergency Preparedness Manual can be found at http://eclkc. ohs.acf.hhs.gov/hslc/tta-sy stem/health/ep (a ccessed November 1, 2013).

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary20 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES \"School systems and their students remain unprepared to deal with disasters, whether natural or man-made.\" \u2014David J. Schonfel d Education to provide additional \"funding and other resources to support disaster preparedness efforts of state and local education agencies, including collaborative planning, training, and exercises with emergency management officials.\" The commission also called for funding to states to \"implement and evaluate trai ning and professional development programs in basic skills in providing support to grieving students and students in crisis, and to establish st ate-wide requirements related to teacher certification and recertification\" in these areas. The Readiness for Emergency Management in Schools (REMS) program was highlighted by the NCCD as a worthwhile mechanism for delivering grant funding to school districts for preparedness that should be expanded. However, funding for the REMS grant programs has been eliminated, and Schonfeld noted that there has been little progress toward the goal of implementing or evaluating the training and professional development of educators and other school personnel. At a recent White House event on school preparedness that was held after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, th ere was a clear call from partners to reverse the cuts to the REMS grant program and to expand it substantially, as called for by the NCCD. Unfortunately, Schonfeld said, this is one area where ground has been lost, rather than progress made, and school systems and their students remain unprepared to deal with disasters, whether natural or man-made. Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice The NCCD made several recommendations aimed at ensuring that state and local child welfare agencies, juvenile justice agencies (and their associated court programs), and residential treatment, correctional, and detention facilities that house childre n become adequately prepared for disasters to minimize the impact of these events and to support rapid recovery. Recommendations 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 call for an evaluation of current status; issuing of planning guidance; provision of funding, guidance, and technical assistance; and the establishment of minimal standards of preparedness. Schonfeld said that there has been some review of current preparedness, and the Department of Justice is preparing a pilot competitive grant program to states to support the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryCHILDREN AND DISASTERS 21 development of emergency preparedness plans for juvenile justice facilities. Still, there has not yet b een sufficient response to remedy the gap as called for by the NCCD. Sheltering, Housing, and Evacuation The remaining three groups of recommendations in Sections 9, 10, and 11 address sheltering standards, services, and supplies; housing, including prioritizing the needs of families with children (including those with children who have disabilities or chronic physical or mental health needs) in temporary and long-term disaster housing; and evacuation, including reunification of children with their families after disasters. HHS PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING CHILDREN'S DISASTER HEALTH NEEDS The NCCD recommendations directed toward HHS fall into four key categories: behavioral health; MCMs; physical health, EMS, and transport; and child care and child welfare. To address these, ACF and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) established the Children's HHS Interagency Leadership on Disasters (CHILD) Working Group comprised of members from 18 HHS divisions. The working group was created to comprehensively integrate the disaster-related health and human services needs of children across HHS disaster policy, planning, and operations activities; to assess current capabilities and facilitate coordination at the policy and response levels; and to develop a set of recommendations to enhance departmental efforts (see Box 2-1). An overview of progress by HHS in the four areas was provided by Dan Dodgen, director of the Division for At-Risk Individuals, Behavioral Health, and Community Resilience in ASPR. 5 5Dodgen referred participants to the Divi sion for At-Risk Individuals, Behavioral Health, and Community Resilience website fo r further information: http://www.phe.gov/ abc (accessed September 9, 2013).

First, HHS created and implemented a Disaster Behavioral Health Concept of Operations 6 designed to provide coordination and guidance for federal-level behavioral response. As a result, children's behavioral health is now part of every HHS response and recovery to disasters. For example, HHS provided support in response to the Newtown, Conn-ecticut, shooting, Hurricane Sandy, and the Joplin tornadoes through the 6The HHS Disaster Behavioral Health Concept of Operations is available at http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/planning/ abc/Documents/dbh-conops.pdf (accessed September 9, 2013).

To build capacity, ASPR leadership and NDMS responders have been trained in psychological first aid, the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps includes psychological first aid in all of its field training activities, and a 6-hour, interactive, online psychological first aid course available through National Child Traumatic Stress Network. 7 In 2012, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) launched the Disaster Distress Helpline (DDH), the first hotline dedicated to providing disaster crisis counseling. The DDH offers support via telephone and Short Message Service (SMS) text, and hosted a Twitter chat on helping children and teenagers cope after disasters. The line is always ac tive and ready for use, Dodgen ex- plained, and capacity can be in creased as events happens. Dodgen commended SAMHSA for making the disaster distress line readily accessible via forms of communication that are popular among adolescents (e.g., texting and Twitter). Medical Countermeasures We are beginning to make some real strides in moving forward the MCM enterprise for children, Dodgen said. For example, a pediatric and obstetric integrated program team wa s established to provide guidance to PHEMCE and prioritize gaps related to pediatric and obstetrical needs. There are now a number of pediatric MCM initiatives under way. In May 2013, for example, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) awarded a contract for the development of the antibiotic solithromycin for the treatment of children infected with anthrax, tularemia, or community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Clinical studies have also been funded by the National Institutes of Health and BARDA to support a pediatric indication for midazolam to treat nerve-agent seizures, and they should be widely distributed within stockpiles for children once approved. Though, as benzodiazepines (midazolam family) are commonly used for the treatment of seizure disorders in children, clinical studies on drugs that are not used as often or where effects are less clear could also be illuminating. In addition, the National Institute of Child Health and Hu man Development Pediatric Trials 7The psychological first aid course is av ailable at http://lear n.nctsn.org/course/ category.php?id=11 (accesse d September 9, 2013).

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryCHILDREN AND DISASTERS 25 Network plans to conduct 16 trials in the next 5 years that could enhance pediatric labeling of MCMs. There are also activities aimed at addressing the unique challenges of developing MCMs for children. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration held a public workshop on the Ethical and Regulatory Challenges in the Development of Pediatric Medical Countermeasures. Physical Health, EMS, and Transport Dodgen highlighted several accomplishments in the areas of pediatric physical health, EMS, and transport. The NDMS has developed the capability to deploy pediatric specialists to augment traditional response teams. The intent is to ha ve people with unique expertise who may not need to respond to every emergency setting, but who are available when needed. To help address pediatric patient movement, ASPR hosted two workshops with pedi atric transport stakeholders and additional workshops are planned. To aid reunification, one outcome of the Pediatric Disaster Preparedness Curriculum Development Conference convened by the National Center fo r Disaster Medicine and Public Health was an online module, \"Tracking and Reunification of Children in Disasters: A Lesson and Reference for Health Professionals.\" 8 The ASPR HPP hosted a technical assistance webinar in June 2013 for HPP grantees and health care coalitions on integrating pediatric disaster management into health care system preparedness and medical surge. 9 Approximately 400 people dialed in to participate in the webinar, and the archived webpage received 3,000 vi sits in the first month it was available. A second webinar focused on pediatrics is scheduled for May 2014 through the HPP at ASPR. These are just a few examples of current programs, and Dodgen noted that the goal is not to simply create more federal mechanisms and federal projects, but to involve the stakeholders and people at the local level who will ultimately implement the programs. 8Module is available at http://ncdmph.usuhs.edu/K nowledgeLearning/2012-Learning1. htm (accessed September http://www. phe.gov/Preparedness/pl anning/abc/Pages/ webinar-resources-130620.aspx ( accessed September 9, 2013) along with all of the resources identified, from both federa l agencies and nongovernment partners.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary26 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Child Care and Child Welfare There is a lot of activity on child care and child welfare happening at ACF right now, Dodgen said. For example, ACF has trained all of the nation's State Administrators for Family Violence Prevention and Services on disaster preparedness, incl uding attention to the needs of children exposed to domestic violence. ACF has also trained Head Start executives in preparedness planning. ACF recently collaborated with state and NGO partners via Child Care Task Forces and Coalitions following the Joplin tornadoes and Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy to assess the impacts to systems serving ch ildren and to promote children's resilience and recovery. (Efforts to ward improved child and family welfare during disaster recovery are discussed further in Chapter 8.) Next Steps for HHS HHS has been responsive to the recommendations of the Commission and other stakeholders, a nd has covered a lot of the basic areas, Dodgen said, but there is still work to be done. The CHILD working group has prioritized three additional areas of focus for 2012-2013: children with special health care needs and other subpopulations of children traditionally unde r-represented in planning efforts; pregnant/ breastfeeding women and neonates; and enhancing inter-departmental and NGO collaboration. The working group plans to submit its second progress report to HHS leadership at the end of 2013. In closing, Dodgen said that Assistant Secr etary Lurie and ASPR are committed to ensuring that children are integrated into a ll emergency preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. HHS polici es and programs will continue to emphasize and address the disaster health and human services needs of children and families. He stressed that , in the face of the sequester budget challenges, there is no longer room for isolated projects. Collaboration across federal agencies and with outside stakeholders is essential.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary27 3 Leveraging Health Care Coalitions Highlights of Points Made by Individual Speakers Pediatric surge capacity remains a challenge. Barriers to building capability include lack of understanding among stakeholders of each other's needs and capabilities, lack of local knowledge about available guidance and tools, and cost. A coalition's role is translating across silos, promoting day-to-day pediatric readiness, helping communities navigate through numerous disaster preparedness tools, and partn ering to make the best use of available resources. National neonatal and pediatric disaster drills are needed. This chapter focuses on how best to leverage existing coalitions and collaborations for the benefit of ch ildren. Panelists provided federal, state, and local perspectives on coa lition challenges and best practices, and discussed duality of services and improving everyday capacity. Securing buy-in from important stak eholders and coordinating work across regions and sectors are a few of the challenges discussed, as well as highlighting the need for central coordination and broadening of stakeholders in coalitions past si mply including pediatric providers. Giving an example of ways to augment pediatric surge capacity, Andrew Rucks of the University of Alabama at Birmingham noted that he also serves as director of the Southeastern Regional Pediatric Disaster Surge Network, which currently includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee, and will soon include Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The network is an emerging multi-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The network has developed a mission and is working to operationalize and exercise the surge network, pointing to an earlier referenced challenge about the lack of pediatric focused exercises and drills. There are numerous challe nges to managing this multistate coalition consisting of a wide variety of players, Rucks said. And while regions are becoming better prepared to deal with large-scale events (e.g., hurricanes), Rucks suggested that they are not as well prepared to deal with the smaller-scale issues that overwhelm the needs of one or more local pediatric specialty hospitals. FEDERAL PERSPECTIV E: THE HOSPITAL PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM Richard Hunt, senior medical advisor for the National Health Care Preparedness Programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), provided federal-level perspective on health care coalitions. Currently, th e U.S. health care delivery system is focused on cost reduction. This includes service retraction, which results in just-in-time operating principles and staffing. Although U.S. health systems emergency prepare dness and response mechanisms are established and operational, they are fragmented and are restrained by a just-in-time approach, Hunt said. The country continues to experience overcrowding in emergency departments with limited mechanisms to reallocate patients throughout the hospital or the community. Although the concept of surge capacity has b een discussed for well over a decade, a March 2013 Government Accountab ility Office report still highlights surge capacity as a challenge. Work has been done on allocation of scarce resources and introducing the concept of crisis standards of care, where population outcomes would be optimized over individual patient outcomes (Devereaux et al., 2008; IOM, 2012). Although this difficult conversation is further complicated when children are introduced to the discussion, it is an important piece in planning if a scenario occurred where real limitations were placed on resources or capabilities. Hunt described some of the financial realities of disaster preparedness and response. National health care expenditures grew 4 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryLEVERAGING HEALTH CARE COALITIONS 29 percent to $2.5 trillion in 2009, or $8,086 per person, and accounted for 17.6 percent of gross domestic produc t. Hospital expenditures for 2010 were $814 billion according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Assuming there were 5,754 hospitals in the United States (per the American Hospital Associ ation), the average hospital expend- iture was approximately $141 million that year. In contrast, the total Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) budget for 2012 was $347 million, which Hunt pointed out is 0.0001 percent of overall national health expenditures. With that in mind, Hunt said, the current need is a comprehensive national preparedness and response health care system that is scalable and coordinated to meet local, state, and national needs, and is financially sustainable. This requires a multifaceted effort, including integrating with and improving the efficiency of daily health care delivery, and applying a population-based health care-delivery model for disaster response. Toward that end, having defined health care preparedness capabilities (i.e., goals) and performance measures is very important. Fifteen capabilities for national hea lth care preparedness are outlined by ASPR in the National Guidance fo r Health care System Preparedness (ASPR, 2012). Health care system preparedness is one area where HPP is currently focusing efforts. Hunt described health care coalition development as the foundation for health care preparedness capabilities. The concept is one of inclusiveness, like a web, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Per the ASPR guidance, the list of health care coalition essential partne r memberships includes \"specialty service providers (e.g., dialysis, pediatrics, women's health, stand-alone surgery, urgent care).\" It will be important moving forward for pediatrics to interface with coalitions, and for pe diatric coalitions to interface with the health care preparedness program. Hunt noted that the Pediatric Preparedness Resource Kit 1 released by the American Academy of Pediatrics includes an entire section on pediatric coalitions. Hunt described four key cons iderations for developing a preparedness and response coalition. First, the coalition must be functional (i.e., not simply a mechan ism for further discussions). Second, it is important to consider the per cent of the population covered in a particular area relative to resources (e.g., how a very rural coalition 1Available at http://www.aap.org/en-us/advo cacy-and-policy/aap-he alth-initiatives/ Children-and-Disasters/Documents/PedPreparedn essKit.pdf (accessed September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary30 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES compares to one that covers a much larger percentage of the population). The third consideration is the necess ary linkage of preparedness with daily delivery of health care. Finally, risk needs to be taken into account. One aspect of risk could be, for example, how many coalitions cover a particular earthquake fault line? But another risk consideration is vulnerable or at-risk populations (e.g ., older adults and children). Hunt stressed that ASPR is committed to building functional coalitions for national health care preparedness that not only work, but that will serve children as well. LOCAL PERSPECTIVE: THE CALIFORNIA NEONATAL/PEDIATRIC DISASTER COALITION Patricia Frost, director of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for Contra Costa County Health Services in California, described a local, grassroots coalition-building effort and how coalitions can help overcome barriers to pediatric disaster preparedness. Contra Costa County in California has a population of 1.1 million, with about 250,000 children. A 2008 EMS for Children Program Assessment revealed that the county has lost more than 40 percent of its total pediatric bed capacity in the prior 5 years, and had approximately 1 licensed pediatric bed for every 16,000 children in Contra Costa. No one knew or considered the impact of this to the health system, she said. A primary barrier to building capability, according to Frost, is the lack of understanding among stakeholders of each other's needs and capabilities. Frost observed that many times what one group perceives as simply excuses from another are, in fact, real barriers for them. A major role for a coalition is to translate across the gaps and silos, and to help find workarounds for complex problems. Frost described the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic as a \"pediatric disaster near miss\" that helped launch the California Neonatal/Pediatric Disaster Coalition. 2 The first challenge for the grassroots effort to 2Frost referred participants to the coaliti on's GoogleSite, https:// sites.google.com/site/ pedineonetwork and the Contra Costa Pediat ric Disaster Preparedness Resources website, \"In most communities across the nation, less than four to five critical pediatric patients, per hospital, arriving on the same day would completely saturate the pediatric health care system in that community.\" \u2014Patricia Frost Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryLEVERAGING HEALTH CARE COALITIONS 31 enhance pediatric capacity was to get people's attention. The coalition addressed this by telling a compelling story about the lack of licensed pediatric beds in the state. The state had never done a bed capacity analysis for neonatal and pediatrics, citing lack of funding. Frost found that California and the West Coast's pediatric \"safety net\" consists of about eight key regional centers that handle more than 55 percent of pediatric inpatient care. Every one of these is on a fault line at high risk for earthquakes. If, for example, Southern California lost its infra-structure for neonatal intensive care, providers may have to look as far as Texas to find bed capacity. Another role of the coalition is to promote a strategic plan to improve day-to-day pediatric readiness. We need to plan for those situations that fall in between daily triage, when resources are available relative to patient demand and normal standards of care are applied, and full-scale disaster, when patient needs outstrip resources and crisis standards of care come into play. It does not take much to overwhelm the current system of pediatric care, Frost said. According to her experience, in most communities across the nation, less than four to five critical pediatric patients, per hospital, arriving on the same day would completely saturate the pediatric health care system in that community. Lack of local knowledge about available guidance and tools is another barrier to preparedness. Th e coalition's role is the navigator through numerous (often overlapping) disaster preparedness tools, helping communities understand what they need to prepare for and how. With regard to tools, Frost also a dvocated for the use of communication technology under normal conditions. The goal is to embed technology, telemedicine, and consultation into normal pediatric care because it builds relationships and competencies. This knowledge, shared now, pays dividends when the power is lost later. Cost is an ongoing barrier to prepare dness. The coalition's role is not to raise money for itself, but rather to partner with organizations that have resources, and to direct communities to the training and other resources already available for free. 3 In addition, although hospitals are often competitors in a business sense, they must \"share without regard to turf\" when it comes to readiness. http://cchealth.org/ems/emsc-disaster-prepa re.php, for further information (accessed September 9, 2013). 3Frost cited, for example, the University of New Mexico Pediatric Emergency Online Education Program, available at http://hsc.unm.edu/emermed/PED/education onlineEd.shtml (accesse d September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary32 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Competency requires volume, and everyone can make a contribution, Frost said. The role of the coalition is to help set reasonable expectations, and craft messages to reduce fear. \"Special\" may be interpreted as \"too scary to handle\" for a community hospital, and adult providers may lack confidence in dealing with pediatric patients. Coalitions, both formal and informal, mobilize partners, and small collective actions matter. The California Neonatal/Pediatric Disaster Coalition has grown from a handful of key people to more than 150 champions statewide. Frost concluded noting that we ar e very good at multi-agency and organization mobilization to save one or several children (for example, the rescue of 18-month-old Jessica McClure when she fell 22 feet down an 8-inch-wide well in 1987), but we tend to lose our focus when many more children are involved. Frost suggested that the next priority for the HPP should be a national neonatal and pediatric disaster drill. This, she said, could be the single most important vehicle to improve capability. HOSPITAL PERSPECTIVE: NE W YORK CITY PEDIATRIC DISASTER COALITION On the evening of Saturday, May 1, 2010, a sports utility vehicle packed with explosives was parked near Times Square in New York City, across the street from the theater where the family musical The Lion King was playing. The bomb failed, but had it exploded, there would likely have been numerous children in the area. George Foltin, vice chair of clinical services at Maimonides Infant and Children's Hospital, described a study conducted by the New York City Pediatric Disaster Coalition to determine how many pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds were available in New York City on that day at that time. Although New York has a very sustaina ble and robust health care system and many pediatric intensive care be ds, on that night only 21 percent of the pediatric beds were available, or 32 total beds. This potential disaster, paired with the bed census study, demonstrates the need to develop pediatric critical care surge capacity to increase the number of available beds in an emergency. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryLEVERAGING HEALTH CARE COALITIONS 33 Coalition-Developed Resources During the past decade, there has been a strong coalition between the New York City Department of Health and the health care sector. Because there are now hospitals focused exclus ively on children, general hospitals have probably done the l east thus far to prepare for children. Foltin cited as an example the 2008 development of guidelines to help hospitals prepare to receive children in a disaster. The resource guides general hospitals on elements such as security, how to put a baby in an adult bed, what kind of food and how much should be provided for children, and so forth. A pediatric disaster tabletop exercise was also developed to help hospitals exercise their plans. 4 Another resource the New York coalition developed for out-of-hospital pediatric disaster preparedness describes the elements of disaster planning and management for pre-hospital providers. 5 The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene also directed federal funds for a formalized Pediatric Disaster Coalition of hospitals, public health entities, municipal services, and community groups. The coalition is focused on effectively matching critical assets and resources to victim's needs during and after a large-scale disaster affecting children, neonates, and women in labor. The coalition will also develop and expand ongoing pediatric disaster preparedne ss efforts through advisory and coalition-building activities. Continuing to describe resources his coalition has developed, Foltin explained that a child's chances of survival are heavily dependent on the early chain of events, including triage, tiering, and transport (e.g., whether the child gets access to pediatric expertise right away, or whether they receive interim treatment at a facility not set up to handle children, followed by transport elsewhere). To help address this, the Pediatric Disaster Coalition created new guidelines for first responders, recommending transport of pediatric patients to pediatric receiving hospitals. A memorandum of understa nding was established with the fire 4The hospital guidelines and the tabletop exercise toolkit are available at http:// www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/em/emergency-ped.shtml (ac cessed September 9, 2013). 5Available at http://cpem.med.nyu.edu/teaching- materials/pediatric-disaster-preparedness (accessed September 9, 2013). \"Major pediatric centers must be able to surge as critically ill children are best served at specialty centers.\" \u2014George Foltin Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryLEVERAGING HEALTH CARE COALITIONS 35 In conclusion, there must be a plan and communication, Foltin said. Major pediatric centers must be able to surge as critically ill children are best served at specialty centers. Primary transport should be to these centers, and inter-hospital transporta tion must be in place for children initially transported elsewhere. If this is not possible, general hospitals that are used to serving adults should have plans in place to properly take care of children. Building on just planning, resources, and drills are essential, he noted. Providers who do not routinely care for children often do not understand the subtleties, and many are very intimidated by it. If we do not prepare providers for the challenges and horrors of taking care of large numbers of badly injured children, they will not be able to care for the children successfully (or for adults, or even for themselves).

Engaging community medical practices in preparedness efforts is essential to building community resilience. A systems-based approach is needed to ensure that stakeholders are preparing in the context of other partners in the community, and not in isolation. Individual parents and childr en who experience quarantine or isolation may need behavioral health and other support services to prevent or mitigate traumatic effects from social distancing. State and local preparedness and response plans including pan- demics should include a module of pediatric health and mental/ behavioral health. Bringing in stakeholders and adapting other state resources were key points in Illinois' development of a pediatric annex to their state emergency plan. In order to adequately integrate the needs of children and their families into state and local emergency plans, it is necessary to involve those groups that represent differe nt populations, as well as use best practices or evidence-informed guidelines. This section of the report brings together identified needs of children and families and discusses how to integrate them into municipa l emergency plans. Several examples of issues, including pandemic planning and behavioral impacts, pediatric surge planning, and child care provi der issues are discussed to help augment the material that goes into plans. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary38 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES PROVIDER PERSPECTIVE: INTEGRATING COMMUNITY PEDIATRIC PRACTICES INTO DISASTER PREPAREDNESS Esther Chernak of Drexel University School of Public Health described the development of a strategic plan to integrate pediatric practices into community-wide disaster preparedness. A systems-based approach helped to ensure that practic es were prepared in the context of other partners in the community. The project was conducted by Drexel University in partnership with the Pe nnsylvania chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (PA AAP) a nd was funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health through a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cooperative Agreement. The primary objectives of the project were to identify the current status and needs of pediatric providers in the community with respect to emergency preparedness; identify the expectations of health departments; and formulate recommendations to improve the integration and coord- ination of pediatric providers. In conducting the project, it was assumed that physicians play a key role in promoting personal preparedness and in risk communications to the public (Garrett et al., 2007; Lasker, 2004; Olympia et al., 2010). It was also assumed that practice-level planning and outreach was important to realize the potential of practices, and that working with pediatric practices woul d be a paradigm for other primary care providers in the community. The process was informed by a literatu re review and interviews with thought leaders and stakeholders in pediatrics, public health, emergency management, information technology, human services, health insurance, and schools/child care. The findings, Chernak noted, were not surprising. Most pediatricians had limited understanding of the public health system (e.g., how the agencies are organized, and their capacity, operations, and resources). They wanted a clear identification of their roles in a disaster, and felt that they had subject-matter expertise to share (e.g., pediatrics, understanding of public fears). Many providers simply do not have the time (or interest) in preparedness planni ng, but they were very interested in a just-in-time infrastructure for training during a disaster. They want real-time, pediatric-specific inform ation to be able to ensure the continuity of operations and commun icate with patients. Importantly, pediatricians want information before the public receives it, so that when patients call, they can speak knowledg eably about the issues and impacts. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryAUGMENTING STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANS 39 It was also found that public hea lth departments had a very limited understanding of pediatric practices , including how providers might function in public health emergencies. They failed to recognize the potential of pediatricians for disaster communications during an incident, and overestimated the capacity for outpatient practices to surge. Readiness has been very focused on points of dispensing (PODs) and mass prophylaxis in the first 48 hours of a disaster, with little planning for what happens after the POD closes. Public health departments also do not have an understanding of wher e practices are with regard to implementation of electronic records, including the potential and challenges of electronic health records (EHRs). The first action, in collaboration with stakeholders, was to define the roles and expectations. For most pediatricians, their major role is in their community-based office, providing all aspects of medical care. This offsets the burden on hospitals, par ticularly emergency departments, Chernak noted. They also support the medical countermeasure enterprise, not just by staffing a POD, but by monitoring for drug interactions, adverse events, and outcomes after the POD closes. Providers also have a role in long-term follow-up and mental health support. Key roles for public health departments include local and state leadership, surveillance and investigation, implementation of disease control measures, surge support, and information sharing. The project then developed recommendations for public health departments, pediatricians, and the PA AAP in the areas of continuity of operations and surge capacity building; collaborative planning; bi-directional communications; training; children with special health care needs; and schools and child care programs. Chernak highlighted several of the recommendations that she said were most relevant to health care coalitions (see Box 4-1). Chernak referred participants to a recently released communications tool for pediatric practices 1 that includes fact sheet templates for waiting rooms and websites, phone scripts for voicemail and patient messaging, triage protocols, and social media templates. The PA AAP has been reaching out through webinars addr essing continuity of operations and practices, mental health issues, and children with special health care needs, and is developing a list of pediatric subject-matter experts who can serve as advisors on an ad hoc basis to county health departments and the state health department. 1Available at https://www.portal.state.pa .us/portal/server.pt/document/1337530/final aap_toolkit_5_2_13_.pdf (acce ssed September 9, 2013).

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryAUGMENTING STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANS 41 With regard to the creation of the recommended Child Health Advisory Council for Disasters, Chernak noted that the state has agreed to instead create a working group that will inform the state with respect to pediatric issues. Other initiatives will involve planning with schools and child care programs, participation in regional health care coalitions, and practice-based projects such as exercises with local and state agencies. Chernak cited technology (e.g., EHRs, communications platforms) as one of the major challenges moving forward, and resources are a perpetual challenge. She also hi ghlighted the cultural dissonance between the public health and personal health care systems, and intercounty and interstate differen ces in priorities as challenges to progress. In conclusion, Chernak said that a systems-based approach to thinking about public health and h ealth care services is critical. It is important to understand what various partners do relative to each other, and not just prepare individual entities in isolation. Pediatricians play a unique role in the health of children and families, and in support of schools and child care programs and other community institutions. Engaging community medical practices is essential in efforts to prepare communities and build community resilience. A participant added that pediatricians also need to be in culcated into incident command and operations so that children are not forgotten during the implementation. All panelists discussed further how to get health care systems engaged in preparedness issues. They expressed the importance of taking advantage of that moment in time when people are feeling the impact of lack of preparedness, especially as it affects practice and has financial consequences. For example, after a major storm where practices lose power for 3 to 4 days, providers recognize that they might lose their records, lose $60,000 worth of vaccines, or may not be able to communicate with patients, Chernak sa id. Hunt added that a motivating force for a health care delivery system is the realization that they need to get back to normal business operations as soon as possible. They lose millions of dollars per day by canceling elective surgeries, for example. Frost and Blake agreed, and Frost said that they take advantage of every unfortunate situation in order to point out the pediatric component to it. She reiterated the value of telling a compelling story, noting that the statewide bed capacity analysis she did for California was instrumental in bringing people to the table. Chernak noted that because drawing providers in to preparedness training be fore an event is so challenging, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary42 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AAP is also building capacity to conduct webinars immediately after disasters, lining up subject-matter experts so that they can provide key information to 1,000 or more pediatricians rapidly. EVIDENCE-INFORMED GUIDELINES FOR CHILD-FOCUSED PANDEMIC PLANNING AND RESPONSE Ginny Sprang, executive director of the Center on Trauma and Children at the University of Kent ucky, described the development of evidence-informed disaster guidelines intended to optimize preparedness and response for pediatric populations, and prevent adverse unintended consequences (e.g., panic, noncompl iance, poor behavioral health outcomes). Citing the work of noted sociologist Robert Merton, Sprang said that well-intended policies and plans inevitably generate unintended consequences that cannot always be anticipated (Merton, 1936). Leaders are under great pressure to act very decisively in situations that, by their nature, are unique and transactional. Error is an unavoidable component of all social action. Strategies ge nerally address proximal outcomes and it is difficult to anticipate the undesire d impacts of more distal outcomes. The research for the project \"E vidence-Informed Guidelines for Child-Focused Pandemic Planning and Response\" was done at the University of Kentucky in partnership with the University of Louisville, with funding from the Department of Homeland Security through the Kentucky Critical Infrastructure Program. 2 Based on a systematic literature review, Sprang and collea gues developed a toolkit of mixed- method measures (e.g., interview guides, surveys, focus groups, guides, content analysis templates) to collect information from key stakeholders on the gaps and vulnerabilities in systems. Data were collected from diverse stakeholders in six U.S. cities; Mexico City and Juarez, Mexico; and Toronto, Canada (data collection occurred coincidentally as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza was emergi ng). The findings were used to draft preliminary guidelines which were field tested at the national and 2Sprang referred participants to the full report, available at http://www.uky.edu/CTAC/ sites/www.uky.edu.CTAC/files/NIHS_Del_5i _online_copy_revised__FINAL.pdf (accessed September 9, 2013).

The final recommendations were then formulated and disseminated as a 3-hour Web-based training program.3 Using the University of California, Los Angeles, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD-RI), Sprang and colleagues identified a relationship between a disease containment experience and traumatic stress symptoms. Based on the qualitative responses during focus groups, Sprang said that there is something about the disease containment experience that is stigma tizing and stressful in a way that just having H1N1 or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is not. Parents and children who had no is olation or quarantine experience during either the SARS or H1N1 outbreaks had a mean PTSD-RI score of 5.3, while those who had an isol ation or quarantine experience had a mean score of about 22. The anxiety and panic identified in those affected by a health-related disaster triage is complex, and triage, assessment, and intervention strategies are not tailored to these needs. For example, pediatric behavioral health screening was not routine; screening that was done was not evid ence-based and not consistent; and screening of family members was rare. Screening also occurred more often in hospital settings versus community settings, and screening for traumatic stress reaction was limited. The relationship between pandemic containment and PTSD symptoms is significant, Sprang explained. About 33 percent of the children who experienced quarantine in isolation met the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder based on parent reports, as did 25 percent of parents based on their own self-reports. Sprang also highlighted the correlation between parent and child symptoms; about 86 percent of the parents who met the clinical cutoff score for PTSD had children who also met the cutoff. Of those parents who did not meet the cutoff, only about 14 percent of their children met the cutoff. (Sprang acknowledged the potential for contamin ation of parental perception in the reporting of child symptoms, but noted that young children take behavioral cues from their parents.) These findings suggest that individual parents and children who experience quarantine or isolation may need behavioral health and other support services to prevent or mitigate these traumatic effects. Sprang and colleagues recommended routine peri- and post-pandemic behavioral health assessment, including trauma screening, for parents and youth who experience isolation or quarantin e.

For example, hospitals reported that neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) (which require highly specialized skillsets) were especi ally vulnerable to staff shortages, even under mild pandemic conditi ons. Personnel backup plans were often insufficient as available personnel did not have the specialized expertise. To address this, Sprang and colleagues recommended cross-training for areas of potential shortage and three-deep coverage plans. Prolonged closure of schools creates other vulnerabilities, especially for children who rely on subsidized lunch programs. Sprang noted that few districts were aware of the Pandemic Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (P-SNAP), 4 and most did not have a plan for food distributions if schools were closed 5 days or longer. In this regard, the recommendations call for further training and education about P-SNAP and development of a food distribution plan to accommodate worker illness or unavailability. Need for State and Local Pediatric Module In terms of the state pandemic preparedness and response plans, there was an underlying assumption in the plans that there would be tight coordination across systems, but Sprang noted that frequent staff turnover often results in the exit of responders with pediatric expertise. At the local level, there was an absen ce of key stakeholders in planning, 4\"Section 746 of Public Law 111-80, the Ag riculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 (signed October 21, 2009) authorizes the Secretary of Agricultu re to approve State SN AP agency plans to provide SNAP benefits to house holds including children certified as eligible to receive free or reduced price school lunches who are enrolled in a school or school district that will be or has been closed for at least 5 consecutive days due to a pandemic emergency.\" See http://www.fns.usda. gov/sites/default/files/SP_05_S FSP_03-2010_os.pdf (accessed September 9, 2013).

Activities focused on building resilient response systems occurred ge nerally just before and during a pandemic event, with limited attenti on between events. In addition, most plans were adult-focused, but did not address the needs of parents. Although 36 percent of the state plans acknowledge the need for family-level disaster planning, there was little focus on operations or guidance regarding what the essential elemen ts of a plan might be. Only 20 percent of the plans contained any gu idelines regarding the design, focus, or implementation of behavioral hea lth triage for pediatric populations. In response, Sprang and colleagues in June 2011 highlighted the need for all state and local pandemi c preparedness and response plans to include a module on pediatric health and behavioral health. Behavioral health professionals should be incl uded in the development of these modules. Recommended elements of su ch pediatric-focused behavioral health module include Clearly defined organizational structure for pediatric response coordination. Sample risk messaging targeted to children and families. Psychoeducational materials that are developmentally informed. Alternative behavioral health service delivery options. Listing of pediatric-focused, community-based resources to address psychosocial needs. Strategies for just-in-time of evidence-informed, pe interventions. Criteria for evidence-informed, protocol-driven behavioral health response. Pediatric-specific ethical and legal guidance. DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE PEDIATRIC AND NEONATAL SURGE ANNEX Evelyn Lyons, Emergency Medical Services for Children Manager for the Illinois Department of Public Health, detailed her state's development of a pediatric and neonata l surge annex, an appendix to the state medical disaster plan. The annex, developed with funding from the Hospital Preparedness Program cooperative agreements, provides guid-ance to hospitals and other health ca re personnel in the event of a large surge of pediatric or neonatal patients. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary46 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Illinois is the fifth most populated state in the country, with a total population of 12.8 million, including 2.7 million children (age 15 years and younger). The state has 200 hospitals, 190 of which have emergency departments. Pediatric resources for Illinois children include 15 PICUs and 24 NICUs, 3 of which are actually located in Saint Louis, Missouri, just over the southwest border of the state. Similar to what Frost observed in California, Lyons said that there was a decrease of about 400 licensed pediatric hospital beds within Illinois between 2007 and 2010 (dropping from 2,159 to 1,722). This is particularly concerning in the central and southern part of Illinois, she said, where there are already limited pediatric resources. Following the release of the National Commission on Children and Disasters report in 2010, Illinois convened a stakeholder group to develop a statewide pediatric and neonatal strategic plan addressing medical surge capabilities and health care system preparedness for at-risk populations. Four workgroups were charged with addressing comm- unication, the decision-making process, system decompression, and standards of care. Lyons provided examples of tools developed by each of the working groups. 5 The communications workgroup developed a Pediatric and Neonatal Event Notification Form, a flow chart that guides users through the activation of the surge annex and the notification of key stakeholders and partners. The decision-making process workgroup developed an algorithm to guide requests for pediatric medical resources. The algorithm includes consultation with pediatric care medical specialists. These are physicians and nurses who are not onsite, but who provide consultation and guidance at the state level in the even t of a surge of pediatric patients. The working group defined the roles, responsibilities, and educational requirements of these experts, and developed just-in-time training that these consultants could utilize during an event. The system decompression workgroup was responsible for dev- eloping a method to decompress tertiary care centers. In the event of a large pediatric surge, pediatric tertia ry care centers need to be reserved for more critically ill and injured ch ildren, and children with conditions that are less urgent may be able to be moved to community hospitals. Hospitals were asked to self-select from the following categories to describe themselves: 5All tools referenced can be found in the \"I llinois Department of Public Health ESF-8 Plan, Pediatric and Neonatal Surge Anne x Attachments\" as of September 2013.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryAUGMENTING STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANS 47 Category one, pediatric tertiary care centers with PICUs and NICUs that care for any level of patient; Category two, community hospitals with some pediatric services for children ages 0 to 12 years (including emergency de-partments approved for pediatric level); Category three, community hospitals with no pediatric or neonatal capabilities that could accept pediatric patients ages 12 years and older; and Category four, community hospitals with nurseries that can manage pediatric patients ages 0 to 1 year old. Lyons noted that the system is based on the decompression model developed by Frost for California, showing the benefit of collaboration between states. Finally, the standards of care workgroup developed a method to track pediatric patients and aid in the reunification of children with their families. They also designed an obj ective system to triage pediatric patients to tertiary care centers, and a mechanism for communicating patient information betwee n hospitals and with the pediatric care medical specialist. In addition the workgroup developed a series of patient care guidelines for hospitals less familiar w ith pediatric patients, advising them on care for the first 96 hours after an event, or until they are able to route the children to a higher level of care or to specialty care as needed. Care guidelines cover, for example, burn care, newborn care, premature newborns, radiation, shocks, and ot her potential pediatric scenarios. Stakeholders were key to the whole process, Lyons asserted. The process was also advanced by adapting other state resources, such as the Contra Costa County Decompression Model and New York's hospital guidelines for pediatric preparedness. The pediatric annex also serves as a framework for other at-risk populati ons such as burn surge. There is still work to be done, however. The next steps, Lyons said, emphasizing the theme of drills, are to exercise and test the annex, and modify as needed, and to work with regional health care coalitions to integrate these pediatric concepts into regional planning. Coordination of resources, patient tracking, and liabilit y issues also need to be addressed. Considerations for children's need s can come from various sectors and organizations. Speakers in this session noted that adapting resources from other states and jurisdictions like Illinois can be helpful if resources are strained and beginning a brand new plan is not feasible. Also, including research and information gathered from focus groups can help Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary48 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES to ensure additions to plans have the correct personnel identified and the right inclusions. Finally, Anderson reiterated, breaking down silos and fostering relationships among public health, pediatric providers, and researchers can lead to better response when needed.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary49 5 Financing Health Care for Children in Emergencies Highlights of Points Made by Individual Speakers Investments in improved day-to-day operations for children can also provide extraordinary benefits for em ergency preparedness (dual use). Private practice pediatricians already do many of the activities needed in a disaster on a daily basis, yet they are essentially left out of all phases of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. Children are covered by many forms of private and public insurance and there is no single database of children's health information, making data collection and analysis challenging. State-to-state differences in coverage levels and laws make it challenging to develop broad solutions to payment for children's health services. In addition, many children cross state lines for care. Private insurers can be key partners in disaster preparedness and response in many ways, from waiving copays to rebuilding lost patient health records or tracking patient transport from claims data to providing medically trained volunteers and building space. Reimbursement pays for intervention. Any time spent away from seeing patients is lost revenue for a private practitioner. As for-profit entities, private practice providers are not eligible for grant money from the Department of Health and Human Services or for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance. In this section of the report, panelists representing a health system, an insurer, a hospital, and community practice offer their perspectives on the challenges of funding preparedness activities and response. Session chair John Wible, formerly with the Alabama Department of Public Health, offered his own recommendations for several activities an Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary50 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES advocacy group could undertake in this area. For example, he suggested becoming familiar with the State Medicaid Agency's policy on out-of-state reimbursement, and working with the agency on cooperation and reimbursement for both in-state a nd out-of-state care. Educating and encouraging providers close to state borders to sign up for both states' Medicaid network was another consideration along with drafting a model state Pediatric Emergency Preparedness Act to present to state legislators. Finally, he said, working with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to help load the Disproportionate Share Hospital formula in favor of hospitals that join a regional disaster compact would be a good effort that could benefit from advocacy. The rest of this section gives varying financial perspectives of preparedness financing related to children, including the federal level, private insurer, hospital association, and private practice provider. Their considerations and suggestions can help to understand the biggest challenges in this area and where the opportunities for improvement lie. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM POLICY Emergency preparedness is built on the strength of everyday health care systems, and the financial stability and sustainability of private- sector health care delivery systems is an essential component of the health security of the nation, said Gregg Margolis, director of the Division of Health System Policy at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. More than 90 percent of the health care delivered in the United States, both routine and during disasters and public health emergencies, is delivered in the private sector. Health care financing is complex, Margolis said, and there are disparities in the financial stability of various health systems in the United States. Some health care systems report revenue minus expenses of hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Other health care systems, often those that serve vulnerable populations, are much less financially stable. Disasters disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, and pediatric populations in particular, and Margolis emphasized the need to address the financial stability of safety net providers that will be further stressed during public health emergencies and disasters. Disasters affect the entire health care system. Although there is much discussion about emergency care or trauma care systems, a public health emergency also impacts the primary care system, long-term care, nursing Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFINANCING HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN IN EMERGENCIES 51 homes, behavioral health, ambulatory care, and specialty care. There are considerable threats or costs to a h ealth care system during a disaster, for example, unanticipated expenses, busin ess interruption, lost revenue, lost workforce, increased proportion of uncompensated care, and liability. However, disasters are low-frequency events, and low-financial-return types of investments. It can be ve ry difficult to convince health care administrators to invest their limited resources in disaster preparedness when they are inundated by other institutional priorities that have a high probability of being used and will ge nerate high returns on investment (e.g., imaging technologies, laboratory services). One approach to paying for preparedness is through grant funding. Another way to fund preparedness is as part of the cost of doing business. In a fee-for-service environment, where volume generates revenue through reimbursement, a small fraction of every dollar generated goes toward paying for preparedness. However, as noted above, many programs compete for a portion of this small fraction. Margolis suggested that payment/reimbursement for care during disasters (especially emergency or trauma services) could create a revenue source. But disasters disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, which are disproportionately self-pay or Medicaid patients. Shifting the Mindset The challenge, Margolis said, is sh ifting the financial mindset from emergency preparedness as an investment, to emergency preparedness as insurance. How do we make emergency preparedness an integral part of the entire U.S. health care system , beyond the emergency care system, critical care, and emergency medical services? Margolis suggested that a successful business case for emergency preparedness involves decreasing the cost and increasing the value of preparedness. As the health care system evolves from a fee-for-service, volume-based reimbursement system, to a value-based reimbursement system, how do we ensure that preparedness is part of the value equation? One mechanism to increase value is to focus on activities that build from and leverage day-to-day functions to strengthen preparedness and response. As an example, Margolis pointed to how investments in health information technology infrastructure have improved day-to-day operations but have also provided extraordinary benefits for emergency preparedness. To decrease the cost of emergency preparedness on individual facilities, Margolis Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary52 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES called for increased collaboration, coalition building, and new partnerships, so that the burden is sh ared by all of the institutions when a disaster or public health emergency affects a community. Margolis also described a model of \"coopetition\" that has been very successful in the airline industry. In this model, organizations that normally compete against each other for market share of their services agree to cooperate in certain defined spaces for the advancement of all. In health care, emergency preparedness could be one such area for coopetition. The task moving forward, Margolis reiterated, is to think not only about how to build a financially sustainable health care system, but how to ensure that emergency preparedness is an integral part of the entire evolving health care system. PRIVATE INSURERS Robert Smith, senior medical director for the central region of United Healthcare Clinical Services, began by clarifying that UnitedHealth Group is both an insurer, through its UnitedHealthcare division, and a health and wellness company, through its Optum division. Together, these two divisions employ more than 133,000 staff, including 27,000 physicians, nurses, and other c linical practitioners, and 12,000 technologists. United manages more than $300 billion in health care annually, and invests more than $2 billion in technology and new development. United delivers health care through the management of medical groups and hospice, and thr ough direct clinical, pharmacy, and health financial services. Overall, United serves 83 million consumers, 777,000 care providers, and 250,000 plan sponsors. Smith listed some of the many ways that health care for a child is paid for. Employer-based insurance pr ograms can be fully insured plans with coverage provided by a majo r insurer (e.g., UnitedHealthcare, Anthem, Cigna) or they can be self-funded plans where the employer hires a firm to manage the transactions for them (as is done by the federal government). Smith added that self-insured employers have a lot of control over the process. Other examples include individual policies, self-paid policies, Medicaid, state health insurance programs, military health care, the Indian Health Service, and programs for children with special needs or those under the care of the state (e.g., foster children, those in the juvenile justice system). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFINANCING HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN IN EMERGENCIES 53 The system of payment is complex, which makes it difficult to evaluate data from across the nation re garding coverage. Smith used data from the Kaiser Family Foundation rega rding coverage of children ages 0 to 18 to highlight some of the disparities in coverage. In Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Utah, for example, 64 percent of children are covered by employer-based programs, and in New Hampshire is it 68 percent. In Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, it is 38 percent or less. Differences in coverage levels and laws from state to state make it challenging to develop broad solutions to payment for children's health services. In addition, many children cross state lines for care. Large numbers of children are covered by pr ivate plans, and it can be difficult to coordinate between carriers, and difficult to identify the responsible parties. Additional challenges to pa yment for children's health services listed by Smith include the lack of population-based health system responses, and lack of accountable organizations for care and financing. He added that the effectiveness and adequacy of public-private partnerships is highly variable, and the needs and expectations exceed the ability to respond of any single organization. Smith called out several key differences between private and public insurance that are important in di sasters. In private insurance, the eligibility of a child for payment of care depends on the employment of parents. In the public sector payment is independent of parental employ- ment. Importantly, some items (e.g., dental needs, therapy, private duty nursing) are quite commonly paid for by public coverage, but are subject to restrictions and limits, or not cove red at all by private insurance. In a disaster, the majority of children may be covered by employer or individual insurance; however, they may become separated from their parents. These children are not likely to have identification or a health insurance card in their pocket, and ma y not be able to provide accurate health histories. Their clinical records are likely with private practitioners and may be inaccessible or destroyed, and as such, immediate specialized care may not be available to them. Roles of Insurance Providers in Disasters As an insurer, Smith said that a company like UnitedHealth Group has a variety of resilience and response roles, including providing for the safety of its employees. From a business perspective, the company Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary54 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES strives to minimize service disruptions, preserve customer information and organizational assets (including people, process, technology, and information), and continue to comply with laws and regulations regarding continuity of operations. The UnitedHealth Group business continuity plans focus on critical business functions and planning for the worst-case scenario so that the organization can react quickly and efficiently, even in the face of loss of its own critical systems, resources, or facilities. Because private insurers control a significant portion of health care dollars as the fiduciary representatives of employers of parents, they can have significant involvement in disast er preparedness and response. For example, insurers can waive the copay for prescriptions refill for medications lost in the disaster. They can cover visits to out-of-network providers at the higher in-network pa yment levels. If provider records are destroyed or the provider cannot be found, Smith said that United-Healthcare can compile a profile of a given child's medical situation by using information from health claims such as diagnoses and prescriptions. Claims data can also be used to track patient transport and reunite families. As a large employer and business, insurers have medical staff who can volunteer, and faciliti es that can serve as shelters or auxiliary medical sites. Smith stress ed the importance of public-private partnership and urged pl anners to include insurers in preparedness discussions. HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION The mission of the Children's Hospital Association is to advance children's health through the quality , cost, and delivery of care in association with the 225 member hospitals, said Amy Knight, senior vice president of the Children's Hospital Association. Members include freestanding children's hospitals as well as pediatric units within larger hospitals or health systems. Many of the children cared for by the network of children's hospitals ha ve complex medical conditions, and many are children who are covered by Medicaid. These populations are particularly vulnerable in a disaster. Knight listed the primary activities of the Children's Hospital Association as public policy and advocacy; data, research, and analysis; peer networking and knowledge ex change among members; clinical quality and operational improvements; and purchasing and cost contain-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFINANCING HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN IN EMERGENCIES 55 ment initiatives. Knight noted that on e of the challenges with regard to data and analysis is that the pedi atric population is covered by various forms of private and public insurance and there is no single database of children's health information. Day-to-day issues drive hospital priorities and often trump planning and prepare dness activities, Knight explained. Those issues and priorities include, for example, patient safety; Medicaid (and paying for children's care in the face of Medicaid budget cuts); workforce, including subspecialty r ecruitment and training; value (i.e., competitiveness on quality and cost of care); market strategy; and organizational survival. Advancing preparedness can be overwhelming for children's hospitals, in large part because they ar e only part of the system. They are largely focused on acute care (i.e., re sponse) rather than preparedness. Similarly, reimbursement pays for intervention, not for prevention or preparedness. The availability of resources, both internally and ex-ternally, is a perpetual challenge, and she concurred with Margolis that capital investment decisions are generally for something that has an immediate return on investment. Population health and accountable care are in nascent stages of development, Knight said, as there are very few children's hospitals, and most child ren are not treated at children's hospitals. Knight suggested that one potentia l driver of change in the way children's hospitals invest in pr eparedness is their expanding ac- countability, influence, and control across the care continuum. External incentives and expectations also drive change (e.g., reimbursement, grants, regulations, certifications, sta ndards). Ultimately, current events are major drivers of change and force people to think differently about preparedness. INDEPENDENT PRIVATE PRACTICE PROVIDERS The majority of pediatric care is primary care provided by pediatricians, as well as family practitioners, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, said Scott Needle, a pediatrician in the Healthcare Network of Southwest Florida (Phillips et al., 2005). There are also cognitive subspecialists and surgi cal subspecialists who focus on pediatric care. The majority of pediatric care takes place in independent private practices, which Needle said can range from solo practices to \"super groups\" such as Pediatric Associates in South Florida, which has Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary56 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES 180 pediatricians at 25 sites. Pediatric care also takes place in health care systems, hospital-owned practices, and federally qualified health centers. Medicaid is the single largest payer of children's health care, covering 39 percent of the children in the United States. Children in families who do not qualify for Medicaid, but still have limited income, may be covered by the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Many children are covered in some fashion by private insurers, and some are self-paying. Children are not covered by Medicare, Needle reminded participants. This is an important point because Medicare is a federal government program with uniform coverage across the country, while Medicaid, although funded in part by the federal government, is run by the states and coverage can vary. After Hurricane Katrina, for example, Medicare incentive payments were made available for some of the affected providers and institutions . Any kind of comparable proactive change to Medicaid is much more difficult to effect because four agencies are involved in the decisions (CMS, Congress, the state legislature, and the state Medicaid authority). Medicaid is generally one of the lowest-paying payers for most pediatric providers, Needle said. The current payment system is fee-for-service, which means the pediatrician is paid for face-to-face encounters with the patients. Any time spent away from seeing patients (such as giving a talk at an Institute of Me dicine workshop, or spending time on preparedness) is lost revenue. In addition, payments are generally preset and inflexible and there is no ability to recoup losses suffered by a practice during a disaster. There are also many administrative and regulatory burdens which can be particularly challenging for small practices with limited administrative staff. Challenges in Engaging Providers Needle continued by noting that outside agencies attempting to engage pediatricians in preparedness face several challenges. First, pediatric providers are fragmented, diverse, and independent. There is no central agency or authority through which on can reach out to all providers. For example, although The Joint Commission does have outpatient certification, the average pediatrician has no incentive or reason to participate. Office-based providers are also for-profit entities, and Needle explained that they are not eligible for grant money from the Department of Health and Human Services or other agencies unless there Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFINANCING HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN IN EMERGENCIES 57 is a specific provision. In addition, the Stafford Act does not allow for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance directly to for-profit businesses in a disaster. The net result is that office-based providers are essentially left out of all phases of disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. This is a significant concern because providers have a significant role in the community. For the majo rity of people, an office-based provider is their first point of contact with the health care system. Pediatricians hope to see 100 percent of their patients in the office at least once every year for annual well care, or routine acute or chronic care. Care provided in the office can often prevent someone from having to go to the emergency room, Needle said. In addition to providing care that can lead to overall health system cost savings, providers also have a positive economic impact on their communities. Needle cited an American Medical Association (AMA) study that found that, on average, each individual office-based physicia n generates about $100,000 in state and local tax revenue each year (AMA, 2011). In aggregate, office-based physicians are a tremendous part of local and state economies in the United States. In 46 out of 50 states, for example, physician practices across all specialties paid out more in employee wages and benefits than the hospital systems in the same states. In some states, physicians pay out more in employee wages and benefits than hospitals, universities, home health care agencies, nursing homes, and legal facilities combined in the same states. As discussed earlier by Chernak (see Chapter 3), physicians also have a significant role to play in a disaster. Many of the activities necessary in response to a disaster ar e already done every day by the office-based pediatrician (e.g., communication, public health surveill-ance, vaccines, longitudinal care, ment al and behavior health). This is dual use capacity waiting to be tapped, he said. Needle added that office- based providers are key partners in a disaster for the management of children with special health care needs. Opportunities for Preparedness Involving private practice pediatricians in preparedness, response, and recovery will require financial and material assistance. Needle suggested that there are some current opportunities that can be leveraged for preparedness. For example, th e meaningful use standards for Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary58 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES electronic health records (EHRs) allows providers to earn incentive payments, and increases the functionality of their EHR systems. The Affordable Care Act does not address preparedness per se, but the Medicaid parity to Medicare provision does allow for higher Medicaid payment rates, which could create more possibilities for preparedness. The patient-centered medical home model of care fulfills many of the criteria for disaster-based capabilities. Finally, accountable care organiz- ations are moving health care toward a value-based continuum of care, which also means a shift toward population-based or community pediatric care, creating the potential to help many more children, Needle said. It also provides the opportuniti es for collaboration, networking, and data collection. Other opportunities include community coalitions, and networks to share resources and create economies of scale. Needle also suggested recovery memoranda of understanding or contracts that could pass on Stafford Act disaster recovery funds to office-based practices, perhaps similar to how for-profit debris removal services are contracted by the state for disaster services. Bruce Clements of the Texas Department of State Health Services raised an additional financial issue for private providers. He relayed the concerns of a private provider following Hurricane Katrina who felt that the disaster clinics were putting the provider out of business. States are good at quickly deploying resources when needed, but deciding when is the right time to demobilize medical assets post-disaster is a very difficult decision, Clements said. It is a delicate balance between supporting the community and threatening the current infrastructure. Needle concurred noting that the free clinics were often the only source of care in the first few days to weeks after Hurricane Katrina. But as time went on, patients wondered why they should pay a $20 copay at their providers office when they can go to the free clinic instead. Experience from Haiti and other disasters shows that staying too long can set up this care conflict and actually undermine the self-sufficiency of the local health care system. Needle suggested the need for a regional health care coordinator: someone who could coordinate and assess the health care situation from the integrated system as a whole, and better define current needs. Moving forward, coordinating the needs of children through private practice providers, private in surers, hospitals, and federal-level policy makers could help to alleviate the disjointed framework that currently plagues reimbursement and finance for children's care after disasters.

The spiritual and religious needs of faith communities are generally lacking in mass care and mass fa tality planning, which can have detrimental effects on children. Including spiritual and religious groups in planning can also build a better communication network to families. Greater religious literacy and competency is needed in emergency management and public health; specific consideration should be placed on the needs of children in disasters and the effects of emotional and spiritual trauma. Youth who are trained in preparedness become more resilient and are highly effective messengers, en gaging their peers, parents, and other adults. Typically, in planning stages, public health and emergency planners will include partners within their sectors or other leaders of government who are involved or directly related to formulating a successful response. However, with certain sections of the population, children especially, including nontraditional community partners can allow for better and more comprehensive planning and response. In this chapter, some ex-amples of nontraditional partners are explored, from child care providers to those who serve special populations of children such as individuals with disabilities, faith communities, and engaged youth.

PREPAREDNESS ISSUES FOR CHILD CARE Linda Smith, Deputy Assistant Secretary and Inter-Departmental Liaison for Early Childhood Development at the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), provided an overview of child care in the United States and highlighted some of the preparedness issues for child care at the federal, local, and provide r levels. Painting a picture of child care providers across the country, Smith explained that there are about 2.1 million child care workers in the United States, with an annual turnover rate of about 30 percent. Average salary for a child care worker is $21,000 per year, which Smith pointed out is poverty level for a family of three. Child care workers are 98 percent female, many have only a high school education or less, and half are eligible for public assistance. Roughly 12 million children in the United States aged 5 years old and younger are in child care. One million children are in centers, about 250,000 are in family home-based child care, and the rest are in some form of in-home or relative care. Child care takes place in neighbor-hoods, strip malls, and churches. It is for-profit and nonprofit. Child care is not a universal system, Smith stressed. Smith described several examples of child care-related activities at the federal level. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released a recovery fact sheet on public assistance for child care services to help the public to understand what FEMA can and cannot do with regard to child care in the aftermath of a disaster. 1 FEMA and ACF also sent a joint letter to state governors asking them to include child care in their state emergency plans. 2 When child care is not included in the plans, the providers are not eligible for FEMA reimbursement, making recovery even more difficult. At the local level, it is important for first responders to know where child care is taking place in their co mmunities. To help with this, the federal government has funded some projects to map child care in communities, Smith noted. It is also important to back up the local data 1See http://www.acf.hhs.gov/s ites/default/files/occ/fema_public_assistance_for_child_ care_services.pdf (accessed October 28, 2013). 2The FEMA ACF letter can be found at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/p rograms/occ/resource/ acf-and-fema-joint-letter-to-state- governors (accessed October 28, 2013).

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryBROADENING STAKEHOLDERS INVESTED IN CHILDREN 61 regarding children in child care. A child care provider may have parents in their database, and a city may have child care providers in a database, but this needs to be backed up and remotely available so that it is accessible when needed. Finally, at the provider level, Smith reiterated, preparedness is \"more than a fire drill.\" Providers need assistance in developing plans and Smith noted several specific needs, listed below: A call-in system: Child care providers can contact a central location to report their status during a disaster. Age-specific materials: These are currently lacking and could be useful for providers when working with young children who have been traumatized. Up-to-date information from parents (e.g., how to reach them in an emergency, medications the child may need to have if evacuated). Funding for preparedness activities: Given the limited income of a child care provider, this is especially needed. Although needs and gaps exist, child care remains a critical component of response and recovery. Parents need to clean up, pick up, move or rebuild, stand in lines for assi stance, and return to work. At the same time, child care providers are also trying to rebuild their home or business. Providers themselves are part of the impacted community and are also traumatized. Providers are not automatically trained to deal with traumatized children. Facilities may be damaged and closed, and if a facility is closed for 2 or 3 months, it may go out of business. In closing, Smith referred participants to emergency standards for child care developed by Save the Children and the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (now Child Care Aware). 3 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Among many other organizations, FEM A has recently embraced and encouraged a \"whole community\" approach when it comes to emergency planning and response and recovery . Parallel with that concept, a continuous theme throughout the workshop was that the involved 3Available at http://www.naccrra.org/sites/defa ult/files/publications/naccrra_publications/ 2012/protectingchildreninchildcareemergenc ies.pdf (accessed September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary62 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES stakeholders in planning discussions need to be broadened past that of just pediatricians and child-focused hospital coalitions. Stakeholders should include organizations and repr esentatives across a ll sectors that work or interact with children, including schools, youth groups, religious organizations, and others. This sec tion brings together nontraditional partners who represent community groups that can be leveraged for better community engagement and buy-in and improved risk com-munication and message dissemination. Planning for the Needs of People with Disabilities Easter Seals is a social service organization focused on providing services and support to people with disabilities. Patricia Wright, national director of autism services at Easter Seals, said that in 2012, the organization provided direct service to 1.6 million people with disabilities in the United States, more than half of whom were children. Wright listed 13 categories of disability: specific learning disabilities, speech or language impairments, intellectual disability, emotional disturbance, hearing impa irments, orthopedic impairments, other health impairments, visual im pairments, multiple disabilities, deaf- blindness, autism, traumatic brain injury, and developmental delay. Wright noted that the needs of those with physical disabilities or orthopedic impairments are often raised in preparedness planning discussions, but learning, intellectual, emotional, and speech and language disabilities are also prominent in society. People with disabilities have unique needs; for example, children with autism are subject to wandering. Many children with intellectual disabilities also have parents with intellectual disabilities who will need services and support. Wright listed several resources available specifically for people with disabilities. The Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) has developed specific tools for use w ith individuals who have complex communication needs, including, for example, a universal comm-unication access board that uses pictograms and pictures for communication. 4 The universal design of such devices makes them useful not only for communication with people who are nonverbal or have low literacy rates, but also with people who speak other languages. 4RERC resources available at http://aac-re rc.psu.edu/index.php/pages/show/id/4 (ac- cessed September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryBROADENING STAKEHOLDERS INVESTED IN CHILDREN 63 Another tool is a \"go bag\" filled w ith the unique items a person with a disability might need to take with them in an emergency (e.g., a communication board, medicines and supplies, food, clothing). Relaxation techniques are also useful for people with disabilities. The Oregon Health Science University (OHSU) and the Green Mountain Emergency Preparedness Project at the University of Vermont also have emergency preparedness toolkits for people with disabilities. 5 Wright urged state and local planners to include people with disabilities or their representatives in planning groups. Organizations with disability expertise to share in clude, for example, the University Centers for Excellence in Developm ental Disabilities, Family Voices, Community Council on Developmental Disabilities, and Centers for Independent Living. Engaging Faith Communities The American religious landscape is a mosaic, as diverse as the population, said Peter Gudaitis, chief response officer for New York Disaster Interfaith Services and president of the National Disaster Interfaiths Network. About 90 perc ent of Americans say they are religious or spiritual, and 43 percent of Americans say that they attend worship services regularly at approximately 345,000 U.S. houses of worship. The United States is the most Christian country in the world. Eighty percent of Americans self-identify as Christian, although the percentage is decreasing due to de mographic shifts in the population. Today, for example, there are more Muslims in the United States than there are Episcopalians and Presbyterians. Americans are connecting with their religious institutions as places of learning and communication, and Gudaitis added that activities such as religious education, Bible study, and youth groups probably account for the most significant percentage of institutional rela tionships outside of schools. Faith communities have historically responded to disasters and human suffering. There is growing interest from government for greater faith community engagement, and a growing interest from and need for faith communities to work with government on disasters. There are 5The (acce ssed September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary64 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES significant gaps between these two entities, compounded by what Gudaitis described as an \"extraordinary lack of religious literacy and competency.\" Religious competency, Gudaitis explained, is knowing how to navigate and engage each faith community (and individual adherents) competently and respectfully, as a trusted, knowledgeable, and effective partner. Religious literacy is having a basic understand- ing of the history, sacred texts, beliefs, and rituals (including diet, clothing) of multiple faith traditi ons, and the ability to understand the intersection of religions and social, political, and cultural life. The spiritual and religious needs of the faith communities are generally lacking in mass care and mass fata lity planning, Gudaitis said. If a Muslim family entered a shelter, for example, would the staff know that the men and women may want to she lter separately, what Halal food is, and whether or not Kosher food would be acceptable instead? Even if the sleeping areas of the shelter were separated by gender, it may still be unacceptable for the women and men to have to walk past each other to the bathrooms. Helping to Improve Planning Gudaitis drew from the objectives and recommendations of a project on faith communities and disasters that he has worked on with the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at the University of Southern California (funded by the California Emergency Management Agency). To improve disaster planning for children, he said, we need greater religious literacy and competency in emergency manage ment and public health; competent government outreach to congregatio ns, faith-based organizations, and religious families; and education fo r religious leaders on the needs of children in disasters and the effects of emotional and spiritual trauma. Disaster planning for children should include faith-based risk communication and public service announcements oriented to the full range of children's ages and/or th eir caregivers, Gudaitis continued. Religious leaders need information on how to care effectively for children and their congregation, and how to educate parents and their caregivers to care for children in disasters, particularly in minority, immigrant, or non-English-speaking communities. All disaster mental health planning should include the spiritual needs of children and mass care, and mass fatality plans should provide specific direction for the care and disposition of children from religious families. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryBROADENING STAKEHOLDERS INVESTED IN CHILDREN 65 Gudaitis referred participants to a series of tip sheets developed by the National Disaster Interfaith Networ k for religious leaders to help them address needs of religious children and families.6 The back page of each \"Be a Ready Congregation\" tip sheet also includes information on training resources or education resources. Examples shown were tip sheets addressing children in a disaster and an active shooter in a house of worship. There are also a series of tip sheets for faith community partners which are competency guid elines on issues such as sheltering and mass care of different faith communities with unique dress, diet, or sheltering requirements (e.g., Buddhi st, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh). Information on how to support childre n of those faith traditions is included as well. In closing, Gudaitis recommended a text by Stephen Prothero, Religious Literacy , to those interested in learning more about religious literacy and competency. Engaging Youth Ashley Houston, a high school student and member of FEMA's Youth Preparedness Council, shared her personal experience and perspective on engaging youth in preparedness. Houston became involved in the youth council through a school club called Health Occupations Students of America. Children can play an important role during emergencies and should be a part of all disaster planning, preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, she said. Communities and towns should target teens through schools and community programs because youth who are trained in preparedness become more resilient in actual disasters. Youth are also highly effective messengers who can be used to reach their parents as well as other adults. In addition, engaging youth today will ensure future gene rations of prepared adults. The FEMA Youth Preparedness Council gives teenagers an opportunity to voice their opinions, share their experiences, and offer ideas and solutions to help strengthen the nation's resiliency for all types of disasters. The council is comprised of 13 diverse leaders from across the country, ranging in age from 13 to 17, who have demonstrated a willingness to represent the youth perspective on emergency prepared-ness and to take information back to their communities. Members of the Youth Preparedness Council work on yearlong projects, help to set up 6More information on the tip sheets for congreg ations and community partners is avail- able at http://www.n-din.org (accessed September 9, 2013).

Houston d escribed some of her activities, including coordinating and participa ting in teen Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) demonstrations at local events in her community, and completing the necessary training to become a CERT instructor as well as organizing a course for teens at her school. Because youth play such an important role in outreach to other audiences, Houston recommended reaching out to them through their school programs. School drills, for example, help prepare children for real emergencies, and they share this information at home with their parents. Most schools also have student resource officers who are law- related counselors and educators in the school who can share information. School clubs are a big part of student's lives and are also a good way to reach students. Houston also offered suggestion on ways to connect with youth outside of school s through youth organizations (e.g., Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scout s of America), church groups, and emergency response programs (e.g., CE RT and Teen CERT). Finally, Houston said that Twitter and social media are tools that can be used to connect with and involve youth in preparedness. She added that members of the Youth Preparedness Council have been teaching their advisors how youth use social media tools and how social media can better be used for outreach. Engaging different parts of the community for their input on planning and assistance in outreach can be a great tool for jurisdictions as they try to promote more awareness and identify gaps in the response and recovery frameworks.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary67 7 Planning for Children and Families During Disaster Response Highlights of Points Made by Individual Speakers Most people with disabilities do not have acute medical needs. Planning to meet the access and functional needs of disaster survivors in general population shelters can help to preserve limited acute care resources for those with a true medical need. In the aftermath of a disaster, primar y care providers are likely to be the first, and possibly the only, responders to provide mental health services to children. Professional staff may be impacted directly themselves and may have some of the same behavioral and ment al health needs as those they serve. A single disaster event is really par t of a cascade of other events in a child's life and results in cu mulative impact and stress. Stigma related to mental health is a still barrier, even in times of national crisis. Temporary child care in shelters and service centers allows parents to attend to business, such as applying for aid and other recovery activities. Include older children with disabilities in the process when planning for their evacuation and transportation during an emergency. They know what works for them and what does not. Planning for the specific needs of children and families in response to disasters, including functional needs, nutritional needs, family reunification, and temporary child care, is extremely important when thinking about community plans. Th ese specific needs are discussed Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary68 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES throughout this chapter in addition to real-world experiences that support these needs. Participants also share best practices and potential strategies for response. Examples include regional preparedness, infection pre-vention, sheltering, tracking, evacua tion and transportation of children with disabilities, and novel training techniques. CHILD AND FAMILY NEEDS DURING MASS CARE AND SHELTERING OPERATIONS Session chair Kari Tatro, executive vice president of Emergency Management Operations for BCFS Health and Human Services, 1 said that meeting the needs of children in disasters presents a unique set of planning considerations. She gave an overview of logistical requirements and cultural considerations regard ing children with medical needs, shelter placement, unaccompanied childre n, children in state or federal custody, the impact of stress and trauma on children, and neonatal transport and services. When facility plans cannot be implemented, there need to be alternative plans for evacu ation, alternate care sites, and field triage sites. To meet the logistical needs of children, planners need to consider the availability of items in shelters such as cribs and crib linens, clothing, food, eating utensils, diapers, pediatric durable medical equipment, and pediatric consumable medical supplies. There are also cultural considerations when sheltering children, especially as they relate to food service. Change in diet (e.g., providing cow's milk to children who have only ever consumed almond milk) can lead to gastrointestinal disorders, vomiting, and diarrhea. From a medical perspective, there must be access to pediatric medical equipment and medication dosag es. Planning considerations also need to include a process for making medical decisions for unaccompanied children. Children will have medical needs that must be addressed with or without their parents present, Tatro said. Similarly, there must be provisions for maintain ing a chain of custody for children in state or federal custody for medical decisions. There are special shelter placement considerations for children with disabilities. Historically, individuals with disabilities have been sent to medical shelters or to medical facilities. Tatro said that children with disabilities should instead be sheltered with their families in general 1 BCFS is an international health and human services agency that provides all-hazards emergency management, planning , preparedness, and response. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryPLANNING DURING DISASTER RESPONSE 69 population shelters whenever possible. As such, it is important to ensure adequate planning for children with disabilities in general shelters. If a child has a medical need that requires professional licensed staff oversight, then placement in a medi cal shelter may be appropriate, but planning should include considerations for keeping the family unit together (instead of splitting the child and one parent away from the rest of the family). Thinking about mental health, Tatro explained the trauma and stress of disaster and the sheltering experience can impact children differently than adults. New and stressful experiences can include, for example, disease isolation and quarantine, being in a group living situation with thousands of strangers, standing in line to get meals, or trying to find clothing. Educational opportunities, games and recreation, and coun- seling opportunities, including psychological first aid, can help to alleviate some of the stress and trauma for these children. It is important to draw on partnerships to meet some of those needs, Tatro said. Further mental health considerations for children in emergencies are explored in Chapter 8. Functional Needs Support Services The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Office of Disability Integration and Coordina tion was established to provide guidance, tools, methods, and strate gies to integrate and coordinate emergency management that is inclus ive of children and adults with access and functional needs, in accordance with federal civil rights laws and regulations. Marcie Roth, director of the Office of Disability Integration and Coordination at FEMA, quoted FEMA administrator Craig Fugate, who has stated that \"i f we wait and plan for people with disabilities after we write the basic pl an we fail.\" In this spirit, FEMA tools and resources are now inclusive of the whole community (rather than addressing some subpopulations in the back of a manual or in a separate annex). Several federal laws prohibit discrimination in emergency programs on the basis of disability (see Box 7-1). These laws apply to preparation, exercises, notification, evacuation and transportation, sheltering, first aid and medical services, temporary lodging and housing, transition back to the community, clean-up, and other emergency- and disaster-related programs, services, and activities.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary70 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BOX 7-1 Federal Laws Prohibiting Discrimination in Emergency Programs on the Basis of Disability Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Stafford Act of 1988 Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988 Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 Telecommunications Act of 1996 Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 SOURCE: Roth presentation, June 11, 2013. Roth noted that the term \"access and functional needs\" is now preferred to the term \"special needs,\" as the latter tends to relegate these issues to annexes, separate documents, and separate plans, she explained, which is the antithesis of inclusion. In addition to adults and children with physical, mobility, sensory, intellectual, developmental, cognitive, or mental health disabilities, others who may have access and func tional needs include older adults, people with chronic or temporary hea lth conditions, women in late stages of pregnancy, as well as those with limited English proficiency or low literacy, no access to transportation, very low income, or who are experiencing homelessness. It is important to recognize that most people with disabilities do not have acute medical needs and maintain their health, safety and independence in their home and community on a daily basis. Planning to meet the access and functional needs of disaster survivors with and without disabilities in general population shelters can help to keep people out of the acute care setting and preserve limited acute care resources for those who have a true medical need. If given the proper support, people with disabilities can be successfully acco mmodated in shelters with their family. But providing this support and meeting their access and functional needs requires planning an d coordination, and involvement of the whole community. To help guide local governments and commun-ities, Roth referred participants to the FEMA functional needs support Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryPLANNING DURING DISASTER RESPONSE 71 services guidance.2 This tool includes information about planning, finding subject-matter experts, selecting shelter sites, accessible toilets and bathing facilities, personal assistance needs, medical care and equipment, legal obligations, and ser vice animals. Another useful tool Roth highlighted is the FEMA pe rsonal assistance services contract. 3 If a disaster situation exceeds a state's ab ility to meet the needs of people with access and functional needs in general population shelters, FEMA can bring in up to 2,500 personal assistance service providers to assist with both basic and higher-level care. When communities integrate the access and functional needs of children and adults with and w ithout disabilities in all phases of community-wide emergency management, they strengthen their ability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards, Roth concluded. During the discussion, the need for research was discussed and it was noted that there are grant opportunities with the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (part of the U.S. Department of Education) focused disability inclusive emergency management practices. Family Reunification One of the primary needs of childre n in the shelter environment is family reunification. Mary Casey-Lockyer, manager of disaster health services at the American Red Cross, discussed several Red Cross programs that help to facilitate family reunification in times of disaster, including the Safe and Well Online Registry, and Patient Connection. Safe and Well is a free, Web-based tool that people can use to let their loved ones, friends, and colleagues know they are safe. 4 Those affected by disasters self-register on the site, and anyone can search the list for friends and family and view the registrants' posted messages. Clients can also update their status on Facebook or Twitter, simply by clicking an 2The FEMA Guidance on Planning for Integration of Functional Needs Support Services in General Population Shelters is available at http ://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/ odic/fnss_guidance.pdf (acce ssed September 9, 2013). 3Further information on the personal assistance services contract is available at http://www.pascenter.org/publications/item.php?id=1324&focu s= (accessed September 9, 2103). 4The Red Cross Safe and Well website addre ss is http://www.redcross.org/safeandwell (accessed September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary72 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES icon in the Safe and Well registrati on page. Everyone in their \"friends list\" will be notified that they registered on the American Red Cross Safe and Well website. This is an integrated response, Casey-Lockyer explained, and Red Cross volunteers also physically locate vulnerable people and conduct welfare checks when a request is initiated by a concerned family member. Safe and Well is available 24 hours per day, every day of the year. In addition to the website, Red Cross also uses paper forms in shelters and at ev acuation transition points, and has computer spreadsheets for when Intern et connectivity is not available. Roth noted that there are many current initiatives to help with family reunification and patient tracking (e.g., FEMA initiatives, individual state systems, Google Missing Persons, Facebook, Crisis Commons, and others) and the question is how these systems will integrate. Another Red Cross tool is Patient Connection. The system is currently being used in Chicago and will be implemented statewide in Illinois in the future. The system is triggered if 10 or more people affected by a particular disaster are sent to area hospitals, or by mass- casualty events such as transportation accidents (e.g., mass transit, aviation, traffic emergencies) or building fires and collapses. Patient Connection has also been activated as a precaution before large events such as the Chicago Marathon and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit. In these types of situations, disaster victims are frequently transported without notice to their loved ones. Red Cross activates a single hotline for families to call to locate relatives, reducing calls and walk-in traffic to emer gency departments. Hospitals send names and descriptions of affected pa tients to Red Cross, and call agents work to make matches. Hospitals and emergency management can then refer families that call to the Red Cr oss hotline to locate their loved one. Casey-Lockyer clarified that the Red Cross is exempt from Health Insurance Portability and Accountabilit y Act (HIPAA) privacy rules, and in times of disasters, HIPAA provisions allow hospitals to share information with a recognized respon se agency such as the Red Cross for reunification purposes. Casey-Lockyer added that American Red Cross now has a digital disaster operation center, called Digi DOC. The Red Cross can monitor publicly available social media and can push current information back to the public via national communication channels such as Twitter, Facebook, email, and the Red Cross website. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryPLANNING DURING DISASTER RESPONSE 73 Nutritional Needs Another primary need of all children in a shelter is nutrition. Casey- Lockyer said that the Red Cross shelter guidance advises shelter managers to prepare for infants by having cribs and diapers available, as well as baby food, formula, and a quiet area for breastfeeding. An advocate from the U.S. Breastfeedi ng Committee concurred and referred participants to a physician statem ent on safe infant and young child feeding in disasters 5 and noted that an operational guidance document would soon be available. Breastfeeding is a resource that protects infants from gastrointestinal and respirator y diseases that are prevalent in a disaster, and lowers the infant's and mother's stress levels. In addition, it reduces the cost of managing disasters and increases community resilience. The participant also alerted shelter managers to the fact that women may want to bring their breast pumps and frozen milk supply to the shelter. For older children, Casey-Lockyer continued, the rise in peanut allergies is a concern. The Red Cross is evaluating options such as peanut-free snack zones, placing snacks out of reach of children so they cannot help themselves, and possibly having EpiPens available in the shelters (in accordance with laws and policies). It is important to note that shelf-stable meals were designed for the dietary needs of adults in the military, and they are extremely high in sodium and calories. These meals are not suitable for a 2-year-o ld, Casey-Lockyer noted, or for an 82-year-old who may have the beginn ings of congestive heart failure. Some companies are coming out with lower-calorie, lower-sodium meals, but sodium is a key component in the long-term preservation of the meals. Shelter managers also ha ve the ability to purchase fresh food. Some children, especially infants, ma y also require tube feedings, and shelters need to be prepared. Casey-Lockyer cautioned that although we have done well with the types of disasters we have had in the United States, we have not really had a catastrophic event in a large urban city that results in many thousands of unaccompanied minors in the suburbs. This scenario has not been addressed by school systems or shelters. How will we sustain children for extended periods, and how are we going to reunite parents who were in the city during the event with their children in the suburbs? 5Available at http://www.usbreastfeeding.org/ Portals/0/Position-Statements/Emergen- cies-Statement-2011-USBC.pdf ( accessed September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary74 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Providing Child Care in Shelters After a disaster, children suffer from a kind of benign neglect, said Judy Bezon, former associate director of Children's Disaster Services (CDS), which is part of Church of the Brethren Disaster Ministries. Children are confused and do not understand what is going on around them, Bezon said. They may see thei r parents crying, worry about who will take care of them, where their pet is, and why they cannot go home. They have very little control over their environment, have few coping skills, and are completely depende nt on others for recovery. Young children also have limited language, and limited conceptual skills. They do not think to ask questions to get the reassurance that they might need from parents, and parents are often so totally consumed with their own worries that they do not have the emot ional ability to reach out to their children and find out what is going on with them. Bezon reiterated that the mistaken perception is that if they are playing, they must be doing fine. Children have concerns, she said, and these are often expressed and worked out through play. Adults may see children playing, and play is normal, so they assume the children are carefree and not impacted by the disaster. As an example, she described how a young girl in a FEMA facility after Hurricane Katrina had been playing with a doll and when she left the staff noticed that she ha d carefully raised the doll bed up on toy blocks, presumable to protect the doll from the flooding that she had experienced. She also described a brother and sister at a facility in Joplin who used empty boxes to build a \"tornado-proof house.\" Children's drawing can also be quite telling. Following the tornadoes in Oklahoma, center volunteers reported using up the dark colors of tempera paint as the children were painting tornadoes and storms. Children's Disaster Services Because children use play to express themselves and to understand their experiences, CDS volunteers use a comfort kit full of toys that promote imaginative play. This is a very safe medium, Bezon explained. Children process the disaster experience at their own pace and in a safe environment using their own language and the natural language of play. If the children are too worried or not ready to deal with the disaster on their own or through the play, they will play about stereotypical things. CDS has about 600 volunteers nationwide, and they are trained to follow Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryPLANNING DURING DISASTER RESPONSE 75 the child's lead in play. Volunteers participate in a 27-hour experiential workshop, staying overnight in a simu lated staff shelter to give them a sense of what families are going through, as well as what they will go through if they need to stay in a staff shelter during a disaster. The training emphasizes the social and emotional phases of a disaster, rather than the impact, response, recovery, and long-term recovery. They learn to interact with children after a di saster and how to communicate through play, and they undergo a very rigorou s screening process to be certified to work with children. CDS's work in shelters and service centers allows parents to attend to business, such as applying for aid and other recovery activities, without having their children with th em. This is an important resource for parents because life is disrupted for many families and their former child care arrangements, including babysitters and family members, may no longer be options. Parents can also leave children with the volunteers at CDS simply to get a break from the \"hyper vigilance\" needed in a crowded shelter environment to take a much needed shower or nap. Volunteers are also trained to talk w ith the parents about their concerns regarding their children. Partner agencies (e.g., FEMA, Red Cross, local groups) report that CDS creates an environment that makes it easier to give aid to those in need, Bezon said. \"By offering child center care, emotional support and a sense of normalcy, the CDS program helps to meet the immediate needs of children, assists family members who may be overwhelmed as they attempt to deal with the effects of the disaster, and plays an important role in fostering resiliency among children\" (Peek et al., 2008, p. 408). BEST PRACTICES AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIES DURING RESPONSE Moving from high-level conversation from involved organizations on different operational needs, this se ction shifts focus to tactics and practices already being used on the gr ound in different sectors. Because children make up such a large percentage of vulnerable populations, it is important to continue to integrate their needs across planning areas and situational scenarios. Speakers describe examples of patient tracking, accessible evacuation planning, and hospital-level pediatric competency exercises in the next section. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary76 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Best Practice Examples from the Texas Department of State Services Bruce Clements, director of the community preparedness section of the Texas Department of State Servic es, said that Texas has the largest number of federally declared disasters of any state in the nation. Events the Department has responded to since 2007 include hurricanes, wildfires, disease outbreaks (West Nile virus, tuberculosis, measles, mumps, H1N1 influenza), foodborne illness outbreaks, the plant explosion in West, Texas, and the raid on the Yearning for Zion Ranch. The Department also activated in re sponse to a spike in hospitalizations of young women with mercury poisoning, which turned out to be from mercury-tainted skin cream from across the border. A growing issue for Texas is the need to shelter unaccompanied minors. The thousands of unaccompanied children who cross the border from Mexico are returned home according to a reciprocity agreement with the Mexican government, which can be as simple as filling out the forms and walking them across the bridge. However, there has been a recent surge of undocumented Central American minors who travel north to Mexico and then cross into the United States. It takes longer to arrange to return them home, and they need to be sheltered in the interim. Clements noted that Texas contracts with BCFS for most of its shelters across the state. Texas is continually threatened by hurricanes and tropical storms, and Clements pointed out that the capacity the state has built to respond to hurricanes is very flexible and sc alable, and has enabled the response to other events. Texas has had \"a lot of practice with a lot of diverse types of threats,\" Clements said, and he shared several of the state's best practices and initiatives in four key areas: regional preparedness, infection prevention, sheltering, and tracking. Local and Regional Pediatric Preparedness Initiative Clements highlighted the Houst on Regional Healthcare Pediatric Preparedness initiative as one of the best in the state, in part because of the lessons learned from a long hist ory of flooding and from the city's role as a central location for evacuees from Hurricane Katrina. Houston's pediatric disaster planning includes, for example, a prophylaxis dispensing form that has weight conversion charts; pre- identified pediatric response teams to assist at National Disaster Medical Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryPLANNING DURING DISASTER RESPONSE 77 System reception sites; pediatrics patient inclusion in exercises; and preparedness guides for families from the children's hospitals in the area. Another resource from the Houston initiative is the \"Together Against the Weather\" website with videos and information on how to prepare for a hurricane, whether evacuating or sheltering in place. There is information for people with acce ss and functional needs (e.g., the elderly, individuals with disabilities, developmentally disabled children), and public service materials for em ergency management personnel, social services, and the media. Houston has also expanded pediatri c preparedness training to all the health care providers in the area, a nd provides quick reference materials, such as the Broselow Pediatric Emergency Tape, for pediatric medications, doses, equipment, etc. Infection Prevention The concurrent threats posed by the first cases of H1N1 pandemic influenza in late April 2009, and the start of hurricane season that June, raised serious concerns about infection prevention during evacuation and sheltering. In preparation, two diffe rent infection control kits were developed, one for buses and one for shelters (see Box 7-2). Although designed to address the double threat of H1N1 and hurricane season, Clements said these kits are now in regular use.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary78 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Pediatric Sheltering Sheltering planning for children in Te xas is focused in the full range of pediatric vulnerability, Clements said, medical, behavioral health, and social (also referred to as biopsychosocial). The biggest challenge is variability across the state with the in tegration of the three elements. The quality of the preparedness plans that are already in place is also a concern. Although there are requirements for schools, child care facilities, and foster families to have disaster plans, there is no quality check on those plans, or criteria to de fine quality, Clements said. This is an important gap to be addressed, a nd an opportunity for very-high-risk populations to get fundamental support. Clements pointed out that state la ws and definitions differ regarding the \"age of childhood\" (NLCHP, 2012). The majority of jurisdictions define childhood as under the age of 18; however, for several it is under 17 or 16 years of age. Some laws also bifurcate youth and children (e.g., someone up to the age of 12 is a child, and someone aged 13 to 18 is a youth), and in some jurisdictions childhood or youth may encompass persons older than 18. These laws impact both general population and medical sheltering. In most cases a person needs to be 18 years or older to consent to medical care, but in Rhode Island, South Carolina, or Texas the age is 16; in Alabama, Hawaii, and Indiana it is 14; and in Guam and Puerto Rico anyone below the age of 18 can consent if he or she is married. If a child is separated from his or her family, short of surgery, the child can generally make decisions on whether care is received. Multidisciplinary teams are involved in pediatric sheltering planning in Texas. Among those included are child life specialists who assist with coping, normalization, and play therapy; and Child Protective Services, especially those who are conservatorship specialists and can assist with emergency orders for medical consent. Clements added that all members of the multidisciplinary team need to have at least basic incident command training. Texas also promotes crisis counseling skills for responders, and uses the psychological first aid field guide from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. 6 6 The Psychological First Aid Field Operations Guide is available at http://www.nctsu. org/content/psychological-first-ai d (accessed September 9, 2103).

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryPLANNING DURING DISASTER RESPONSE 79 Pediatric Tracking There were more than 1,000 children missing in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, Clements said. This motivated responders from Texas who were involved in the response to Katrina to champion a banding tracking program for Texas. Using computers, a Web-based program, and barcode scanners, evacuees are given a yellow wristband with a barcode on it and a radio-frequency id entification (RFID) chip inside. Personal information is entered into the system, which can be as simple as swiping a driver's license if available. Pets and medical assets are also tagged with the same RFID chip so they can be associated with the person. Portals with RFID chip readers, or staff with handheld readers, can be set up at shelter entrances, the front of a bus, or anywhere else. Evacuees can then be tracked as they board and exit a bus, or enter and leave a triage site, shelter, or medical facility. In addition to tracking individuals, manifests can be printed listing all of the people on a particular bus or in a particular facility at any given time. Clements added that they work to build trust with the undocumented population along the U.S.-Mexico border so that they are not hesitant to participate in the program. Trust is fostered through medical outreach such as an annual exercise where clinics are set up in the Rio Grande Valley offering free health care to these individuals. The banding system is a simple program that can be used across different platforms to share information during a disaster, and Clements said it has been a very successful system for Texas. During the discussion, a participant said that after Hurricane Sandy, he was made aware that some people who were in the shelters were feeling stigmatized because when they were out of the shelter during the day they were known as being shelter residents by their wristbands. Clements responded that he had not encountered significant pushback from shelter residents thus far, and he felt that the benefits of the wristband tracking outweigh the potential for stigma. Tatro added that in Texas, no one is required to be bande d, and that education and outreach have helped foster acceptance. Evacuation and Transportation of Children with Disabilities Richard Devylder, senior advisor for accessible transportation at the U.S. Department of Transportation, shared his perspective on best Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary80 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES practices for addressing the needs of children with disabilities in evacuation planning. Identifying needs is the first essential step, he said, and administrators and parents often have different views on what those needs are. Next, it is important to define what resources are available, and what resources need to be brought in to help a specific child. Other key considerations in planning are the accessibility of vehicles and facilities, and ensuring access to any adaptive equipment the child may use (e.g., moving it with the child, moving it separately and tracking it, providing it onsite). If a child has a custom wheelchair designed for his or her needs, for example, simply providing another wheelchair is not suitable, and could be detrimental. Many children with disabilities will have an individual education plan (IEP) with their school, and Devylder stressed that the child's evacuation plan should be part of his or her IEP. He also emphasized the importance of including the child in the planning process when old enough to provide input. It is the child who knows what works and does not work for him or her during drills or other events at school. There also may be certain adults that children do not trust to help them, he added, and planners need to respect that. Evacuation plans need to include student medical information, including diagnosis, medication alle rgies, hazardous conditions (e.g., impact of smoke on the child and mitigating measures to take), cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibr illator steps to take, and climate control needs. Other necessary information includes contact information for parents and guardians, doctors, an d hospitals familiar with the child, so that first responders know which hospitals are best to take the child to. Devylder recommended that someone fr om the local fire department and law enforcement participate in the plan ning so that they are aware of the child's situation and how to assist him or her through the evacuation process. Information on communication with the student during the emergency is also an essential component of the plan. Not just primary language, but how to communicate with a child with autism, a deaf child, or how to guide someone who is blind or has impaired vision. Devylder explained that someone who is blind or has low vision cannot simply be put into a wheelchair or evacuation chair as this can be extremely frightening for them. Adhering to the normal ways of communicating with that child on campus is best. An evacuation plan should also include primary, secondary, and tertiary options for exiting the building, determined by accessibility and class location. The plan should also Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryPLANNING DURING DISASTER RESPONSE 81 describe under what circumstances el evators and/or evacuation chairs can be utilized. He noted that evacuation chairs vary; some can go both up and down stairs, others can only descend stairs. He also stressed that a plan must include what to do with the child after using an evacuation chair as they are extremely uncomfortable and the child cannot be left in the chair for more than 10 or 15 minutes, or risk injury. Once evacuated, how is the student transported off campus in both medical and non- medical emergency situations? The plan can include transport memor-anda of understanding that define the potential use of school transport- ation and public transport, as well as private entities (e.g., community partners, shuttles, taxis). Children with disabilities need support teams, including an evacuation team, a primary education team, and a substitute team, each with at least three people assigned, De vylder said. If the child had an aide assigned, the aide should also ha ve a defined role in evacuation. The evacuation team should include someone who is very familiar with the child, usually a school nurse, counselor , or teacher who will be available to be with the child and to make decisions during the evacuation of the child (i.e., the lead should not be a teacher who is also responsible for other children in a classroom). With the plan in place, training and drills are essential. \"To know it is to do it,\" Devylder concluded. Competency in Pediatric Disaster Training and Education Jeff Upperman, program director for the Pediatric Disaster Resource Training Center (PDRTC) at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, described novel teaching techniques implemented with the support of Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) funding. Los Angeles is about 4,000 square miles, with a populati on of about 11 million, including 2.5 million children below the age of 18. Children's Hospital Los Angeles has about 300 beds, and there are appr oximately 400 pediatric beds total in the County of Los Angeles. The PDRTC is part of a disaster network that includes multiple hospitals; however, as the only hospital dedicated to pediatric needs in Los Angeles County, the center is the county resource on pediatric disaster preparedness. It is the hub supporting many spokes, Upperman said. Upperman defined competence, or competency, as the ability of an individual to do a job properly, whether it is care, leadership, or management. But in developing competencies, we often train people for Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary82 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES a certain period of time, give them a paper test, and send them off. When conducting drills and exercises, especially hospital-based, are we really seeing if care providers can intubate in austere conditions? Can they recognize posttraumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues? It is important to train and practice, but there also needs to be some level of competency, he said. A leader in the community helps to make the community resilient and is a role model. Leaders at work (i.e., on commissions, committees, etc.) agitate the system, providing leadership for those who cannot provide it for themselves, such as children. Managers implement the plans through drills and exercises. Wh at competencies are necessary to make these things happen? Upperman highlighted several tools that PDRTC developed with the support of HPP to help foster competency in disaster response. The first is a prototype disaster preparedness logistics tool for pediatric emergency decision support (Neches et al., 2009). The software was designed for hospitals in Los Angeles County to use to begin thinking about their specific plans based on their specific needs. They could, for example, enter a zip code in Los Angeles County into the system and learn, based on available census data, how many ch ildren live in that zone and what might be the expected impact to the neighborhood during an earthquake. A novel approach to education is games which allow people to practice what they have learned. Working with the University of Southern California Games Institute , PDRTC developed an online game, Surge World, to give health care workers practice in triage, resource management, and preparedness planning. 7 Another example described by Upperman was the \"Disaster Olympix, \" an interactive drill to foster communication, collaboration, and leadership (Goodhue et al., 2010).8 Fire teams, engineers, pediatricians, nurses, and others at Children's Hospital Los Angeles participated in competitive events testing their knowledge, skills, and abilities to res pond to disaster situations. Finally, Upperman described a tri-hospital drill using technology, including robots and telemedicine, to facilitate triage and treatment consultation by offsite pediatric specialists (Burke et al., 2012). 9 In closing, Upperman 7Surge World is available to play online at http://lachildrenshospital.net/SurgeWorld (accessed September 9, 2013). 8Upperman played a brief video of the Di saster Olympix, which is available at http://www.youtube.com/wat ch?v=sZVgdRj-bCc (accessed September 9, 2013). 9Upperman played a brief video showing the use of telemedicine robots during the drill which is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqfZI7Vqsh8 (accessed Sep- tember 9, 2013).

Thinking about the specific needs of children and families in shelter situations prior to an emergency, and utilizing and encour aging best practices from other cities, can continually improve both the mass care operations and surge capacity at area hospitals that ma y not typically care for children.

Ho wever, if they are unprepared or insensitive, they can be a source of further distress. A single disaster event is really par t of a cascade of other events in a child's life and results in cumulati ve impact and stress, even if the prior events are completely unrelated. Stigma related to mental health is a still barrier, even in times of national crisis. Between 30 and 40 percent of a direct survivor population are at risk for developing a new disorder that they did not have until the index event. Traumatic grief is different from the experience of grief in other situations and requires different treatment. Supporting the mental and behavioral health needs of children in disasters was a recurring statemen t throughout the workshop. The speakers in this section of the repor t focused on heightened triage and targeting of vulnerable children for intervention more than demonstrating effective interventions. However, it should be noted that there are not enough data in this area to prove interventions are successful after traumatic events. Definitive guidance requires far more research on the comparative effectiveness of interven tions targeting children exposed to traumatic events (Forman-Hoffman et al., 2013). Although earlier chap-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary86 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ters covered some of the behavioral health implications for local planners, this section goes deeper into mental health needs and manifestations in children during their recovery period. In addition to a focus on coping and post-disaster processing, there is also the presentation of a tool that schools and other organizations can use to monitor and triage mental health needs in their population. ENSURING THAT CHILDREN ARE COPING David Schonfeld, director of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement, shared his list of key points for short-term mental health response for children. First, pe diatric health care providers play a critical role in the mental health r esponse to disaster. On a daily basis, pediatricians and other pediatric primary care providers are the de facto mental health providers for children in this country. Children are most likely to receive treatment from their primary care physicians for mental health disorders and psychosocial problems, which Schonfeld noted are actually the most common chronic conditions seen in pediatric practices. In the aftermath of a disaster, primary care providers are likely to be the first, and possibly the only responders to provide mental health services to children. Adults who work with children should understand the likely reactions to disaster and know techni ques to help them cope, Schonfeld continued. This includes psychoe ducation and supportive services to accelerate the natural healing process. Different types of staff have different relationships with children and can offer different perspectives. As an example, Schonfeld noted that it was cafeteria workers who noticed that girls had been cutting themselves in reaction to a school shooting in which a classmate was killed. They could see this because the girls' long sleeves would pull b ack as they reached out with their lunch trays to be served, revealing the cuts on their arms. Anyone who interacts with children after a disaster can be a potential source of assistance and support but, unfortunately, he said, if they are unprepared or insensitive, they can be a source of further distress. Helping children necessarily incl udes helping their families and communities as well. For example, parents may need help to take care of themselves in order to be able to be more available to take care of their children. Helping children also mean s helping health care providers to fulfill their roles. Professional staff members have their own basic needs, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryMONITORING CHILDREN'S MENT AL HEALTH AFTER DISASTERS 87 and crisis preparedness and response plans need to consider the pro- fessional's needs as a priority. These professionals may be impacted directly themselves and may have some of the same behavioral and mental health needs as those they serve. Professional self-care is important, but is often neglected. It is distressing to be with children who are in distress. It is critical that st aff find ways to have their own personal needs met, and appreciate and address the impact of supporting children who are grieving or traumatized. Understanding the Timeline of Recovery Beyond the immediate response, we need to appreciate the timeline for recovery, Schonfeld said. Everyone has a baseline level of function with some highs and lows (see Figure 8-1). When a disaster event occurs people feel vulnerable, their usual coping mechanisms may fail, and they may feel helplessness and hopel essness. As communities respond and provide resources, people start to have improved functioning. This is still a vulnerable period, Schonfeld stressed. Some individuals continue their recovery and return to their baselin e functioning, and some even have \"posttraumatic growth\" and achieve a new baseline of even higher level functioning. But others never return to their original baseline and live in a state of continued impairment. There is often an increase in suicides in this period. Unfortunately, Schonfeld said, children are thought of as \"resilient\" and support is often withdrawn as soon as there are signs of recovery. Instead, they need to be su pported until they return to their baseline level of functioning. The scope of need is broad, and there is a wide range of reactions and concerns beyond the acute trauma and posttraumatic stress from a disaster. For some children, bereavement is a primary issue if they have lost someone close to them. Other children face a cascade of secondary losses and stressors such as loss of their homes and relocation, loss of their peer network, difficulty integrating into new social networks or bullying at their new school, academic failure, financial stresses on the family, and parental stress, depression, substance use, or increased domestic violence. Schonfeld also pointed out that a single disaster event is really part of a cascade of other events in a child's life and results in cumulative impact and stress, even if the prior events are completely unrelated. When responding to one event, we are responding to all of the events in the life of the child. As an example, Schonfeld said that after a Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryMONITORING CHILDREN'S MENT AL HEALTH AFTER DISASTERS 89 Schonfeld reemphasized the work of the National Centers for Disaster Medicine and Public Health which is developing online training materials that can be used more br oadly by the general public, including a module on attending to the psychosocial needs of children. He also mentioned a project with the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, the National Association for School Psychologists, and others, to create materials that would be disseminated to all of their memberships. There are many materials being developed, but facilitating the dissemination and uptake of those materials is a challenge, and he recommended wo rking through professional organ- izations. Roth urged that the traini ng materials being developed also be made accessible for those with varying needs (e.g., captions on video materials, e-book device accessible). TRIAGING HIGH-RISK CHILDREN Merritt Schreiber, director of psychological programs at the Center for Disaster Medicine of the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, described a national childre n's disaster mental health concept of operations (NCDMH CONOPS) that he developed with funding from the Terrorism and Disaster Center of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (Schreiber, 2011). A very large subset of people, including children, experience transitory distress (e.g., insomnia , fears of recurrence, fears of separation). For many, resilience ha ppens without any intervention. However, between 30 and 40 percent of a direct survivor population are at risk for developing a new disorder that they did not have until the index event (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] being the most common). The concept of operations is designed to get to that high-risk subject in a timely way, and offer th em evidence-based interventions that have been shown, through randomized controlled studies, to have an impact. The goal is a seamless con tinuum of triage-to-care incident operation. Schreiber said that there is a critical window at 30 to 45 days post-event in which intervention can reduce or even prevent clinical PTSD. Timely intervention may also reduce the secondary mental health burden on both emergency departme nts and primary care settings. Included in the NCDMH CONOPS is the PsySTART Rapid Mental Health Triage and Incident Management System. PsySTART does not measure symptoms (as symptom measurement in acute aftermath of an Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary90 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES event is often unreliable) and is not a diagnostic measure. Rather, it measures exposure, traumatic loss, early emergence of potentially ongoing or persistent stressors, disaster-related injury and illness, and peri-traumatic panic. A triage form prompts staff to collect information from individuals about their experiences (e.g., psychological panic symptom, direct life threat, exposure, trapped, saw bodies, had direct loss of loved ones, home loss). The responses help identify which patients need to be seen first. Aggregated individual PsySTART da ta can be used to estimate site- level and population-level impacts of a disaster and develop a total picture of risk (types, locations, number of children at risk). Geographic information system mapping of data from multiple sites enables a common operating picture and near-rea l-time situational awareness of children's mental health needs. This is then used to guide incident management, define needs, allocate resources, and facilitate interagency coordination. Schreiber noted that a PsySTART mobile app has recently been developed. In closing, Schreiber referred participants to another resource from the National Child Traumatic Stre ss Network, a trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy online training course. 1 He described it as a high-end intervention for the very-high-risk subset who are not likely to progress to resilience without intervention. Traumatic grief is different from the experience of grief in other situations, he said, and requires different treatment. Triaging high-risk children, while also taking into account important trauma histories and exposure to other incidents can be instrumental in ensuring that children progress through a recovery of timeline along with their peers, and re turn to their normal baseline after an event or reach further growth potential. 1Available at http://tfcbt.musc.edu (accessed September 9, 2013).

A capabilities-based approach to disaster preparedness develops core disaster response capabilities that can be deployed across a wide range of situations (rather than creating new plans, equipment, and responses for every disaster). Factors impacting resilience or t he associated trauma in children include dose (magnitude of the si tuation), context, developmental period when exposure occurs, association with a capable caregiver, self-efficacy, and resilience of families and other systems. A child's resilience is embedded not just in the child, but also in the relationships, culture, and all the other communities and systems the child may interact with. Schools are part of the community continuum, and teachers and child care workers are first responders. They should be trained on the typical responses and needs of children by age and development. Older children and youth can be provided with manageable but meaningful roles in recovery. The unfortunate onset of a disaster creates a critical moment to leverage the media on children's behalf, show the challenges that communities face, and advocate for policy changes. Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8) on national preparedness \"is aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary92 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES to the security of the Nation.\"1 As defined in PPD-8, resilience is \"the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand a nd rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.\" Session chair Kathryn Brinsfield, formerly of the White House National Security Staff and now the Acting Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said that to really be resilient, people, systems, and the infrastructure that supports those systems, have to work together simultaneously to return to normal, whether that is the original state of things, or a new normal. PPD-8 takes a capabilities-based approach to disaster preparedness. The intent is not have new plans, equipment, and responses for every disaster, but to have core disaster response capabilities that can be deployed across a wide range of situations. To further consider resilience interventions in children from a scientific perspective, a white paper was commissioned for the workshop and presented in this section. David Abramson, deputy director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, presented an overview of the white paper \"The Science and Practice of Resilience Interventions for Ch ildren Exposed to Disasters.\" 2 The paper, authored by Abramson, Kallin Brooks, and Lori Peek, provides a review of the current literature on resilience research, and identifies several challenges to developing an evidence base for resilience interventions in disasters. Following first a discussion of research on the science of resilience in children, and then an explanation of the white paper, panelists provide real-world examples of specific strategies to foster resilience. THE FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH ON RESILIENCE IN CHILDREN AND YOUTH Ann S. Masten, of the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota, said that th e field of disaster research and awareness was motivated in large part by the incredible global devastation from World War II, and the millions of traumatized children impacted by bombings, radiation, di splacement, and being orphaned. 1See http://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness (accessed September 9, 2013). 2Full text of the white paper is available in Appendix G of this workshop summary and online at http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/PublicHealth/MedPrep/2013- JUN-10/White%20paper%20Abramson%20child%20resilience.pdf (accessed September 9, 2103).

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFOSTERING RECOVERY THROUGH COMMUNITY RESILIENCE 93 Researchers in psychiatry, psychology, and other fields wanted to understand the impact of these kinds of experiences on child development, and what could be done to prevent problems and promote better development in children with these experiences. Factors That Impact the Resilience of Children Masten highlighted several of the top factors that impact the resilience of children in a disaster. Dose is key, not just the magnitude of the current situation but also pr ior exposure to adversity, ongoing adversities that often cascade following a mass trauma experience, and cumulative adversity. There is also much interest now in toxic stressors that can alter health, well-being, or epigenetic status in the long term. This also reinforces David Schonfeld's earlier point clarifying that response to one event in a child's life is actually a response to all of the events in that child's life, and havi ng providers maintain trauma histories can be helpful in understanding a chil d's response to a singular event and how it might be impacted from previous stressors. Other experiences of great adversity in children's lives are relevant to understanding disaster, but context matters a great deal. Context matters not just in terms of the hist ory and the nature of the exposures, but also the recovery context. One of the most powerful predictors of how children will do is to track the quality of the recovery context, she said. Masten cited a growing recognition of sensitive periods in the course of development when children are mo re susceptible to certain kinds of exposures (e.g., radiation, toxins associated with disaster, traumatic stress). These exposures can be experienced directly by the child, or prenatally because the pregnant mother is experiencing severe trauma and stress. Studies in Finland in the aftermath of Chernobyl, for example, are showing biological sequelae in children who were prenatally exposed not to the radiation, but to the extreme fear and stress experienced by the mother during pregnancy. Many aspects of a child's risk exposure, resources, and response capabilities are dependent on where the child is developmentally. Expectations of child ren and how they are going to be able to handle stress also varies developmentally as well as culturally. Individual differences, ranging from genetic variations to personality differences, impact how a child might interact with disaster experiences. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary94 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Neurobiology now has the tools to study epigenetic change and intergenerational transmission of trauma effects. A large literature on resources and protective factors suggests that one of the most important factors for children to help them deal with adversity is a capable care giver. Self-efficacy is also important because it is attached to the motivational syst em that drives people to try to cope in the midst of adverse situations. Ch ildren also depend on the resilience of families and of many other systems. Resilience as a Dynamic Systems Concept The capacity for resilience is dist ributed across multiple, adaptive, interacting systems, Masten stressed . A child's resilience is not just embedded in the child, but also in the relationships, culture, and all the other communities and systems the child may interact with (Sapienza and Masten, 2011). The capacity for resilience in a disaster is interdependent with resilience in other kinds of systems (e.g., economic resilience, global resilience in terms of climate change). Masten emphasized that many syst ems influence the capacity that children have for resilience. Systems in the organism (i.e., the child) include, for example, the immune system, stress response systems, central nervous system, cognitive skills, executive functions, and motivation. Much of child capacity is also embedded in relationships. Secure attachment relationships with young children are with caregivers, but as we get older, attachment expa nds to friends, mentors, romantic partners, and to spiritual relationships (e.g., with a pastor or religious leader). Other systems in communities and societies that are important for children include schools as well as the emergency response systems, health care systems, and cultural practices. To foster resilience in children, general guidelines from the literature are to plan developmentally, target and time interventions strategically, consider multiple levels of action, define and prepare first responders, and promote resilience of key systems for children. With regard to planning, Masten said to prepare for children medically, psychologically, and pragmatically. Recognize that teachers and child care workers are first responders, and train them on the typical responses and needs of children by age and development. M asten also noted that many first responders are parents, and they are likely to perform better if their own children are safe and protected. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFOSTERING RECOVERY THROUGH COMMUNITY RESILIENCE 95 The resilience literature also argues for reducing and mitigating risk. One way to promote better outcomes is to reduce or avoid exposure to risk, she said. For example, avoid separation of children from their attachment figures; monitor exposure of children to adversities, including the media; reduce stress of pregnant mothers; and help parents to regulate negative emotion. Other strategies emphasize the importance of restoring routine systems that symbolize normalcy to children, such as family meals, school and play opportunities, and cultural and religious practices. Support the natural and familiar helpers (families, school, and teachers) and adaptive systems in a child's normal environment so they can support and comfort children. Masten also reiterated the points made by Houston and others about providi ng older children and youth with meaningful but manageable roles in recovery. Resilience is common, and does not require anything special, Masten concluded. There is more than one wa y to achieve resilience, and given a favorable recovery context, most children will recover. The needs, vulnerabilities, and strengths of child ren vary individually, and by de- velopment, situation, and culture . Recovery depends on very fund- amental adaptive systems (within the child, in relationships, and in the systems), and restoring and protecting these systems are high priorities. THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF RESILIENCE INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN EXPOSED TO DISASTERS Abramson cited the work of Wright and colleagues who classified the existing research on resilience into \"four waves\": identifying individual factors associated with resilience; understanding how those factors develop as processes in complex systems; understanding how to foster resilience (i.e., interventions); and understanding the biology and the epigenetics of resilience (Wright et al., 2013). In conducting their research, the authors sought to address four key questions: What is the long-term impact of disasters on children and youth, and how does it relate to resilience and recovery? What does a resilience trajectory look like? How does one balance promoting positive traits and protecting against pathophysiological states? How can resilience be activated? Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary96 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES What Is the Long-Term Impact of Disasters on Children and Youth and How Does It Relate to Resilience and Recovery? Abramson highlighted three overarching findings regarding exposure to disasters, impacts, and recovery. First, disasters may be only a moment in time, but they exert a long-term enduring effect on children and youth. \"Toxic stressors\" may extend the effects of a disaster into the adult years, leading to complex comorbidities. Abramson referred participants to the Institute of Me dicine and National Research Council report From Neurons to Neighborhoods for more information about the impact of toxic stressors on children (IOM and NRC, 2000). In addition to the stress of the disaster, the child may have other acute or chronic stresses in their life, as mentioned previously, and the effects can be cumulative. Second, children are embedd ed in larger social systems and their health and well-being is highl y contingent on functioning support systems in their lives (e.g., parents, households, schools, community institutions, neighborhoods). And third, children and youth often want to be actively engaged in their own recovery. Gulf Coast Child and Family Health Study As an illustration, Abramson descr ibed the Gulf Coast Child and Family Health Study conducted from 2006 through 2010. This longitudinal cohort study followed 1, 079 randomly sampled households in Louisiana and Mississippi for up to 5 years after Hurricane Katrina (including 427 households with childre n). During the course of the study, the percent of children living in a trailer or a hotel declined from 83.8 percent in 2006 to 7.5 percent in 2010. However, the percent of parents who reported that they were not copi ng well was consistently between 13 and 20 percent. Parents with mental health distress declined from 61 percent to 43 percent; however, Abramson noted that more than 40 percent of parents exhibiting mental health distress after 5 years is still an enormous number. Parents who felt th eir children were not safe in school remained high, at 25 to 37 percent. And more than half reported moving in the past year in the 2010 survey. Abramson next considered what systems in the children's lives had an effect on their mental health. Children were directly impacted by parental constraints such as mental health distress, inadequate social supports, minimal sense of community, or lack of a sense of \"life recovery.\" Household stressors accounted for the most effect (e.g., Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFOSTERING RECOVERY THROUGH COMMUNITY RESILIENCE 97 unstable housing, loss of income, not enough money for food, poor family functioning). Social stressors in the neighborhoods also had a statistically significant and substantial effect on the child's mental health (e.g., drug sales, prostitution, gangs and crime, signs of vacancy). Interestingly, prior social adversity had no statistical effect. Almost 5 years after Hurricane Katrina, Katrina-affected children and youth had rates of serious emotional disturbance that was five times the national average of a comparable group. Understanding these long-term impacts can help inform resilience interven tions, and recovery expectations, Abramson said. What Does a Resilience Trajectory Look Like? Developing a resilience trajectory (i.e., plotting the ability to withstand, adapt to, or recover from a disaster event) is hampered by the limited availability of pre- and post-disaster data, and the lack of defined and standardized resilience outcom es measures. Outcomes could be, for example, the percentage of children without pathophysiology, the per- centage at an age-appropriate grade, or the percentage with a subjective sense of \"stability.\" However, there are issues with all of these outcome measures. For example, many children are too old for their grade in school because the family has been di splaced and they did not attend school or attended sporadically, or th e family is in a new school system that is more rigorous than the school system they came from, and they are behind. Subjective measures are impacted by bias, Abramson noted, and parents often underreport their children's problems. How Does One Balance Promoting Positive Traits and Protecting Against Pathophysiological States? Resilience-based efforts are designed to promote optimal development in children, Abramson explained. Approaches used seek to enhance their healthy and adaptive cognitive, emotional, and social processes, and to develop their skills in solving problems, expressing emotions, and forming relationships . These promotional efforts often take place before a disaster, so that they can be activated after the child has been exposed to the stressor. Symptom-based efforts are employed to Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary98 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES reduce or address mental health problems. Approaches focus on decreasing psychological symptoms through individual and group therapies; using graded exposure and inoculation strategies to decrease stress; and applying \"meaning making\" to the stressors to help contextualize what the children have experienced (Peltonen and Palosaari, 2013). Resilience- and symptom-based effo rts can complement each other. By enhancing resilience-based efforts, we may be able to avoid stress-induced mental health symptoms. By addressing mental health problems resulting from stress, Abramson said, we may be able to achieve optimal development and resilience (see Box 9-1). How Can Resilience Be Activated in Children? Abramson summarized four ways that children's resilience can be \"activated.\" Many times, it is through extemporaneous policy decisions. For example, the Joplin School District made the decision to open 87 days after the tornado that devastated 6 of their 10 school buildings. This was an immediate and clear policy decision that was not governed by other preexisting policy decisions or plans, and it set a very clear objective for recovery (discussed further by Besendorfer below). Another approach is through policy advocacy and community engagement. Save the Children's Program on Resilient and Ready Communities, for example, works to ensure that the emergency operations plans in a community have taken into account all of the child institutions, promoting policy infrastructure so that decisions do not have BOX 9-1 Key Protective and Promotive Factors Highlighted by David Abramson Positive self-identity (self-effi cacy; self-worth and self-esteem) Executive control and self-regulation Coping skills (problem-solving competence; stress reduction) Supportive relationships (parents, siblings, peers, trusted adults) Opportunities for \"pro-social behavior\" (helping others) Positive worldview (hopefulness; fa ith; communal ualized understanding of hazard/catastrophe) (parental, household, instit utional, communal, social routines) Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFOSTERING RECOVERY THROUGH COMMUNITY RESILIENCE 99 to be made extemporaneously (di scussed further by Spangler below). The Communities Advancing Resilience Toolkit is similar, but takes more of an asset building approach, Abramson explained. A third way to activate resilience in children is through programs and interventions. Abramson divided these into two basic categories: pre-disaster moderators as primary prevention for those who may be exposed (e.g., preparedness education, stress reduction training, public health) and risk-activated moderators as secondary prevention for those who were exposed (e.g., Vietnamese Am erican Young Leaders Association [VAYLA] and Rethinkers, discussed further below). Finally, resilience can be activated through providers and the workforce. The Joplin Child Care Task force, for example, is working to train providers in the community to address many of the psychological needs the children are facing. He offered several examples of programs that increase self-efficacy, including the Masters of Disaster curri culum of the American Red Cross, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts preparedness badges and awards, the Wisconsin Responding to Emergencies and Disasters with Youth (READY) camp and classes, Teen Citizen Emergency Response Team (CERT), and the Youth Council at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (the latter discussed by Houston in Chapter 6). These are very similar, Abramson said, in that they all occur before the disaster, and focus on building skills and self-efficacy. Promoting Positive Worldview in Children The white paper research also identified several examples of projects that promote a positive worldview after a disaster. The New York City-based 9/12 Generation Project is a day of volunteer service held on 9/12 (i.e., the day after 9/11). VAYLA was established in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to fight a toxic waste dump that was going to be located in their neighborhood, and has since evolved into a robust youth engagement and empowerment initiative in New Orleans for youth of all race and ethnicities. The Urban Resilience Program in Israel is very targeted toward preparation for terrorism in an effort to provide stress reduction. Abramson elaborated on the Rethinkers program, which promotes both a positive worldview and empowerment. Rethinkers was started as a summer program in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, with 20 middle school students in New Orleans. The students were charged with helping Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary100 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES to find solutions to fix the problems in their schools. The students surveyed more than 500 other children from a sampling of schools in New Orleans on issues that matter to students. The Rethinkers have produced reports, held press conferences, and made recommendations to the city, some of which have been acted on. They have also led campaigns to make changes to bathrooms, cafeterias and food, and discipline policies. They have now ex panded to rethink nutrition, weight and obesity issues, architecture, digital media, food justice, gardens, and restorative justice. Challenges to Building an Evidence Base on Resilience in Children The authors of the white paper identified three major types of challenges to the development of an evidence base for resilience interventions: definitional, operationa l, and political. The definition of resilience is a topic of considerable debate, as can be understood by the varying definitions from different s ources in this report alone. Is it a process, an outcome, or a latent cons truct? Is it the presence of a positive state, or the absence of a pathological state? Most scholars would agree, Abramson said, that resilience only ma nifests in the face of a stressor. How can you determine baseline resilience of a community if resilience can only be measured in the presence of the stressor. Operationally, disasters are rare and unpredictable events and the factors underlying resilience are complex, multilevel sy stems (biological, psychosocial, social, cultural). Finally, from a political perspective, the federal government, which is the largest purchaser of academic research, does not generally fund direct resilience intervention services, so it has little reason to fund resilience research. Most of the resilience program funding comes from the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors, which have little surplus for funding research, Abramson said. In addition, many of the issues around resilience are \"root cause\" problems, social problems such as health disparities and social in equities, for which there is limited political advocacy especially in the face of constrained budgets. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFOSTERING RECOVERY THROUGH COMMUNITY RESILIENCE 101 From Research to Action In closing, Abramson described the Gulf Coast Population Impact Project as a case example of how research moves to action.3 The project objective was to characterize the ways that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill affected children in communities along the Gulf Coast, and to identify resources and services that would most benefit these children. Secondary data were used to develop an oil spill impact score and identify heavily impacted communitie s. Researchers then interviewed 1,437 parents in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi regarding exposure to the oil spill, and physical or mental health effects. Focus groups were also conducted with children, caregivers, health care providers, educators, and community leaders. The data showed that poverty and ex posure to the oil spill were most statistically significant factors in well-being. Key health and wellness themes that emerged from community engagement were lack of access to care (especially for mental health), clusters of unexplained symptoms (e.g., nose bleeds, ear bleeds, skin rashes), unsupervised children and unsafe behavior, and dwindling recreational and occupational oppor- tunities. Participants in the focus groups also cited economic pressures and cascading stressors (e.g., not enough food, parental depression, eroding cultures) and the inability of the community to sustain economic opportunities, social programs, and provider networks. For many communities, Hurricane Katrina and th e oil spill were not really two disasters, but one long continuous disaster, with acute stressors layering on top of chronic stressors. Abramson relayed that in one of the fishing communities, 1 out of every 11 girls in the high school was pregnant. According to a local community leader, \"the only thing to do around is go fishing, get high, or get pregnant, and we can't go fishing anymore.\" This data compelled the researchers to take action and the SHOREline (Skills, Hope, Opportunity, Recovery, and Engagement) youth empowerment project was developed. The goal is to build a network of high school chapters th at will develop and enhance their agency, self-efficacy, positive worldview, and pro-social behavior. Youth help other youth recover from disasters. The project does not ask the youth about themselves, Abramson explained, but rather, how can they help others in their familie s and communities.

PROMISING PRACTICES OF CHILD-SERVING PARTNERS After discussing resilience research highlights and concepts from Masten's research and identified in Abramson's white paper, the summary now shifts to on the ground case studies of resilience examples in children and best practices in disasters. Because this area is still new and evolving, it is somewhat of a moving target, but continual sharing of strategies and communication across sectors\u2014again broadening stakeholders\u2014can help develop unde rstanding of children in this vul- nerable state. Joplin Schools as an Example of Resiliency Angie Besendorfer, assistant superintendent for the Joplin (Missouri) Public School District, began her presentation with a safety message urging everyone to reevaluate their school tornado shelter plans, in particular, to find safe areas other than interior hallways (where students have traditionally been taught to line up and duck and cover). Security cameras that were still functioning wh en the tornado hit the Joplin school buildings on Sunday, May 22, 2011, show that those hallways became wind tunnels where equipment and soda machines went flying. 4 Had the tornado been on a school day, she said, \"it would have been horrific.\" Besendorfer played a brief news video to show some of what the city of Joplin experienced. Three thousand of the approximately 7,700 students lived in the direct path of the storm. Seven students and 1 school staff member were killed, and 4,200 students were without a school at the end of the storm. Nine schools and the administration building were hit by the tornado, six of which were a total loss. Around the city, 8,000 homes, 400 business, and 18,000 vehicl es were damaged or destroyed, and 161 community members were killed. Prior to the storm, the school dist rict was already on a first-name basis with city leaders, chamber leaders, and federal and state 4The security camera footage can be vi ewed on the school di strict website at http://www.jet14ondemand.com/ondemand/musicvideo. php?vid=9974a0414 (accessed September 9, 2013).

Also in place was the Bright Futures Initiative, a network which links business, social services ag encies, and faith-based partners to schools. The district also had strong communications strategies, including social media, phone calling systems, a website, and relationships with media outlets. A ccording to Besendorfer, having these aspects already in place greatly benefited the school system's resiliency and recovery. The immediate response focused on finding people from the total school family of about 9,000 employees and students. Outreach was done through social media, teachers' rela tionships with students and parents, phone calls, media, and simply walki ng the neighborhoods. The district felt that it was important to provide some sort of closure, and with 12 days left in the school calendar, th e school year was declared finished and an event was held at every school, whether it was standing or not. These were set up as celebrations to start the summer, Besendorfer said, but they offered closure and let children, families, and teachers see each other and know that they were all okay. Another aspect of the immediate response was attending the funerals of the students who passed, and the family members of students, being there to support the children in their tragic losses. Importance of Establishing and Meeting Expectations Besendorfer explained that the school district established a clear goal immediately following the storm; school would start again on August 17 of that year, just 84 days after the tornado hit. In addition, summer school was started on time and for the firs t time, it was extended through July and transportation was provided (as ma ny parents had lost their cars). Summer session was really one way to provide a safe place to be for students who needed it, and although the program was for elementary students, middle school and high school students could serve as helpers. Temporary education facilities were set up in leased spaces, for example, in the mall. Progress on the creation of spaces was shared through the media. It was important to reassure the community that there were going to be quality places for their children to attend school, so that people would stay in Joplin and recover together. The district stressed the message that it might be a temporary location, but it was not a temporary education. Groups of students toured the facilities so that they could share the progress with their friends and foster excitement about starting school. This was particularly importa nt for the high school students who Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary104 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES lost their school and wanted to quit. But when they came to see the facility at the mall, unlike anything they had had before, and learned they were going to get laptops, there w as renewed interest. The short-term response also included taking care of the adults. All administration and staff at the hardest-hit schools were required to have a 30-minute visit with the counselor. Additional support was provided during the course of the 2011-2012 school year. In partnership with the Ozark Center from Freeman Hospital, counselors and caseworkers were embedded in all of the schools in the district, not just those damaged by the tornado, because everyone was ultimately impacted. Besendorfer noted that they were originally called trauma counselors, but they were renamed \"hope counselors.\" Another intervention was Winter Camp during Christmas break, again, for students who needed somewhere safe to go. The district also worked with the governor and FEMA to create a playground and a community building in the FEMA village. Mercy Hospital hosted community dinners twice per month at the schools to help bring people from the neighborhoods back together . Finally, the \"Sunshine Squad\" was a group of people who would come to a school and do something for the kids, and then something for the teachers, just to \"lighten the air.\" Looking Forward For the school year 2012-2013, the hope counselors are continuing in the schools through a grant. Besendorfer noted that there were even more counseling needs in the second year after the tornado, and there was currently no funding for year three, although several grant applications had been submitted. Also in the sec ond year, all of the school counselors received Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Schools (CBTS) training. Three thousand students are still in temporary schools while replacement schools are under construction. Bese ndorfer added that all of the temporary school sites and the schools th at were affected have temporary storm shelters, and safe room additions are being added to all of the elementary schools (with mitigation funding through Sections 404 and 406 of the Stafford Act). In summarizing her overview of Joplin schools as an example of resiliency, Besendorfer said that schools are part of the community continuum, and having a relationship w ith the whole community is very important. Approaches that were successful included setting clear goals and making them very public. This creates accountability but also gives Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Celebrating frequently is also critically important. Celebrating the opening of school, the first football game, or ground- breaking for new schools helped children to make the positive presupposition that everything was going to be all right, and helped them to behave as if it was. The schools became a part of the community pride. Perhaps the most important asset to recovery, she concluded, has been the school staff, and she closed with a video of staff and students telling their stories of resiliency and hope. 5 Save the Children Save the Children was founded in England in 1919, established in the United States in 1933, and now works in more than 120 countries around the globe. Kathy Spangler, vice president of U.S. programs for Save the Children, said that in th e United States, it is the leading advocate and responder for children in emergencies. Save the Children is working to mobilize communities in all 50 states to better protect children in emergencies through federal and state advocacy, and policy change. Toward this end, the organization produces an annual national report card that provides a state-by-state assessment of school and child care emergency planning for evacuation, reunification, meeting func- tional and mobility needs, and multiple disasters. States are ranked on their policies each year, and Spangler said that currently, only 17 states meet the very minimal requirements in all four areas. Spangler reiterated the theme expressed by others that the unfortunate onset of a disaster creates a critical moment to leverage the media to speak on children's behalf, to show the challenges that communities face in meeting their needs, and to advocate for mu ch needed policy changes. Children's Task Forces One of the best practices shared by Spangler is the establishment of a Children's Task Force. First used by Save the Children in 2005 in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the convening of a children's task force is now institu tionalized in the immediate response to a disaster. The task force engages key stakeholders, including federal, state, and local partners and nongovernmental organizations, to prioritize 5The video can be seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF-rWJKdgCE (accessed September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary106 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES the response and recovery needs of children and child-serving programs. A related best practice is the establis hment of a working group (a subset of the task force) to focus on child care recovery. The sooner child care can be operational again, the sooner families can get b ack to work and get reestablished in their communities. A key challenge to making a rapid assessment of the impact of a disaster on child care is the lack of any central database or registry of facilities, Spangler said. For Hurricane Sandy, three task forc es were established, for New Jersey and New York at the state level, and for New York City. Save the Children is planning to continue its work with Hurricane Sandy recovery through June 2014. Following the immediate response, the organization's focus has shifted to child care recovery. Save the Children has awarded around 200 recovery grants to child care facilities in New York and New Jersey. Save the Children is also partnering to provide its Journey of Hope psychosocial recovery program to children and their caregivers. Because the tornadoes in Moore, Oklahoma, were in May, at the end of the school year, the focus there was also on child care recovery, as well as expansion of summer camp programs. Grants to local organizations such as the YMCA facilitated free attendance at camp for more than 350 children in affected communities. Emergency Planning and Response Programs Another best practice highlighted by Spangler is the Child-Friendly Spaces program, which is the organization's key emergency response program. It meets immediate needs by setting up care and activities for children in shelters and other places where families congregate during disasters. By the end of 2012, Child-Friendly Spaces had served 1,485 children in 16 Hurricane Sandy shelte rs. Child-Friendly Spaces were also set up within 6 hours of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in New-town, Connecticut, and operated for more than 2 weeks in conjunction with crisis counseling services for families. Save the Children has also deve loped the Resilient and Ready Communities Initiative, a national program to improve community planning to protect children in emergencies. Resilient and Ready Communities was born out of Save the Children's work across six high-risk regions in the United States. It is focused on systems building, and core elements of the initiative have been utilized at the state and local levels, and in large urban and sma ll rural settings. Trainings to build local capacity to protect children in emergencies have been provided in Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryFOSTERING RECOVERY THROUGH COMMUNITY RESILIENCE 107 communities of all sizes in all 50 states through webinars and online learning. Spangler noted that Resilient and Ready has been recognized by the J. Getty Trust and the American Red Cross as a strategy that has brought together disparate systems into a more organized capacity-building approach. The six key components of the initiative are (1) engaging key stake- holders through training, awareness raising, and advocacy; (2) assessing current capacity and monitoring progress; (3) informing practice and emergency planning improvements; (4) evaluating resiliency post- disaster; (5) renewing and refreshing resiliency through continuous im-provement; and (6) mobilizing communities in support of children's protection through relationship buildi ng and meaningful engagement. As examples of activities in these core ar eas, Spangler said that Save the Children is currently working with Columbia University to develop a child-focused preparedness assessment tool to help communities identify gaps and focus areas. The organization is also working in a number of county-level jurisdictions in California to draft children's annexes to their emergency management plans. Although it's clear that defini ng and understanding resilience in children is difficult, especially in the wake of a disaster during their developmental years, continued research and case studies from youth groups and child advocacy organiza tions from around the country can help to identify best practices and tactics children need to recover from adverse events. Engaging youth gr oups and looking at cross-sector outreach between public health professionals in health equity, social justice, and disaster risk reduction could show new ways of achieving a similar goal of building a stronger community where children can grow.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary109 10 Hurricane Sandy Experience: Disaster Recovery Focused on Children and Families Highlights of Points Made by Individual Speakers The federal government's role in recovery is to support locally led recovery efforts to restore and improve the health care and social services networks in the affected communities. The health and the human services functions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) need to work in tandem, edu- cating each other about their respective disciples, and communicating better about available tools and resources. The goal of a children's task force is to develop a common operating picture on children's needs across the public, education, and early childhood sectors. A key aspect of the response to Hurricane Sandy was coalition building though the activation of existing resources and relationships. A barrier to response and recovery efforts for child care is that there are thousands of independent oper ators who are not part of org- anized networks, and are not r eachable through standard com- munication mechanisms. An all-hazards approach to planning and training for child care providers includes chain of command, communications, emergency kits, evacuation and sheltering plans, and business recovery. In the final chapter on recovery, panelists discussed examples of human services disaster recovery interventions that promote the social and economic well-being of children and families in the aftermath of disasters. The \"recovery\" phase begins almost as soon as the disaster and response end, but it continues for long after the rest of the country stops watching. Monitoring children and fa milies during this recovery phase is critical and has often been overlooked. With the release of the Federal Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary110 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) National Disaster Rec- overy Framework (NDRF), there is more focus and guidance for this important phase of rebuilding communiti es, and monitoring of social and economic determinants can give great insight to the process. During both the response and recovery phases, it is important to highlight the need for coordinated communication and action from the many players involved related to children. With a lack of power and communication options immediately after the storm, as well as jurisdictions responding differently based on their state or city protocols, streamlined activity and information gathering across child care providers can remain a difficult challenge. Representatives from stat e and federal level children and family agencies highlight their experiences during and after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast in October 2012. NATIONAL DISASTER RECOVERY FRAMEWORK: HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES RECOVERY SUPPORT FUNCTION Joyce Thomas, regional administrator for Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Region II, 1 described the NDRF as the federal structure for how to best r estore, redevelop, and revitalize the health, social, economic, natural, a nd environmental fabric of the com- munity following a disaster. The NDR F defines the roles and respons- ibilities of the federal government in recovery, and provides guidance on coordinating structure, recovery plan ning, and building stronger, smarter, and safer communities. 2 The NDRF established six recovery support functions (RSFs) that provide a structure to facilitate th e identification, coordination, and delivery of federal assistance to supplement the state, local, private, and nonprofit efforts in affected comm unities. The RSFs are community planning and capacity building; economic; health and social services; housing; infrastructure systems; and natural and cultural resources. Each RSF has coordinating and primary federal agencies, and supporting organizations. The coordinating agency for the health and social services RSF is the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with the Office of the 1Region II includes New Jersey , New York, Puerto Rico, a nd the U.S. Virgin Islands. 2The National Disaster Recovery Framewor k is available from FEMA at http:// www.fema.gov/national-disa ster-recovery-framework (acces sed September 9, 2103).

ACF is focused on child well- being, and Thomas said that ACF services touch the lives of every community and every tribal nation across the country. In the event of any major disaster, ACF provides situational awareness on human services systems status and disaster-caused unmet needs; conducts outreach to Office of Child Care (OCC) and Office of Head Start (OHS) programs and grantees; coordinates federal support for children's needs; conducts immediate disaster case management assessments and services; participates in the identification of the \"problem set\" for federal partners; defines the landscape of potential need for federal support and engagement across interagency in support of health and social services recovery, including new partners coming in to assist in response and recovery; focuses on establishing structure to support local long-term recovery operations at regional level; and identifies opportunities for building resilience (capacity, mitigation). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary112 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES As an example of ACF activities, Thomas highlighted the role of ACF in support of the health and social service RSF core mission area of referral to social services/disaster case management. ACF implements coordinated systems for rapid referral to appropriate social services, and strategic leveraging of federal service programs to mitigate social disruption and transition people back to self-sufficiency. ACF also facilitates the Federal Disaster Ca se Management program to address unmet recovery needs. Hurricane Sandy and the NDRF Hurricane Sandy was the first large- scale event that prompted NDRF implementation, Thomas said. The storm impacted 5 of the 10 ACF regional offices. About 70 staff members were deployed during the response phase, logging more than 16,000 staff hours. Three disaster case management assessments were conducted, which indicated that 86 Head Start centers and 697 child care centers were closed across Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York. In the transition from response to the recovery phase, ACF provides recovery-related technical assistance for HHS and ACF programs by encouraging, facilitating, and supp orting children's task forces; providing support from OCC and OHS for early childhood center re-openings; providing early childhood programs and children's issues subject matter expert teams; and providing linkages to human services networks. In addition, ACF provid es financial recovery assistance through Social Services Block Grants, Head Start funding, and Family Violence Prevention Grants. Thomas noted that ACF provided $474 million in funding for Hurricane Sandy recovery, $2 million of which will go toward family violence prevention. An additional $95 million in recovery aid will be available for Head Start centers. In closing, Thomas stressed that the health and human services pieces of HHS need to work in tandem, educating each other about their respective disciples, and communicati ng better about available tools and resources. Unlike a disaster event, recovery is a process and may take a very long time. Restoration of health and social services systems following a disaster requires coordination, communication, and collab-oration among various levels of government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and impacted communities. Situations such as Hurricane Sandy provide teachable mome nts, and Thomas reiterated the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

She urged participants not to become weary in doing good and important work. CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES TASK FORCES FOR RECOVERY Lieutenant Commander Jonathan White, deputy director of the Office of Human Services Emergency Preparedness and Response at ACF within HHS, stressed that responding to the needs of children in disasters is not about \"pediatric populat ions\" or \"at-risk populations.\" It is about children, youth, and families, and the world as children encounter it. It is vital, he said, to have a strategy that is multisectoral and multidisciplinary. White highlighted three key cha llenges to meeting the needs of children, youth, and families in a disaster. One of the foremost challenges is the limited interoperab ility of human services, public health and medical (including behavioral health), and emergency management systems. Of these three areas, White noted that human services is least connected to the other two. Second is the pro-found vulnerabilities of child care providers and the formidable financial barriers to child care recovery. White explained that a public hospital that suffers an uninsured loss looks to FEMA for public assistance. However, as for-profit entities, the vast majority of America's child care providers are ineligible for FEMA public assistance. Many are also ineligible for Small Business Administration disaster loans because their profit margins are too small to make them credit-worthy. As noted earlier, child care workers are not well funded at baseline, with average earnings of about $21,000 per year. Third, disaster human services in the United States have historically focused on sheltered populations, not communities; however, the human services purview is the entire population. \"As for-profit entities, the vast majority of America's child care providers are ineligible for FEMA public assistance. Many are also ineligible for Small Business Administration disaster loans because their profit margins are too small to make them credit-worthy.\" \u2014Jonathan White Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary114 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Community-Level Task Forces A key intervention, White said, is the community-level task force focused on children, youth, and families' needs in recovery. The task force is a whole-community coordination forum that is multisectoral, multilevel, and multidisciplinary. It is often led by a state agency with equities in children's services, convened by the state with support from ACF and Save the Children, and brings together a broad array of child- serving organizations (see Box 10-1). The goal of the task force is to develop a common operating picture on children's needs across the public, education, and early childhood sectors. A key feature of the task fo rce is that it makes available to community-level leaders a ready chan nel to get technical assistance and subject-matter expertise from national organizations and federal agencies. The task force facilitates the integration of early childhood programs and the behavioral health mission. One of the most important places to be providing behavioral hea lth services in the birth-to-5 age group is child care and Head Start, he said. The task force also enables resource pooling to address gaps. In Joplin, Missouri, for example, the tornado struck just after the Head Start centers in that community had closed in the summer. Head Start grantees had transportation and facilities that were child-suitable and were able to add these resources to the pool and help close the care gaps in the remainder of the community. Because of the particular vulnerabilities of child care, White said it is often helpful to have a child care wo rkgroup within the larger children's task force. Participants would includ e the lead state agency for child care (in some states there may be multiple lead state agencies for child care), ACF, the child care resource and refe rral agency, Save the Children, child care providers, affected families, FEMA, and others. The role for national organizations and federal agencies in recovery is to support the state leadership, empower communities, and provide them every resource and tool that will help them achieve recovery. The community needs ownership of the process, White concluded. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

STATE PERSPECTIVE: NEW JERSEY CHILD TASK FORCE Allison Blake, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families (DCF), di scussed preparedness and response before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. In the state of New Jersey, DCF is responsible for Child Protective Services, all of children's behavioral health care, and services for children with intellectual and Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary116 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES developmental disabilities. DCF operates a network of special education schools for pregnant and parenting teens and children with profound physical impairments, and a very large network of community-based family-strengthening child abuse prevention programs. Blake noted that DCF has no responsibility or authorit y for sheltering or decision making around mass care. Each of the 21 c ounties in New Jersey has a county department of human services that is responsible for emergency sheltering and for local homeless sheltering and boarding homes; a county department of health; and an office of emergency management. In each county, there is also a board of social services (formerly called the county welfare agency) that provides temporary assistance for needy families, emergency assistance, an d housing assistance. In some counties, the head of Social Services reports to the Department of Human Services, while in others it operates independently. This inconsistency across counties became one of the most complicated parts of the disaster response to Hurricane Sandy, Blake noted. Preparations Hurricane Sandy touched down in New Jersey on October 29, 2012. Blake said that the magnitude of the approaching storm was not fully appreciated until 4 or 5 days before that. In preparation, DCF looked to other jurisdictions for lessons about child welfare. For example, when Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005, many state offices were impacted. At that time, Louisiana did not have a client tracking system or a robust system of electronic records, and numerous paper records were destroyed or lost. As a result, foster children who moved out of state with their displaced foster parents were essentially missing, for 2 years in some cases. Medications and prescriptions were lost for children in foster care (and many of the children in the welfare system are taking psychotropic medications which should not be discontinued abruptly). In fall 2012, New Jersey already had a robust electronic record system in place for case management. In preparation for the storm, DCF established the existing child abuse hotli ne as the hub or central point of communications for contact with DCF on any issue. All children's and women's service providers and all foster parents were notified of this central contact hub via blast e-mails, phone calls, and alerts on the DCF website. Staff were sent to coastal areas to retrieve state vehicles used to Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryHURRICANE SANDY EXPERIENCE 117 transport children and move them to higher ground so they would be serviceable after the storm. After the Storm Devastating flooding and widespread power outages meant that many people did not have television or Internet access to obtain news. The DCF central operations, where the hotline is based, did not flood or lose power, and it became the central point of communications and operations. DCF was able to put in calls to every foster parent in the state within the first 5 days after the storm. There were also daily conference calls with FEMA and the Red Cross. The day after the storm, the governor's office began holding conference calls twice daily and providing reports on the number of people in shelters. Although they had data on the number of adults, senior citizens, and even pets, there were no data on child ren in shelters. As a result, DCF sent \"well-being teams\" to the shelters to meet with the Red Cross and the county staff and check on the children and families. Blake explained that the name of the teams was intentionally chosen because many people hear \"State Depa rtment of Children and Families\" but think \"Child Protective Services.\" Blake noted that although many individuals and families who stayed in longer-term shelters were not known to the public systems, they had been living on the edge and were in need of public services. DCF had public health nurses and social workers talking with these people to understand why they were still in the shelter after they were able to return to their communities or other housing options. A key aspect of the response to Hurricane Sandy was coalition building though the activation of ex isting resources and relationships. Immediately after the storm, DCF contacted the human services directors in the impacted counties. DCF also reached out to the FEMA-operated disaster recovery centers to provide information about available local social services and community support. The State-Led Child Task Force was also created, focused on identifying a short-term recovery plan for children and families, and long-te rm recovery needs around trauma, resilience, and other issues. In addition to DCF and the New Jersey Departments of Health, Human Servic es, and Education, task force mem- bers included FEMA, ACF, AAP, New Jersey Volunteer Organizations Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary118 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BOX 10-2 New Jersey DCF Long-Term Recovery Plan Target Areas of Focus Strengthening families and preventing incidence of child abuse that would be exacerbated by the storm Strategically bolster DCF's network of Family Success Centers to enable the centers to continue to be a resource to families during the long-term recovery phase. Provide direct assistance to foster /resource homes displaced by the storm to maintain stable home environments for children under the care of the Department of Chil d Protection and Permanency. Ensure child protection worker caseload sizes remain at appropriate levels to be able to effectively and efficiently respond to allegations of abuse or neglect. Expand respite services for families with children with special needs. Engage pediatric primary health care practices in a partnership to assess, identify, and intervene in a coordinated manner to mitigate the potential negative impacts of this disaster. Preventing violence and exploitation exacerbated by the storm's impact Broaden existing domestic violence prevention programming. Prepare the domestic violence inte rvention system for the expected increase in incidents of domestic violence. Strengthen programs for homeless youth and victims of human trafficking. Building resiliency and supporting recovery Expand access to mental health services for children. Provide evidence-based psychosocial disaster recovery programming in schools. Provide psychosocial programming for child care centers and other early childhood centers to promote positive early childhood development and build resilience.

NEW YORK STATE CHILD CARE RESPONSE The New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) is the child welfare agency, the juve nile justice agency, and regulates all modalities of child care (with the excep tion of child care centers in New York City). Janice Molnar, deputy commissioner of the Division of Child Care Services at the New York State OCFS, described the office's preparation and response to Hurricane Sandy. There are more than 4 million children in New York State, and almost 400,000 live in the Hurricane Sandy surge areas. 4 In the days before the storm, OCFS staff prepared geographic information system (GIS) maps of all of the child care providers in the vulnerable coastal areas of the Rockaways and Long Beach. In the days immediately following the storm, the initial focu s of OCFS was identifying child care programs that were open and possibly able to take in children from affected areas. She pointed out that this was different from the early federal data collection focus, which was on identifying programs that were closed (to make the case for resources before Congress). There are numerous challenges to collecting data from child care facilities. There are thousands of independent operato rs who are not part of organized networks, and often not reachable through standard communication strategies and mechanisms. Because ma ny home-based providers are not technology-savvy or do not have e- mail, OCFS still sends out important communications by regular mail, resulting in delays in response. Staff also went door to door to conduct operational assessments of providers. The numbers of open and impacted cen ters was continuously refined as more information became available. Ultimately, about 11,500 licensed and registered child care programs were impacted by the storm in the 13 3Available at http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/ home/Hurrican (accesse d September 9, 2013). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary120 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES counties for which President Obama issued a major disaster declaration (more than half of the 21,000 regulated programs in the state as a whole). Tools and Best Practices The day after Hurricane Sandy, OCFS developed and implemented an assessment tool for the licensing staff to use when determining the level of impact on child care programs (via phone if possible, or on foot through onsite inspections). One of the goals of outreach, Molnar explained, was to help open programs stay open, even those without heat, running water, or light. Children's circ umstances were so dire that most would not have fared any better stay ing at home, and for many it would have been even worse. It was also im portant to maintain the continuity of care for children to preserve some sense of normalcy in their lives, and to support parents who were struggling with significant issues and for whom the provision of child care was a relief. The GIS maps of facilities created before the storm were overl aid against FEMA maps of flood and surge zones so that OCFS could triage outreach to programs that had the greatest potential of being impacted on the storm. Assessors looked for very basic health and safety proce dures (e.g., bottled water, safe food storage, sufficient clothing and blankets, sanitation, working smoke detectors, a way to contact emergency services, and sufficient staff/ adequate child supervision). Molnar noted that OCFS waived staff-to- child ratio and group-size requirements on a case-by-case basis to keep as many programs open as possible. She added, as noted by others, that many of the staff helping in the recovery effort were themselves impacted by the storm. Working to Stay Open The New York government is a state-supervised, county-administered system, which means that the 62 coun ties have a considerable authority in determining how they run their child care subsidy systems and other social services. Because there was no time for counties to do plan amendments, OCFS created a simple checklist that counties could submit (by e-mail or by phone) for on-the-spot approval by the state of expanded services to affected families. Districts could be allowed, for example, to extend the eligibility period for services, expand the definition of a child needing protective services, or expand the amount of time a district can Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryHURRICANE SANDY EXPERIENCE 121 pay for child care for families seeki ng employment. Molnar stressed the importance of daily communication with the commissioners of the departments of Social Services in the affected counties, representatives of the governor's office, and representatives of all applicable state agencies. In addition to outreach, OCFS co-c hairs the Children's Issues Task Force with ACF Region II (discussed by Thomas, above), and Molnar noted that they continue to meet monthly. Meeting agendas included topics such as review of time sensitive deadlines, update on temporary shelters and assistance, updates on housing, or mental health supports. Subcommittees concentrate on specific topical areas such as outreach to immigrant populations, disaster-relat ed food loss, and behavioral and mental health. OCFS made resources for providers and families available on its website in both English and Spanish, issued waivers to programs to allow them to temporarily relocate, and OCFS staff provided onsite case management at the seven FEMA disaster recovery centers on Long Island. In addition, Governor Cuomo issued an executive order that allowed for temporary suspension of certain statutory provisions related to programs under the jurisdiction of OCFS (for example, child care subsidy eligibility predetermination coul d be processed in the absence of a family's supporting documents, which were likely destroyed in the storm). Lessons Learned Molnar described current OCFS activities to improve child care provider emergency preparedness. Ex isting regulations are very basic and require providers to have a writt en plan for evacuation and to have evacuation drills once per month. OCFS is proposing new regulations to ensure that each program has onsite supplies sufficient for an overnight stay, including nonperishable food, wa ter, first aid, and other safety equipment in the event parents are unable to pick up children due to a local disaster. There is also a focus on all-hazards planning and training for providers, including chain of command, communications, emergency kits, evacuation and sheltering plans, and business recovery. Online videos are available for providers on emergency scenarios such as what Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary122 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES to pack in a \"to go\" bag or emergency kit.5 It can take a while for actual on-the-ground practice to catch up with best practice, Molnar concluded, and in New York \"we've had no choice but to catch up as best we can.\" As national guidelines and support at the federal level are beginning to include the \"recovery\" phase more and more in documents and agendas, these children and family ag encies affected by Hurricane Sandy are important examples of the work and outreach that need to be done after the incident occurs. This also presents an opportunity to engage child care providers and agencies across the country to share lessons and work collectively through ACF on improving plans and preparedness for future incidents. 5The video library is available at http ://www.ecetp.albany.edu/videolibrary.shtm# emergencyvids (accesse d September 9, 2013).

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary123 11 Final Remarks Workshop committee chair Michael A nderson noted that we are past the starting line and have made progress in many areas related to children's needs, but still need to get to a better state. The participation of national leaders and subject-matter experts was a key strength of this Institute of Medicine workshop, as was the broad array of topics discussed relevant to taking better care of children faced with disaster, he continued. Despite the diversity of experts in the room, Anderson again reiterated that there is still the need to bring others to the table and broaden the group of stakeholders that engages in these conversations at the national and local levels (e.g., more involvement from the child care and education fields, private practitioners). Many nontraditional partners familiar with children could bring a wealth of knowledge to the public health and health care professionals to augment planning and response, but they are often not engaged, or do not realize they could be a resource. Many of the barriers to progress that were discussed are financial as well as a lack of centralization a nd coordination for information and resources. As noted by many participants, there is usually no payment or reimbursement for preparedness activ ities. Administrators and child services providers are increasingly asked to do more with less, and although they acknowledge the importan ce of emergency planning, there are many competing priorities. Ho w do advocates for children make and keep disaster preparedness for child ren and families a priority? The concept of multifaceted efforts (i.e., designing things to meet daily operational needs that can also me et the needs of patients during disasters) was discussed as one opportunity for progress in preparedness in the face of financial constraints. Also mentioned was balancing the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary124 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES wealth of resources, tools, and best practices happening at the grassroots level with the lack of coordination and centralization for these issues. Moving forward, children and family issues in preparedness could use a centralized home that practitioners and caregivers across the country can access to augment their planning. Revisiting remarks from Irwin Redlener's keynote speech, Anderson pointed out that the challenge now is figuring out how to move from lessons learned to actions taken, actually implementing the many best practices shared by speakers. In th e same vein, testing the many plans and annexes that have been devel oped is an important second step in making sure that they are sufficient and robust enough to perform as expected. Various speakers highlighted the need for a national exercise focused on pediatrics and surge capacity. Upperman presented promising ideas to improve competency in pediatrics and using games and drills at the hospital level to familiarize provide rs, but taking this to a higher level and coordinating drills across regions or across the country could be very beneficial to identifying remaining gaps in plans and seeing where strengths are. Finally, Anderson pointed out that although the summary of the workshop will help disseminate information about the many tools, websites, and resources discussed by the participants, there remains a need for a \"clearing house\" for sharing information and best practices. With the continued interest and engage ment of invested federal agencies mentioned throughout the summary, as well as the reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2013, the conditions are favorable to make strong impacts in these areas of children and families in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.

The committee will develop the workshop agenda, select and invite speakers and discussants, and moderate the discussions. Specifically, the topics to be addressed at the workshop will include the following: How state and local health department emergency planning should integrate the needs of children and families. How child care systems should incorporate emergency planning into day-to-day operations, and how they can partner with state and local health departments. How public health can assist with child separation/family reunification through pre-event health education development. Opportunities to integrate the needs of children and families in public health readiness at the state and local level. What community partners would be critical for covering as many children as possible (age, ethnicity, disability status, etc.) during an emergency. How state and local health departments should connect with these community partners for the purposes of emergency preparedness and response. An individually authored workshop summary will be prepared by a designated rapporteur based on the information gathered and the discussions held during the workshop.

Children represent nearly 25 percent of the U.S. population, but current state and local preparedness plans often do not include specific considerations for pediatric pop-ulations and families. The prepare dness and resilience of communities related to children will require a systems framework for disaster preparedness across traditional and nontraditional medical and public health stakeholders, including community organizations, schools, and other partners in municipal planning. This workshop will examine medical and public health preparedness related to children and families, including children with special health care needs. The workshop will review already existing tools and frame- works that can be modified to include pediatric needs, as well as partnerships and organizati ons with vested interest that can be leveraged Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary134 CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES in planning to improve outcomes and allow for pediatric considerations to be integrated throughout local and state emergency plans.

PROLOGUE The post-Katrina trailer park wh ere we met \"M\" was markedly dif- ferent from the many others that had sprung up in the weeks and months following the devastating 2005 hurricane. Rather than being situated in a dusty field, surrounded by chain-link fencing, this trailer park was in a forested glen. The houses were well-kept, single-wide mobile homes, ar-ranged in a horseshoe shape around a grassy field, rather than the smaller travel trailers arranged in endless rows common to other trailer parks. Our research team of interviewers pulled up to this trailer park mid-afternoon just as the school bus arrived. Twenty to 30 school- children emptied from the bus and went running across the field to their Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Many knew each other from their old New Orleans neighborhood in the Lower Ninth Ward. The reside nts were mainly working-class and working-poor residents who had been displaced from their homes, and represented a mix of homeowners and renters living in this Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-subsidized emergency housing. Our team of 15 researchers fanned out across the trailer park to re- cruit the mobile home residents to our Gulf Coast Child and Family Health Study. This was the baseline survey for what would ultimately be a 5-year longitudinal cohort study of 1,079 randomly sampled house-holds in Louisiana and Mississippi. The interviews generally took about 45 minutes. One of the interviewers emerged from a home after 2 hours with the resident. She was visibly moved as she recounted the woman's story. \"M\" was in her late 40s, a mother of 2 children, 1 high-school-aged, the other an adult. During the hurricane, \"M\" was separated from her husband and daughters, because she had been required to report to the health care facility where she worked and ended up evacuating with the patients. For almost a week, the family did not know of one another's fate, or even whether they had survived the storm. They ended up reunit- ed at a Texas shelter, and during the succeeding 6 months leading up to our interview, they moved 7 times, across multiple states. As \"M\" de-scribed her journey to our interviewer, she pulled out a scrapbook. It was filled with pictures\u2014of her destroyed home in New Orleans, and then of every place where she and the family had stayed since the hurri- cane. They had moved from shelter to shelter, to hotels and motels, to crowded homes where they doubled up with friends, and ultimately to this trailer park. Her husband drove their teenaged daughter back and forth to her old New Orleans high school daily, commuting up to 4 hours in an effort to maintain this stability in their daughter's life. The snap- shots in the scrapbook chronicled this story. \"Whenever my girls face something difficult in their lives, I want them to be able to pull this scrapbook out,\" \"M\" told our interviewer. \"I want them to see where they've been, the challenges they've faced. This is their strength. There isn't anything they can't handle.\" Our research team re-interviewed \"M\" three more times in the sub- sequent 5 years. Two years after the hurricane, the team found her living in a travel trailer in the front yard of her New Orleans home as she su-pervised its reconstruction. By the last round of interviewing, she and her family had moved back in to their home, and her daughter had grad- uated from high school and was attending college. It appeared that the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As a tale of resilience, \"M\"'s story reflects so many of the character- istics and attributes identified by researchers. Despite exposure to ex- treme adversity, \"M\"'s daughter maintained critical academic routines, was encouraged by her parents to develop her cognitive skills, was living in a supportive and nurturing household with a mother who actively promoted her daughter's sense of self-efficacy and hope for the future (embodied by a tangible tool\u2014the scrapbook\u2014to reinforce the message). \"M\" herself was a woman who personified \"hardiness\" and whose per- sonal outlook was dominated by her faith, good humor, and unshakable optimism. At a larger level, her daughter's resilience was further bol- stered by the sense of community offered by the mobile home park, by the stability of her mother's workplace, and even by the policies that brought her family back to the Lower Ninth Ward to become actively engaged in the community's redevelopment. All of this leads to a central question: Is it possible to design poli- cies, programs, and interventions to replicate such resilience? Is it feasi- ble to identify the factors that promote such \"resilient\" outcomes among children and youth, either directly or indirectly, and then target interven- tions to enhance, activate, or facilitate these factors? Resilience is com- plex, operating at multiple intersecting levels that encompass individual biology, cognition, and psychology; family dynamics; communal and institutional support systems; and policy environments. This puzzle re- flects a fundamental question that has been posed by Yehuda and col- leagues (2006): \"Are resilient people born, or made?\" INTRODUCTION In this white paper, we consider the current science and practice of resilience interventions for children and youth 1 who are susceptible to disasters or who have been exposed to disasters. Starting from the central question introduced in the prologue above\u2014is it possible to design evidence-based resilience interventions for children?\u2014this paper reviews the ways in which resilience research has influenced resilience interven- tions, considers specific illustrations of these resilience practices, and examines the evidentiary base for these activities. Furthermore, we will place these disaster-related resilience interventions within a public health framework of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Public 1In the interest of editorial brevity, throughout this white paper, we will mainly refer to children and youth, across the age spectrum of toddler to adolescent, as \"children\" Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The field of resilience research has evolved in the 50 years since de- velopmental psychologists first began examining what factors contribut- ed to the positive social, emotional, and intellectual growth of children growing up in the face of highly adverse conditions, such as being reared by a schizophrenic parent (Garmezy, 1985; Garmezy et al., 1984) or liv- ing in environments of extreme poverty (Masten, 2001). Researchers noted that deficit models that focused on correlations among a child's personality, environment, and subsequent psychopathology were inade- quate frameworks for providing robust explanations of how children de- veloped. The goal was not merely to avoid psychopathology in children, but also to understand how children achieved their cognitive, social, and emotional potential. By contrasting children who were more successful at reaching key developmental milestones despite their adverse circum- stances with those who were less successful, effectively illuminating what made them resilient, researchers hypothesized that they could artic- ulate adaptation mechanisms. After these adaptation pathways were un-derstood, the subsequent step would involve developing interventions that stimulated or facilitated these growth processes to encourage better outcomes for more children, regardless of their circumstances. As a number of scholars have noted, this field of \"positive psycholo- gy\" spawned a short list of factors that were persistently associated with children's ability to adapt and achieve developmental milestones despite being exposed to chronic and acute adverse conditions (Luthar and Cicchetti, 2000; 2008; Wright et al., 2013). These factors included child- specific characteristics such as good cognitive abilities; positive con- structs of self (including self-efficacy and self-control); attitudinal and belief systems that encompassed hopefulness, faith, and a positive worldview; and the ability to form and sustain relationships with parents, peers, and siblings. Studies of American soldiers who were held captive in Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp s for extended periods revealed many of the same characteristics of resilience among adults (Yehuda et al., 2006). Scholars have long noted that children do not grow up in a vacuum, but are embedded in a number of concentric social systems that support and nourish them\u2014notably, their parents, their households, their peers, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryAPPENDIX G 181 the institutions with which they interact, their communities, and society as a whole (Bronfenbrenner, 1986)\u2014all of which exert an influence on children's ability to adapt to adverse conditions. Factors across all of these domains are often divided into two categories: those that \"promote\" adaptive competencies in children, and those that \"protect\" them from the negative consequences of exposure to adverse events leading to psy-chopathologies or stunted development. Wright and colleagues (2013) have referred to this phase of inquiry in the scientific evolution as the first two of four waves of resilience research: the first wave identified resilience factors, and the second wave explored resilience processes within individuals and across these multiple social systems. With each succeeding wave, the resilience research field expanded beyond the original boundaries of developmental psychology. Wright et al. (2013) referred to the third wave as the examination of interventions that might enhance or facilitate resilience, and the still-emerging fourth wave is focused on a consideration of multiple system effects, notably within the fields of epigenetics and neurobiology. In the second and third waves, social scientists, education researchers, and social epidemiolo- gists applied their disciplinary perspectives, particularly as the research explored the intersection of multiple levels (e.g., How does one measure a family or community's social capital and its relationship to a child's ability to adapt?); the relationship of resilience to health outcomes (in-cluding the biological mechanisms of action of adverse events triggering stress responses, which, in turn, lead to biochemical and genetic chang- es); and the institutional settings most conducive to resilience interven- tions for children (e.g., schools and day care centers). These succeeding waves of resilience research have resulted in sig- nificant analytical shifts in the field as well. What began in the first wave as qualitative case-based research and quantitative variable-based re-search that generally relied on correlational analyses such as regression modeling, analysis of covariance, and categorical data analyses has evolved to include hierarchical modeling; latent growth curve analyses (particularly when looking at the relationship of resilience factors com- pared to recovery over time) (Bonanno et al., 2011); structural equation and propensity score modeling (Abramson et al., 2010b, Stehling-Ariza et al., 2012); and complex system science approaches (Sherrieb et al., 2010). The benefit of such sophisticated analyses is that they permit far more nuanced tests of frameworks and models that can incorporate mul-tiple social levels, as well as dimensions of time. The cost to such com-plexity is that it may be regarded as out of reach for a practice communi- ty eager to translate such findings in to programs and interventions. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary182 APPENDIX G As different scientific communities struggled with finding common ground in defining, operationalizing, and analyzing resilience, the con- cept of population resilience emerged in political discourse as well, par- ticularly during the past decade. In 2005, the United Nations secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction convened 168 coun- tries in Japan, culminating in the Hyogo Framework for Action. This in-ternational blueprint for risk reduction urged countries to develop nation-al resilience programs and strategies to reduce the impacts of natural dis- asters. In response, political leaders in a number of countries, including the United States and Canada, called for national resilience efforts. For example, the 2009 U.S. National Health Security Strategy has two goals, the first of which is to \"build community resilience\" and the second of which is to strengthen health and emergency response systems. This foundational policy document goes on to elaborate that Communities help build resilience by implementing policies and prac- tices to ensure the conditions under which people can be healthy, by assuring access to medical care, building social cohesion, supporting healthy behaviors, and creating a culture of preparedness in which bystander response to emergencies is not the exception but the norm. In Presidential Policy Directive 8, issued in 2011, resilience is defined as \"the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies\" [emphasis added] (Brown, 2011). This political rhetoric has translated to administrative action as well. Among the notable mandates are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Public Health Emergency Preparedness Capabili- ties: National Standards for State and Local Planning (2011), which lists community preparedness and community recovery as the two capabilities that every public health department should plan for as part of their \"community resilience\" domain. State and public health agencies, in turn, are tasked with identifying processes and outcome measures that can demonstrate to their satisfaction, and that of their federal funders, that they are engaging in and achieving \"community resilience.\" Al-though these appear to be entirely different constructs from individual resilience, as Norris and colleagues (2008) pointed out in their seminal article on community resilience, (a) the concept of resilience is often viewed metaphorically rather than operationally (in that it represents a return to a prior steady state after being shocked or deformed, and thus may be viewed as either an outcome or a dynamic process), and (b) community resilience is often measured as the capacity to sustain indi- vidual physical and mental health and well-being within a community Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryAPPENDIX G 183 (Norris et al., 2008). The combination of the definitional ambiguity and the potential interpretation of community resilience as the aggregation of individually resilient residents suggests considerable measurement challenges. In addition to scientific and governmental interest in cultivating \"re- silience interventions,\" there has been increasing awareness and attention to the specific risks associated with children who have been exposed to natural, technological, and manmade disasters (NCCD, 2010; Peek, 2008). Despite the apparent rarity of a disaster happening in any one in- dividual's life, in recent years the number of domestic disasters and complex emergencies affecting children and youth has increased\u2014 including several high-profile events such as the World Trade Center attacks (Hoven et al., 2003); Hurricane Katrina (Abramson et al., 2008; McLaughlin et al., 2009); the BP oil spill (Abramson et al., 2010a); the Joplin, Missouri, tornado; the Newt own, Connecticut, school shooting; and, most recently, the Moore, Oklahoma, tornado. In addition to these major events, children are exposed to any number of \"smaller\" commu- nal disasters, including flooding, wildfires, and mass traumas. The acute phases of a disaster inevitably lead to secondary stresses on children and youth: displacement, academic interruptions and disruptions, social net- work cleavages, and economic and mobility constraints. These initial and secondary stresses lead to many consequences, some of them invisible for years. Among these are physical health effects and increased rates of chronic health conditions that emerge across the lifespan; immediate and enduring mental health effects, including self-limiting posttraumatic stress disorder, behavioral and emotional disturbance, and complicated grief; educational disadvantages, including missed grade promotions; and social role effects. Alongside this increased awareness and understanding of the many complex effects of disasters on children has been a growing emphasis by governmental, philanthropic, and voluntary sectors on iden- tifying and intervening to promote positive development among children and avert long-term morbidity and pathology. Cumulatively, these various interests, the evolving science, and the pressing demands to address children's needs post-disaster have led to an increasing appreciation of the need to develop evidence-based resilience interventions.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary184 APPENDIX G THE LANDSCAPE OF DISASTER-RELATED RESILIENCE INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN We employed several search strategies to identify programs and in- terventions whose expressed goals and objectives were to enhance chil- dren's resiliency and to identify evidence of the effectiveness of resili-ence interventions. The initial Internet search for programs was conduct-ed using the following search Based on these search criteria, a limited number of programs were identified. A second search was conducted in which we added identifiers \"9/11 terror attacks.\" Lastly, programs were further identified and researched as they arose throughout the literature search. For instance, programs referenced by articles uncovered during the literature search were included in the list of programs. Each program or intervention was reviewed to determine if it intentionally addressed any of the \"short list\" of resilience factors identified in the literature (Wright et al., 2013). A total of 17 programs were identified; these are listed in Tables G-1 and G-2. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all resilience programs or intervention s, but rather an illustrative list. As depicted in Table G-1, we have characterized resilience interven- tions according to moderating and mediating factors that correspond to the most commonly cited predictors of child resilience. The interventions may be intended directly for the children and youth or for the parents or household, or be targeted to larger social spheres such as child-oriented institutions or the community at large. For each mediating or moderating factor, we have further distinguished the programmatic objectives of the interventions. For example, there are resilience interventions that focus on promoting \"self-identity,\" and within that domain there are distinct programmatic objectives of enhancing self-efficacy and others for en- hancing self-esteem. We have also characterized each of the interven- tion's objectives by where it would fit in a public health prevention mod- el. Given that these disaster resilience programs are often similar in size and scale to community-based health promotion and disease prevention programs, and that there may be advantages to aligning the resilience programs with similar programs that target risk reduction or skill en-hancement among children and youth, we have categorized the interven- tions as fitting within primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention models: Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryAPPENDIX G 185 Primary prevention programs target populations who are po- tentially exposed to disaster, and their objective is to prevent ex- posure to, or consequences of, adverse or toxic agents. This is consistent with the definition of resilience as \"withstanding\" or resisting the disaster exposure. Much of the programmatic activi- ty in these programs occurs before the disaster. Secondary prevention programs target populations who were exposed to disaster but for whom it is unknown whether or to what extent they were affected. The objective of these programs is to \"treat\" populations to minimize the debilitating effects of disaster exposure. This is consiste nt with the definition of resili- ence as \"adapting,\" and generally occurs after the disaster and the exposure. Tertiary prevention programs target populations who were exposed and affected; their objective is to facilitate rapid and complete recovery and prevent \"spread\" to others or deteriora- tion of the health of the population. This is consistent with the definition of resilience as \"rapid recovery,\" and exclusively oc- curs after the disaster exposure. Table G-2 describes the specific programs that illustrate the resilience objectives in Table G-1. Overall, it is noteworthy how few programs were identified using these search criteria, and it suggests that the field of \"interventional resil- ience\" programming for children and youth is still evolving. It is likely that a number of programs have been developed in response to disasters, but are implemented locally with little documentation or evaluation of their effectiveness. Furthermore, we are aware of a number of programs in development whose express purpose is to enhance child and youth resilience through targeted interventions, but they are in the early stages of design and implementation. It is also important to note that we have purposefully excluded the many non-disaster resilience programs that exist (Head Start and 4-H programs, for example), because disaster con- text is often quite distinct from chr onic adversities or more routine envi- ronments. We also elected to exclude programs or interventions that were narrowly focused on mental health treatment only, even in post- disaster settings. Many of the programs and interventions we identified were built on preparedness education models, in which children and youth were taught the basics of emergency preparedness, given risk-specific instructions (such as seeking shelter in tornado-susceptible areas or bomb shelters in war zones), and taught specific survival and recovery skills.

Many of these programs are explicitly intended to enhance self-efficacy and provide opportunities for helping others, although we have attempted to characterize these programs by their presumed or implicit objectives, notwithstanding their stated programmatic goals. Virtually all of these education-based interventions occur in the pre-disaster stage and are generally intended to promote moderating traits among children and youth. In addition, they develop facets within youth that may be \"mobi- lized\" during a disaster and that can serve as risk-activated moderators. Several of the programs and interventions promote very specific so- cial and emotional skills, including stress-reduction techniques (e.g., Is- rael's Urban Resilience Program), communication and relationship- building techniques (e.g., Journey of Hope), or political advocacy skills (e.g., the Vietnamese American Young Leaders Association [VAYLA] and the Rethinkers, both in New Orleans). These skill-oriented programs are a combination of pre- and post-disaster activities and appear to be most effective as primary prevention models when they are tied to spe- cific risks or hazards. Three programs in particular\u2014Save the Children's Resilient and Ready Community Initiatives, the Communities Advancing Resilience Toolkit, and the Joplin Child Care Task Force\u2014focus on community- wide policies, infrastructure, governance and response entities, and child- oriented institutions rather than directly on the children or youth. Their objectives fit more properly into larger ecological models of resilience, in which children's well-being is contingent on the stability and compe- tency of multiple institutions affecting their lives. We have included these broader community-oriented programs in the program matrix be- cause they explicitly reference children's well-being and resilience as a programmatic objective. A number of the resilience interventions seek to broaden children and youth's worldviews, offering historical, political, and social context to disaster events and their consequences. These include the New York City-based 9/12 project that emerged after the September 11 attacks, Israel's Urban Resilience Program, VAYLA and the Rethinkers pro-grams in New Orleans, and FEMA's Youth Advisory Council. Although these programs differ in their perspectives, all offer youth explanatory frameworks for disaster risk and consequence that promote hopefulness and agency for the children. These programs are a mix of pre- and post-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Across all these resilience interventions, however, there is very lim- ited evaluation of their effectiveness or representation of a clear evidence base that reflects interventions mapped to theoretical constructs that had been measured and analyzed. Although the research literature offers sub-stantial evidence on the relationship of child, parental, and communal characteristics to child development, the evidence for programmatic effectiveness is extraordinarily shallow. The next section considers some of the challenges in developing such an evidence base for resilience interventions. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryAPPENDIX G 197 EVALUATING THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR RESILIENCE INTERVENTIONS At a minimum, there appear to be at least three types of challenges to the development of an evidence base for resilience interventions: defini- tional, operational, and political. These are above and beyond the simpler explanation that this is still a young field, particularly in the context of disasters, and that it will take time for the programs to be sufficiently developed to allow for robust evaluations and accumulation of evidence. Definitional challenges: o Resilience outcomes are not universal or standardized. Even distinguishing between the ability to withstand, adapt, or re-cover quickly reflects vastly different outcomes, and there is still a vigorous debate about whether resilience is a process, a latent construct, or a specific outcome. Furthermore, resili-ence can only be measured in the presence of (or in response to) an adverse or potentially traumatic event, thus complicat- ing pre-disaster baseline measurement. o There is still considerable debate about whether resilience is defined as the absence of mental health pathology, the achievement of a specific developmental milestone, or the representation of a specific constellation of positive attrib-utes (e.g., self-efficacy, positive worldview, etc.). The latter also raises the question of whether resilience may be subjec- tively or objectively measured. o Because of the recent interest in resilience across many dis- ciplines and sectors, there are numerous methodologies and disciplinary lexicons that do not necessarily align. Operational challenges: o The processes and factors underlying resilience are extraor- dinarily complex, operating at multiple levels that include biological, psychological, soci al, and cultural domains. Ana- lytical techniques such as systems science and structural equation modeling are being employed to handle these com-plex designs, although the value of such approaches will re-quire many replicated studies. The statistical complexity also limits its accessibility to researchers and stakeholders. Be- yond that, the multidisciplinary nature of these complex re- search questions and designs requires scientists and scholars who can understand and apply theory and methods from areas of expertise far beyond their own. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop Summary198 APPENDIX G o The nature of much resilience research is that it relies on ob- servational data, which is daunting for a number of reasons. The events themselves are rare and unpredictable; it is diffi- cult to get into the field quickly enough to collect critical time-series data; there are rarely accessible pre-disaster data available; and it is particularly difficult to control for com-peting explanations in such quasi-experimental research. o It has also been difficult to operationalize the effects of for- mal help mechanisms in observational studies because they are so varied, are not universally defined, and have no com- mon data systems. The problems inherent in such resilience research are common to public health research's efforts to evaluate community health interventions, and solutions in that field may find traction in resilience research. o Exposure itself may be related to social vulnerability factors, which limit researchers' ability to develop case-control strat- egies contingent on exposure. Political challenges: o Domestically, the federal government does not generally provide or fund disaster-related child resilience services, strategies, or programs, and therefore has little institutional interest in funding evaluation research (Abramson et al., 2007; Garrett et al., 2007). o Most of the extant programming has emerged from the non- profit, philanthropic, and humanitarian aid sectors, which have limited funding for rigorous evaluation methods, and which favor programmatic dollars over research dollars. o \"Root-cause\" theories and frameworks suggest the need for interventions that are (a) comple x, (b) socially progressive, (c) structural, and (d) not the respons ibility of any one sector or domain (meaning that there is little accountability or demand for an evidentiary base). As such, there is a limited political advocacy coalition that can advocate for federal research funding, particularly in times of constrained and shrinking science budgets. MOVING FORWARD WITH \"INTERVENTIONAL RESILIENCE\" Despite the challenges noted above, there are several noteworthy trends or opportunities in resilience research. The first is the notion of Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Considerations for Children and Families: Workshop SummaryAPPENDIX G 199 expanding existing youth programs that have the capacity to \"reach for- ward\" into disaster settings. The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts are exam- ples of such programs, but it is easy to imagine that other well- established youth-empowerment and youth-development programs (such as 4-H) could be expanded in to disaster realms. This would provide con- trol groups of children who have not been exposed to disaster. Just as there is possibility for reaching forward, there is evidence of \"reaching back,\" when disaster-inspired programs, such as VAYLA and Rethink- ers, establish themselves in communities as progressive (but non- disaster) youth-empowerment programs. This extends the utility of such programs and also affords the research community the ability to test the effect of disaster context on resilience outcomes (as do the reaching- forward programs). As mentioned earlier in this white paper, there are also public health research strategies that can be employed in resilience research. There is a long history in public health of community-based research; the Healthy Communities movement, social medicine, and social determinants of health models align both theoretically and programmatically with a num- ber of resilience interventions. There are well-developed evaluation and meta-review strategies, such as the Cochrane Collaborative and CDC's Community Preventive Services Guide , which can serve as models for programmatic evaluations. The field of social epidemiology in particular has embraced complex systems sciences, which can be applied to many multilevel resilience research strategies. This brings us back to \"M,\" the hardy Katrina survivor and her daughter who were profiled briefly in the prologue. In thinking about bottling the resilience factors in their lives and designing interventions that can be applied to others, a number of possibilities emerge. First, to the extent possible, create programs and policies that allow children to remain within their educational environments, assuming that these were positive and high-quality environments. Develop family-based programs that bring parents and children together to create and employ coping skills (like the scrapbook \"M\" created) that can further enhance familial closeness and communication. Create community-focused emergency housing environments for populations that may be displaced for long periods of time to allow for collective self-efficacy and communal soli- darity. Finally, develop programs that empower children and families to be actively involved in rebuilding their own communities, as a means of affirming their self-efficacy and countering the social role of \"victim.\" That said, we do not know with any certainty that these strategies are effective or, rather, which parts of these strategies exert what effect, and to what end?
