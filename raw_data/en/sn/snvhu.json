Detox is a new supplement designed to help clear toxins (such as LPS [Lipopolysaccharides], heavy metals, and metabolites of yeast, mold or bacteria) and other unwanted debris from the body. While it's always important to be cleaning out your system, taking a binding agent like G.I. Detox is especially crucial when you're in the process of healing your gut. Gut-healing protocols can stir up the toxins in your system at first, causing a die-off (or Herxheimer) reaction. By taking a binder like G.I. Detox, you help escort the offenders out of your body quickly, helping you feel better, faster. G.I. Detox is also a powerful supplement to take for general detoxing, or while using a sauna. Why I Love GI Detox: from Bridgit \"Honestly at first I didn't get binders. I couldn't feel anything. Binders just help move things out so, unless you have a horrible stomach flu, they can be hard to notice. But know that these little 'garbage men' are taking out the trash so toxins don't re-circulate after you get them mobilized. GI Detox is a blend of binders to remove heavy metals, and metabolites of yeast, mold or bacteria and other unwanted debris from the body in a convenient pill form.\" Nervous about side effects?

Feels like my body is getting an internal reset. Easy to take first thing in the morning before my organic, decaf coffee; no negative side effects. GI Detox Great experience buying but I do like MiToxin better - works better. Both are good. not my thang For removal of toxins I most often use Chlorella. My body gets relief, no gas, and breathing and allergy symptoms nearly gone once activated. Apparently charcoal is mainly for the gut??? Not sure, but dang, I do not enjoy the discomfort it always causes in my stomach. Painful gas, almost always. My experience. GI detox I had used GI detox when I was dealing with mold toxicity a couple of years ago but had stopped using it. The last few months my labs have shown an increase in my viral load so I was started on it again but due to supply issues I was unable to order it from any of the many supplement companies I've ordered from, instead of going with another product that was recommended to me I by chance found it available on your website, I feel more comfortable using products I'm familiar with. I was happy to find it in stock, so I bought 6 bottles! Your shipping & delivery time was great & I can continue staying healthy again. Thanks for being there in my time of need. Detoxing I have been using this GI detox for about fifty days and know that it is working. With mold, heavy metal and fungal issues to detox I think I will be using this product for years. Glad that I found it. GI Detox a real plus! Worked well to detox without any adverse effects Great ingredients! I'm so glad to have these healthy ingredients in one capsule to help me detox. The best! Amazed I started the AIP diet and felt like I was dieing from die off symptoms. Daily headache, body aches and so on. I started taking these the day I recieved them. By the end of the next day almost all of ym symptoms were gone and there is NO way it was a coincidence as it did the same for my son. Ill FOR SURE always have a bottle of these in my cupboard. Why didn't I start this sooner? I'm really glad I started GI Detox. I take it at bed and I can really tell it works getting the junk out. I feel better when I take it.
