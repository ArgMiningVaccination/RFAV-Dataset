What we put on our body, in our body and what is around our body impacts our health. Common products that we use everyday contain hundreds of chemicals that affect our health in many ways to include disrupting our hormones, creating inflammation, and lowering our resistance to disease. Your \"every day\" products are your worst offenders. These are ones that give you a small dose every day and have a compounding effect; that you barely notice is happening. As a patient in our office, your health is our priority. Health is not just the absence of pain or disease. We want you to function at your 100% and want you to have the information and tools to make the best choice for you and your family. The awareness of toxic chemicals in our homes is growing. Just as second-hand smoke, an environmental toxin that we inhale made headlines; toxins from products we absorb are being exposed. As consumers, we have a choice with every purchase. It is easier than you think to REMOVE and REPLACE these toxic products with safer alternatives. REMOVE products that you use every day that contain dangerous chemicals. Many of these items are too toxic to throw away in your trash. In fact, many local government sites offer household hazardous waste recycling programs to collect them. See the Additional Resources section below for government links. Removing personal items from your home can be a challenge for many reasons: (1) your parents used them and you never questioned it, (2) you love the smells, or (3) you enjoy the results without considering the risks. If you do not know where to start, check out the [Top Tips for Safer Products](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/top-tips-for-safer-products/) with information on product types and ingredients to avoid.
