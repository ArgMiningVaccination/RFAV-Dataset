MARYLAND STADIUM AUTHORITY (cont'd) Camden Yards Sports Complex Remarks: The Maryland Stadium Authority advertised this project on eMaryland Marketplace and on the Authority's Web site along with several direct solicitations; ten firms responded with letters of interest. The Authority prequalified n ine firms and requested proposals from them ; six firms submitted proposals. Two proposals were not susceptible of award for failing to submit statutorily required MBE forms. Based on a complete review of the technical submission, price subm ission, and interview, the selection committee recommended the firm which was deemed most advantageous for the project. This determination was based upon Gilbane being ranked first technically and submitting the lowest cost proposal. Because the scope of services and technical requirements were straightforward, the committee determined that oral presentations were not necessary. A pre- award scope review meeting was conducted with Gilbane to ensure that all contractual requirements would be met for the agreed upon price. It is the Stadium Authority's intent to award the construction -phase services to Gilbane providing Gilbane performs well during the pre -construction phase and all parties are in agreement to proceed to the construction phase. If this occur s, the Authority will return to the Board to award the GMPs . The CM fee, P&P bonds, and general liability insurance were submitted assuming a $4,000,000 construction budget. The construction budget will be finalized upon development the project programming and is subject to change.

After award, Kennedy Personnel Services unsuccessfully recruited for two labor categories: county technicians and election -day field technicians. It became apparent that the contracted rates were too low for these positions. A shortage of county technicians and election -day field technicians would detrimentally impac t the successful execution of the gubernatorial election cycle. T raining of county technicians was to begin the end of April; time was of the essence. DBM advised the Elections Board that a modification to the existing contract was not an option because the change was an increase in the contracted rates. DBM instructed the Elections Board, instead, to remove the county technician and election -day field technician positions from the staffing contract and award an emergency contract to cover the county technician and election - day field technician positions for the 2014 gubernatorial election cycle only. A new procurement will be conducted for the 2016 and 2018 election cycles.

(2) DNR within one year adding 21 +/- acres to this easement. Easement: The easement will allow DNR to limit development along the Catoctin Mountain Greenway, buffer interior forest, and protect sandstone glade and boulder habitat that are home to several species in need of conservation. The property, which scored 103 under the Program Open Space Targeting System, is located in a Target Ecological Area. Additional Acres: DNR and the grantor may seek to amend the easement within one year to protect an additional 21+/ - acres. The additional acreage would protect a sloped area which provides outstanding habitat for the timber rattlesnake. The amendment is contingent upon clarification of title matt ers and confirmation of lot lines.

REQUESTING AGENCY REMARKS: In October 2013, MDOD was awarded a federal grant from United States Department of Education (USDE) titled \"Promoting the Readiness of Minors in Supplement Security Income,\" (PROMISE). MDOD was the lead agency , and the proposal was based on a partnership of state agencies and numerous subcontractors working to improve educational and employment outcomes for youth on S SI and their families. As part of the grant writing and submission process, vendors needed to be identified who could adhere to the protocols required by the federal government and who met the standards and expectations set forth in the grant application. Maryland's application was scored based on the quality, background, and experience of the partners including the identified vendors. In accordance with the grant, MDOD seeks to award Maryland Creating Assets Savings and Hope (CASH) a sole source contract to provide financial literacy services to 1,000 Maryland youth between the ages of 14 and 16 on SSI and their families. Unlike some other financial education providers, CASH provides services at no cost to people they serve, and their curriculum is fact -based and does not promote any particular financial product or service. No other organization can deliver financial education and financial coaching to participants throughout the S tate, and the Maryland CASH Campaign can ensure that services are provided in the same fashion regardless of the county in which they are delivered, thus ensuring fidelity to the research model. The Maryland CASH Campaign is therefore the only organization in Maryland that can execute this contract adequately and they were list ed in the grant proposal as providing the financial literacy services. No MBE participation goal was established for this contract because there are no subcontracting opportunities available since the grant named the recommended awardee to perform the requested services.

INCUMBENT: Same REQUESTING AGENCY REMARKS: A notice of the availability of the Invitation for Bids (IFB) was advertised on eMaryland Marketplace and on DBM's Procurement websit e. Copies of the solicitation notice were mailed directly to 18 prospective vendors, none of which are Maryland firms, and none are MBE s. A copy was also sent to the Governor's Office of Minority Affairs. Four bids were received in response to the IFB to perform the forensic toxicology drug testing on collected specimens. Phamatech , Inc. had the lowest bid and was determined to be a responsible bidder. Therefore, award is recommended to Phamatech, Inc. The State of Maryland has been testing applicants and employees for the illegal use of drugs since 1990 to assure its citizens that State employees are not impaired by the illegal use of drugs in the workplace. This practice ensures compliance with the Federal Omnibus Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (\"Federal Act\") which requires any State receiving Federal funds to establish a drug -free workplace. The Federal Act also requires the State to have a policy on the use of substances, an employee awareness program and a procedure for employees to report their own convictions. The State conducts testing in seven different situations and for a panel of seven drugs. The contractor will provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary for the transportation and testing of urine specimens. In accordance with Executiv e Order 01.01.1991.16 and Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 17.04.09, all applicants for employment in designated sensitive State job categories, as well as State employees in the same sensitive categories, must be tested to detect the presence of illeg al drugs in their urine. In addition, any employee for which there is reasonable suspicion of using illegal drugs must be tested. Most of the sensitive positions that require testing are Correctional Officers and other personnel of the Department of Publ ic Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS). All specimen collections take place at designated collection sites at State and local government facilities throughout the State. An estimated 4,613 specimen collections and subsequent drug tests will be perf ormed each year. The price bids were evaluated based upon a model used in the IFB for evaluation purposes. The Award Amount above is estimated based on the projected amount of collections and subsequent lab tests which were used in the financial evaluati on model. Since this is an indefinite quantity, fixed unit price contract, the contractor will be paid for lab testing services based on the actual amount and type of services provided and at the unit prices that are fixed in the contract. 48DBM 5B Supplement B Department o f Budget And Management ACTION AGENDA June 18, 2014 ITEM: 2- S (Cont.) There was no MBE goal established for this contract for the following two reasons: (1) there is a need to strengthen the legal defensibility of the chain of custody of the samples being collected and tested by having as few vendors as possible involved in these contracts; and (2) there are no sub-contracting opportunities in conducting the lab tests. This contract is for the provision of sample kits and the testing of the contents. The actual collection of urine samples is under a different contract. Maryland's reciprocal preference law does not apply because California, the state in which the recom mended awardee resides, does not have an in- state preference for these services.

One proposal was received in response to the RFP, and it was determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award. In addition, the Offeror was determined to be responsible; the financial offer was considered fair and reasonable, and it was det ermined that other potential offerors had a reasonable opportunity to respond to the solicitation. Therefore, award is recommended to Bolton Partners, Inc., the sole Offeror. Although eMM notified over 665 potential vendors, it is prudent to assume that only a small percentage would possess the necessary credentials and expertise to perform the work that is required for this contract . Written and verbal responses received from vendors who chose not to respond to the RFP included the following reasons for not submitting a proposal: (1) the project timeline and deadline requirements were too restrictive to maintain quality services; (2) took exceptions to mandatory contract terms and conditions; (3) vendor was an MBE that was only interested in subcontracting; and (4) vendor is currently a subcontractor on another state actuarial valuation contract and did not want to jeopardize relationship with the prime by proposing on this contract. The charter and governance policy of the Board of Trustees of the Syst em require that an actuarial audit be performed every five years, or if SRA changes its actuary. The last actuarial audit was performed in FY2010, regarding the FY2009 actuarial valuation. The contract amount is based upon both fixed prices for various tasks to be performed and a blended hourly rate for special or unscheduled actuarial consulting services under the contract. The audit is not divisible, as subdividing the audit would likely duplicate the work to be performed during the audit, and could extend the time for completing the audit beyond the contract term. Continuity and consistency are critical to ensure proper audit coverage. Therefore, no MBE participation goal was established for this contract.

Four proposals were received in response to the RFP. All proposals were deemed to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award. Technical and financial factors had equal weight in the overall award determination. Spy Pond Partners, LLC (SPP) was ranked overall #1 with the second ranked technical offer and the second lowest price. The lowest priced offeror was ranked third technically. The technical differences between these two offerors offset the slightly higher price ($46,135 or 19.5%) of SPP. The highest ranked technical offeror had a price of $3.5M more than SPP. It was determined that the technical differences between SPP and the #1 technical offeror did not offset the 151% price difference between these offerors. Therefore, SPP is recommended for award as having the most advantageous offer to the State. There was a wide disparity in the price proposals, but this was not viewed as a concern or problem with the specifications in the solicitation . All offer ors demonstrated a full understanding of the scope of work. However, each offeror proposed a different solution as to how the services requested would be provided from a simplistic web- based program built from the ground up or subcontracting with other vendors that already had similar Sta te projects to more reasonably priced programs. Considering the strengths provided in the technical proposal, information provided during the oral presentation, price consideration and other factors set forth in the RFP, the proposal from SPP was deemed t o be superior to the other proposals. MDOT's capital program includes nearly 300 Major Capital Projects, allocates funding over a six-year cycle and utilizes funds from several different sources (e.g. state, federal, grants, other). MDOT sought proposals to provide a facilitated process and web- based program to assist MDOT staff and leadership in the project prioritization and decision- making process. SPP offered a technical solution that has many components already established and allows for customization to provide a facilitated process and web- based program to assist MDOT staff and leadership in the project prioritization and decision making process within the Capital Transportation Program. The Award Amount is a not -to-exceed amount for all contract years, including the renewal option period. If there are funds remaining after the base term of the contract, the renewal option may be exercised. No MBE or VSBE participation goals were established for this contract based upon the determination that ser vices could not be subcontracted and the small number of certified MBEs listed on the MDOT website. Maryland's reciprocal preference law does not apply because Massachusetts, the state in which the recommended awardee resides, does not have an in -state preference for services. 53DBM 10B Supplement B Department o f Budget And Management ACTION AGENDA June 18, 2014 ITEM: 4-S (Cont.)

Copies of the solicitation were sent directly to eight prospective vendors, which are all Maryland firms and none are MBEs. Two bids were r eceived in response to the IFB.

The C JC program was established in 2008 offering approximately 322 youth from Baltimore City, Harford, Prince Georges, Montgomery and Worcester Counties the opportunity to work in Maryland State Parks .

Four proposals were received in response to the RFP, all of which were determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award. The proposal from Abt/SRBI was ranked #1 overall with the highest ranked technical offer and the second lowest price. It was determined that the technical differences between the lowest priced offeror (ranked #4 technically) and Abt/SRBI greatly outweighed the slight difference in the prices proposed by these two offerors ($65,380 or 3.4%). Therefore, award is recommended to Abt/SRBI as having the most advantageous offer for the State. Abt/SRBI is located in Silver Spring, Maryland and has extensive experience in performing the services needed for this contract. The recommended awardee also has a proven record of obtaining high response rates when conducting telephone surveys together with a demonstrated commitment to maintaining quality service. The Center for Tobacco Use Prevention and Control is tasked with the ongoing implementation of the Cigarette Restitution Funded Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Program as set forth in the General Health Article in Subtitle 10 of Title 13. Together, Sections 10- 1003 and 10-1004 mandate biennial studies of tobacco use behaviors of both Maryland adults and underage youth with estimates of the prevalence of those behaviors being reported biennially to the Maryland General Assembly and the Governor for both Maryland as a whole and for each county and Baltimore City. This contract fulfills the mandate of Sections 10 -1003 and 10-1004 of the General Health Article to collect data on adult tobacco use behaviors to produce a biennial tobacco study. The Maryland Healthier Communities Survey (MHCS) supersedes the previous Maryland Adult Tobacco Survey (MATS) last conducted in 2008. The MHCS includes necessary tobacco-related questions, but also examines other risk behaviors underlying chronic disease, the reby broadening the scope of the survey initiative and producing results that can be used by a wider variety of health promotion and prevention programs Statewide and in every local jurisdiction. Additionally, because the MHCS is undertaken with technical support provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some costs previously performed by private contractors for the MATS will not be performed by the CDC (data cleaning, weighting the data, and producing the resulting database). A MBE participation goal of 20% was established for this contract because the services are limited to conducting the actual telephone interviews and the programming of the computer system used to assist in those interviews. 58DBM 15B Supplement B Department o f Budget And Management ACTION AGENDA June 18, 2014 ITEM: 6-S (Cont.)

Only one bid, from the incumbent, was received in response to the IFB. The bid was deemed to be responsive and the bidder responsible. Moreover, the price has been deemed fair and reasonable, and it was determined that other prospective bidders had a reasonable opportunity to respond to the solicitation. Therefore, award is recommended to Allied Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. After bid receipt, both firms not submitting a bid w ere surveyed to determine their reasons for not responding to the IFB. The survey results from the one responding firm are as follows: other commitments preclude our participation and scope of work is beyond our present capaci ty. WMHC is one of two licensed and accredited regional facilities administered by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. WMHC consists of an inpatient chronic disease/acute care hospital, a nursing home unit, an outpatient renal dialysis unit and an outpatient physical/occupational therapy unit. The Contractor shall provide pharmaceutical services, which include: Providing a Pyxis/or like system for all interim medications; Providing and delivering both prescription and non-prescription medications; Providing the carts to store the medications; Monitoring and auditing the carts for expired or about to be expired medications' Maintaining an emergency cart with the most common used medications; and Providing 24 hours per day, 7 days per wee k emergency delivery, in the event medication is needed immediately. The Award Amount is the total estimated price to the State taking into account increases over the full five -year contract term. Because the hospital population and drug prices will fluctuate with new brand drugs entering the market and older drugs going off patent and becoming generic, it is impossible to project an exact contract amount. Therefore, the requested award amount is higher than the Bid Price , to accommodate these fluctuations. The Contractor will only be paid for actual acquisition costs based on utilizatio n by WMHC, plus a fixed monthly service fee. No MBE or VSBE participation goals were established for this contract based upon the limited subcontracting opportunities and the low number of certified MBEs and VSBEs available within a two -hour radius of WMH C for stat deliveries.

By having the vendor handle this contract it relieves the Department of the responsibility of machine maintenance and supplies, plus the Department has not been able to hire enough staff to do this type of work on its own. 63DBM 20B Supplement B Department o f Budget And Management ACTION AGENDA June 18, 2014 ITEM: 8-S (Cont.) The Department has procured this type of service before and this Preferred Provider has made the scanning and retrieval of documents faster and more efficient with greater access to informat ion. The machines, maintenance agreements, etc., are very expensive and this Contractor owns/rents the equipment and supplies the maintenance, which keeps the Department from purchasing the wrong equipment/software as it lacks expertise in this area. At the end of six months the Department will meet internally to decide whether to keep using this service beyond the one- year contract. The contractor will scan: (1) current claims/attachments to a compact disk ( CD) with multiple documents under one index number for storage and retrieval; and (2) closed recoveries files for retrievable documents for storage and easy access to client data.

Copies of the solicitation notice were sent directly to 156 prospective vendors, 146 of which are Maryland firms, and included 41 MBEs. Three proposals were received in response to the RFP , all of which we re deemed to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award. Augenblick, Palaich and Associates (APA) was ranked #1 overall with the highest ranked technical proposal and the lowest price. Therefore, award is recommended to APA as having the most advantageous offer to the State. APA's p roposal demonstrated their strong understanding of education in Maryland and proposed utilizing three different methodologies to conduct the study , incorpora ting a cost -benefit analysis within the Pre -K study. The Maryland General Assembly enacted Chapter 288, Acts of 2002, which established new primary State education aid formulas based on an adequacy cost study and other education finance analyses that were conducted in 2000 and 2001. The Act required a follow up study of the adequacy of education funding to be undertaken approximately 10 years later. Chapter 288 was later amended to require the study to be conducted in two phases, beginning June 30, 2014, and concluding by December 1, 2016. The follow-up study of the adequacy of education funding in the State is to be conducted in two phases and must include, at a minimum, an adequacy cost study that identifies a base funding level for students without special needs and per pupil weights for students with special needs to be applied to the base funding level, and an analysis of the effects of concentrations of poverty on adequacy targets. Several additional components must also be included in the study: the elements of school size and its impact on educat ional delivery; the role of \"supplemental grants\" and their impact on the integrity of the State's education finance structure; and an update to the Maryland Geographic Cost of Education Index. A 30% MBE participation goal was established for this contra ct. The recommended awardee requested a partial waiver of 28.8% with an MBE commitment of 1.2%. MSDE reviewed the good faith effort made by the offeror to obtain MBE participation and granted the MBE waiver. In addition, a 5% VSBE participation goal was established for this contract. The recommended awardee requested a partial waiver of 2% with a VSBE commitment of 3%.

In the summer of 2013, DHCD proposed the Families First Program to the Foundation to provide temporary rental subsidies for veteran families that are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness. The Program would also fund a full -time case worker that would connect the veteran with services such as workforce training and job placement. 72DBM 29B Supplement B Department o f Budget And Management ACTION AGENDA June 18, 2014 ITEM: 12-S (Cont.) The Foundation approved the grant application and in December 2013 awarded $400,000 to DHCD. However, the Foundation requested that DHCD partner with a nonprofit organization that is already serving veterans through the federal Department of Veterans Affairs' Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) grant program for the case management services. The Foundation further specified that Prince George's County (the County) be the sole jurisdiction where the Program would operate. DHCD conducted extensive research and determined that Friendship Place was the only organization with the required experience running the SSVF program in the County. Friendship Place was the only SSVF grantee in the County and thus carrie d considerable experience in assisting veterans in that jurisdiction. Through its research, DHCD identified other organizations that offered similar services, but none with historical experience working in the County under the SSVF program. Several State of Maryland agencies, including the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs, Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, and Maryland's Commitment to Veterans, confirmed that Friendship Place wa s the sole organization with SSVF experience in the County. Thus, it was determined to be sole source procurement. The contract covers salaries, benefits, and operating expenses (travel, office supplies) for the case manager, as well as funding for emergency services for clients. The contract requires the awardee to submit periodic reporting and comply with criteria defined in the program manual. No MBE participation goal was established for this contract because there are no subcontracting opportunities based upon the information provided above.

Six proposals were received in response to the RFP. One proposal was deemed not to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award and was rejected. The proposal from Chesapeake GeoSciences, Inc. was ranked overall #1 with the lowest price and the third ranked technical offer. The slight technical differences between the #1 or #2 ranked technical offerors did not offset the price differences of Chesapeake GeoSciences, Inc., which were 48% and 39% higher in price, respectively. 74DBM 31B Supplement B Department o f Budget And Management ACTION AGENDA June 18, 2014 ITEM: 13-S (Cont.) Technical and financial factors were given equal weight in the overall award determination. Therefore, Chesapeake GeoSciences, Inc. is recommended for contract award. In addition, Chesapeake GeoSciences, Inc. is a certified small business and the incumbent. The Department intends on obtaining approval for the new contract to run concurrently with the existing contract , which expires on September 30, 2014. The current contract has a balance of approximately $400,000, which is not sufficient to initiate several large -scale projects ready to proceed. Thus, these projects are delayed until the new Remedial Management Service contract is in place. With the approval of the new contract, Chesapeake Geo Sciences, Inc. will continue providing remedial management services involving over 70 sites across the State. This work is necessary in order to protect public health and the environment. The contractor will assist MDE in identifying the source of a release, as well as planning, implementing, and/or oversee ing a remedial strategy to reduce or eliminate the threat to public health or the environment. The $10,000,000 is a finite cap for this contract. If the funds are expended during the five year base contract, then the renewal option will not be exercised. If there is available funding remaining after the five year base contract then the established rates that prevailed during the base term would prevail for the renewal option and no additional funding would be requested.

REQUESTING AGENCY REMARKS: DJS is required to provide both residential and non- residential services and programming for youth who are ordered by the Juvenile court to be placed in specific types of programs. Since DJS does not have a sufficient number of S tate operated programs, private providers have been relied upon to provide the majority of these services and programs. The types of residential programs include: treatment foster care, group homes, therapeutic group homes, shelter homes, residential treatment centers, residential educational programs or schools and independent living programs. Home based supervision treatment and therapy are also provid ed. There are approximately 32 youth in these programs daily. For In -State providers, the State's Office of Children, through the Interagency Rates Committee (IRC), sets standardized rates for these services. DJS determines the not to exceed amounts of each contract based upon an estimated number of youth that may re quire these services annually. Contractors are paid o nly for the youth placed in the program for the actual number of days they receive services. Daily or Per Diem rates are paid in accordance with the IRC. These services were procured through Non- Competitive Negotiated Procurement of Human, Social or Educ ational Services. (See State Finance and Procurement Article 13 -106 and COMAR 21.14.01.03 G). The reasons for employing this method of procurement are: DJS's Secretary and Procurement Officer have determined that two or more sources for the service are available but that because of the absence of effective competition, it is unreasonable to expect those sources to respond to an Invitation for Bids under COMAR 21.05.02 or Request for Proposals under COMAR 21.05.03; For these services, the recommended contr actors have submitted an acceptable response to a Request for a General Expression of Interest (RGEI) that was last advertised through postal mailings on April 5, 2013. Under this procurement method, contractors that respond to the RGEI may be awarded contracts as the need arises, as determined by the Agency head. As stated above, the DJS Secretary has now made this determination; and, The Maryland Office of Children is the single point of entry for these services under approved negotiated rates for youth of the various State Agencies. No MBE participation goal was established for this contract as there are no certified MBEs available in Western Maryland for the limited subcontracting opportunities for the services provided in this contract. In addition, there is no guaranteed maximum or minimum number of youth to be served to in these programs. However, the maximum number of beds contracted in one of the programs is 16; the other programs are lower. 78DBM 35B Supplement B Department o f Budget And Management ACTION AGENDA June 18, 2014 ITEM: 14-S (Cont.)

REQUESTING AGENCY REMARKS: Exercising the available one -year renewal options is in the best interest of the State because these services are critical in providing supervised sexual offenders the specialized treatment they need to enhance community safety. In addition, the Department has determined that the Contractors are fulfilling all the contract requirements and that the prices are reasonable as the renewal rates were established four years ago when the contracts were awarded. Specialized sexual offender assessment and treatment are essential elements of the containment approach to sexual offender management and enables parole and probation agents to develop more appropriate supervision plans and implement more effective supervi sion strategies. These services have been successfully performed in three regions of the State as follows: Contract A: Eastern Shore Psychological Services provides services in Region 1B, which includes Caroline, Dorchester, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico and Worcester Counties; Contract B: Huber and Associates provides services in Region 2, which includes Baltimore City and Baltimore County; and Contract C: Community Based Treatment Services provides services in Region 4A, which includes Carroll, Frederick and Howard Counties. The requested funding amount for these renewal options is higher than the estimates in the original agenda item because at the time of award it was unknown how many offenders would be referred for such services or from what area s of the State the referrals would come. When the contracts were awarded, sexual offenders already under supervision were referred for treatment. Newly -sentenced cases from the courts and newly -released offenders from the Division of Correction steadily added to that number. Most of the offenders remain in treatment for at least one year. Since this is the last renewal option for this contract the Department will re -solicit for these services during the renewal period. A new contract is expected to b e in place prior to the expiration of this contract. FUND SOURCE: 100% General APPROP.

Whenever an agenda item is presented on the DBM Secretary's Agenda, DBM validates the information provided by the submitting agency for accuracy. This item was requesting approval of the third and final one-year renewal option for sexual offender treatment providers for the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS). The information that DBM received from DPSCS was reviewed and was determined to be correct for the agenda submission. However, upon updating the spreadsheet showing the previous actions taken on these contracts, the final renewal option amounts were not updated from the second renewal option amounts. Therefore, the spreadsheet, attachment page 39B of the agenda, incorrectly showed the same amounts for both renewal options, which both totaled $538,000. The BPW approval was for the total amount of $538,000. The information pertaining to the approval request, term dates, the contractors and the total renewal option amount, are accurate. Only the breakdown of the third renewal option amounts for each contractor was incorrect. The attached edited agenda item pages show the \"For the Record\" corrections to the agenda item in yellow for easy identification. If you would like any other documentation, I would be pleased to provide it. I apologize for the additional work these errors have caused for you and your staff. Sincerely, T.

The DHMH Office of Health Services (OHS) is charged with the task of administering the dental program for 650,000 Medicaid children, pregnant women and adults in the Rare and Expensive Case Management (REM) program. Administration of the dental program includes recipient outreach and education, customer and provider assistance and the adjudication of all dental claims.

DentaQuest of Maryland, LLC (DentaQuest), as the Administrative Services Organization (ASO), administers the dental program to all Medicaid recipients under 21 years of age, and recipients over the age of 21 that are pregnant or enrolled in the REM program. It is in the best interest of the State to modify the contract to continue these services because DentaQuest has been consistent in their administrative functions with regard to the increase in the Medicaid enrollment in the dental program. DentaQuest has proven to be an exceptional partner with DHMH by supporting the goals of DHMH and demonstrating cooperation and flexibility as needed to adjust or respond to unexpected issues.

MPT conducted a competitive procurement; however, it was determined that the solicitation contained ambiguous language that created issues with all offeror's proposals. MPT issued a solicitation for direct mail marketing services for fundraising opportunities on 12/9/2013. Three proposals were received in response to the solicitation. All three proposals were deemed to be reasonably susceptible for award and were evaluated with a recommendation of award by the Procurement Officer submitted to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for inclusion on the 6/18/2014 Board of Public Works (BPW) agenda. However, MPT did not verify the correctness of the MBE submission documents by the three offerors. DBM reviewed the MBE documentation from the recommended awardee and advised MPT that the MBE requirement was not met. Upon further review of the other two proposals, it was discovered none of the offerors submitted the correct required MBE documentation. It was then realized that the solicitation had ambiguous language as to what the MBE participation goal was and what the sub- goals should be. Therefore, the solicitation was cancelled and a new solicitation is being issued with an updated MBE participation goal and sub- goals. These services are for direct mailing to potential members, lapsed members, or requesting members to become sustainers. Without these services MPT's membership could suffer, creati ng a direct impact on MPT's revenue that would decrease, and ultimately may cause MPT to cease operations. MPT is supported by viewers/members for their operation. It is anticipated that the new contract award will be presented for approval prior to December 2014. This extension is also available for a transition period, if needed. FUND SOURCE: 100% Special (Viewer Support) APPROP.

UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE (cont'd) Construction Contract Modification Requesting Institution Remarks: This project was competed among the seven On- Call Construction Managers. T hree price proposals were received . The proposals were evaluated based on price which includes preconstruction phase fees, construction phase fees, staff reimbursables, general conditions and CM contingency. UMB - under its authority to award construction contracts less than $1 million - awarded the task order for pre -construction services to Jeffrey Brown Contracting, LLC who submitted the lowest priced task order proposal of the three received . The award by UMB was based on the initial estimated constructio n cost of less than $1 million. However, in fact, the construction GMP came in at $1,253,280 which exceeds UMB 's approval authority and requires BPW approval. The increase in cost is due to the need to provide temporary communications operations around the center perimeter while construction is ongoing in the equipment room and operations room. This requires installing temporary fire suppression, HVAC, connective cabling, and electrical panels. Sequentially thereafter suppression, HVAC, connective cabling, and elec trical panels will be finalized and the temporary removed. Originally MIEMSS expected to relocate communications operation to another facility during the renovations. However, MIEMSS was provided a more aggressive installation schedule by Motorola, the contractor responsible for installing the Maryland FiRST 700 MHz communication system. This required MEIMSS to maintain current operations in the communication center while the renovations are underway. No additional GMPs are anticipated. Fund Source: Plant Funds Approp.

In May 2011, DJS procured the Safe Measures software via an i ntergovernme ntal agreement with the Mary land Workforce Corporation. The Safe Measures software addresses the day -to-day reporting needs of case managers and executive- level management through communication, information collection, and analytics. The Mary land Workforce Corporation determined that the Safe Measures service provided by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency Corporation is unique because no other organization provides programs, technical assistance and research for social services that combines the knowledge of juvenile justice, data analysis and internet techno logy into a turn- key C ontinuous Q uality Improvement system. DJS's agreement with the Mary land Workforce Corporation expires June 30, 2014. DJS determined that it is in its best interest to procure the software directly through the manufacturer. There is no other method to procure this software. There are other case management software products on the market but to purchase a different product would require spending additional State funds and labor hours to integrate the new software into DJS's IT infrastructure and the retrainin g of case workers and managers. Due to the proprietary nature of this service, there is no MBE participation and no subcontractor opportunities for this contract. Fund Source : 100% General Approp.

RTZ's technical proposal ranked significantly higher and it demonstrated accuracy, efficiency and responsiveness 130DoIT 7D Supplement D Department of Information Technology ACTION AGENDA June 18, 2014 6-IT. DEPARTMENT OF AGING (cont'd) Remarks ( cont'd) : throughout the review process. While VisionLink offers a slightly lower contract price, it does not offer a lower overall project cost because the Department would have to reassign or hire staff and resources, which would cost substantially more than the $14,355 difference between the two contracts. VisionLink's proposal did not identify specific economic benefits to the State, such as tax revenue, hiring of local businesses, or jobs. RTZ's proposal identified specific economic benefits in each of those three areas, in addition to the use of a local MBE as subcontractor. The nominal difference in price is justifiable based on the State's expectation of high quality and efficient service and the importance of providing that service to people relying on the website to connect with service providers and obtain information that affects their health and well-being. Maryland consumers and professionals may use the W eb site to learn about long term care and search for available services in their area. Consum ers include older adults, individuals with disabilities, and caregivers who may be searching for personal care attendants, home -delivered meals, assisted living facilities, housing, transportation, and a variety of other such services that allow individuals to live independently in their home or community.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & MENTAL HYGIENE Contract ID: Maintenance Support and Services for Pharmacy Tr acking OPASS 15 -13994; ADPICS No .: M00B5400052 Description : Maintain pharmacy tracking and drug interaction software modules for Hospital Management Information System. Award : Netsmart Technologies, Inc. Great River, NY Term : 7/21/14 - 7/20/15 Amount : $207,400 Procurement Method: Sole Source MBE Participation: None Remarks : DHMH's Mental Hygiene Administration's Pharmacy Tracking System has been in service for over ten years. A key function is electronically checking f or drug -to-drug interactions. A breakdown could negative ly affect patient safety. Moreover, the Joint Commission requires electronic drug -to-drug interaction checking to maintain hospital accreditation. Loss of accreditation could lead to a loss of billing revenue s from Medicare and Medicaid. Accordingly, a software maintenance contract is necessary. Netsmart is the application software developer and owns the source code. Netsmart has been responsive in terms of timeliness and knowledge of the pharmacy software. Netsmart's support keeps the system operational for daily drug dispensing and allows DHMH to access pharmacy data files for reporting purposes and resolving user operation issues. Due to proprietary nature of the software and services provided under this contract, there are no subcontracting opportunities. As such, no MBE goal has been set . In FY2009, an RFP was published to replace the existing Hospital Management Information System , which includes census, billing and pharmacy modules with a more modern system that would also include an electronic medical record module. However, that procurement was not funded so the legacy HMIS system is still in use. Fund Source : 100% General Approp.

DPSCS has determined that this sole source procurement is necessary to provide the State with the capability of rapid positive identification of criminal and non- criminal subjects thr ough electronic fingerprint processing. In addition, these Livescan systems have the capability to interface with the Offender Case Management System.

This Solicitation was advertised in eMaryland Marketplace and on MTA's Web Site. Sixty- one (61) firms received bid packages; twenty -six (26) were Maryland firms. Five (5) bids were received and all bids were responsive and responsible. The Central Light Rail North Avenue Yard is currently equipped with electrical powered switch machines that are activated by wayside pushbuttons adjacent to each switch machine. This requires the train operators to stop their trains at each switch and leave the train to operate the switch to the required position. To improve efficiency and personnel safety, MTA is seeking to add route pushbuttons that will set all switches in a route. The functions of the route pushbuttons will be controlled by a redundant non-vital Programmable Logic Controller. To further enhance safety, train detection in the yard ladder tracks is also being added utilizing wheel detectors to prevent the possibility of any switch being thrown under a train.

The first item is to preserve structural integrity of a retaining bulkhead to keep access to the existing pier an d new wharf open. The second item provides a slot, or recess, in the 12\" thick concrete wharf slab to allow future placement of a railroad spur on the wharf with Federal grant funds . An additional 10 days is needed to complete this work.

It includes the pile -supported berth, lighting, drainage, water supply and fire hydrants as well as security and landside support areas. Subsequent to the contract award, it was found that the existing underwater bulkhead retaining the earthen fill which creates the access road and contains utilities was deemed unstable. As the con tractor was already mobilized on site with the highly specialized equipment needed to best perform the work, a revetment of stone was placed to buttress and preserve the bulkhead. REVISED 163T17 ITEM: 8-C- MOD (Continued) BPW - 06/18/14 Also, the design and bid of this contract will use Federal grant funding to build a railroad spur onto the wharf. The need to build this spur and create a slot, or recess, to accommodate railroad bedding is to mitigate the cost of providing future railroa d siding as well as interruption to operations on the wharf.

Located adjacent to the right of way line of through highway on the north side of the west approach to the Francis Scott Key Bridge (I -695). EXPLANATION: In accordance with Section \u00a78-309, State Finance and Procurement Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, Board of Public Works approval is requested to grant 2.7167 acres for a perpetual utility easement in Baltimore City. SPECIAL CONDITIONS: None GRANTOR: Maryland Transportation Authori ty GRANTEE: Baltimore Gas Electric Appraiser STATE CLEARINGHOUSE: The Clearinghouse conducted an intergovernmental review of the project under MD20140117-034 and has recommended to grant a perpetual easement for public utility to the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company across +/ - 2.7167 acres of improved property which is located at 4010 Fort Armistead Road in Baltimore City. The property is improved by two (2) electrical towers and two (2) monopoles with connecting wires, and a gate that surrounds the subject area. T he Baltimore Gas and Electric Company plans to maintain a new, high- tension tower that is situated next to the existing towers. REMARKS: Approval of conveyance is requested in accordance with Section 10-305 of the Transportation Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. The utility easement will be used to maintain an additional high-tension tower line from the Brandon Shores Power Plant to the Riverside 230 Kilovolt switching station with the review and approval of the Maryland Public Service Commission. BGE has constructed a three mile-long 230 kilovolt overhead transmission line from the Brandon Shores generation station to the Riverside 230 kilovolt switching station. The transmission line is carried on monopole towers approximately 130 feet in height and runs parallel to an existing high-tension tower line that crosses the west approach to the Francis Scott Key Bridge (I -695). The new tower line, running parallel to I -695 is located 202 feet from the centerline of I-695, 120 feet from the edge of shoulder and 27.5 feet from the right of way line of through highway (distance are to the two monopoles). 204T58 ITEM: 26- RP (Continued) BPW - 06/18/14 In 2004, BGE applied to the Public Service Commission for approval of this proposal. This proposal was necessitated and initiated by the Mid Atlantic Area Council, which is one of the ten regional Reliability Councils that form the North American Electric Reliability Council, who oversee the reliability of the various power companies.
