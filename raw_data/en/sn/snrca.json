[Letter from the Chairman](#) I would like to take a moment to welcome you to the Department of Neurology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. I am certain you will find this information both helpful and informative. Saint Louis University School of Medicine has a long history of excellence in teaching, research and patient care. Saint Louis University established the first medical school west of the Mississippi River in 1836.In 1929, Mother Marie Kernaghan became the first woman to graduate from Saint Louis University with a Ph.D. Her degree was in physics. In 1932, the University opened the Firmin Desloge Memorial Hospital, later named Saint Louis University Hospital. Dr. Gilbert Chaddock was the first neurologist of record at Saint Louis University. He was the main consulting neurologist in the 1930's. Our institution is rooted in tradition while looking forward to growing in new and exciting ways. Saint Louis University Hospital's partnership with SSM (Sisters of St. Mary) has helped to create more diversity in patient care and in teaching experiences for our students and residents and has us excited about the construction of the new SSM Health St. Louis University Hospital, due to be finished in the fall of 2020. We are also extremely excited to continue our partnerships with Saint Louis John Cochran VA Medical Center and SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. As a graduate of Saint Louis University School of Medicine in 1997 and completing a fellowship in Child Neurology at Saint Louis University in 2007, I know first-hand of the amazing faculty, students, residents and staff we have in the Department of Neurology. Our department is dedicated to our patients, students, and residents. We strive to provide the best care possible for our patients while committing to teaching our students and residents so they will become experts in the field of neurology.
