If 2020 completely depleted your energy and dampened your mood, don't worry. You're not alone, and you can make small changes and adjustments to your diet to help your body get what it needs for a boost of energy and an elevated mood. Clean eating is key to fueling your body and gaining the energy needed for your body to perform all of its daily functions. Your body does a lot throughout the day, from digestion to movement to storing memories. Give it the fuel it craves, without bogging it down with ingredients that you can't pronounce. If you want more energy throughout the day, your diet can help. But calories alone do not give you energy or boost your mood. Your lifestyle also plays a role in how you feel throughout the day. A good night's sleep, healthy relationships at work and home, and daily exercise all play into how your body and mind feel. Use this blog post as a starting point, but do not forget to consult fitness experts and stress management professionals for more information to boost your energy and mood through your lifestyle choices. What are the most important nutrients to boost energy & mood? If you want to feel more energized and happy after your next meal, just remember to get your recommended amounts of Omega-3s and Vitamin D. Omega-3 fatty acids are considered \"good fats\" because they support brain health and help to produce neurotransmitters that provide energy and a mood boost. Studies have linked consumption of Omega-3s to a [reduced risk of depression](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-health-benefits-of-omega-3). If you're experiencing brain fog, you might not be consuming enough Omega-3 fatty acids. The body cannot produce Omega-3s on its own, so it's crucial to get up to 500mg of Omega-3s each day through your diet or supplements (always consult a professional to determine what is best for you). It's hard to feel down when you're soaking in the sun and getting your daily amount of Vitamin D! Researchers have found that Vitamin D aids in the [production and release of serotonin](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/can-taking-vitamin-d-boost-serotonin-levels-10291.html), a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and energy. Low serotonin levels increase your risk of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and other disorders that affect your mood and energy levels. Be sure to get your Vitamin D from the sun (if you can) and your diet! Different Kinds of Energy In Your Diet Calories are energy, but we all know that creating a diet for an energy boost isn't so simple. Increasing your calorie intake doesn't guarantee that you'll have loads of energy to burn. You have to consider how many [carbohydrates](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/list-slowrelease-carbohydrate-foods-1677.html) (the body's main source of energy,) fat, and protein (secondary sources of energy) you consume and use throughout the day. Eating a lot of processed sugar, for example, may give you a boost in energy initially before you crash and experience fatigue. It's important to know whether your foods contain slow-release carbohydrates or quick-release carbohydrates. The names say it all: quick-release carbohydrates (found in foods like white rice, potatoes, and candy) are released quickly into the body, causing quick, short-lived boosts in energy. Slow-release carbohydrates (found in foods like nut butters, quinoa, and non-starchy vegetables) fuel the body moderately throughout the day. If you want to avoid getting hit by that \"2:30 feeling\" or resist the urge to snack and fuel up throughout the day, look out for foods that contain slow-release carbohydrates. How To Choose Foods To Boost Energy and Mood It goes without saying that clean eating can boost your energy and mood. Nutrient-dense, whole foods have fueled humans since we first walked the Earth! If you can pronounce the ingredients and trace your food back to its source, it is likely to offer more fuel than processed junk food. To make better decisions about your diet and meal plan, opt for slow-release carbohydrates over quick-release carbohydrates. Leafy greens, nuts, and fresh fruit all contain carbohydrates that sustain the body over time and curb cravings. Filling meals, ones with slow-release carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats, are key to eating for an energy boost. Pay attention to your gut health as well. Most of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut! When the gut can function properly, food is broken down into energy more efficiently. Get more out of your food by taking care of your gut! If you want to build a meal plan around higher energy and a better mood, remember to: - Eat clean - Choose slow-release carbohydrates - Enjoy foods that support gut health What Are The Best Energy-Boosting Snacks? Healthy snacking is simple! Aim for one-ingredient snacks made with healthy fats or packed with protein. Some of my favorite energy-boosting snacks for on-the-go fuel Can Juicing Boost Your Energy? Fruits (like apples and blueberries) and vegetables (like dark, leafy greens) can also boost your mood and energy. But you don't have to chew on them to get the benefits of these clean eats. Try juicing! Fresh pressed juices can help to boost energy by making nutrients easier to digest and distribute throughout the body. The process of making juice separates pulp from juice, leaving fibers which are more easily digested and passed into the bloodstream. Your digestive system can spend more time and energy on eliminating waste and toxins from the body, instead of processing the pulp and other parts of your fruits and veggies. Don't worry about missing out on nutrients, either. They are highly concentrated in juices, allowing for quick and easy absorption. Quick nutrient release may be helpful to give you a boost of energy before or after exercise or to quickly replenish nutrients when you're not feeling well. Best Foods For Boosting Your Energy and Mood Add a handful of these energy-boosting foods into your meal plan to get you through the day! Bananas Studies suggest that bananas are a great source of energy for before and after exercise, due to its high amounts of slow-release carbohydrates and fiber.

Plant Proteins Plant-based eaters are always looking for top sources of protein that don't contain animal products. Replace meaty dishes with chickpeas, lentils, or quinoa for a leaner boost of energy. Plant-based proteins also contain nutrients for gut health and reducing anxiety, like magnesium and folic acid. Salmon Salmon and other fatty fish contain a lot of Omega-3 fatty acids to support brain functioning and Vitamin B to boost your mood! My [Chia Crusted Salmon ](https://girlswhoeat.com/chia-crusted-salmon/)or [ Honey Cinnamon Salmon](https://girlswhoeat.com/honey-cinnamon-salmon/) recipes pack a huge punch of protein!
