Would she have to commit to it long-term? 47 Answers [Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist Mother-in-law sounds elderly... coupled with kidney issues, that together sounds like it would take extensive treatment to resolve the problems, so it probably would help her, and it probably would take a month or two of consecutive treatments to really help. If you decide to try acupuncture, make sure you start with a fully trained acupuncturist (not an MD or chiropractor that did minimal hours of training to get a license). [Dr. Hui Gao](/Expert/2028512-Hui-Gao)Acupuncturist Albany, NY Acupuncture can increase her circulation, bring more blood flow to her brain and organs so her energy level will be improved. Long term treatment depends on her symptoms. [ryan bishop](/Expert/81226544-ryan-bishop)Acupuncturist loxahatchee, fl Yes acupuncture can help boost energy however we must first evaluate her to determine how [Jennifer Kolter](/Expert/81226363-Jennifer-Kolter)Acupuncturist Henderson, MN This is hard to answer without a lot more history and background. She may very well be sleepy due to a weakened kidney. We can help in many areas of the body. If there is imbalance we find a way to bring balance back to the body. This is done through acupuncture, diet, herbs and more. Commitment varies. Depends if the symptoms are chronic or just acute. Chronic conditions may take some time to correct and require some maintenance for a while. Some will adjust quickly and require monthly visits. Some only need to come in as needed. Every body is different and every situation is different. I feel it would be worth it to take her in. She will feel better. [Ms. Janice Fluellen Campbell](/Expert/977339-Janice-Fluellen-Campbell)Acupuncturist Baltimore, MD A chronic condition such as a kidney disorder is not a \"one walk dog\" as one of my mentors says. Ongoing support with acupuncture could help her energy level and potentially slow the disease progression. [Sarah E. Sanger](/Expert/2945888-Sarah-E-Sanger)Acupuncturist San Diego, CA Acupuncture can help with fatigue. How long a patient needs treatment varies with the severity of the problem, the weakness of the patient, and how long they have been struggling with the issue. Generally a deficiency requires longer treatment then an excess and if she is older it is more likely to be deficient. Please contact a local acupuncturist, one that uses herbs will get results quicker. [Monica Edlauer](/Expert/3384967-Monica-Edlauer)Acupuncturist Boulder, Colorado Yes, acupuncture can help bring her bodily systems back to balance - or homeostasis. This includes helping with energy, metabolism, and kidney function. Though it is not necessary to commit to long-term, it is usually adviseable to receive more frequent treatments in the beginning before tapering off, as acupuncture is cumulative in effect. [Melissa Faina Lone](/Expert/662464-Melissa-Faina-Lone)Acupuncturist San Diego, CA Yes, acupuncture can definitely help with sleep issues. A good acupuncturist and also dietary and supplemental help. Kidney disorders are a chronic condition, so if this is truly the cause, then yes, it will be a 6-mo to a year commitment of coming on a regular basis. Frequency will depend upon the severity of her kidney condition and sleep disorder. But it is definitely worth the commitment, for the treatments will address the patient and all of her ailments including stress, digestion, sleep, and any other pains, since acupuncture treats the patient more than the disease. Not to mention far less side effects than just adding more medications to the mix. [Pai Hsiang Peng](/Expert/383539-Pai-Hsiang-Peng)Acupuncturist Santa Clarita, CA Yes, acupuncture can help kidney disorders.

I will answer your question in general, however to specific case mote information requered. Acupuncture could be really helpful and not necessarily long term commitment depending on each individual case. However taking age and medical history with underlined condition it might be a long term treatment. [Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO Acupuncture can support kidney functions or reduce renal inflammation. Usually, acupuncture needs some time to act among elderly people. I typically recommend six visits first to see how she reacts to acupuncture and then decide afterward. [Chanelle C Macnab](/Expert/81226659-Chanelle-C-Macnab)Acupuncturist Austin, Tx Yes. Theres a treatment called \"aggressive energy treatment\" to boost energy, stamina, joy and overall well being. [Anli Luo](/Expert/81226698-Anli-Luo)Acupuncturist Lindenhurst, NY Compared to Acupuncture, I think natural Chinese herbs may be more helpful. [Dr. Carol Revak](/Expert/2293443-Carol-Revak)Acupuncturist Tucson, AZ It's likely acupuncture can help depending on the root of the issue. Is she sleepy during the day because she doesn't sleep well at night or is she getting a full night sleep and still feels sleepy during the day? An acupuncturist would determine the \"underlying pattern\" by asking this and other questions to find the best treatment plan. Several treatments (6-8) are best to provide relief. [JOONKOO LEE](/Expert/81226344-JOONKOO-LEE)Acupuncturist LOS ANGELES, California Yes, acupuncture can help your mother. Would she have to commit to it long-term? Diagnosis is required first. [Dr. Isaac Goren](/Expert/2212376-Isaac-Goren)Acupuncturist Ft. Lauderdale, FL When the Kidneys are weak it can cause the patient to be weak and sleepy. As we strengthen the Kidneys the vitality returns and person can function throughout the day. As to how long it may take it is hard to answer. It depends on the person constitution. Some people may take more time to get better than others. [Young Suk Seo](/Expert/81226406-Young-Suk-Seo)Acupuncturist La ny Hi! Yes!! Acupuncture balances the flow of Qi throughout your body.

[Avery Ellen Mason](/Expert/81226490-Avery-Ellen-Mason)Acupuncturist Aurora, Colorado Acupuncture can definitely help with energy levels and also kidney disorders. Chinese medicine has been treating conditions like this with acupuncture and herbs for more than 3000 years. The emotional energy of the kidneys is will power, and sometimes the energy is low and there is also a lack of motivation. Acupuncture has been shown to help both of these.

If her fatigue is caused by a kidney disorder she might need to commit long term, but there's also a possibility the cause is something else that could be treated short term.

Leonard](/Expert/1434534-Ellen-D-Leonard)Acupuncturist Grants Pass, OR Not having examined your mom-in-law, and not knowing what medications she's taking, I can't really tell you if it would help. But I have rarely come across a condition that acupuncture, and perhaps herbs and diet tweaks, can't improve. as long as it isn't medication induced. As to how long her treatments would go, again, it's very personalized. Normally we get a handle on the condition with treatments twice a week, and then we can taper off to tuneups whenever she feels the need - if at all. I would certainly give it a try if it were me. Who wants to feel sleepy all day?! I would certainly give it a try if it were me. Who wants to feel sleepy all day?! [Neilly A. Buckalew](/Expert/8128589-Neilly-A-Buckalew)Acupuncturist Post Falls, ID Thank you for your question. First she needs to make sure that there's nothing going on that is treatable with respect to her fatigue. Four instance, with kidney disease there are toxins that can build up in your system that can cause extreme fatigue. Anemia is ankther common cause of fatigue in those with kidney disease. Another source of a fatigue in patients with chronic diseases are medications. Sometimes this can be changed by one's doctor to decrease the adverse effect of fatigue but still achieve the important medical treatment objective. Also, depression can be a cause of fatigue. This is not a complete list of possible causes, and should be assessed by a medical doctor. First she needs to make sure that there's nothing going on that is treatable with respect to her fatigue.

[Dr. Alexandre Yves Hillairet](/Expert/2554708-Alexandre-Yves-Hillairet)Acupuncturist Ventura, CA Did she have any blood tests? How is her thyroid? Has she been getting/losing weight? I would like to recommend to consult her primary physician and based on the medical findings, we will be able to give you a better answer. Thank PARK, IL A completed Health Appraisal and consultation will help determine the contributing factors to sleepiness. Medications, the severity of conditions, lifestyle, et al will be taken into account. Only then can we prescribe a treatment plan. After a few sessions, we can be more specific as to a timeline. In a word, Yes! Acupuncture can very possibly help your mom. [Abe Shahabelmolki](/Expert/81226414-Abe-Shahabelmolki)Acupuncturist Sarasota, FL Acupuncture can help her to cope with her condition.

[Ms. Louise Abell Suta](/Expert/3599672-Louise-Abell-Suta)Acupuncturist Ashland, OR Kidney disorders can be benefited by acupuncture, but would require long-term treatments. [Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO Fatigue is an issue that acupuncture can be used to address. With a kidney issue, though, it's hard to say without having the full picture of what's going on. Acupuncture is a therapeutic approach and more than one visit is typically required. The idea is to see a patient relatively frequently in the beginning. As we start to see results, we start to space the visits out until we hit some optimal maintenance interval. What maintenance looks like varies from person to person; it could be monthly, quarterly or twice a year. There aren't really any good ways to predict.

[Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Hi! It's very hard to determine length of treatment without seeing a patient, but certainly fatigue and kidney conditions go hand-in-hand. She will most likely feel a short burst of energy after the first treatment, but my guess is she would need a series of treatments for her energy level to rebalance long term. [Jun S. Kim](/Expert/1917025-Jun-S-Kim)Acupuncturist CLOSTER, NJ Due to Kidney disease, her digestive system is also affected and not functioning well. Acupuncture can help to balance Kidney system and Digestive system for her to recover.

[Livnat Hai-Choron](/Expert/3162605-Livnat-Hai-choron)Acupuncturist Paramus, NJ Hi, Acupuncture can definitely promote blood flow as well as the flow of other fluids in the body. The movement of these substances within the body allows oxygen to reach muscles more efficiently, hence, reducing fatigue and increasing energy level. It is recommended to have a weeekly treatment at least 5-6 times, and upon re-evaluation the next step can be figured out.

Generally speaking, acupuncture and Asian medicine can definitely help the condition. And, depending on the condition, the patient is expected to be committed to long-term treatment and care, especially if it is chronic and internal condition.

Because of the kidney disorder, treatments will most likely be long term. Treatment frequency, however, may decrease as her symptoms and condition improve. [Mr. Michael andrew Chow](/Expert/3559303-Michael-andrew-Chow)Acupuncturist Lake Elsinore, CA There are acupuncture points to address energy. I believe acupuncture can help with the sleepiness; but it would definitely depend on the cause and it's hard to say how long she will need treatment without knowing the root of the issue and her response to the acupuncture treatments. Of course, please check with her primary as many other issues can cause sleepiness and they might be able to help her pinpoint it easier. Live happy, Michael PS: walnuts are nutritious for the kidneys. If she can find honey fried walnut snacks from the Asian store, she might notice a difference if the root really is related to her kidneys.

If her condition is chronic, her acupuncture treatments may need to be ongoing with maintenance type care, but I would need to know more specifics about her condition before advising on the duration of a treatment plan. Dr. Barbara Wasson, DAc Dr. Barbara Wasson, DAc [Richard S. Mandell](/Expert/1401780-Richard-S-Mandell)Acupuncturist Brookline, MA Yes, I think that acupuncture can help. The practitioner would take a complete health history and intake, and then she/he would make a Chinese diagnosis. It is this that she/he would treat. The goal would be to achieve the desired results and then spread out the treatments as much as possible, as long as the desired results are maintained. [Dr. Scott S.

It may take a few treatments to help her or may take longer, depending on her condition and the diagnosis at the first treatment.

Absent those issues (or in conjunction with treatments for said issues) acupuncture could be helpful when diagnosed by a Licensed Acupuncturist to address issues from that point-of-view.

[Miss Amy Rose Gendron](/Expert/653774-Amy-Rose-Gendron)Acupuncturist Winter Park, FL Absolutely! Gendron, AP [Caitria Thiele](/Expert/81226754-Caitria-Thiele)Acupuncturist Greendale, WI Absolutely, acupuncture can help with this. As far as coming consistently or committing long-term, a patients level of commitment determines the caliber of healing that will occur. I generally give a window of time in which a patient should experience marked relief, 4-6 treatments for acute conditions and 10-12 treatments for chronic conditions. Patients begin with weekly treatments to return the body back to a balanced and healthy state, and as their body is able to hold that balance longer, treatments can be spaced out accordingly. Lots of my patients come in every 4-6 weeks after their initial issue has been resolved for a \"tune-up\" treatment. [Rosemarie Allen](/Expert/81226282-Rosemarie-Allen)Acupuncturist Jacksonville, FL Sleeping through the day can be caused by a variety of conditions or factors. The first thing to check is how well is she sleeping at nights. Is her sleep being interrupted / disturbed throughout the night? How many hours of sleep is she getting? How is her energy? Have you informed her doctor of this? Excessive sleeping could also be caused by medications she may be already taking. If she is under the care of a doctor for her kidney disease (as you mentioned) I would suggest you start there first by informing her doctor of her excessive sleeping habit so she can be evaluated by her doctor first. Acupuncture can help. however, I would strongly advise consulting her PCP first to rule out current medication involvement etc. "}
