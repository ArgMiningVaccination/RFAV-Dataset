Mindfulness is the cultivation of self awareness and the practice of being present in the moment. Through mindfulness we attain a greater sense and understanding of the inner workings of our physical and mental emotional processes. This translates into a better understanding of the self and others which leads to more conscious living, healthier relationships, better stress management and mastery over one's emotions. The eventual attainment of equanimity and inner peace are but by-products of a mindful lifestyle. A mindfulness practice confers multiple health benefits resulting from lower stress hormones, positively affecting blood pressure, weight gain, blood sugar irregularities, chronic pain and digestive problems. Mindfulness Meditation at our clinic Mindfulness meditation involves any meditative practice that cultivates this self awareness and presence. At our clinic, we incorporate mindfulness meditation into our treatments typically during a [clinical hypnotherapy](/clinical-hypnotherapy/) session. "}
