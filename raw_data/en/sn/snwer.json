The last twelve months have been a transformative time in the COVID- 19 pandemic as our colleagues and the community continue to adjust to changing guidelines, safety precautions, disease variants, and vaccines. At St. Peter's Health Partners, it is always our focus to put the patient at the center of all we do. In the spirit of this commitment, we introduced community health workers into our communities in FY 2022 . These frontline health care workers serve an important role in helping people identify and remove their social barriers to health care. These services are especially vital after so many people abandoned health screenings and other important care for two years out of fear, or lack of personal contact or communication during the most turbulent times of the pandemic. With the expansion of COVID- 19 vaccines and subsequent boosters aimed at reaching new age groups, we continue our campaign to raise awareness of the benefits of being vaccinated and having access to these vaccines, especially among the needy and vulnerable. We've also expanded effective treatments for patients. As we continue to encourage vaccination across all groups and communities, we hope to realize improved population health, without disparities, in these at-risk communities. St. Peter's Health Partners invested more than $110 million in community health in FY 22. These efforts included preventative services, uncompensated care, community partnerships, and other efforts to meet the health needs of the uninsured, low-income, and other at-risk populations. Thanks to these resources, we were able to reach an additional 9,000 people in FY22 compared to the previous fiscal year, thanks to these resources. Our services benefited victims of crime, homeless people who needed treatment or temporary housing while ill, and people with food insecurities. At St. Peter's Health Partners, we remain steadfast in our Mission to serve as a \"compassionate and transforming healing presence within our communities\" and address social influencers of health, not only as a caring community member, but as a catalyst for change. We continue to promote optimal health for those populations that are poor and vulnerable by connecting social and clinical care, addressing social needs, dismantling systemic racism, and reducing health inequities. We continue to be thankful for the opportunities and partnerships that help us invest in our communities and optimize wellness in the Capital Region and surrounding areas.James K. Reed, M.D. President and CEO Katherine A. DeRosa Vice President, Mission Services About St. Peter's Health Partners People-centered, integrated care is at the heart of St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP).

We know 80% of health outcomes are a result of social and behavioral conditions impacting health and quality of life. This reinforces the need for a holistic approach to addressing health disparities. We participate in many community partnerships aimed at assessing these needs and identifying opportunities to make a difference. We are leading the way to healthier communities and meeting the needs of the community. The Community Has Spoken, SPHP Has Listened In FY22 , SPHP provided more than $111 million in total community benefits. These efforts included preventative services, community partnerships, the preparation of future health care professions, uncompensated care, research and clinical trials, programs that impact well-being and health status, and efforts to meet the health needs of the uninsured, low-income, and other vulnerable populations. Hospital community benefit refers to initiatives and activities undertaken by nonprofit hospitals to improve health in the communities they serve. Community benefit activities must meet at least one of the following criteria: Improve access to health care services Enhance the health of the community Advance medical or health knowledge Relieve or reduce the burden of government or other community health efforts 2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 12022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 2Addressing Social Care/Needs IDENTIFYING SOCIAL NEEDS Addressing social needs is essential to improving health, reducing health disparities, and decreasing health care costs. The goal of St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) is to screen all patients for social needs. TogetherCare has made it possible for Trinity Health to standardize screening for social needs and connect patients to community resources through the Community Resource Directory, community health workers, and other social care professionals. More than 56,000 patient social care needs were addressed throughout SPHP in FY22 . Food Insecurity, housing, and access to affordable health care were the three top needs identified by patients. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS Our Community Health Workers (CHWs) have been hard at work screening and mitigating the social needs of one of our most vulnerable patient populations - the dually enrolled. Dually enrolled refers to patients who are enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid health insurance. The CHWs are frontline workers who are trusted members of the communities they serve. This trusting relationship within the community enables the CHW to serve as a liaison between the health system and the community to facilitate access to services and improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery. The CHW role was implemented in FY22 as an intervention to meet the Preventable Hospitalizations measure (among Medicare and dually enrolled populations), which is part of the FY22 System Balanced Scorecard. By the end of FY22 , more than 3,000 screenings were completed by the CHWs. SAFETY NET HEALTH CENTERS St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) is dedicated to upholding our Mission, vision, and core values by providing health and dental care to our underinsured and uninsured populations through our seven Safety Net Health Centers. Our Safety Net Health Centers serve patients and families that experience or are at risk of experiencing health disparities due to income level, race and/or ethnicity, and other social, economic, and environmental realities that contribute to poor health outcomes. The centers play a critical role in ensuring access to quality health and dental care while addressing unmet social needs related to language, culture, income, and transportation. Cohoes Family Care2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 3CAPITAL REGION HEALTH CONNECTIONS HEALTH HOME Capital Region Health Connections (CRHC) Health Home is committed to being a transforming and healing presence within the community. By building relationships outside of office walls, care coordinators provide support, advocacy, and education to the members served and their families. Care coordinators connect members with needed medical, behavioral, and social services to support their overall health and wellness, and assist members transitioning back into the community from hospitals, inpatient psychiatric settings, or incarceration. Our care coordinators are hard at work assisting more than 250 patients each month. FOOD ACCESS AND THE COMMUNITY St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) continues to work tirelessly to address food insecurity in our communities, thanks to a grant from the Mother Cabrini Foundation. Community Health & Well-Being was pleased to continue offering weekly deliveries of fresh produce and healthy foods to community members with chronic diseases and food insecurity through our Food Farmacy program. Interactive nutrition education was provided weekly by a registered dietitian who also tracked participants' health progress. Participants saw an average weight loss of 8.2 lbs. and a two percent drop in their A 1C (hemoglobin blood test). We were able to expand our collaboration with the Regional Food Bank of Northeastern NY and \"Just Say Yes to Fresh Fruits and Vegetables\" to reach more than 150 senior citizens and their families in Albany, Colonie, Cohoes, and Troy. We also partnered with our Personalized Recovery Oriented Services (PROS) program and the Colonie Senior Center to provide home delivered, medically tailored, prepared meals to participants of weekly PROS classes who are living with a psychiatric illness or addictive disorder. SPHP has greatly expanded our emergency food bag program, offering three days of shelf-stable, nonperishable food to reach all of our service lines and community agencies. Our goal is to mitigate an immediate food insecurity need while assisting these community members in finding long-term solutions. Approximately 75 bags are given out every month. The Cancer Care Food Closet in St. Peter's Cancer Care Centers in Albany and Troy has supported more than 300 patients who expressed food insecurity. Healthy, medically appropriate, shelf-stable food is provided along with referrals to community services for long-term assistance. SPHP has once again provided funding for all food and nutrition expenses at the Interfaith Partnership for the Homeless which serves more than 64,000 healthy meals a year. \" I'm thinking more of my food choices and the classes made me aware of healthy alternatives. I appreciate the weekly check-ins and the fresh produce and meats/dairy are really helpful on my limited budget.\" \u2014 Food Farmacy participant A Community Health & Well-Being Food Farmacy offers healthy food choices to patients diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes.2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 4COMMUNITY RESOURCE DIRECTORY The Community Resource Directory (CRD), powered by FindHelp, has continued to grow into a robust source of support to serve our patients, colleagues, and those living in the communities we serve. The online portal connects those in need to free or reduced-cost health and social services within the community and across all Trinity Health locations - including housing, medical care, food pantries, transportation, and behavioral health resources. We have also partnered with the City of Albany which now offers access to the CRD on the city's home webpage.

This is possible by accessing free or low-cost programs through pharmaceutical companies. The program is available for individuals who are uninsured or underinsured and meet specific income guidelines. In FY 22, 1,350 individuals were served. HEALTH INSURANCE ENROLLMENT Imagine being faced with enormous medical debt or making the decision not to seek needed medical care because of a lack of health insurance coverage. These are issues that our most vulnerable populations face every day. Driven by our desire to make a difference in the lives of others, St. Peter's Health Partners provides patient advocates to help uninsured or underinsured patients navigate the very complex process of searching for comprehensive, affordable, or free health insurance coverage. Patient advocates focus on delivering exceptional, compassionate advocacy to best meet the needs of our patients, resulting in a better patient experience.2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 5Strength in Diversity and Optimal Health for All Our St. Peter's Health Partners team is made up of people from different backgrounds, cultures, work styles, values, and ways of thinking. We invite these differences. We seek them out. We know our organization and the communities we serve thrive as a result of this commitment to diversity. The issues women, people of color, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ+ community, religious minorities, and other marginalized groups face are our responsibility to understand and address. Everyone deserves to have an equal opportunity to be as healthy as possible. One of our primary focuses is to create a plan to address and remove any and all barriers to optimal health for all. We are committed to active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity - in our facilities and within the communities we serve. Our goal is to identify and eliminate inequities and injustices that plague all minorities. TRINITY HEALTH MLK HEALTH EQUITY SYMPOSIUM This virtual symposium honored the life, legacy, and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Inspired by the words of Dr. King, \"Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane,\" our guest speakers focused on the importance of disrupting systems that create health inequalities and called leaders to action both personally and professionally. BIRTH EQUITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT St. Peter's Health Partners interdisciplinary teams from Samaritan and St. Peter's hospitals continued to be part of the New York State Birth Equity Improvement Project in FY22 . How individual and systemic racism impacts birth outcomes continued to be a focus, and action plans were developed to improve both the experience of care and perinatal outcomes of Black birthing people in our communities. 2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 6Promoting Healthy Women, Children, and Families MATERNAL AND OBSTETRICAL MENTORING SERVICES (MOMS) PROGRAM In FY22 , St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) Community Health & Well-Being acquired the management of the MOMS program. The MOMS Program offers support and education to pregnant women at no charge. Any pregnant woman may participate regardless of age, insurance, immigration status, or county of residence. It is a comprehensive program with all new obstetric (OB) patients throughout SPHP OB/GYN offices being referred, as well as collaborations with community agencies and private OB/GYN practices in the area. The MOMS Program assists more than 500 patients a year. HEALTHY FAMILIES (RENSSELAER COUNTY) PROGRAM Children begin to develop vital social, emotional, and cognitive skills in infancy. Their earliest experiences and relationships are critically important to their long-term health and well-being. St. Peter's Health Partners is here to help parents-to-be and new parents offering a free, voluntary, supportive home- visiting program for families living in Rensselaer County. Healthy Families' proven methods offering education and support in a comfortable, nonjudgmental environment help to make children and families healthier, more connected, and more successful. CREATING BREASTFEEDING-FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES/BABY CAF\u00c9S Our staff members work with health care providers to implement best practices addressing childhood obesity, promoting healthy food choices, and encouraging breastfeeding in new mothers. The Creating Breastfeeding-Friendly Communities program is funded through an Obesity Prevention in the Pediatric Health Care Setting grant. Thanks to that grant, St. Peter's Health Partners Community Health Programs department offers Baby Caf\u00e9s in the Capital Region. A Baby Caf\u00e9 is a free drop-in service providing professional breastfeeding support in a relaxed and informal environment. Baby Caf\u00e9s also offer opportunities to make friends, share experiences, and participate in open forum discussions. Due to spikes in COVID- 19 throughout FY22 , Baby Caf\u00e9s continued to be held virtually several times a week at convenient times for both working parents and stay-at-home moms. One-on-one visits with a certified lactation consultant could be scheduled if the need presented. Patients were also able to reach out directly to the group or via Facebook Messenger with any additional breastfeeding questions. In FY22 , 40 new mothers were helped. The Baby Caf\u00e9 was promoted via radio and pop-up ads online, and social media was utilized to reach potential attendees. 5/22 1,000 HST.

The program introduces underserved youth to the sport of soccer and helps them establish healthy lifestyle habits and develop critical life skills. Studies have shown physical inactivity in adolescents is a core health concern. The occurrence of certain chronic diseases - including obesity - and premature mortality are shown to decline with regular physical activity. It is also thought that children who are engaged in a community sport show improved cognitive development and social integration with peers. In addition to the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Capital Area, SPHP partnered with local school districts and the U.S. Soccer Foundation. While learning the fundamentals of soccer, participants are taught how to eat right, stay healthy, and gain important decision-making and relationship skills from their interactions with coach-mentors and peers. \"Soccer for Success\" coaches help the students build confidence and emphasize the value of hard work, teamwork, and persistence in achieving personal goals. Coach-mentors also meet with participants' families regularly to educate parents and guardians about embracing an active and healthy lifestyle and supporting their child's personal fitness and emotional growth. More than 1,500 school-aged children participated in \"Soccer for Success\" in FY 22. Of these participants, 88% maintained or decreased their personal body mass index (BMI); 72% increased their aerobic capacity; and 86% stayed away from anti-social behavior. A planned expansion of the program to include middle schools will allow even more vulnerable youths to learn these valuable skills and life lessons. 2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 8COHOES CONNECT CENTER SUMMER BACKPACK SUPPORT The Connect Center is a youth-oriented community center located in Cohoes. The organization's primary mission is to break the cycle of poverty by connecting youth to their full potential, aiming to meet the health and educational needs of our youth through dynamic after school programming and material assistance. The vision is to be a community hub for connection and empowerment, providing youth development programming alongside community aid initiatives to provide support in a holistic manner. With St. Peter's Health Partners' donation, the Connect Center was able to serve 36 families from Cohoes that have food insecurity. SCHOOL SUPPLY DRIVE St. Peter's Health Partners Community Health & Well-Being was once again able to assist more than 300 families in FY22 , providing backpacks filled with school supplies to our pediatric Safety Net Health Centers. This has been an ongoing effort since 2018 and was even more of a need in the community this past year due to the rising costs of household expenses. TROY HIGH SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP In the fall of 2021 , Troy High School and St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) began a formal partnership to prepare high school students for full-time roles within SPHP. This program prepared the students for employment by providing them with 13 pre-employment training sessions that concluded in late April of 2022 . These sessions covered topics ranging from team building to resume writing, and concluded with a job fair organized by SPHP. On May 5, 2022 , we celebrated 11 students who graduated from the program. St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) and Troy High School team up to prepare students for employment at SPHP.2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 9Preventing Chronic Diseases DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM In FY22 , the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) not only included participants within our Albany County partnership and our Medicare participants, but expanded virtually to include participants from all over New York state. Virtual classes allowed flexibility during this unprecedented time, eliminating issues of missing a class due to traffic, appointments, or needing child care. We continue to assist participants with using technology. If a lack of access is identified, we try to find alternatives for participants to join the program or connect them with a diabetes education specialist to ensure they receive guidance on reducing their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM DATA Since our program started in 2018 545 Participants11 lbs Average weight loss 6,154 Total pounds lost THE BUTT STOPS HERE - SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAM The Butt Stops Here (BSH) is an award-winning community smoking cessation program developed by St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) in 2001 .

Thirty-one groups were held including eight drop-in sessions in FY22 , with more than 400 registrants from all over New York state and the northeast. 2022 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 10ST.

PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS Faith Community Nurse Program A Member of Trinity Health AID TO UKRAINE COLLECTION DRIVE The St. Peter's Health Partners community rallied to support the \"Stand with Ukraine\" humanitarian drive to aid people in Ukraine who continue to face a humanitarian crisis from the Russian military invasion of their country. The collection saw generous colleague donations of clothes, baby supplies, personal care and first aid items, along with monetary donations collected within departments. Our Safety and Emergency Management department also donated emergency management supplies, such as linen kits, blankets, and infant and adult hygiene supplies. Coordinated by St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church in Watervliet and Community Health & Well-Being, donations were dropped off several times a week and loaded onto trucks driven to New Jersey, loaded onto a plane to Poland, and then driven into Ukraine to be distributed to those in need. SOCKTOBER Socks are the most needed, but least donated item in homeless shelters. More than 5,000 pairs of brand-new socks were collected in October 2021 throughout St. Peter's Health Partners sites. They were donated to area shelters to make a difference in the lives of our neighbors who are homeless. Our \"Socktober\" campaign is a wonderful example of our Mission and Core Values in action, and a tradition we hope to continue in years to come. SOCK OUT CANCER PROGRAM St. Peter's Health Partners continues to be a proud supporter of \"Sock Out Cancer\u00ae\" - a nonprofit initiative that aids financially distressed families so they can put all their energy into fighting cancer. The program is funded through donations, community-based fundraising efforts, and the sale of its signature multicolored socks. These efforts raise public awareness of the financial challenges facing families fighting cancer. Bettering Our Colleagues ALBANY MEMORIAL GARDEN The St. Peter's Health Partners Wellness Committee made great improvements in the Albany Memorial Campus courtyard.

JOHN'S BIBLE PAGE TURNING St. Peter's Health Partners continued to host the Heritage Edition of The Saint John's Bible, the first hand-scribed bible in 500 years.

All St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) colleagues and their spouses over the age of 40 are encouraged to get screened for breast cancer. SPHP increased the number of screening events from two to six (March, April, May, September, October, and November). These events are offered at various locations, times, and days of the week. Along with mammograms, colleagues are offered assistance with transportation, interpreter services, obtaining prescriptions, and a primary care physician referral, if needed. Caring for Our Communities as We Navigate Through the Pandemic As COVID- 19 safety measures and protocols continue to change, our focus is now on COVID- 19 vaccine confidence and education in vulnerable communities. We are carefully pivoting back to in-person events and loosening health care visitation policies while maintaining our continued concern for patients' and colleagues' health and safety. IT STARTS HERE: COVID- 19 VACCINATION CAMPAIGN Our Community Health & Well-Being program continued to support Covid- 19 vaccine clinics. In partnership with local colleges and community-based organizations, including Maria College, the Collaboratory, Lincoln Pharmacy, and the Boys and Girls Club of the Capital Area, 99 vaccine events were held in FY22 . Through those events, 1,845 community members (including colleagues) obtained either their first, second, or booster dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.
