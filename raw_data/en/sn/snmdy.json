The integration of protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior [Samar Rahi](/insight/search?q=Samar Rahi)(Hailey College of Banking and Finance, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan) ISSN: 2042-6763 Article publication date: 3 February 2023 Issue publication date: 7 March 2023 Abstract Purpose In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, public health is associated with the acceptance of vaccination unless it reaches herd immunity level, which is 67%. Nevertheless, citizens have shown hesitancy toward acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination globally. Therefore, this study aims to investigate factors which influence citizen's intention to get COVID-19 vaccination with two well-known theories, namely, protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior. Aside of direct relationship, the moderating effect of perceived awareness is also tested between attitude and citizens' intention to get COVID-19 vaccine. Design/methodology/approach The research framework is statistically tested with data set of 215 responses. Data were collected from Pakistani citizens residing in Islamabad, Lahore, Narowal and Burban. For data collection, convenience sampling approach is used. The positivism research paradigm is adopted to design the research framework. Data were estimated with structural equation modeling approach. Findings Results of the statistical analysis unveiled that collectively perceived severity, vulnerability, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control have explained substantial variance R2 52.9% in measuring citizens' attitude toward acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Likewise, attitude and awareness have explained substantial variance R2 54.6% in measuring citizens' intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, results have shown substantial Stone-Geisser Q2 value to predict citizens' attitude and intention to accept COVID-19 vaccine. Practical implications In term of theoretical contributions, this study has combined two well-known theories, namely, protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior, to investigate citizens' attitude and intention to get COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, practically this study directs that government officials and health-care practitioners should create awareness among citizens about pandemic by highlighting severity and vulnerability of the COVID-19 virus toward health which, in turn, motivate citizens to get COVID-19 vaccine on time. Social implications The ongoing health crisis could be reduced if citizens achieve herd immunity against COVID-19 virus, resulting in long-term welfare of the society. This research has significant social impact on citizen's lives, as it revealed that citizens could be motivated to get COVID-19 vaccination if they get adequate awareness about pandemic, enhance behavioral control and understand severity and vulnerability of the COVID-19 virus. Originality/value The current research is valuable, as it unveils factors which encourage citizens to get COVID-19 vaccine. In terms of originality, to the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first that integrates protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior toward citizens' intention to get COVID-19 vaccine during pandemic.
