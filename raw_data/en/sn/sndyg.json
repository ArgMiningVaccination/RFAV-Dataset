Based on thousands of years of experience in the application of CMMs, people have explored many practical processing methods of CMMs, also known as \"Pao Zhi\", to reduce/control toxicity and preserve/enhance efficacy. Toxic CMMs have been used throughout China's hospitals. Yet, the production and use of toxic CMM should be carried out in accordance with the Chinese pharmacopoeia (ChP) and the processing regulations formulated by the health administrative departments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. This paper summarizes the current understanding and awareness of toxicity and 45 toxic CMMs, the commonly used processing methods of toxic CMMs recorded in the 2020 edition of ChP, and the changes in the chemical component, toxicity, or efficacy profiles after processing. This review may provide useful information for the processing methods of toxic CMMs worldwide. We believe that with an in-depth study and understanding of toxic CMMs combined with a standardized application, the toxicity of CMMs will be predictable and controllable in the RESUMO Despite its demonstrated efficacy, the conventional pharmacologic approach to the treatment of Herpes zoster often has shortcomings-delayed treatment response times, limited treatment window to prevent PHN, and outright treatment failures. It is obvious in light of the foregoing evidence that other treatment options merit consideration, complementary and/or alternative medical disciplines among them. Homeopathic medicine, based on extensive clinical experience, coupled with its remarkable safety profile and convenience of administration, is one such trials (RCTs) are an established research method to investigate the effects of an intervention. Several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs with homeopathic interventions have identified shortcomings in design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of trials. Guidelines for RCTs in homeopathic medicine are lacking. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to fill this gap in order to enhance the quality of RCTs in the field of homeopathy. METHODS: Identification of the homeopathy-specific requirements for RCTs by reviewing literature and experts' communications. Systematization of the findings using a suitable checklist for planning, conducting, and reporting RCTs, namely the SPIRIT statement, and high-quality homeopathy RCTs as examples. Cross-checking of the created checklist with the RedHot-criteria, the PRECIS criteria, and a qualitative evaluation checklist. Consideration of the REFLECT statement and the ARRIVE Guidelines 2.0 for veterinary homeopathy. RESULTS: Recommendations for future implementation of RCTs in homeopathy are summarized in a checklist. Alongside, identified useful solutions to the issues encountered when designing and conducting homeopathy RCTs are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The formulated recommendations present guidelines additional to those in the SPIRIT checklist, on how to better plan, design, conduct, and report the Rhine (AD 1098-1179), was a Benedictine abbess, musician, poet, writer, counselor, and healer. As an influential personality of the 12th century, she was advisor of kings, princes, and bishops. Her medical work is collected in 2 books (AD 1152-1163): Physica and Causae et Curae. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of the nephrology-oriented remedies in Physica and compare these with the respective remedies in De Materia Medica (AD 1st century) by Dioscorides Pedanios Anazarbeus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Physica is a collection of 9 volumes with an inventory of plants, trees, elements, stones, animals, and metals and describes the associated natural therapeutic properties. We studied all 293 plants (230 herbaceous plants, and 63 trees) in this treatise and recorded all nephrology-related remedies. In addition, we recorded the treatment indications of the same remedies in De Materia Medica. Nephrology-oriented material was defined as any item pharmacological action (diuretic) or indication (eg, dysuria, nephritis, stones, sand, dropsy). Our findings are presented as simple descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among all plants, there were 15 (5.1%) of nephrological interest (11 herbaceous plants and 4 trees). Only some of the natural ingredients mentioned in Physica were found with the same indication in the ancient text, De Materia Medica (9 of 15). The nephrological treatment indications described in Physica included dysuria, nephritic lithiasis in 87% (edema) in De Materia Medica. CONCLUSIONS: Physica provides a reliable account of medicine in the 12th century as it was practiced by the clergy for generations. It also incorporates Hildegard's personal observations and contemporary folk remedies. This fact is supported by the limited similarity of nephrological remedies in Hildegard's Physica with the edible and medicinal material, and Mume Fructus is its processed product, which was first recorded in Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica(Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing). It is an effective drug for stopping diarrhea with astringents and promoting fluid production to quiet ascaris. By consulting the ancient herbal works of the past dynasties, modern codes, and other rela-ted literature, this paper sorted out the medicinal evolution of Mume Fructus, examined the ancient efficacy of Mume Fructus and the main indications, and summarized the inclusion of Mume Fructus in national and provincial standards. It is recorded in the ancient herbal works of the past dynasties that Mume Fructus can be processed by various methods such as roasting, stir-frying or micro-frying, stir-frying with charcoal, single steaming, steaming with wine, and steaming after soaking in wine or vinegar, and prepared into pills, powders, and ointments, which are used in the treatment of fatigue, diabetes, malaria, dysentery, ascariasis, and other diseases. Mume Fructus has been included in nine editions of Chinese Pharmacopoeia and 19 provincial and municipal preparation specifications. The processing method of Mume Fructus is determined, namely, clean P. mume should be softened by moistening in water or steaming and pitted. By reviewing the effects of processing on its chemical composition, pharmacological effects, and its modern clinical application, this paper identified the following issues. The ancient application methods of Mume Fructus are diverse but less commonly used in modern times, there is a lack of standardized research on the processing, and the research on the changes caused by the difference in Mume Fructus before and after processing is not deep. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the change pattern of its chemical composition before and after processing and its correlation between its medicinal activity to standardize the processing technology and provide a solid basis for the use of Mume Fructus in parts and its quality Vine tea is a popular folk tea that has been consumed in China for more than 1200 years. It is often used in ethnic medicine by ethnic groups in southwest China with at least 35 aliases in 10 provinces. In coastal areas, vine tea is mostly used to treat heatstroke, aphtha, aphonia, toothache, etc. In contrast, in the southwest inland regions, vine tea is mostly used to clear away heat and toxic materials, antiphlogosis and relieving sore-throat, lowering blood pressure and lipid levels, and alleviating fatigue. Three main species have been used as the source of vine tea, Nekemias grossedentata, Nekemias cantonensis and Nekemias megalophylla. Among them, the leaves of Nekemias grossedentata were considered as new food resource in complicance with regulations, according to the Food Safety Standards published by the Monitoring and Evaluation Department of the National Health and Family Planning Commission in China. AIM OF THE STUDY: At present, the comprehensively summary of Materia Medica on the history and source of vine tea is currently unavailable. The current article summed up the Materia Medica, species origin and pharmacological effects of all 3 major species used in vine tea to fill the knowledge gaps. We also aim to provide a reference for future research on historical textual, resource development and medicinal utilization of vine tea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adhering to the literature screening methodology outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), this review encompasses 148 scholarly research papers from three database, paper ancient books, local chronicles and folklore through field investigations. We then comprehensively summarized and discussed research progresses in scientific and application studies of vine tea. RESULTS: The historical records indicated that vine tea could have been used as early as Southern and Northern Dynasties (AC 420-589). Nekemias grossedentata, Nekemias cantonensis and Nekemias megalophylla, were used to considered as vine tea in the ethnic medicine. The main phytochemicals found in three plants are flavonoids, polyphenols and terpenoids, among which dihydromyricetin (DHM) is the most important and most studied active substance. The key words \"Ampelopsis grossedentata\" (Synonym of Nekemias grossedentata) and \"dihydromyricetin/DHM\" showed the highest frequency over the last 27 year based on the research trend analysis. And the ethnopharmacology studies drawn the main activities of vine tea are antioxidant, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective and anti-atherosclerosis activities. CONCLUSIONS: This review systematically summarized and discussed vine tea from the following five aspects, history, genetic relationship, phytochemistry, research trend and ethnopharmacology. Vine tea has a long historical usage in Chinese ethnic medicine. Its outstanding therapeutic efficacies have attracted extensive attention in other places in the world at present. Nekemias cantonensis and Nekemias megalophylla are quite similar to Nekemias grossedentata in terms of many aspects. However, the current research has a narrow focus on mainly Nekemias grossedentata and DHM. We propose that future studies could be carried out to determine the synergistic effect of multi-components and multi-targets of vine tea including all 3 species to provide valuable knowledge.

RESUMO In this research, I aimed to recognize the historical meaning of installing the medical education center, 'Uihak', during the Silla dynasty. 'Uihak' was installed in 692, in the first year of King Hyoso 's rule. 'Uihak' was founded by using various Chinese medical classics as its textbooks for medical education, such as the Classic of Plain Questions. The wooden prescriptions excavated from Anapji, which is thought to have been created in the middle of the 8th century, and the Chinese medical book Prescriptions for Universal Benefit, which the envoy of Silla tried to acquire in 803, reflect the idea on medicine during that period in Silla. By this time, the field of medicine began to develop the idea to discern the locations and mechanism of disease patterns by centering on the viscera and bowels while making use of the herbal prescriptions based on various drugs. This means that clinical medicine founded upon the medical education achieved in 'Uihak' was being realized in the medical fields as well. According to the Chronicles of the Three States, for the illness of Queen Sunduk in 636, medicine, praying, and the method of esoteric Buddhism was tried out as a means of her cure. Comparatively, for the treatment of the first rank Chunggong in 822, the Kingdom's representative doctor with professional medical knowledge was sought out to fine a cure. The analyses of the human disease, diagnosis, treatment method, etc., given by the kingdom's representative doctor were identical to those recommended in the medical textbooks used in 'Uihak'. As such, we can posit that his academic background was 'Uihak' and the education given there. The Classic of Materia Medica, which was also used in 'Uihak', was a book professionally centered on the drug branch of medicine. The Classic of Materia Medica is a terminology referring to various books on drugs, including the Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica, the Variorum of the Classic of Materia Medica, the Newly Revised Materia Medica, etc. Thus, we cannot specify what the classic of Materia Medica actually taught, based on only its terminology. However, based on the wooden prescriptions excavated from Anapji, and from the terminology of drugs recorded in the drug trading document Purchase List for Silla goods preserved in Shosoin of Japan, we can hypothesize that in the middle of the 8th century, the Newly Revised Materia Medica was indeed being circulated. Based on these evidences, we can also hypothesize that Silla was part of the network of drug trading that encompassed the entire region of Asia. After unifying the Korean peninsula, the Kingdom of Silla actively adopted the medical educational system of Tang China. By using the obtained medical knowledge, Silla cured illnesses and used the medical knowledge on various drugs recorded in the Newly Revised Materia Medica to pursue trade with China, Japan, and other countries. Through the installation of 'Uihak', the same medicine has now begun to be officially used in East Asia, including rule of processing in Chinese Pharmacopoeia from slicing development of Chinese materia medica processed product and thinking and suggestion on slicing techniques].](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/pt/mdl-37005857) [Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za 1691-1699, 2023 Mar. RESUMO Slicing is critical in the processing of Chinese materia medica(CMM) processed product and the specification(thickness) is closely related to the quality of the decoction. On the basis of clarifying the concept and evolution of slicing of CMM processed product by reviewing the Chinese herbal classics of the past dynasties and general rules of local processing standards, this study discussed the development history of slicing specifications in general rules of Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2020 edition), analyzed the current situation and key problems, and proposed the thinking and suggestion on promoting the sound development of slicing of CMM processed product. Since 2000, the slicing thickness of CMM processed product in the general rules of local CMM processed product processing specifications newly revised and issued by 27 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities has been consistent with that in the general rules of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2020 edition). The standard that the thickness of extremely thin pieces is less than 0.5 mm is rarely retained, and the pieces in 0.5-1 mm thickness have not been found on the market, which is consistent with the provisions of the general rules of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. This study can provide a historical and modern basis for the rationality of slicing of CMM processed product. bovis by principal component RESUMO A new approach is developed for the reliable classification of Calculus bovis along with the identification of willfully contaminated C. bovis species and the quantification of unclaimed adulterants. Guided by a principal component analysis, NMR data mining achieved a near-holistic chemical characterization of three types of authenticated C. bovis, including natural C. bovis (NCB), in vitro cultured C. bovis (Ivt-CCB), and artificial C. bovis (ACB). In addition, species-specific markers used for quality evaluation and species classification were confirmed. That is, the content of taurine in NCB is near negligible, while choline and hyodeoxycholic acid are characteristic for identifying Ivt-CCB and ACB, respectively. Besides, the peak shapes and chemical shifts of H2-25 of glycocholic acid could assist in the recognition of the origins of C. bovis. Based on these discoveries, a set of commercial NCB samples, macroscopically identified as problematic species, was examined with deliberately added sugars and outliers discovered. Absolute quantification of the identified sugars was realized by qHNMR using a single, nonidentical internal calibrant (IC). This study represents the first systematic study of C. bovis metabolomics via an NMR-driven methodology, which advances the toolbox for quality control of TCM and provides a more definitive reference point for future chemical and biological studies of C. bovis as a valuable Considering the rich background of Persian Medicine in the use of materia medica for the treatment of diseases, the huge burden of oral poisonings in the world, and the urgent need to find scientific solutions, the purpose of this study was to determine Avicenna's approach toward clinical toxicology and his proposed treatments for oral poisonings. In Al-Qanun Fi Al-Tibb, Avicenna addressed the materia medica for the treatments of oral poisonings after explaining the ingestion of different toxins and also elucidating the clinical toxicology approach toward poisoned patients. These materia medica were from different classes including drugs, stimulants, cardiotonic drugs, and heating oils. By applying different therapies, Avicenna endeavored to attain main goals in clinical toxicology that are comparable with modern medicine. They included removing the toxins from the body, decreasing the severity of the deleterious effects of toxins on the body, and counteracting the effects of toxins inside the body. Aside from introducing different therapeutic agents that played an important role in the treatment of oral poisonings, he emphasized the ameliorating effects of nutritive foods and beverages. Further research using other Persian medical resources is recommended to elucidate the applicable approaches and treatments for drugs in Shen Nong's Classic of \"Taking drugs for a long term\" is a qualitative expression of medication method based on the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine, and the study on it is conducive to the full utilization of the efficacy and rational use of drugs. There are 148 drugs that can be taken for a long time recorded in Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica, accounting for 41% of the total drugs. This paper analyzed three-grade classification, natural qualities, four properties and five flavors, and efficacy features of the \"long-term taking\" drugs(LTTD), thus exploring the herbal source of traditional Chinese medicine health care and the rationality of effect accumulation by long-term taking. It was found that there were more than 110 top-grade LTTD in Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica, most of which were herbs, with sweet flavor, flat property, and no toxicity. The efficacies were mainly making body feel light and agile(Qingshen) and prolonging life. Eighty-three LTTD were included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2020 edition). In the modern classification, tonic LTTD accounted for the most, followed by damp-draining diuretic LTTD and exterior-releasing LTTD. Twenty LTTD were included in the \"List of Medicinal and Edible Products\" and 21 were in the \"List of Products Used for Health-care Food\", involving in various modern health care effects, such as enhancing immunity, assisting in reducing blood lipids, and anti-oxidation. Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica is the classic source of traditional Chinese medicine health care, and its medication thought of taking drugs for a long term to accumulate effects has guiding significance for the regulation of sub-health and chronic diseases nowadays. The efficacy and safety of LTTD have been examined in practice for a long time, and some of the drugs are edible, which is unique in the whole cycle of health-care service, especially in line with the health-care needs in the aging society under the concept of Big Health. However, some records in the book are limited by the understanding of the times, which should be scientifically studied according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and the related regulations and technical requirements, under the attitude of eliminating falsifications and preserving the truth and keeping the right essence, so as to achieve further improvement, innovation, and americana (KangFuXin liquid) in the treatment of pressure meta-analysis.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/pt/mdl-36851877) Wound J](http://portal.revistas.bvs.br/transf.php?xsl=xsl/titles.xsl&xml=http://catserver.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxis1660.exe/?IsisScript=../cgi-bin/catrevistas/catrevistas.xis|database_name=TITLES|list_type=title|cat_name=ALL|from=1|count=50&lang=pt&comefrom=home&home=false&task=show_magazines&request_made_adv_search=false&lang=pt&show_adv_search=false&help_file=/help_pt.htm&connector=ET&search_exp=Int Wound J); 20(7): 2855-2868, 2023 Sep. RESUMO Pressure ulcers often become chronic wounds that are difficult to treat and that tend to recur after healing. In China, convincing data from randomised trials have demonstrated that the pharmaceutical preparations of Periplaneta americana (KangFuXin Liquid, KFX) have a significant efficacy for pressure ulcers. To provide more reference to the clinicians and experts, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the existing randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched the RCTs about KFX for the treatment of pressure ulcers published up to July 2022 in major English and Chinese databases with no language restriction, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science (WOS), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), China Network Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedicine (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), and WanFang database. Cochrane Handbook guidelines were used to assess the risk of bias and to evaluate the methodological quality of included RCTs. Estimates of the intervention's effects are expressed as the risk ratio (RR) (95% CI) for binary outcomes and mean difference or standardised mean difference (95% CI) for continuous outcomes. We applied fixed or random effects models, and all analyses were performed using Review Manager version 5.4 and Stata/SE version 12.0. We included 22 studies with a total of 1575 participants. Compared with controls, KFX combined with basic wound care or KFX combined with basic wound care and another topical drug or physical treatment significantly increase clinical efficacy (RR: 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.28; P = 0.001; I2 = 81%) and shorten the complete healing time (MD = -5.11; 95% CI [-8.19, -2.02]; P = 0.001) for pressure ulcers. Subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the total clinical effect rate between KFX combined with basic wound care and controls. (n = 1018, RR 1.21, 95% CI [1.07, 1.36], I2 = 82%, P = 0.003). No difference was found in the total clinical effective rate between patients using KFX combined with basic wound care and another topical drug or physical treatment with controls (KFX combined with basic wound care and topical physical treatment: n = 267, RR 1.15, 95% CI [0.86, 1.52], I2 = 87%, P = 0.34; KFX combined with basic wound care and topical drug: n = 290, RR 1.05, 95% CI [0.80, 1.37], I2 = 86%, P = 0.71). Based on treatment duration, subgroup analysis indicated that increasing treatment duration increased the total clinical effective rate when treatment duration was not long. (treatment duration: 14 days: n = 158, OR 5.48, = 0%, 18.91], I2 = 65%, P = 0.003). When treatment duration was 28 days or 30 days, the results showed that there was no significant difference in total clinical effective rate between interventions and controls (treatment duration: 28 days: n = 107, OR 3.04, 95% CI 37.32], I2 = 50%, P OR 0.58, 95% CI [0.11, 3.15], I2 = 65%, P = 0.53). No data on side effects were reported in any of the 22 studies. The conclusion is that the combination of KFX and basic wound care is effective in increasing the total clinical effectiveness and shortening the complete healing time of pressure ulcers. Assuntos remedies are highly diluted formulations without proven clinical benefits, traditionally believed not to cause adverse events. Nonetheless, published literature reveals severe local and non-liver-related systemic side effects. We present the first series on homeopathy-related severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from a single center. METHODS: A retrospective review of records from January 2019 to February 2022 identified 9 patients with liver injury attributed to homeopathic formulations. Competing causes were comprehensively excluded. Chemical analysis was performed on retrieved formulations using triple quadrupole gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. RESULTS: Males predominated with a median age of 54 years. The most typical clinical presentation was acute hepatitis, followed by acute on chronic liver failure. All patients developed jaundice, and ascites were notable in one-third of the patients. Five patients had underlying chronic liver disease. COVID-19 prevention was the most common indication for homeopathic use. Probable DILI was seen in 77.8%, and hepatocellular injury predominated (66.7%). Four (44.4%) patients died (3 with chronic liver disease) at a median follow-up of 194 days. Liver histopathology showed necrosis, portal and lobular neutrophilic inflammation, and eosinophilic infiltration with cholestasis. A total of 29 remedies were consumed between 9 patients, and 15 formulations were analyzed. Toxicology revealed industrial solvents, corticosteroids, antibiotics, sedatives, synthetic opioids, heavy metals, and toxic phyto-compounds, even in 'supposed' ultra-dilute formulations. CONCLUSION: Homeopathic remedies potentially result in severe liver injury, leading to death in those with underlying liver disease. The use of mother tinctures, insufficient dilution, poor manufacturing practices, adulteration and contamination, and the presence of direct hepatotoxic herbals were the reasons for toxicity.

RESUMO INTRODUCTION: A 32-year-old with colon cancer consulted for homeopathic supportive care (HSC). She had also suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs) for 20 years. Could homeopathy treat these two very different issues with the same medicine? THE PATIENT'S MAIN CONCERNS: Though the main reason for the consultation was a fear of the side effects of chemotherapy, the presence of Escherichia coli-induced RUTIs affected the patient's quality of life. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The repertory listing highlighted Pulsatilla as the patient's homeopathic constitutional medicine. It was prescribed both for HSC and also for RUTI. In association with Arsenicum album and Nerves, Pulsatilla enabled a good tolerance to chemotherapy, with rapid recovery from peripheral neuropathies. In combination with Colibacillinum, Pulsatilla provided relapse-free curing of the RUTIs. The MOdified NARanjo Criteria for Homeopathy (MONARCH) Inventory score was +9. CONCLUSION: The one individual's two different clinical complaints were treated with a constitutional homeopathic medicine, Pulsatilla, which covered the whole case. However, in HSC, the use of the constitutional remedy alone is rarely sufficient: it was reinforced by individualised symptomatic medication, organotherapy and isotherapy. For RUTI, isopathic and tubercular miasmatic treatments were each helpful. For both complaints, individualised homeopathy gave rapid, long-lasting and Preparations in the composed of several homeopathic medicines in the low potency range, are frequently used in the treatment of a number of common disorders. At the same time, they represent an almost unexplored area of research. Are complex remedies just additive mixtures of the components, or are there interactions between the latter leading to new properties of the complex? METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed as an example the simple bi-component complex, Luffa 4x - Mercurius bijodatus 9x, by means of patterns from evaporated droplets and tested what influences the complex's single compounds have upon the patterns and if there are any interactions. For this purpose, we compared in a series of five experiments patterns from evaporated droplets of the complex, Luffa 4x - Mercurius bijodatus 9x, and three comparison samples in which one or both of the complex's compounds were replaced by potentized solute. The patterns were photographed and evaluated for their gray-level distribution and texture using the software ImageJ. The experimental set-up's stability was tested by means of systematic control experiments. RESULTS: We found that Mercurius bijodatus 9x significantly influenced the patterns of Luffa 4x, increasing their homogeneity; at the same time, the patterns of Mercurius bijodatus 9x combined with solvent were more heterogeneous than those obtained from a control consisting of two pure solvents. CONCLUSION: In this phenomenological assay, the complex Luffa 4x - Mercurius bijodatus 9x does not correspond to a simple addition of the components. The exact nature of the underlying interaction needs to be elucidated in chemical components and their mechanisms in traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/pt/mdl-36739925) [J RELEVANCE: Traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine together play an important value in the modern medicine system that is different from that of chemical drugs. Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine with hemostatic effect have unique advantages and development potential in the prevention and treatment of clinical hemorrhagic diseases, reflecting multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway effects. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this paper, the active ingredients related to the hemostatic effect of traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine are taken as the starting point, and the traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine with traditional hemostatic purposes are reviewed, and the existing research progress on the active ingredients and their mechanism of action of these drugs is systematically expounded, aiming to provide theoretical reference for the development of traditional hemostatic drugs, the discovery of hemostatic active ingredients and the research of new hemostatic methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hemostatic chinese medicine and ethnic medicine were collected and summarized from the classic books of Materia Medica, public literature database and doctoral or master's thesis repositories. At the same time, we discussed the classification of various types of hemostatic active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine according to the different mechanisms of hemostasis. RESULTS: A total of 436 traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine with hemostatic effects have been collected, and their hemostatic active ingredients include alkaloids, quinones, flavonoids, tannins, esters, polysaccharides and herbal extracts, etc. These active ingredients accelerate the formation of hemostasis by improving endogenous and exogenous hemostatic pathways mainly vascular wall contraction, increasing aggregation, promoting coagulation system activation and inhibiting fibrinolysis. CONCLUSIONS: This article reviews the previous data on various aspects of the hemostatic effect of traditional Chinese medicine and ethnomedicine. Many traditional hemostatic drugs have been discovered and many active ingredients and mechanisms have been reported. However, although there are a large number of drugs with traditional hemostatic effects, there are still few developed and applied. At the same time, the hemostatic components of many drugs still remain in the study of the activity of their total extracts, and the potential link between some drug components achieving hemostatic effects through different mechanisms remains to be 273-278, 2023 Jan. RESUMO The paradigm can be summarized as the same methodological principles followed by the members of the learning community who received common education, training, and edification in the common social and historical stage, and had common academic views, concepts, and terms. The \"species standardization\" paradigm of botanical drugs in China has experienced the period of non-standardization of names(the end of the Warring States period), the period of multi-dimensional textual research paradigm of traditional materia medica(from the end of the Warring States period to 1930s), and periods of modern plant taxonomy system research paradigm(from 1930s to the present). The multi-dimensional textual research paradigm of traditional materia medica is characterized by the textual research of species in different regions and years based on the classification of the natural attributes and the habit of correspondence between names and materials, from the multi-dimensional investigation of the name, appearance, color, smell, texture, growth environment, efficacy, and morphological characteristics of medicinal materials, to find the correspondence between names and materials. The purpose of the progress in traditional species standardization is practicality for humans, and there is a lack of systematic research on the classification and naming principles in line with its laws from the plant itself, resulting in inaccurate research results. The research paradigm of modern plant taxonomy is herbal research. The characteristics of this paradigm are using plant taxonomy knowledge to conduct textual research to confirm the species of the drug and calibrate the scientific name by the double name method, based on the plant morphology, harvest season, origin distribution, ecological habits, names, drug efficacy, and other data in the lite-rature of previous dynasties. This paradigm combines the knowledge of traditional materia medica and modern plant taxonomy, and the results of species research are accurate. is a traditional Chinese medicine with the application of more than a two-thousand-year history. It is a common medicine used in the clinical treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and is listed as the top grade in Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica.
