The protection of such knowledge hasbeen identified by the Maliseet Chiefs as a crucial component for future relationswith non-Aboriginals, as increasing development activity continues to causeconcern for all parties on the best way to proceed, in the spirit of cooperation andwith due respect for Maliseet Aboriginal and Treaty rights2.The protocol also addresses past problems with research projects such as lack ofconsultation of Maliseet people, lack of meaningful community involvement, lackof benefit from research, lack of informed consent, lack of community ownershipof data (including analysis, interpretation, recording or access), and lack of respectof our culture and beliefs by outside researchers.Initiated by the Maliseet Nation Conservation Council and produced through thecombined efforts of informed Maliseet Elders, leaders, committees and grassrootsvolunteers, this protocol identifies the methods developed by the Maliseet Nationfor the proper and thorough collection and use of traditional ecological knowledge(TEK). It also provides for the increased employment of Maliseet people inconducting all aspects of these types of studies, reflecting the desire for increasedcommunity control of both the process and use of the results. 1 See UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples UNGA UN Doc.

Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 1992 c.37, s.16. (Community knowledge and aboriginaltraditional knowledge may be considered in conducting an environmental assessment), Species at Risk Act,2002 c.29 preamble (the traditional knowledge of the aboriginal peoples of Canada should be considered inthe assessment of which species may be at risk and in developing and implementing recovery measures),s.10.2 \u00a9 stewardship action plans prepared by the Minister in consultation with COSEWIC must includemethods for sharing information about species at risk, including community and aboriginal traditionalknowledge, that respect, preserve and maintain knowledge and promote their wider application with theapproval of the holders of such knowledge, with governments and persons), s.16 (Composition ofCOSEWIC expert committee must include those with expert qualifications, including communityknowledge or aboriginal traditional knowledge, of the conservation of wildlife species).The Maliseet Nation Conservation Council, representing all Maliseet First Nationcommunities, has developed this MTK Protocol through a working groupdedicated to ensuring a reliable system for the collection and use of Maliseettraditional ecological knowledge. The working group, comprised mainly ofMaliseet Elders and Leaders, reviewed best practices of other Aboriginal nations,and participated in several meetings and conferences to develop the draft protocol.A Maliseet Research Review Board is being developed at this time as acomponent of MNCC's overall mandate to implement this protocol.Ratified by Maliseet leadership in September 2009, this MTK Protocol wasdeveloped for the purpose of establishing the proper conduct of traditionalecological knowledge or other research studies within Maliseet traditionalterritory, with consideration of the rights of the Maliseet people, and therefore inthe event of any conflict, shall prevail over any other protocol within the saidterritory. 1.0 IntroductionThe traditional territory of the Maliseet Nation largely coincides with the SaintJohn River watershed, an area of 55,000 square kilometers, starting in the State ofMaine, USA and continuing through the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswickto the Bay of Fundy in the south. The Maliseet name for the Saint John Riverwatershed is the \"Wolustok\", meaning the beautiful river, and \"Wolastoqwik\",meaning people of the beautiful river. Maliseet leadership formed the MNCC in2004 in order to speak with a united voice on matters concerning tribal orwatershed matters, to develop capacity in watershed co-management, and toadvise Maliseet leadership on issues that may pose a threat to Maliseet territory,now or in the future. Saint John River WatershedThe Maliseet Nation Conservation Council (MNCC) hosted a conference in Marchof 2009 to address the issue of a lack of a protocol for the collection and use ofMaliseet Nation traditional ecological knowledge. This conference led to theformation of the MNCC Working Group on MTK. Consisting mainly of Eldersand Maliseet leaders, the working group provided input on what the draft protocolshould look like, how and when it should be used, important related issues such asethics and ratification, and what critical components such a protocol shouldcontain. The working group also provided input in the draft Maliseet ChiefsProclamation, mandating the MNCC to represent the Maliseet Nation with regardto MTK issues, providing a central agency for government, industry, researchersand First Nations to work together in conducting TEK studies in Maliseet territory.The MNCC was appointed to implement the MTK Protocol, to organize theMaliseet Research Review Board, and establish the Maliseet Nation Archives soas to ensure development of sustainable, long-term benefits for the MaliseetNation as we move toward increased co-management in our traditional territory.2.0 Definitions\"Consultant\" means a company, group or individual responsible for the conduct ofa Maliseet Traditional Knowledge study within Maliseet traditional territory, theSaint John River (Wolustok) watershed, including parts of the Bay of Fundy.\"Consultation\" means any negotiations or meetings with representatives ofgovernment, related to potential infringement of Aboriginal, Treaty or Title rightsor environmental or other impacts on \"crown lands\" within the said territory.\"Government\" means any federal, provincial or municipal department, agency orrepresentative.\"Maliseet Nation Archives\" means the services performed by MNCC related toinformation indexing, storage, backup, and retrieval of various MTK materials,including original interview documents, videos, GPS maps, electronic database orother materials produced during an MTK Study.\"Maliseet Nation Leadership\" means the elected political leaders of the MaliseetIndigenous communities located throughout the Saint John River watershed.\"MNCC\" means the Maliseet Nation Conservation Council Inc., formed in 2004,responsible for development and implementation of the MTK Protocol.\"MNCC\" means the Maliseet Nation Conservation Council Inc.\"MRRB\" means the Maliseet Research Review Board, formed in 2009,responsible for the implementation of the Maliseet Ethics Guidelines.\"MTK\" means Maliseet Traditional Knowledge, and includes but is not limited toMaliseet culture, customs, oral history, or archived material.\"MTK Study\" means any study or project that is designed to capture and recordpatterns of traditional use by Maliseet communities, both historical andcontemporary, in Maliseet traditional territory, and includes planning, collection,analysis, reporting and distribution of MTK.\"MTK Working Group\" means the ad hoc MNCC committee formed in March2009, responsible for the development of draft and final versions of the MTKProtocol\"Project\" means any official undertaking which triggers an MTK Study to beconducted, and includes such undertakings as Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge(ATK), Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), Traditional Use Study (TUS),socio-economic impact assessments, cultural resource management studies,environmental impact or archaeological assessments or other ecological studies.3.0 Interpretation3.1 Nothing in this MTK Protocol or any related discussions, communications ordocumentation shall be interpreted as to abrogate, derogate, or in any way, affect,limit or detract from the Aboriginal, Treaty or Title rights of any member of theMaliseet Nation.3.2 Nothing in this document shall be interpreted as Consultation for the purposeof justifying an infringement on Maliseet Aboriginal, Treaty or Title rights, or assatisfying the duty to consult and accommodate the Maliseet Nation, unlessotherwise provided for in writing and sanctioned by Maliseet Nation Leadership.3.3 This MTK Protocol is intended to complement and support the operation ofthe Maliseet Research Review Board (MRRB), that pertains to MTK datacollection and, in the event of a conflict between this protocol, and any otherguidelines or laws, the guidelines in this Protocol, including the Maliseet EthicsGuidelines, shall take precedence.4.0 MTK Methodology4.1MTK Study methodology provides standards and recommended guidelinesfor all stages of an MTK Study, including the planning, implementation andreporting thereof.Phase I - Project Planning4.2The MNCC will act as the central agency responsible for the administrationand oversight of all stages of the MTK Protocol, including planning and initiation.MNCC will advise the Consultant on communications strategy in order toeffectively provide information on each Project, Consultants and Proponents,MTK processes, and gather feedback. MNCC shall act as the contact organizationfor MTK studies taking place in the traditional territory of the Maliseet Nation.Though the exact scope of the planning phase of each MTK study will vary fromproject to project, each should have consideration of the following components:4.3Research Principles - Maliseet Ethics GuidelinesWith respect to certain matters, the Maliseet Ethics Guidelines may apply inconjunction with, or in advance of, the MTK Protocol. The Maliseet EthicsGuidelines identifies approved research principles and methods. Administered bythe Maliseet Research Review Board (MRRB), the ethical guidelines provideproper procedures for the collection; analysis and reporting of research datagenerated from Maliseet communities.These matters include, reviewing research proposals, monitoring research projects,review of research methodologies, repatriation of Maliseet artifacts and burialitems, and others. The (draft) Maliseet Ethics Guidelines is attached to thisdocument and marked Appendix \"B\"4.4Role of the MNCC in phase I activities Determinations of what activities will trigger an MTK or MRRB Study; Meeting with Government and Industry in relation to resource developmentdiscussions in Maliseet traditional territory; Developing discussions as early in the process as possible; Communicating the MTK Protocol requirements to consultants, projectproponents, Maliseet communities, and other interested parties; Coordination with the MRRB on matters of an ethical nature;Phase II - Conducting an MTK StudyThere are four main considerations related to the execution of MTK Studies:research principles, communications, information collection and storage, and therole of the MNCC.4.5 Research PrinciplesVarious research principles are addressed in detail in the MRRB Maliseet EthicsGuidelines.
