Stacy 1 Customer from Madera, CA I called Green Building Supply several times over the past month with product questions. I was impressed with their knowledge of all the products I was considering and really appreciated their good advice. I love having a supplier of non-toxic building products be so accessible!! Michelle W Customer from Hartwick, VT My daughter and I suffer from MCS, so we are so thankful for your company which has such a large selection of flooring to choose from. Also the people who man the phones are helpful, and know how to help and advise us. Merriel M Customer from Hornick, IA So excellent. They were super helpful with a last minute order change--including running to the loading dock! Then I had to order a few more tiles and they again were SO Helpful. I wish I had more building supply needs so I could keep ordering from them. Elizabeth S Customer from Jericho, VT Fast sample shipping = easy choice. I ordered a sample on a Thursday and had it on Monday. This fast turn made it really easy to choose flooring and added to my confidence in purchasing a few thousand dollars of building material online.
