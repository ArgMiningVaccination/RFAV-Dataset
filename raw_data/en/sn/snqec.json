Your loved ones can be back flying with the angels.\" Since mid.July, the Observer has been charging for all but seven lines of each obituary. The average obit runs $140. Publisher Rolfe Neill said newsprint has become \"white gold,\" rising 40 percent in price this year and an expected 20 percent next year. The cost of running a page of obits each day is more than $350,000 a year, not including news clerks' salaries. Readers, Gordon said, are not happy. \"They're saying, 'My mom and dad have been subscribers all their lives and now you're going to make me pay money to get their obit in the paper?'\" he said. \"It was tread\u00b7 ing on sacred ground.\u00b7 That reaction prompted the paper to return to the previous unpaid obit policy in two small\u00b7cir\u00ad culation zoned editions, including The York Observer, which Gordon edits. It was just that tug\u00b7of-war between grieving families and the newspaper's desire to treat all equitably that prompted The Salt Lake Ttibune and Deseret News to \"The one time you get mentioned is when you die, and how did you get that? You had to pay for it.

He is president of the company that handles adver\u00b7 tising for both newspapers. \"It was a fun decision. Economics were a minimal part of it,\" Welch said. \"People read the obits now more than ever.\" Mark Shenefelt, assistant man\u00ad aging editor at the Standard\u00b7 Examiner in nearby Ogden, said the obituaries are more interesting but less factual than they were before the paper turned them into ads five or six years ago. For instance , families often do not mention the cause of death. Some editors say they will resist the change to paid notices. \"It seems to me one of the duties of a newspaper is to write about the rites and rituals of its commu\u00b7 nities,\" said Joe Distelheim, editor of the Huntsville Times in Huntsville, Ala. John Ferre, a University of Louisville communications profes\u00ad sor, bemoans the formula obits that became standard in daily papers by the end of World War II and are still common in many papers. \"All they say was that you or [ existed. They don't say anything about what made us good, what, made us bad,\" Ferre said. While the paid obituaries have more personality, Ferre said, it's a shame newspapers can't run them for free. \"The one time you get mentioned is when you die, and how did you get that? You had to pay for it. There's something too bad about that.\" But there is something good about homemade obituaries like the one in which a woman said goodbye to her husband: \"r love you dearly, you old poop.\" Or a family's farewell to their father: \"We hope you find Heaven easier than you could find the airport.\" Or one man's sign off: \"Sayonara, aloha, hasta la vista.\" \"I have a full-time job.

They're gone,\" Marina Regencia said Sun\u00ad day between sobs, pointing to the coffins of her 10-and 8-year-old daughters, 4-year-old son and month-old boy. A fifth child still was missing. The bodies were among 37 fished out of Calauag Bay on Fri\u00ad day and Saturday, after the 140 mph winds of Typhoon Angela lashed the northern Philippines, killing at least 500 people. Two hundred others were reported missing after the coun\u00ad try's strongest storm in 11 years hit with 12-foot-high waves and flash floods. About 286,000 people remained in evacuation camps in Bicol, the region on the southeast\u00ad ern leg of luzon, the Philippines ' main island, where Angela stormed ashore, said Fortunato de )oras, executive director of the National Disaster Coordinating Council. The winds tore off the roofs of many concrete and wooden hous\u00ad es and thatched huts. In one vil\u00ad lage, a cluster of houses was flat\u00ad tened. Schools were destroyed, their galvanized iron roofs and walls peeled open and crumpled. About 100 of the dead were from the fishing and coconut farm\u00ad ing town of Calauag, a Quezon province town of 60,000 about 100 miles southeast of Manila. Clinton: 'Peace in Bosnia matters to America' WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi\u00ad dent Clinton used a magazine essay to make his case for sending U.S. troops to enforce a possible peace agreement in Bosnia, saying the United States has an \"urgent stake\" in ending the war. \"If peace is achieved, NATO must help secure it -and as NATO's leader, America must take part,\" Clinton wrote in a guest essay in this week's Newsweek. The leaders of BOfnia, Croatia and Serbia arrived in Dayton, Ohio, last week to begin negotia\u00ad tions. Clinton is trying to build con\u00ad gressional support for his plans to send ground troops to Bosnia if \"a solid peace agreement\" is reached. \"Peace in Bosnia matters to I America -to our values and inter\u00ad ests,\" Clinton wrote. \"We have an urgent stake in stopping the slaughter, preventing the war from spreading and building a Europe at peace.\" Clinton has said he might com\u00ad mit up to 25,000 U.S. troops. But congressional Republicans have expressed worries the troops might become targets or be drawn into a larger war if the peace I doesn't hold. I Space shuttle Columbia returns home CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)\u00ad Columbia and seven astronauts returned to Earth with a laboratory full of experiments on Sunday after the second-longest flight in space shuttle history. Commander Kenneth Bowersox guided Columbia to a 6:45 a.m. landing at the Kennedy Space Cen\u00ad ter, just after sunrise. Columbia was launched on Oct. 20 after a record-tyipg six scrubs because of mechanll:al and weath\u00ad er problems. The 16-day voyage ranks in length only behind 1ndeavour's 16Y, -day astronomy mission last March. Columbia crossed the entire United States on its way home: passing just north of San Francisco and over the Rocky Mountains, down into the Texas panhandle, louisiana and the southern tips of Mississippi and Alabama, and on into Florida. Total trip mileage - 6.6 million miles. Columbia brought back about 1,500 protein and semiconductor crystal and five marble-sized pota\u00ad toes, all grown in weightlessness. The potatoes, once unloaded, will be (rozen or doused with chemical preservatives for later analysis. \" Nation &World Congress' secret dug--out revealed Rochelle Olson cameras on an exclusive tour. . . On Sunday, the AP was the first pnnt news servIce given access to the site. Associated Press WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. -A once top\u00ad secret bunker built to house Congress in the event of a nuclear war sits 64 feet beneath a posh Allegheny Mountains resort. But the spartan refuge has little in common with its upstairs neighbor. The two-story bunker is mostly a maze of narrow halls connecting small, stark rooms and offices, with each floor ahout the size of a football field. It rests under a west wing of The Greenbrier, although guests looking west out the lobby windows see only a grassy hillside. \"They hid the facility in plain sight of everyone, \" Greenbrier President Ted lGeisner said Sunday. In fact, hotel auditoriums and a convention room under the west wing were built as part of the bunker and would have provided office space for congression\u00ad al officials in a time of war. Congress and the Defense Department decided to close the bunker after its existence was reported by The Washington Post in 1992. It was decommissioned July 31 when the contract with Greenbrier 's parent company, CSX Corp. of Jacksonville, Fla., expired. CSX was given ownership of the bunker. Outsiders got their first peek at the bunker Friday through NBC's \"Dateline \" news show, which took its Sony 13\" TV *Full Function Remote Control * 181 Channel Cable Ready Tuner *program/Sleep Timer \"On-Screen Menus Sony 27\" Stereo TV 'MTS Stereo Broadcast Reception 'Full Color Picture In Picture 'Dynamic Acoustic Chambered Speakers Tuner PIP (/(I/\u00b732V15/ $1197.21 State and federal lawmakers are scheduled to tour the bunker along with other reporters today. Hotel employees will be given tours this week, and eventu\u00ad ally the bunker will be opened for limited public tours. The Greenbrier , about 190 miles southwest of Washington , D.C., has long attracted wealthy and renowned guests, including presidents and diplomats. Congressional Democrats formerly held their winter caucuses here, and during World War II the military used The Greenbrier to intern Japanese diplomats . The concrete -and-steel bunker was built at the behest of President Eisenhower in 1958 for $14 mil\u00ad lion to give Congress a place to meet in case of war. The executive and legislative branches have other secret meeting places. Bunker inhabitants would not eat and sleep in the manner of The Greenbrier, where rooms cost between $340 and $2,600 a night and world-class chefs prepare mouth-watering meals. Those being sheltered would have entered the bunker through an inconspicuous door in a hallway leading into Exhibit Hall. The bunker would not have survived a direct nuclear strike but would have protected inhabitants from radioactive fallout, lGeisner said.

Incredibly poor student judgment has been a common theme in several recent local stories. An inability to recognize the difference between right and wrong, as well as a shameless irresponsibility, are pervasive . After an alarmingly short mourning period, the national Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity has lift.ed the charter suspension on the local chapter, where associ\u00ad ate member Matthew Garofalo died of an alcohol\u00ad related complication on Sept. 8. The national organization has handed down a laun\u00ad dry list of conditions associated with the fraternity's reactivation, which could come as early as next year if the m approves . University officials would do well to insist that the fraternity's no alcohol policy remain in effect forever, and consider applying the requirement to all other recognized fraternities. UI fraternities are becoming more and more dangerous, and the possible positive effects of removing alcohol from the mix would far outweigh the proven negative consequences of allow\u00ad ing it to remain. The m has yet to make a final judgment on Lamb\u00ad da Chi Alpha, but an amazing example of incredibly poor judgment is the unfolding case of UI juniors Robert Kooima and Kevin Michael Joyce Jr. EDITORIAL POINT OF VIEW A wanton disregard for the rules, laws and feelings of others is spread\u00ad ing across the UI campus, the com\u00ad munity and the country. Kooima has been charged with providing false reports to law enforcement officials when Joyce faked his suicide. Kooima apparently thought he was being true to his friend and roommate when he knowingly lied to the UI Department of Public Safety and then stood with Joyce's parents as officials dragged the riv\u00ad er for the body when he knew it wasn't there. Kooima faces a possible fine or 30 days in jail. He should be required to reimburse area law enforcement officials for the cost of the recovery effort he could have stopped at any time. UI senior Joseph Sample also was in the news Fri\u00ad day, and he too demonstrated a corrupted sense of right and wrong. Last year, Sample ran across the field in a gorilla suit during a football game. Then, in the same costume, he ran onto the floor during a bas-still wrong no matter how many times you do it befon ketball game. The university evidently ignored the you're caught. first incident, but inflicted sanctions aft.er the second run. Sample faces several charges from the UI, as well as a year-long suspension from attending sports activ\u00ad ities. Although tens of thousands of people witnessed his breaking of the rules, Sample has taken the UI to court to overturn the suspension . Sample's attorney, Richard Pundt, was quoted in a letter last The subjects of many of Friday's front page storie. in the DI demonstrate through actions or words that few have ever learned the simple difference betweel[ right and wrong.

Stephanie Whitmer UI !tenior majoring in English By the year 2000, half of our nation's population will be single -but this phenomenon may not be all good. Enter the computer -the single person's new best friend. It knows how to find that significant other. Cou\u00ad ples allover are hooking up. No longer the reject path to dating, on-line dating is the new way to reach out and find someone. People have always been searching for a connection, but the avenues they are now driving down have defi\u00ad nitely been rerouted. Con\u00ad nection once meant commu\u00ad face, watch\u00ad ing expressions and antici\u00ad pating reactions . It meant talking, listening to verbal inflections and understand\u00ad ing moods. It was about the ideals, thoughts and opin\u00ad ions two people had in com\u00ad mon, not whether or not both people smoke or if they like the same television shows. Today, relationships don't have the same priority in people's lives. For many col\u00ad lege students, marriage is just not cool anymore. And sadly enough, that mind frame is revolutionizing the way we relate to one anoth\u00ad er. The phrase \"sex in the '90s\" has been thrown EDITORIAL POINT OF VIEW Computer dating cannot rep'lace personal contact. around repeatedly. There is an underlying meaning to these words -connection in the '90s. It's amazing how many people are afraid they sim\u00ad ply won't find \"that special someone.\" For most people, being alone is a genuine fear. So with America's lust for technology, humanity and real relationships are getting lost in the computer chips. Jobs certainly do not fill the emotional void in people's lives, but the road to the modern dream of a successful career is easier to travel than the winding road oflove. So people continue to search for a significant other in the very thing that has fundamentally separated them -technology . There's an invisible wall sequestering Americans. People would rather relocate for a job than for a partner. Work, in\\ltead of people, takes priority. Money means more than marriage. People find that they are just .. unwilling to take chances o~ something that might not work. If you put enough inhi\" a job, you'll get somewhere .'

No country puts more emphasis on security than Israel. The Shin Bet secret service built an enviable reputation for protecting its lead\u00ad ers and preventing terrorist attacks. Security broke down, however, when bodyguards apparently mis\u00ad took a young law student for a VIP driver and let him get close enough to shoot Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin with a 9mm Beretta. Ques\u00ad tions are also being asked about why Rabin was not wearing a bul\u00ad letproof vest. It's not as if there weren't ample warning that an attack might come from Israel's religious right wing. The suspect had links to right-wing extremists. -An Israeli soldier lights a candle on a makeshift m,emorial setup in front of an honor guard stand\u00ad ing around the coffin containing the remains of Associated Press slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin outside the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, in Jerusalem early Sunday. In recent weeks, angry debate over the future of the West Bank spilled into the streets with right\u00ad wingers heckling Rabin at public appearances, calling him a \"mur\u00ad derer,\" \"Nazi\" and \"traitor.\" His Cabinet ministers were also under threat, and extra body\u00b7 guards and armored cars were deployed. Housing Minister Binyamin Eliezer was trapped in an angry crowd, Education Minis\u00ad ter Shulamit Aloni was punched in the stomach and Environment Minister Yossi Sari d's car was forced off a highway. Israelis mourn slain leader Karin Laub ~ Associated Press JERUSALEM -Hundreds of thousands of Israelis, many weep\u00ad ing, many bearing flowers, silently filed past the simple wooden coffin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Sunday, in a final salute to the as;assinated soldier, statesman and man of peace. ;rhe parade of mourners came frQm allover the shocked and sad\u00ad dened country to a courtyard in front of the Knesset, the Israeli p~rliament. The procession was elij)Bcted to continue all night until the start of a state funeral today attended by dozens of world lead\u00ad ers, including President Clinton. Even as Israelis mourned, they tried to grasp the enormity of the ull~eaval thrust upon their country when a Jewish opponent of Rabin's ~acemaking gunned him down. ,Under a bright, warm Jerusalem s~n, many gently placed bouquets or flowers on stone tiles near the flag\u00b7draped coffin in which the 73\u00b7 year\u00b7old slain leader lay. Others saluted the former army chief of staff who became Israel's standard\u00b7 bearer for peace. r\"l feel that half the country has di.ed,\" high school student Pini Cqhen said as he and a group of friends huddled and lighted can\u00ad dIes in parliament's courtyard on a hjll overlooking Jerusalem . . ~ Jewish settler from New York, Y~akov Geneck, quietly sat in a comer, with a sign announcing he was on a hunger strike to protest growing violence. Geneck said he opposed Rabin's peace policies, but could not con\u00ad done the behavior of Rabin's oppo\u00ad nents. \"! am here to say that the hatred of so many people led to this. I have encountered this hatred and I did not speak out,\" said Geneck, who moved to Israel two years ago. Rabin's assassination at a peace rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday night stunned a nation that, despite increasingly bitter divisions over peacemaking with the Arabs, had somehow denied such violence could happen to them. The suspect, Yigal Amir, a 27\u00b7 year-old law student with links to the Jewish extremist fringe, told in.terrogators he wan.ted to stop Rabin's peace policies. He reported\u00ad ly said his actions were based on rabbinical rulings which permit Jews to kill people who gave away parts of the biblical Land ofIsrael. Israel radio reported Amir's brother, Hagai, was one of an unspecified number of extremists rounded up for questioning. \"There were many writings on the wall, but still we felt this could not happen to us,\" said Chaim Ramon, chief of the powerful His\u00ad tadrut Trade Union Federation.

A sea of memorial candles, bou\u00ad quets, handwritten prayers and Rabin photographs covered the spot where the prime minister was shot. A sign in Hebrew read, \"Why?\" Rabin's coffin, draped with the blue-and-white flag bearing the Star of David, was placed in an army truck Sunday morning and, accompanied by six army generals and two police chiefs, driven slowly {rom Tel Aviv up to Jerusalem through the rocky, eternal hills. Yossi Melman, an author and expert on intelligence, said security was \"a total failure because the handwriting has been on the wall for the past month.\" One reason was that few Israelis really believed that an Israeli would kill an Israeli. Gideon Ezrach, former deputy head of the Shin Bet, said he thought when Rabin was in the Arab West Bank town of Nablus, his bodyguards were \"more psycho\u00ad logically alert\" than they were in Tel Aviv. \"I also think we all did not believe that such a thing could happen,\" said Ezrach.

Much of Rabin's life was used to direct efforts toward peace between Jews and Palestinians in Israel, and with hi8 aS8usination many have questioned whether the peace process will break down. \"In my opinion, 1 don't think this will aiTect the peace process,\" Dubin said.

We have to push for\u00ad ward. \"Even people against what's going on (the peace process) are shocked and dismayed .

However, a suggestion to eliminate halftime re\u00ad entry passes was not implemented. At the Iowa VB.

Vernon said the one thing the council can do to help UI students is to create internships and other ways for students to gain experi\u00ad ence in the work force. \"I'm hoping the council will be able to bring in businesses that will allow college students to gain expe\u00ad rience so they will find jobs after school,\u00b7 Vernon said. Johnston said the character of Iowa City is part of ita stimulating business. \"I think one thing that is very important is to build on the charac\u00ad ter of Iowa City, and I think this makes us unique,\" she said. Like several other candidates, Johnston thinks zoning is an impor\u00ad tant part of improving business in Iowa City. \"Right now, our industrial park is full. We're going to need to take care of that,\" she said. The focus of Kubby's campaign is affordable housing. \"I hope to make my focus afford\u00ad able housing.

Thornberry, a District C candi\u00ad date, said his first priority if elected would be to improve Iowa City's cost of living. \"Iowa City is the most expensive city in the state .... 1 want to give people more affordable living,\" he said_ \"As a businessman, I don't think I'm getting my money's worth.

Dubin, who has heard Rabin speak twice in the United States, said the emotional outpouring sur\u00ad rounding Rabin's assassination is comparable to that which occurred following John F. Kennedy's death. \"My heart goes out to the people of Israel and Prime Minister Rabin's family and kids and every\u00ad one there,\" Dubin said. \"Ifit bothers me as an American, many thou\u00ad sands of miles away, it must be a tremendous blow to Israelis.\" has to be cooled,\u00b7 he told ABC's \"This Week With David Brinkley.\" Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, will not attend Rabin's funeral, a decision ltamar Rabinovich, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, calJed \"a sensible decision.

TRANSGENDERED Continued from Page 1 home by police to the UlHC. He was released Friday after\u00ad noon. County Attorney J. Patrick White, whose office is in charge of involuntary commitments, would not co=ent Sunday night. McCloskey's commitment has sexuality experts saying public awareness about transgendered issues is vital for transsexuals to be accepted into society. \"We have very, very narrow limits to how we respond to gender-relat\u00ad ed issues,\" said Howard Ruppel, adjunct associate in the UI school of social work and executive director of society for scientific study of sex\u00ad uality. \"It is a good thing when the public can learn about these issues.\" Ruppel said our society is much harsher towards transgendered individuals than European soci\u00ad eties. \"It certainly doesn't mean that this person is crazy,\" he said. \"It just means that they may need some help.\" Ruppel said transsexuals \"find themselves in a situation that hap\u00ad pens to not be compatible with their body structures . \"Why that happens is really unclear, but that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone,\" Ruppel said. \"We have only been worrying about this issue for about 45 years. It is still a premature issue to explain.\" Possible causes for transsexuality may be found in the person's histo\u00ad ry, such as nonacceptance as a child, Ruppel said. An individual's biological nature and what they believe to be their core gender iden\u00ad tity may also be factors. The core gender identity is a per\u00ad son's deep sense of maleness or femaleness and is not something that is defined through cultural socialization, Ruppel said. The behavior may range from a male dressing in feminine clothing to radically changing his body struc\u00ad ture. However, Ruppel said gender identity is not directly related to a person's sexual orientation. \"No, in capital letters -it is not linked to homosexuality,\" Ruppel said. \"Homosexuality has to do with a person's sexual orientation and how they express their feelings, where as trans sexuality has to do with the core sexual identity, which is totally different.\" Ruppel, who is from Mt. Vernon, Iowa, and has never had one of his transsexual patients involuntarily committed, said it is also important for the mental health community to understand transgendered issues. \"There are some rigid beliefs about gender and sometimes talk\u00ad ing to a person to expand (the defin\u00ad ition 01) androgyny can help,\" he said. \u00b7So many of the individuals feel that they are the only ones dealing with this problem.\" However, it is impossible to esti\u00ad mate accurately how many people are transsexuais because no scien\u00ad tific studies asking participants about gender issues have been done, Ruppel said. \"There are a lot more people than the general public believes,\" Ruppel said. \"But there are probably fewer people than (transsexual groups) project.\" Counseling, along with hormonal treatment, is a prerequisite for those considering sex reassigrunent surgery. John Maclndoe, U1 associate p\\'O< fessor of medicine and endocrinolo\u00ad gist, treats transsexuals througb hormone therapy and only treat~ people who are recommended by a psychiatrist or psychologist . \"For every 5 to 10 people on ho~ mone therapy then, maybe down the line only one will go ahead with the surgery,\" Maclndoe said. Maclndoe said he gives male patients normal amounts of estr&\u00ad gen while inactivating the male hormones. \"Male transsexuals are the mOSt co=on ones,\" he said. \"Basically, we are trying to help them find peace of mind. One reason (for hor-. mone therapy) is just to feel better,\u00b7 feel more calm, feel less hostile or angry. There are others who want to look like Miss Iowa before they are happy.\" There are few women transsexu\u00ad als, and they are treated with hor-: , mones that react much more quick- ly than the male transsexual's bor: mones, MacIndoe said. This is. because unlike men, women do not . need to deactivate their own hof\u00b7 : mones. MacIndoe said he has about two or three patients in Iowa City, but' sees between 20 and 30 transsexu \u00b7 als per year. \"I think these folks are a very . unhappy group of people,\" he ssid. \"I thi nk society tends to disregard them.

SportsBriefs LOCAL Women's basketba ll team plays at home tonight The path to redemption for head coach Angie Lee's nationally ranked Iowa Hawkeyes begins tonight at 7 p.m. in Carver-Hawk\u00ad eye Arena. Lee's young team will line up against Athletes in Action in the beginning' of its quest to make up for last season's disappointment. Lee replaced Iowa's all-time win\u00ad ningest coach C. Vivian Stringer last spring after a disappointing 11\u00b717 finish. The uncharacteristic Iowa record was the first sub .500 record in the last 13 seasons, and the only one in the Stringer era. Many eyes will be on the per\u00ad formance of last seasons highly touted freshman class, led by Big Ten Conference freshman of the year Tiffany Gooden. Gooden finished semnd for the Hawkeyes in scoring last season with 12.5 points per game. Iowa is also looking forward to the return of senior center Si mone Edwards, who red-shirted last sea\u00ad son with a knee injury. \"If you look at them from top to bottom, they have great poten\u00ad tial,\" Lee said. \"Where that will take them is up to them and what they learned last year and what they're willing to put on the line this year.\" Kansas 8\u00b71\u00b70 940 11 11.

Hawks'skid: 3 and counting Sherman, 'Hawkeyes hit bottom in defeat Chris Snider The Daily Iowan Iowa quarterback Matt Sherman stood at mid-field, motionless. He looked downfield, and then slowly began his walk to the sideline. The No.2 rated passer in the Big Ten had just thrown his fifth inter\u00ad ception of the game, the fourth in his last six attempts. Sherman's fourth interception, with 5:36 to go, erased all hope of an Iowa victory, and this one, with 1:37 to go, was the icing on the cake. \"Matt had a tough day,\" Iowa coach Hayden Fry said. \"It was the first time since he's been a starter that he really had a tough time.\" Iowa has little ti me to salvage season Mike Triplett The Daily Iowan Three weeks ago the Hawkeyes were undefeated and riding high. The fact that they still needed two more wins to qualify for a bowl game was merely in the back of their minds. But three games and three losses later, those two wins must come in the last three games. They must come now. \"Obviously we've got to win now,\" offensive lineman Matt Purdy said.\" If we don't win now, then we don't go anywhere. We're all sitting at home at Christmas.\" Sherman finished with 223 yards passing, completing 22-of-42 passes for one touchdown and five inter\u00ad ceptions. Illinois defeated Iowa, 26-7, Sat\u00ad ping the Hawkeyes to 5-3 in the season, 2-3 in the Big Ten. Illinois moved its record to 4-4, 2-3 in the conference . Pete Thompson/The Daily Iowan Iowa defensive lineman 8i11 Ennis-Inge wraps up Illinois running back Robert Holcombe during Satur\u00ad day's 26-7 loss at Kinnick Stadium. Illinois ran for a season-high 244 yards against the Hawkeyes. Despite a 5-0 record, Iowa went into the Oct. 20 game against Penn State as an underdog . The Hawkeyes were also heavy under\u00ad dogs a week later against Ohio State in Columbus. In a sense, those two losses were understand\u00ad able and maybe even expected. But a two-game losing streak, against anybody, can take some fire out of a team. And on Saturday, the Fighting Illini seemed to be play\u00ad ing with a lot more heart. \"Everyone was juiced up, ready to go, and mistakes just hurt us: offensive lineman Matt Purdy said. As the Hawkeyes mourned, the Fighting Illini celebrated on the other side of Kinnick Stadium. Illinois coach Lou Tepper was concerned coming into the game because of the chaos Hayden Fry Iowa puts on a show for sellout crowd David Schwartz The Daily Iowan While Jess Settles was proving to the world that his back was healthy, it was the absence of a freshman that forced the greatest impact. The Iowa men's basketball team announced Saturday that fresh\u00ad man Guy Rucker has decided to redshirt his freshman season to focus on academics. \"I have asked coach Davis if he would allow me to sit out this year to concentrate on my books,\" Ruck\u00ad er said in a written statement. \"I want to become a student fust and then an athlete, as well as develop\u00ad ing my body skills and getting in better shape.\" The Hawkeyes, who finished in the lower half of the Big Ten Con\u00ad ference in rebounding last season, will sorely miss the 6-foot-ll fresh\u00ad man from Inkster, Mich., but Iowa coach 'Ibm Davis thinks Rucker's decision is for the best. \"I'm very supportive,\" Davis said. \"I think it's a great decision for him personally. It was the right move.\" The Hawkeyes will now play two exhibition games -the first game being on Sunday at Carver-Hawk\u00ad eye Arena against the Republic of Georgia -before heading to the Great Alaska Shootout over Thanksgiving. has caused him through the years. \"Fry causes me more turmoil than any coach I've faced. He's probably cost me three years of my life,\" Tepper said. Tepper was mainly concerned because of the intangibles involved, but was proud of how his team reacted. \"I was concerned coming into the game more because of the road problems,\" Tepper said. \"When the game was moved up to 11:34 and we were staying in Cedar Rapids, that concerned us. \"You travel here in the morning. You felt the team might fall asleep on the bus ride over and you've got to come to the wonderful pink lock\u00ad er rooms.

The Lady Lions earned an auto\u00ad matic berth to the NCAA tourna\u00ad ment and sent the No. 2 Haw~eyes, the Big Ten regular season champi- 0ns' home to ponder what went wrong. \"This is just one of the most frus\u00ad trating things,\" Beth Beglin, Iowa head coach, said. \"I hope we get to play Penn State again. I would love to see them in the NCAA tourna\u00ad ment.\" The Hawkeyes came into the tournament the No.1 seed, but struggled to get by Ohio State in the first round. The fifth-seeded Buckeyes gave Iowa all it could handle on Saturday as it took an overtime goal by Hawkeye sopho\u00ad more Michelle Wilson to eek out the 2-1 victory. Iowa's Diane DeMiro gave the Hawkeyes the lead in the first half as the junior beat Ohio State's Nik\u00ad ki Thompson to put Iowa up 1-0. The Buckeyes knotted the game at 1-1 when Jill Deemer scored with five minutes left in the first half. The two teams battled the entire second half scoreless to send the game into the extra period. Iowa senior Ann Par~ found Wilson in the penalty circle and Wilson sealed the victory 9:59 into over\u00ad time. On Sunday, \u00b7the Hawkeyes ran into a fired-up Penn State squad who bad gone down twice to Iowa in the regular season. The Nittany Lions jumped out to a 1-0 lead on a goal by Jenni Bisig\u00ad naro with 11:54 remaining in the first half. Penn State then caught a break when Hawkeye goalkeeper Lisa Cellucci was called for lying on the ball and the Lady Lions were awarded a penalty stroke. Penn State's Holly Bollinger shot the ball past Cellucci to put the Nittany Lions up 2-0. A controversial call at the end of the first half cost Iowa another goal as well as some momentum. Pare took a shot off a deflection of a Lady Lions stick, but the ball went through a hole in the net. The officials ruled no-goal and Penn State retained its two goal lead. Iowa's Diane DeMiro cut the lead to 2-1 when she received a pass from Par~ and scored in the penal\u00ad ty circle with 21:05 left in the game. But Penn State shut the door on Iowa when freshman Dawn Lam\u00ad mey scored with 17:01 remaining . Bigsignaro then added her second goal with 2:48 left on the clock. Penn State coach Char Morett said this was a huge victory for her team. \"We never gave up on ourselves,\" Morett said. \"This win will give us a tremendous boost heading into the tournament. I have a funny feeling we might see Iowa again, so it's good to get a win under our belt against them.\" Iowa, a lock for the NCAA tour\u00ad nament despite the loss, will find out ita first round opponent when the pairings are announced today. ellll/ R L \\\\1\u00a3' Keyshawn Johnson caught an 8-yard Illinois ~6 TO pass from Kyle Wachholtz with Iowa 7 39 seconds remaining, putting Southern Cal (7-'-') within one vic-Wisconsin 38 tory of a Rose Bowl berth.

The Hawkeye duo churned out three conference wins to set up a finals showdown with Illinois' Isabel Adsuar and Nicole Jackson. The Hawkeye s were never in dan\u00ad ger in the championship match as they cruised to an 8-2 victory. All of this despite never having played a match together as mem\u00ad bllrs of the Iowa women's tennis team. McCracken , who usually plays with her sister KeJJy, became a.late substitute for the injured Krissy Campbell . Iowa assistant women's tennis coach Jen Hyde said McCracken apd Wolverton overcame unfamil\u00ad iarity with solid fundamentals . \"They to play super- BLOWOUT Continued from Page 1B red shirt eligibility by participating in exhibition games. \"It's pOBsible,' Davis said. \"We may hold a couple of the younger players out.\u00b7 Last Saturday'S Intrasquad scrimmage was appropriately named (the Gold team won 101- 54), but Davis and his players believe the Black and Gold Blowout served a useful purpose. \"'Ibday was good just to get a lit\u00adtle timing work done and for coach Davis to get in a rhythm as far as substituting,' senior Kenyon Mur\u00ad ray said. Davis said the Blowout was a chance for his team to work out kinks from the offseason . \"It was good for the players to be Ollt in front of the lights,\" Davis hero doubles,\u00b7 Hyde said. \"They just played basic doubles and that's why they won.' Wolverton, McCracken, and sophomore Robin Niemeier were equally impressive in singles play. McCracken and Wolverton each posted 3-1 tournament records before falling in the semi-fina ls and quarterfinals respectively. Niemeier lost her second round match in three sets, after winning her opening match 6-2, 6-0. Two other members of the Hawk\u00b7 eye squad competed at the Rolex Regional s last Thursday and Fri\u00ad day in East Lansing, Mich. Seniors Sasha Boros and Nikki Willette advanced to the third round in dou\u00b7 bles play with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Cincinatti's CollettelHanis. There, the duo was defeated by EklundINovak of Northwestern 2- 6,5\u00b77. Boros also saw singles action at the tournament, winning her first match 6-1, 7\u00b75 over Toledo's Christie Brannon. In the second said. \"This has to be one of the places that we can work things out before the actual season starts.\u00b7 Perhaps benefiting most from the scrimmage were the freshmen , who had the rare opportunity of playing in front of a sellout exhibi\u00ad tion crowd of 15,500. ~I think that just being out there is going to help <the freshmen) ,' junior Chris Kingsbury said. \"It's not like the Big Ten is going to be, but it's still good to get them out there.' Murray said the freshmen 's ten\u00ad sion was obvious at first, but the nerves faded as the game pro\u00ad gressed. \"I thought (the natural fresh\u00ad men) were a little bit tight at first, but all three of them began to a playa little bit better down the stretch,\u00b7 Murray said. round, she fell to Michigan's Sors Moon in three sets. Men's team falls in difficult draw There's nothing worse than grab\u00ad bing the shortest straw. The Iowa men's tennis team had high expectations going into the Rolex ITC Championships in Madi\u00ad son, Wis., last weekend, but didn't match its 1994 success at the tour\u00ad nament due to some tough draws. Junior Tom Derouin was the Hawkeyes' top finisher in singles play. Derouin advanced to the quarterfinals with a 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 win over Wisconsin 's Jeff Malik before to Minnesota's 'Ibm Chicoine . Ryan Johnstone, Marcus Ekstrand and Damlr Seferovic did not fair quite as well, as each fell in his first match of the tourna\u00ad ment. Mattias Jonnson won his open\u00ad ing round match against Wlscon\u00b7 sin's Mike Goldstein 6-3, 6-2, but was forced to drop out of his second The Blowout also served another purpose. Namely, how fit is the ort\u00ad injured hack of Settles? \"It felt real good,\u00b7 Settles said after the game. \"I've been doing good through practice so it looks like it'll be ready to roll.\" However , it was a year ago when Settles' il\\jury flared up with little warning. \"It was the exhibition games, about last year at this time, but hopefully it won't ever happen again,' Settles said. Davis also noticed the stability in his star forward's etrort. \"I think if you look at Jess Set\u00ad tles, the numbers support what he can do,' Davis said. Settles hit a game-high 23 match when he aggravated a knee il'\\iury. Two Hawkeye doubles teams played in the tournament as well, both lOSing in the first round. Iowa coach Steve Houghton said he was pleased with the Hawkeyes' perfonnances saying that the num\u00ad bers didn't tell the whole story. \"It's a difTerent feeling after hav\u00ad ing (Bryan) Crowley win the tour\u00ad nament last year,' he said. \"We didn't advance through the last two dJlys of the tournament but I think it was the matter of the draw, instead of people not playing as welL\" As a case in point, Houghton focused on Ekstrand's match with the tournament's top seed. Notre Dame's Mike Sprouse won the match 6-3,6-7, 6-3. \"He really had a good chance to win the match,\u00b7 he said. \"It's too bad that this tournament was one and out. Sometimes good perfor\u00ad mances get lost in the losses.\" junior Chris as weJl, but wasn't overly con\u00ad cerned. Kingsbury tallied 13 points, but missed all 11 of his three-point attempts . \"I'm not happy with how I played, but I just want to do the best that I can right now,\" Kings\u00ad bury said. One of the biggest surprises was the play of the freshman Robinson, who scored eight points -two on a thunderous dunk that was followed up with a little shimmy -and was relentless on the boards. However, it was the hot-dogging that got Robinson the most word\u00ad of-mouth . points, 12 coming on three-point- \"(Robinson's) got a little flare and ers. this team. needs a little bit of that,\u00b7 Iowa's three-point specialist, Davis said. ----------------------- ......................... .. these football f\"~' .~ .''1 Ii QUILT SHORTY (R) DAILY 7'15 9:30 1 FAIR GAME (R) , EVE 7,00 & 9,40 & 9'30 930 IMPORT PANKO CHICKEN.

Chicago's Chris Zorich sacks Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell for an ll-yard loss Sunday. Moon threw for three touch\u00ad downs and 237 yards Sunday, becoming the second fastest to reach the 40,000-yard plateau and Minnesota edged Green Bay 27-24 on Fuad Reveiz's 39-yard field goal as time expired. Moon was the sixth passer to reach 40,000 yards and not much later, Elway became No.7, throw\u00ad ing for three touchdowns and 256 yards as the Denver Broncos rout\u00ad ed the Arizona Cardinals 38-6. Panthers 13, 4gers 7 Call it what you want -shock\u00ad ing, stunning, or inconceivable - but you'd better believe it. Carolina became the first expan\u00ad sion club in its inaugural season to win four games and defeat a defending Super Bowl champion, I downing the San Francisco 4gers, 13-7 Sunday. In the end, the 4gers were with\u00b7 out their top two quarterbacks and committed five turnovers. Three occurred inside the Carolina 10, including Tim McKyer's 96-yard interception return for a touch\u00b7 down. Carolina (4-5) surpassed the pre\u00ad vious high for an expansion club with its fourth straight victory and is by no means out of playoff con\u00ad tention in the NFC West. Saints 19, Rams 10 At New Orleans, Doug Brien, signed this week to replace Chip Lohmiller , kicked field goals of 35, 26. 47 and 42 yards to lead the Saints, drawing standing ovations with every kick. Lohmiller was 8-for\u00b714, missing five field goals and an extra point in two victories.

A capacity crowd of 15,200 cheered as Mourn\u00ad ing and coach Pat Riley made suc\u00ad cessful debuts Saturday with the Heat, who beat Cleveland 85-71. The final 2,000 tickets were sold after Riley swung a six-player trade Friday to acquire Mourning from the Charlotte Hornets. The new coach and new center received standing ovations when introduce d before the game. Mourning echoed: \"I came here with the intention of being here for the rest of my career.\" Mourning made an immediate impact on the Heat's defense, which tied a team record by allow\u00ad ing only 71 points -24 in the sec\u00ad ond half. Cleveland's centers scored eight points. Last season, the Heat ranked 16th in defense in the NBA, allow\u00ad ing 102.8 points per game. \"They are going to be a good team with Mourning in there,\" Cavalier forward Tyrone Hill said. \"They're a whole lot tougher.\" Credit Riley too. He used aggres\u00ad sive, in-your-face defense to make the New York Knicks title con\u00ad tenders, and it looks as though Miami will play the same way. New York never was a threat. By midway in the second quarter, quarterback Bubby Brister was benched for Glenn Foley. But Foley suffered a dislocated right shoul\u00b7 der on the Jets' final offensive play when he was sacked and will miss the remainder of the season. Falcons 34, Lions 22 At Atlanta, Jeff George threw for 362 yards and Atlanta built a 34-7 lead and then hung on. Alton Montgomery returned an intercep\u00ad tion 71 yards for the Falcons' first TO and Jessie Tuggle's intercep\u00ad tion at the goal line with 1:37 to play ended Detroit's last comeback chance.

Iowa, ranked No. 14 in the nation, was paced by its divers, who swept both the one-meter and three-meter events. Vico Hidalgo won both events, with Tete Gil taking second in the one-meter and third in the three\u00ad meter. Jeff Stein finished second in the three-meter and third in the one-meter. Marco Minonne won both the 20Q-meter individual medley and the 200'meter breaststroke. \"I am very pleased with our young and inexperienced team being able to swim to a convincing victory over a worthy Big Ten oppo\u00ad nent,\" Iowa head coach Glenn Pat\u00ad ton said. \"Vico Hidalgo and Marco Minonne both established them\u00b7 selves as swimmers to be reckoned with in the Big TIm.\" Other Hawkeye winners includ\u00b7 ed Joe Loftus in the 1,000 freestyle and Marc River in the 50 freestyle. Iowa also won the 400 medley relay and the 400 freestyle relay. \"The overall performance was great,\u00b7 River said. \"I thought everyone swam great and gave 100 percent. It was definitely impor\u00ad tant. We all wanted to win.\u00b7 Jon Bassoff The Daily Iowan The Iowa volleyball team found out what the football team already knew. Don't mess with Penn State or Ohio State. The Hawkeyes were handled by the Big Ten powerhouses in a pair of matches over the weekend. Iowa has dropped seven-straight home matches and stands 2-12 in the Big Ten. Saturday night, Iowa performed well but could not overcome the Buckeyes' superior power and depth. No. 10 Ohio State won the match 15-11, 15-11, 15-10. In the first game, the Hawkeyes came out very strong. They bolted out to a 9-6 lead on a kill by Jen\u00ad nifer Bell. But Iowa went cold and was outscored 9-2 the rest of the way. The Hawkeyes were hurt badly by another cold stretch in the sec\u00ad ond game. After tying up the score at four, Ohio State ran off seven straight points to put the game away. Iowa made a late run but came up short. The third game was more of the same. The Hawkeyes battled to a 6-6 tie, but Ohio State went on an 8-1 run to take a 14-7 lead. Anytime you can run double fig\u00ad ures on a team like Ohio State, you're in pretty good shape,\" Coach Linda Schoenstedt said. \"Given our injury situation, and our lack of depth, I thought we did a really nice job.\" Jennifer Webb led the Hawkeyes in kills. She recorded eight in the third game alone to keep the Hawkeyes kicking. \"I think (Webb) is doing a better job playing within herself,\" Schoen\u00ad stedt said. \"She's not trying to car\u00ad ry the whole world on her shoul\u00ad ders.\" Webb was complimented by solid games from Heather Calomese and Tiffany McDaniel. McDaniel appears to have recovered from a knee injury that kept her out for much of the season. \"She seems a little quicker later\u00ad ally and she just keys our blocks,' Schoenstedt said. \"(McDaniel) is a good leader on the court and proba\u00ad bly doesn't receive enough credit for being a positive contributor to the team.\" On Friday, Penn State showed the Hawkeyes why it's ranked sev\u00ad enth in the country. The Nittany Lions (23-3, 12-2) en route to a 15-9, 15-4, 15-9 victo\u00ad ry. Penn State used a balanced attack to hold off Iowa. The Nit\u00ad tany Lions finished with a hitting percentage of .340 to the Hawkeyes .069. Jill Oelschlager led Iowa with 10 kills while Webb added nine. Webb suffered through a sub par match, however, as she committed a match-high 13 errors. The Hawkeyes fell behind 8-2 in the first game, 13-3 in the second, and 8-1 in the third and never recovered. In the third game, Iowa received a spark from Lisa Dockray . She recorded five of the Hawkeyes' eight kills to go along with an ace and a stuffed block in the game. \"I was really surprised that they didn't pick me up at all, so I just kept hitting as much as I could,\" Dockray said. Dockray said the rocky season has taken a toll on the Hawkeyes. \"It's tough sometimes coming into practice every day,\u00b7 Dockray said. \"The main thing is we really want to work together and make sure we don't lose the team chem\u00ad istry.\" Pele ThompsonITh e Daily Iowan Iowa running back Sed rick Shaw fends off an lIIini tackler Saturday.

Quoting a former close associ\u00b7 ate of the Graf family, Horst Schmidt, Spiegel said the 57- year-old Peter Graf \"treated her like a dog\" when they were once at a training camp in Spain. In one incident, Spiegel quoted Schmidt as saying Graf kicked his daughter when she dropped something and was picking it up. Spiegel said that Schmidt had told his story to tax fraud investi\u00ad gators Aug. 21, almost two weeks after Graf was arrested on the grounds that he was likely to flee prosecution. Spiegel said that before Schmidt saw the kick, he had not taken Peter Graf serious\u00ad ly when the father would come down from the hotel room and say, \"I've just now smacked her.\" This Week's Special GYROS SANDWICH Traditional beef & lamb rombo with Taziki saure on pita bread 2.99 UMON S\"m:IJQN IOWA MEMOIUAL UNION J ~ \u00b7 , . !

Strutter, a KISS tribute band, rocked the house, complete with platform shoes, pyrotechnics and outrageous stage presence -all trademarks of the legendary band. According to the group's mem\u00ad bers, Strutter is actually sponsored by KISS. They performed during the big KISS Convention tour earli\u00ad er this year. Unlike many tribute bands, Strutter pulls it off masterfully. During the set, they look, move a.nd sound just like the real thing.

And, oh yes, the long, flicking tongue was there, too. University of Northern Iowa stu\u00ad dent Kyle lOar, 22, made the trip to Iowa City to catch the show. lOar, a lifelong fan who saw KISS in 1978 at age five, said Strutter's show was impeccable. \"Strutter 's show and an old KISS show are like one,\" Klar said. \"They represent what vintage Kiss is all about -pleasing their fans and having a good time.

So he struggled up and knocked out. Evander Holyfield in the eighth round of their rubber match Satur\u00ad day night. \"I knew I WaB down and I didn't like where I WaB,~ said Bowe, who found himself on the floor in the sixth round for the ftr8t time in 39 professional fights. Bowe got up at the count of 5 and appeared in real trouble, with the round only a little more than 30 seconds old. Holyfield, however, could not take advantage. He landed a cou\u00ad ple more punches to the head, but then did very little (or the remain\u00ad der of the round. \"I was bone tired,\" ftr8t knock\u00ad O\\lt loss. ''The whole fight he was strong and I got real arm weary real quick. Then it was just the only chance I had was a knockout puoch. I couldn't get it. \"I lost a lot of energy throughout the fight. If not so much age, it's just that I didn't fight with every\u00ad thing I had.~ But it might be that age and a lot of hard fights left Holyfield with little against the bigger, stronger Bowe on this 54-degree night. Dr. Flip Homaneky said he examined Holyfield right after the ilgbt and that his pulse was good. Homansky Baid Holyfield, who had been diagnosed with a heart condi\u00ad tion last year, had suITe red some shoulder spasms, but complained of no shortness of breath. Holyfield attended a post-fight news confer\u00ad ence. When Bowe's opportunity came, he did not let it slip by. The two were exchanging punch\u00ad es early in the eighth round when Holyfield suddenly went face down from a crunching right. He strug\u00ad gled up at 9, but looked like a defea ted fighter. \"When he stayed down that long a time, I knew I'd get him,' Bowe said. \"1 am 240 pounds, he's 213. He's no match for me once I hit him.\" And hit him Bowe did, landing 252 of 524 punches, while Holyfield connected on 154 of 256. Holyfield had the better percentage , but he also took the worse beating. After seven rounds, the three judges had Holyfield leading by a point. Bowe had been penalized a point for a low blow in the fifth round. The AP card had Bowe ahead 66- 65 after seven rounds. At the end of their third exciting fight, the 28-year-old Bowe embraced his older opponent and said, \"Man, I love you. Man, I love you.\" An estimated crowd of 12,000 loved them both. With Mike Tyson's fight against Buster Mathis Jr., scheduled for hours earlier at the MGM Grand down the strip, called 01T because of Tyson's fractured right thumb, Bowe-Holyfield was the only fight in town. They made the most of it. While the judges gave Holyfield a slight edge, Bowe appeared in command through the first five rounds. And after Holyfield was unable to take advantage of the knockdown, he quickly re-estab\u00ad lished control. Bowe puffed Holyfield around both eyes and drew blood from his mouth as he scored with good left jabs, clean right uppercuts inside and hard body punches. Bowe thought the body punches played a big part in his victory, tak\u00ad ing the snap out of Holyfield'e legB early in the fIght. \"I could tell he was tired just watching him acro8S the ring between rounds,\" said Bowe, who established himlelf as the premier heavyweight in the world with the victory. Before the fight, he said he and Holyfield were the two best heavy\u00ad weights and that Tyson was No.3. A read on just how good Tyson might be after a four-year layoff etill haa to be made; his 89-second victory over Peter McNeeley on Aug. 19 told little about th.e fonner undisputed champion. The defeat came in Holyfield's second fight after he came out of retirement, which had been forced on him by the heart condition.

He did not fare well on defense against Walt WilliaID8. but none of his team\u00ad mates did either as Williams scored 20 points to lead the Kings. Garnett, the fifth choice in this year's NBA draft, is the youngest player in the league. Last year at this time, he was attending Far\u00ad ragut Academy in Chicago. A year earlier, he was at Mauldin High School In South Carolina. He entered Friday's game with 5:55 left in the first quarter and needed less than three ininutes to score his first NBA basket on a 5-foot bank shot. He followed that with another short shot, the dunk and the jumper from the top of the key. And Garnett even showed Borne ball-handling ability, making B no-look PaBS to Christian Laettner under the basket. \"As long as I can contribute,\" Garnett said. \"I'm not one of those greedy players.\" KNOW THE CODESM ammm [lmllll, moo\u00b7 You are not a mooch.
