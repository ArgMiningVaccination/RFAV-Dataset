Simultaneously a guide for professionals with an interest in health promotionand social policy, and a robust defense of economics in promoting growth and social development. Nicholas Barr Professor of Public Economics, London School of Economics Health economists now participate widely in global debates on health and development and contribute to better healththroughout the world. It wasn't always so. This excellent collection of Philip Musgrove's pathbreaking contributionsconfirms his pioneering role in this growing international field. Musgrove's persistent enquiry, conceptual clarity, andrefreshing irony enrich this collection. Lamps he lit will illuminate important questions for years to come. Peter Berman Professor of Population and International Health Economics Director, International Health Systems Program Harvard School of Public Health At the Pan American Health Organization, and then at the World Bank, Philip Musgrove has furthered the understand-ing of health financing, analysis of costs and benefits, the political economy of health reform, and related topics. His con-tribution has been central to the debate in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America, where crisis seems to be the norm andit is difficult to think soundly about health reform. This book shows that despite ignorance and misunderstanding, arational and productive encounter between economics and health is possible.

collected papers is both personal and institutional. The personal pleasurederives from my association with him and the respect I have developed forhis thinking and work over the past 20 years. It was Philip who criticallyreviewed for me my first major address on the subject of health and devel-opment, and I remember with pleasure his providing me with a list ofrequired reading on the subject and insisting that I read and reread SelmaMushkin's seminal work on health as investment. The institutional pleasure arises because it was Philip who in my view introduced the appropriate line of thinking about health economics intothe Pan American Health Organization in the decade of the eighties. I hadbeen convinced that the majority of health economists were concernedmainly with the costs of health services and presenting to the developingcountries various recipes for reduction of costs, including the employmentof user fees. Philip Musgrove's early work that I recall was a critical analy-sis of the impact of the economic crisis of the eighties on the health serv-ices and health outcomes in Latin America and the Caribbean. It waspartly from this work that he drew the conclusion, which is set out ele-gantly here, that public financing of health should be countercyclical. Thisvery sensible view has yet to gain widespread acceptance. I believe that one of the great virtues of this book, and Philip's papers in general, is that it is presented in eminently readable fashion and avoidsthe turgid writing that obfuscates rather than illuminates. This should beread by all health workers who are interested in the practical treatment ofmany of the problems that are usually dealt with by economists in the jar-gon of their guild. xiv Preface It is gratifying to see the really difficult issues, such as the role of the state or the market, treated so clearly, avoiding the all-or-nothing thinkingthat unfortunately can be common among health workers. These twomajor actors in the organization and financing of health services are nei-ther lionized nor demonized here. It is clear from Philip's papers that theyboth have their place even, or especially, in societies that are committed toequity in health outcomes as well as in the determinants of those out-comes, with emphasis on the role of the health services. Almost all of hisconclusions need to be repeated to health workers and policy makers in allsectors, but the one that is likely to strike the loudest chord is his assertionthat, except for the most inexpensive care, out-of-pocket spending is prob-ably the worst way to pay for health services. I hope that those who read this book Health Economics in Development will be convinced to abjure forever the loose thinking that goes into theexpression \"social sector.\" I appreciate that this will be difficult, but no onewho reads his arguments can fail to be convinced of the naivety if notabsurdity of the expression. This is not a matter of semantic jousting;experience shows that the public budget for health suffers in more waysthan one when it is included in a fixed social sector budget, and govern-ments studiously avoid discussing the merits of health spending in the dis-tribution of public resources. In his discussion on the cost benefit analysis of programs, Philip refers to the effort to establish the economic benefit from the program to eradi-cate poliomyelitis in the Americas. The outcome is now history, and for thepast eleven years there has been no transmission of polio in the WesternHemisphere. There was never any doubt about the technical feasibility orthe social desirability of the program, but when Philip demonstrated thatit was also economically beneficial, the stage was set for the success of whathas to be one of the most remarkable achievements of public health inrecent times. That success led to the decision to mount a worldwide effort,which is now approaching its final goal of universal eradication of polio. I hope this book will be well received and widely promoted, not only by financial institutions like the World Bank, where much of this material wasproduced, but also by institutions such as the Pan American Health Orga-nization, where Philip first began to work on health. There is a need forcritical and dispassionate thinking about all the issues he addresses. Forthose of us in the public health profession, there will be special interest inhis treatment of the concept of equity and the possibility of equity in thePreface xv provision of health care in countries where health services are segmented\u2014 to the detriment of the majority of the population and especially of thepoor. I wish the book well and recommend it to you. Sir George Alleyne Director Emeritus Pan American Health Organization World Health Organization Washington, D.C.xvii Acknowledgments Numerous colleagues and friends, particularly at the World Bank but also at the Pan American Health Organization, the Inter-American Develop-ment Bank, and the World Health Organization, encouraged me in theonly two beliefs that might justify this venture. One is that at least some ofthe papers included deserve a longer life and a wider audience than theoriginal publications alone would provide; the other is that because of thedevelopment of certain ideas over the years and the connections betweenone piece and another, putting the papers together might create a wholegreater than the sum of its parts. This collection owes its existence toAlexander Preker, who insisted on its potential when I doubted it, and toJames Christopher Lovelace, who allowed me to devote to it the necessarytime during my last months at the World Bank. I have also accumulated debts, beginning more than twenty years ago, to all those who provided the environment and the experiences fromwhich these ideas grew. These include a large number of government offi-cials and scholars, especially in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia,with whom I had the pleasure of working on empirical studies and healthsector reform projects, and the many PAHO and World Bank colleagueswho collaborated on those efforts. I trust they will forgive the failure toname them all individually. The acknowledgments for several chaptersthank those whose help was particularly important in stimulating orimproving a paper or in providing information and direction. T urning a collection of papers into a book would have been impossible without Nicki Marrian's repeated guidance and encouragement. DanielCotlear, Mar\u00eda Luisa Escobar, and Adam Wagstaff commented extensivelyon the first full draft, and contributed greatly to making it both leaner andmore thoughtful. The final organization of the volume, and especially thatxviii Acknowledgments of the Introduction, are due to their suggestions. Wagstaff also suggested the felicitous title. Olufumilayo Orisadipe undertook the tedious task ofretyping papers written so long ago that there were no electronic filesfrom which to work. Yvette Atkins and Sithie Naz Mowlana kept track ofsuccessive revisions. Rick Ludwick supervised the transformation of amanuscript into a book, with unfailing patience and efficiency. A Note on Authorship Five of these papers were written with co-authors, who in three cases deserve the lion's share of the credit. Chapter 13 derives from a muchlarger study by Dariush Akhavan for the World Bank. At the invitation ofAlexandre Abrantes, who was the task manager for the Bank malaria con-trol project, I condensed the study and developed the graphic and tabularpresentations to emphasize how a change in strategy improved the cost-effectiveness of control efforts. The fourth co-author, Renato d'A.Gusm\u00e3o, of the Pan American Health Organization, was responsible forthe introduction of the new malaria control strategy into the World Bankproject. Chapter 14 also derives from a larger study, by Osmil Galindo,undertaken for the Pan American Health Organization under my direc-tion at the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Joaquim Nabuco in Recife, Brazil. Besides oversee-ing Galindo's work, my contribution was to condense the study and put itinto English (the original was in Portuguese). Dean T. Jamison and JoanneLeslie wrote the first version of Chapter 17, and later invited my help withreconstructing and interpreting the calculations and with the final writing.Chapters 3 and 19 are more conventional cases of co-authorship; I ammost grateful to all the colleagues who shared in these efforts. I had the satisfaction of contributing to two major publications that are not excerpted here. One is the World Bank's World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health, for which I wrote much of Chapter 3 and part of Chapter 2. The other report, for which I wrote Chapters 1 and 2 and also edited therest of the text, is the World Health Organization's World Health Report 2000-Health Systems: Improving Performance. Both these reports were such joint products with several co-authors, from whom I learned a great deal, thatit does not seem proper to appropriate any part of either one as my own work.Many of the key ideas in these two documents, which deal with the role ofthe state in health, with the use of cost-effectiveness analysis, and with howhealth is (or should be) financed, are either foreshadowed by, or subsequentlydeveloped in, several of the papers included here.1 Introduction The papers in this collection span 21 years of thinking and writing about health economics, first at the Pan American Health Organization(1982-1990) and then at the World Bank (1990-2002, including two years,1999-2001, on secondment to the World Health Organization). They aredivided into six general topics, which together touch on several of the majorissues in this field. Chapters 1 through 3 concern the connection betweenhealth, particularly public health, and economics\u2014a connection that hasoccupied much of my professional effort, in part because I started to work onthe subject in an organization dominated by public health professionals, andonly later moved to an organization dominated by other economists. Chap-ters 4 through 6 treat several different aspects of equity, while chapters 7through 17 deal with effectiveness and efficiency, first in general terms andthen with specific attention to communicable diseases and to malnutrition.Equity and efficiency are among the main issues in any branch of econom-ics, and\u2014as several chapters illustrate\u2014they often cannot be sharplyseparated. Chapters 18 through 20 concern how health is, and how it shouldbe, paid for\u2014questions that involve both equity and efficiency. Calling the collection Health Economics in Development conveys two mean- ings: that the science of health economics itself has been developing duringthe period covered, and continues to do so; and that the application of healtheconomics contributes to development, broadly defined, both by improvinghealth and by reducing the waste of resources devoted to health care. As tothe first, health economics is a relatively young subdiscipline, roughly 40years old and expanding rapidly. In 1982, the Pan American Health Organi-zation (PAHO) sought to hire an economist with 10 years' experience inhealth issues in Latin America. That was a novel departure for PAHO, andit was resisted by a number of staff members trained in public health anddeeply suspicious of economists and their ways of thinking. Moreover, therewas probably no one alive who could meet the job requirements then. By theend of the century, the situation was quite different: PAHO not only2 Health Economics in Development employed several economists but promoted and published studies of the relations between health and development. This change of attitude reflectsthe growing realization that economic thinking is not inimical to the ethicalconcerns of health professionals, and that the expansion of health econom-ics as a field of inquiry has made it steadily more relevant and more useful tohealth organizations. As to the second, there is increasing evidence thatimprovements in health, far from being a pure consumption good or even aluxury, often represent valuable investments in people's capacities to learnand to work, and are sometimes essential to rescue people from poverty orprevent their impoverishment (Ruger, Jamison, and Bloom 2001). As is natural for papers written over a long interval on a variety of topics, these pieces originated in several different ways. The majority are responsesto specific requests from supervisors or colleagues, or (in two cases) friends.This is the case for chapters 1 through 3 and 11 through 17, as well aschapter 19. Only chapters 4, 5, 7, 9, 16, 18, and 20 were completely unpro-voked either by such requests or by criticism of previous work. Consideringthe time devoted at the World Bank to health projects, chiefly in Argentina,Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, it may seem odd that few papers resulted fromthose efforts. Only chapters 6 and 13 derived directly from Bank projects, inthe former case as part of the design and in the latter from ex post evalua-tion. The kind of analysis and the style of writing required to develop proj-ects do not often lend themselves to publication for a wider audience. Infact, the influence probably ran more often the other way, from the ideas ina paper to the way a project was conceived or conducted. I am grateful to the publishers of the journals or other sources in which these papers first appeared for permission to reprint them here. Each pub-lisher's approach to punctuation and the numbering of references and noteshas been retained. What is Peculiar About Health There are two strongly connected issues in chapters 1 through 3: first, what it is that distinguishes health from other sectors of the economy, what makesit peculiar in economic terms; and second, what the consequences of thosepeculiarities are for the appropriate roles of the state and the market. Thatis, how far should governments interfere in the markets for health care andother determinants of health, to what ends, and with what instruments ofintervention? This continues to be a contentious topic, both because theeconomics of health is complicated and because there is sometimes tooIntroduction 3 much ideological rigidity, oversimplified theory, and mutual misunder- standing on both sides of the discussion. Health is emphatically a placewhere \"market fundamentalism\" is misguided, but what one might call\"public health fundamentalism\" can be equally mistaken. Chapter 1 argues that it is valuable for health professionals to understand better how economists think in general, and how they approach issues inhealth in particular. A certain minimum understanding is desirable, but thatunderstanding does not require any specific knowledge of many areas of eco-nomics. (Some public health specialist should perhaps write the mirror-image paper on the minimum that economists should know about health andmedicine. Hsiao (2000) has provided an economist's view on what econo-mists, particularly macroeconomists, not familiar with health issues shouldknow about the subject.) Economists readily invade other professions'domains, in part because most microeconomics is about something particu-lar and not just about \"the economy,\" and also because economists travellight and carry relatively little baggage in the form of data or models specificto their subject (Hirschleifer 1985). Medical professionals, in contrast, mustknow a great deal of extremely detailed information, which makes them lessprone to incursions into others' territory and often leads to a more defensiveposture. These differences in the kind and amount of knowledge they needfor their work help explain why the two professions often have trouble com-municating with each other, to the detriment of how health systems function. Chapter 2 is an excerpt from a much longer World Bank Discussion Paper, specifically about public and private roles in health. The empiricalmaterial in that piece, on health expenditure and relation to health outcomes,has been omitted, because chapter 19 includes more recent and reliable infor-mation. The theoretical or conceptual discussion has also been abbreviated,while trying to preserve the central ideas. Four of these, which can\u2014I hope\u2014be widely accepted, are worth mentioning here. The first is that all healthinterventions can be classified into just three groups, depending on how farthey are public or private goods (in the economist's sense) and how much theycost. This classification links the characteristics of interventions to the ques-tion of who is to pay for them, emphasizing the importance of insurance orother forms of prepayment, including public financing. Second, the distinc-tion between catastrophically costly interventions and those that consumerscan afford to pay for out of pocket depends on people's incomes. Povertygreatly complicates the public/private distinction in the health sector, andbecomes a justification for public spending on grounds of equity. The rela-tion among income, costs of interventions, and public subsidy is treated fur-ther in several chapters, particularly 5 and 9. Third, delivering the right4 Health Economics in Development health interventions to the right people requires a coincidence among need, demand, and supply, which is why the task is so difficult. It is also the reasonwhy most health systems are a mixture of the state and the market, each ofwhich is prone to certain failures which the other can at least partially offset. The fourth idea is that what really makes health peculiar is rooted in biol- ogy. The asset that health interventions exist to protect, mens sana in corpore sano, is unlike any nonhuman asset in several crucial ways, starting with the fact that one cannot separate oneself from the asset (Miller 1978). These dif-ferences are what make health insurance unlike any other form of insurance,and make health financing more complicated than the financing to protectany other type of asset. T able I.1 summarizes some of the most important dif-ferences, which carry numerous implications for both equity and efficiency. There are of course other human assets than one's state of health, notably one's knowledge and skills, including those acquired through formaleducation. All these are forms of human capital, and as such have certain Table I.1 Principal Differences between Health Insurance and Insurance for Nonhuman Assets TYPE OF ASSET CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSURANCE DWELLING VEHICLE BODY Is the asset itself insured?

Nonetheless, the peculiarities of health are such that no other sector is much like it, and in particular, it differs in several fundamen-tal ways from education. These differences are partly intrinsic and partlysocially determined; on balance, they make schooling and health care moreunlike than similar. If schooling were really very much like health care, onewould see attacks of ignorance whose sufferers were rushed to a university forspecialized care; parents would seek to buy education insurance against suchcostly risks; nonemergency students would visit school only occasionally, andonly chronic cases would spend much time there. One crucial difference is that there is nothing in education corresponding to referrals in medical care. A sick or injured person can be referred \"up\" from a health center or physician to a hospital and referred \"down\" when hospitalcare is no longer required. There is a natural hierarchy of organizations and treatments in health care, but there is no natural sequence like primary educa- tion followed by secondary schooling followed by university or other higher-level training. If the health system worked the same way as education, nopatient could get into a hospital until he or she had spent years at health posts,and then more years attending clinics. In schooling, the worse results are atone level, the harder it is to proceed to the next higher one; in health care theexact opposite is true. This is one of the reasons why health care costsincrease more rapidly than educational costs: those who fail primary schoolare not sent, at great expense, to college. T o emphasize these differences is toattack the common and rather imprecise idea that there is something called\"the social sector\" (Castro and Musgrove 2000), which is relatively homoge-neous and is sometimes quite wrongly distinguished from \"the productivesector.\" Lumping, on this logic, is more dangerous to clear thinking andsound public policy than splitting is. T able I.2 summarizes some of the keydifferences and similarities between the two sectors, noting that the similari-ties are greatest at the primary level, with increasing differences as emergen-cies and more complex levels of health care are considered. The arguments in chapter 2 are illustrated by reference to several issues in the public/private balance, but no single issue is treated in detail. Chapter 3applies some of the general ideas to one such issue, that of how far the stateis justified in interfering with consumers' smoking habits. This is a much-disputed question, pitting public health views (actions bad for one's healthshould be suppressed) against those of consumer sovereignty (people shouldbe free to decide for themselves whether to smoke). The only easy point ofagreement between advocates of these different views is that people shouldbe informed about the undisputed health risks of smoking. Simple-minded6 Health Economics in Development economic thinking would stop there, but chapter 3 develops several economic arguments why simply providing information, and relying on consumerrationality for the rest, is an inadequate response to the dangers of tobaccouse. One of these arguments concerns the young age at which people typi-cally start smoking, and illustrates the general idea from chapter 2 that chil-dren do not fit the model of homo economicus, able to take risks into account and make sensible decisions about them. The addictive nature of tobacco alsoundermines an overly market-oriented view of the issue. The attempt toTable I.2 Principal Differences and Similarities between Education and Health HEALTH CARE PRIMARY HEALTH CHARACTERISTIC IN GENERAL CARE SCHOOLING Responds to Sometimes Sometimes, often with Never emergencies referral Predictable demand Only in part More predictable than Largely for health in general Insurance market exists Yes Yes; less needed than No for health in general Nature of Episodic Episodic, sometimes Cumulative improvements cumulative Natural \"good\" state Yes Yes No exists Hierarchy of facilities Yes Yes YesReferrals among facilities Yes Yes NoTendency to cost Strong Less than for health in Slight escalation general Concentrated early No Yes Yes in life Time-consuming Sometimes Sometimes AlwaysUniform treatment Sometimes More uniform than for Usually health in general Measurement of quality Very difficult Difficult Relatively easyUniversal coverage All services Package of \"basic\" Up to some level services Gains from universal Nondecreasing Nondecreasing Decreasing coverage Public budgeting Difficult Less difficult than for Easy health in general Public finance Quite variable Quite variable Always highRelation to technical Technophilic Less technophilic than for Technophobic change health in general Externalities Communicable Communicable General and diseases diseases diffuse Concern for equity Yes Yes YesShare of spending Low Higher than for health Very low on the poor in general Powerful providers Yes Less than for health Yes in generalIntroduction 7 reconcile smoking with the notion of a rational consumer leads to the \"rational addiction\" model, which is an oxymoron and is, in practice, hardlydifferent from models of habit formation that do not include addiction.Economic science is not yet very good at incorporating aspects that under-mine its own standard assumptions about how human beings behave. Judging and Promoting Equity Chapter 4 proposes a scheme for thinking about equity at each of several stages of an idealized or simplified episode of illness or accident. One may ormay not become sick or hurt; receive treatment or not, when needed; be curedor at least benefit from treatment, or not; and recover without treatment, ver-sus dying or continuing to suffer poor health. For a given illness episode,equity can be very different from one stage to another, and the amount ofinequity (and the inequality from which it derives) depends on how the pop-ulation is classified\u2014by age, gender, income, location, or other characteris-tics. The conceptual scheme is filled in, so far as household and health systemdata allowed, with information from Peru. Where the health system is con-cerned, equity can also look very different depending on which resource\u2014physicians, nurses, hospital beds, or money\u2014or which activities\u2014ambulatoryconsultations, hospitalizations, or immunizations\u2014is studied. Given all thesedistinctions, it does not make sense to try to summarize equity in a singlemeasure. Matters only become more complicated when one considers theequity of how health is paid for, since equity in finance can be interpreted inseveral different ways. Moreover, equity in finance is no assurance of equitabletreatment, nor does financial inequity necessarily prevent equitable care. Chapter 5 takes up one financing issue related to equity: it asks what prices consumers should pay for health care when payments do not have to covercosts because the services are publicly subsidized (and, often, publicly pro-vided as well). The key assumption, which attempts to model how a govern-ment in a poor country might think, is that the Ministry of Health valuesboth the quantity of services demanded and delivered and the revenueobtained from patients. The first element implies fees as low as possible,given that demand falls as prices rise; the second may justify substantiallyhigher fees, if demand for health care is relatively inelastic. The model canalso be complicated by allowing for price discrimination among consumersaccording to their incomes, and by trying to distinguish between necessaryand frivolous demand. The accumulated empirical evidence concerning theseissues strongly suggests that it is difficult to administer a user fee system so as8 Health Economics in Development to bring in significant revenue and at the same time to protect those least able to pay (Creese 1991; Newbrander, Collins, and Gilson 2000). It also seemsclear that consumers' reactions to fees for health care do not follow a med-ically sound distinction between care that is more needed or justified andinterventions that can be considered more frivolous or of low priority (Lohret al. 1986). Prices or fees can certainly be used to ration health care, as with any other good or service, but not necessarily to rationalize its use, as is some- times carelessly assumed. If the object is to promote needed care and dis-courage what is less needed, other means are required, and the burden ofmaking that distinction should not fall primarily on patients. Chapter 6 takes up a very different aspect of equity, the geographic distri- bution of resources to finance health care\u2014specifically, how to allocate fundsfrom a national government to state or provincial governments in a federal sys-tem in such a way as to compensate for differences in income, health needs, orcapacity to raise revenue. Analytically, this question fits between a larger and asmaller issue. The larger issue is how allintergovernmental transfers are deter- mined, including those that are not earmarked or that are designated for par-ticular uses other than health. The net fiscal impact on a state or other subna-tional unit may be quite inequitable even if the health-specific transfer isequity-enhancing, and vice versa. Moreover, the net impact on the health of thestate's population may differ from what the health transfers aim to achieve ifother transfers facilitate or hinder spending by the state out of its ownresources. The smaller issue is how the transfers specifically intended for healthare actually used. A national government may preferentially distribute funds toa state or province because on average, its inhabitants are poorer or sicker thanthose of other states; but if the state then uses those funds primarily to benefitthe richer or healthier part of its population, equity is hardly served. The issue treated in chapter 6 is therefore far from a full exploration of how intergovernmental transfers promote equity in health or fail to do so. Itis nonetheless ethically important to design those transfers to be equitable intheir own right, and politically they can be of great importance in federal sys-tems. The United States, Canada, and Brazil furnish three quite differentexamples of how federally organized countries have determined such alloca-tions. All three schemes have two significant features in common. First, theformula for allocation contains only one arbitrary parameter, which has theadvantage of concentrating political attention on a single decision. Second,the variables that go into the formula offer little scope for either level of gov-ernment to take advantage of the other or to manipulate the outcome. Theseseem like valuable principles to follow in many different circumstances whereIntroduction 9 resources have to be shared, so that what is judged technically to be equitable can also be readily understood and therefore accepted politically. Costs and Outcomes: Effects and Efficiency Chapters 7 through 10 are conceptual explorations of different aspects of effectiveness and efficiency. Chapter 7 asks the question of how to balancepreventive and curative interventions when both are available to combat agiven disease. Prevention is always preferable so far as pain, suffering, dis-ability, and anxiety are concerned\u2014\"an ounce of prevention is worth apound of cure\" in those terms\u2014but it does not follow that it is always thebetter choice once costs are taken into account. Assuming that the samefinal health outcome can be attained by prevention or by treatment, themarginal costs of the two alternatives determine the cost-minimizing mix-ture of activities. Under these circumstances\u2014although notin costs also maximizes cost-effectiveness. Some verysimple microeconomics leads to the conclusion that there is no generalsuperiority to either prevention or treatment so far as efficiency is con-cerned. This idea is illustrated in detail in chapter 13, about combatingmalaria in the Amazon Basin of Brazil. A change in strategy developed bythe World Health Organization, to focus preventive efforts more sharplyand to give more emphasis to case treatment, greatly reduced the averagecost of preventing a death. Preventive efforts, it turns out, can be extremelywasteful. T reatment at least has the advantage of not being applied to peo-ple who do not need it because they are not sick or hurt. Chapter 11 considers a somewhat similar question\u2014whether it would be economically justified to spend the considerable resources needed to eradicatepolio in the Western Hemisphere, as the Pan American Health Organizationconcluded in 1985 was technically feasible. In this case the choice was notbetween prevention and treatment, but between a combination of immuniza-tion and treatment, with both continuing into the foreseeable future, andelimination of the disease so that treatment could stop. The answer from theempirical analysis was that eradication would be not only ethically preferablebut actually cheaper than continuing to vaccinate some but not all the sus-ceptible children and to treat those who contracted the disease. At that time,the choice was easy, and polio actually was eliminated in the Americas. Thesame logic\u2014that elimination is cheaper as well as better than continuing topermit cases of the disease\u2014has been followed in the near-elimination of10 Health Economics in Development polio in the rest of the world. However, it is no longer clear that eradication of the disease is possible, and there are now seen to be substantial risks of ceas-ing to immunize once the disease is eliminated everywhere (World HealthOrganization 2002). T o choose the best course of action\u2014how much to vac-cinate, and with which of the two available vaccines\u2014would now require amore thorough analysis than was necessary in the 1980s, and would have totake account of the uncertainties concerning the various risks of continuedcirculation of poliovirus and of future outbreaks in unprotected populations. Both chapter 11 and chapter 13 illustrate ideal cases, in which it is possi- ble both to improve health and to save money by a proper choice of strategy.Economic analysis can be decisive in such cases, without the need for ques-tionable assumptions. Both chapters also deal with cases in which costs, orcosts relative to effectiveness, can be analyzed without making comparisonsacross diseases. More often, the question is whether an additional health gainis worth the additional cost involved, relative to other ways of improvinghealth or to nonhealth uses of the resources. In such cases, economic analy-sis is still helpful but depends more on assumptions and value judgments. For polio, an effective vaccine existed and costs could be estimated rather well. When the vaccines needed to control diseases do not yet exist and theresources required to create and apply them cannot be known with any cer-tainty, the question becomes, how large would the benefits need to be tojustify the likely costs? Alternatively, how cheap would vaccination have tobe for a program still to achieve benefits in excess of costs? This is an exam-ple of cost-benefit analysis, as distinct from the simpler cost-effectivenessanalysis used in the study of malaria control. The benefits in this case couldinclude the reduction in pain, suffering, disability, and death, rather thanjust the reduction in treatment costs that by itself justified the eradicationof polio. Chapter 12 deals with these questions for a hypothetical immu-nization program considered by the Pan American Health Organization forthe control of pneumonia, meningitis, and typhoid fever, including thedevelopment of vaccines. The analysis did not actually estimate the bene-fits: in fact, none of these papers presents a full cost-benefit analysis,because simpler analyses sufficed for the particular questions considered.This avoided the need to make assumptions about unobservable variables\u2014the values or utilities different people attribute to different kinds of benefits. The use of cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness analysis is the common thread in chapters 8, 9, and 10, as well as chapter 13. Both chapter 8 and chapter 10derive from the World Bank's World Development Report 1993: Investing inIntroduction 11 Health (World Bank 1993), which used that analysis as a basis for recom- mending \"essential\" packages of health interventions to be given priority inlow- and middle-income countries. More particularly, both these chaptersderive from criticisms of the approach taken in that report. In the case ofchapter 8, the criticism concerned how the \"burden of disease\" was calcu-lated and used to help determine priorities (Paalman et al. 1998). In the caseof chapter 10, the criticism, voiced by many World Bank economists duringpreparation of the Report, was that cost-effectiveness is a wrong, or even an irrelevant, criterion because it does not correspond to maximization of util-ity or welfare. Arguments continue over both these issues, especially the lat-ter. Economists are trained to look for ways to maximize or at least improvewelfare, which depends on many things besides health, while health spe-cialists focus on health gains, often to the exclusion of any other considera-tion. Economists also differ among themselves on this issue. Some developand employ cost-effectiveness analysis as a good approximation to cost-benefit analysis based on total welfare (Drummond et al. 1997; Gold et al.1996), while others reject that approach or are uncomfortable with it. As chapter 8 shows, some of the criticism of how burden of disease esti- mates were created and used results from simple misunderstanding. Itremains true, however, that such estimates incorporate a number of unveri-fiable and subjective parameters, so that there is no right answer. Empiricalapplications of the method in different countries are often not comparablebecause of different choices about those parameters (Bobadilla 1998). In thisrespect such calculations violate the recommendation of chapter 6 that thenumber of arbitrary or subjective parameters should be held to a minimum,preferably to just one. It does not seem possible, however, to follow that ruleonce the health effects of interest take account of nonfatal disabilities and aretherefore more complicated than just additional years of life. Progress in cre-ating broader measures of health status or of the gains from health interven-tions therefore brings with it the necessity for assumptions that, ideally,reflect consensus about the damage from morbidity and disability. The argument in chapter 10 was initially developed to justify the cost- effectiveness analysis in the World Development Report by starting from the economic theory of an individual consumer and moving toward a societalperspective .It begins by accepting that the health intervention an individ- ual would choose to buy for him- or herself, in order to maximize utility,would not necessarily be the most cost-effective intervention against a par-ticular disease or condition that he or she actually had or was exposed to.Still less would an individual care about the relative cost-effectiveness of12 Health Economics in Development interventions against other diseases or conditions he or she did not suffer or face a risk from. Nonetheless, when decisions about health interventions aresocialized, whether through insurance or, even more clearly, through pub-lic finance, cost-effectiveness becomes relevant, as the total potential healthgain for a group of people is considered relative to the total resources forpurchasing the corresponding interventions. Rather than a right-or-wrongdichotomy, it appears that cost-effectiveness ranges from being largely irrel-evant at the individual level\u2014although both costs and effects matter,choices are not necessarily based on the ratio of the two\u2014to being increas-ingly useful as a criterion for setting priorities as decisions are socialized andconcentrated at a collective level. This argument is more acceptable as one ignores distributional consid- erations, so that it does not matter which individuals gain additional or bet- ter years of life, and only totals or averages are considered. It is also morepersuasive, as the resources necessary to achieve those gains can be trans-ferred costlessly from one individual to another who can gain more fromtheir use. It is therefore more acceptable, as there is a single agency makingthe allocation decisions and responsible to all the potential beneficiaries\u2014asituation approximated by the health systems of some rich countries but notat all typical in poor countries. Somewhat paradoxically, then, cost-effectiveness is on firmest ground theoretically in high-income countrieswhere most health care is financed collectively, while the potential gainsfrom emphasizing cost-effective interventions are greatest in poor countrieswhere the bulk of care is paid for out of pocket. This line of argument, even if fully accepted, certainly does not mean that the cost-effectiveness of different interventions is the onlycriterion needed for choosing which of them to deliver or finance, as some public health pro-fessionals, eager to have the apparent support of economists, sometimesassume. Cost-effectiveness is one issue among several, even when the deci-sion concerns only the use of public funds and not what individuals chooseto spend out of pocket or on voluntary purchases of health insurance. Chap-ter 9 specifies no fewer than eight other criteria for public health spending,and shows how several of them are related to cost-effectiveness, sometimesbeing compatible with it and sometimes at least potentially in conflict. Inparticular, cost-effectiveness can easily be incompatible with both horizontaland vertical equity. For some interventions, especially those that are publicgoods, cost-effectiveness is an adequate criterion, whereas for those servicesthat are private and not catastrophically expensive, cost-effectiveness maynot affect priorities at all. The connections among such concepts as publicIntroduction 13 goods, externalities, equity, poverty, catastrophic cost, and the proper role of insurance elaborate on some of the arguments in chapter 2. The logic ofchapter 9 has been accepted and used in several other instances, including ananalysis of the appropriate public sector role in mental health interventions(Beeharry et al .2002; World Health Organization 2000). Nonetheless, the paper has also fueled continuing controversy about the legitimacy of cost-effectiveness analysis and in particular about whether cost-benefit analysisshould always be used instead (Jack 2000; Musgrove 2000). Beliefs and evidence about malnutrition. There was a widespread suspicion in Brazil in the 1970s and early 1980s that poor consumers were paying morefor basic foodstuffs than better-off purchasers, and therefore needed a subsidyto prevent their being even worse off than they would be just because of lowincomes. While this may have been true formerly, by the time of the studyreported in chapter 14, food markets in the northeast of the country, wherepoverty is concentrated, were sufficiently competitive that the poor did notsystematically pay more for their food. It also turned out that a governmentfood subsidy program, based in part on the assumption of prices being higherfor the poor, was not very successful at transferring the full amount of thesubsidy to the intended beneficiaries. Policies and programs that are based onincorrect beliefs are less effective than they were intended to be. Chapter 15 goes beyond the analysis of costs and prices and into cost- effectiveness, to judge whether four different food and nutrition programsin Brazil made any difference to the growth of young children who were theintended beneficiaries. The analysis is based on a number of detailed evalu-ations of one or more of the programs, conducted by Brazilian researchers.Comparisons among the programs emphasize the variability of outcomes\u2014some children benefited and some did not, and many variables affected theresult\u2014and make it clear that malnutrition is due not only to poverty butalso to illness and ignorance, so that programs need to address those causesas well. As in the case of tobacco, overly simple assumptions about con-sumer rationality do not hold up well; it is evident that the people who aresupposed to benefit do not always behave as program designers expect.Arguments over which foods people would or should eat, and over whetherthey needed any assistance other than lower prices to improve their diets and their health, were sometimes quite ideological and based on little evi-dence (Castro 1985; Musgrove 1986). Despite these limitations, there were many Brazilian studies that actually measured outcomes. This situation is, alas, quite unusual: In 18 other Latin14 Health Economics in Development American countries, there were many food and nutrition programs in the 1980s but almost no evaluations of results (Musgrove 1993). The availabledata counted heads (of beneficiaries, or of malnourished children), moneyspent, and calories or protein distributed, but notwho consumed the food or whether it made a difference to physical growth or other aspects ofhealth. The amount being spent on the programs might have sufficed toeliminate most malnutrition, if it were better used. However, almost noth-ing can be concluded about which programs worked best, or how muchmalnutrition was being prevented or cured Chapter 16 draws on cost-effectiveness analysis to justify fortification of basic foodstuffs with the three best-studied micronutrients: iron, iodine,and vitamin A. Relatively straightforward economic analysis does not pro-vide any argument against the use of fortification to reach all of the popu-lation that suffers, or is at risk of, micronutrient deficiencies andthat consumes purchased foods. (Households or communities that raise most oftheir own food are of course harder to reach in this way.) In particular, it ishard to see any reason to consider fortification less natural or less sustain-able than other approaches to increasing micronutrient intake, such as pro-moting household gardens or otherwise changing what people eat. T akentogether, the chapters on actual and potential food policies and programstell a frustrating story\u2014what is actually accomplished in improving childhealth seems to fall far short of the potential that has been well establishedby research (Allen and Gillespie 2001). The research reported in chapters 14 through 17 mostly occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which may give the impression that these mattersare of no more than historical interest. However, recent increases in knowl-edge and changes in consumer behavior contribute to keeping some of theseissues very much alive. For one thing, it appears increasingly that much con-ventional wisdom about diet, often codified into official advice, is seriouslywrong (Willett and Stampfer 2003). Fat is not necessarily so bad for one'shealth, nor carbohydrates always so beneficial, as has been assumed; and iteven appears that alcohol, while quite dangerous in excess, is so protectiveagainst heart disease that many adults would be better off drinking moder-ately than not at all (Klatsky 2003). And so far as growth is concerned, scarcityof protein is apparently more of a limitation than inadequacy of calories.Chapter 17 uses information from two surveys in China and a comparisonamong 41 populations for males and 33 populations for females, to show thatavailability of protein in the diet is strongly associated with adult heights, andsometimes with adult weights, while caloric availability is much less closelyrelated to height or even to weight. Since growth in height is usuallyIntroduction 15 completed in adolescence, and seems to be strongly related to experience in the first few years of life; and since the data are aggregates rather than refer-ring to individuals, it is \"astounding\" (Wray 2003) to find a clear associationwith current average food intake. This association is always found for males but not always for females; women do not, in many cultures, share equally inwhat protein is available, and when more protein is consumed on average, itappears that men account for most of the extra consumption. It is a matter ofcontinuing controversy whether the result is due to protein alone or whethervarious micronutrients, found particularly in foods of animal origin that pro-vide the highest quality protein also affect attained height. In any case, thecomposition of the diet, and not simply its energy content, appears crucial. What is not in doubt is that underweight, short stature and micronutri- ent deficiencies together account for a large share, probably at least one-third, of the burden of disease in poor countries, a burden concentratedamong young children but with effects on physical and cognitive develop-ment that can last a lifetime (Mason, Musgrove and Habicht 2003). At thesame time, the definition of \"malnutrition\" is broadening beyond these tra-ditional measures of deficiency, to include anthropometric states and healthconditions associated with excess. In rich countries such as the UnitedStates, and even in middle-income Brazil, overweight children nowoutnumber those who are underweight, and obesity among adults is epi-demic. Meanwhile, programs aimed at feeding poor children continue tooperate on the assumption that they eat too little rather than too much(Besharov 2002). It is also clear now that markets can change people's eat-ing habits thoroughly and rapidly, in contrast to the assumption in chapters15 and 16 that such changes would be sluggish. Governments may need toplay a major role in changing habits created or accelerated by the market,and not just traditional eating patterns, to ensure good nutrition. Paying for Health Paying for or \"financing\" health care can be thought of as consisting of three subfunctions: funding, or collecting revenues; pooling them so as to share risks among individuals and households; and using them for purchasing health- related goods and services (World Health Organization 2000, chapter 5).This distinction collapses in the case of out-of-pocket payments, becausethey are not pooled across households. The act of purchasing coincides withand determines, ex post, the corresponding amount of funding. All financingthat is not out of pocket constitutes some form of prepayment, which includes16 Health Economics in Development all three subfunctions. Chapters 18 through 20 deal with only the first two subfunctions: funding and pooling. Purchasing involves decisions on whatgoods or services to buy, whom to buy them from, and how to pay theproviders. Some of the issues involved are treated in chapter 9. Funding, pooling, and purchasing are often described as if they followed a temporal as well as a logical sequence\u2014funds are first collected, then allottedto one or more pools, and finally spent from those pools under various pur-chasing arrangements. This is a useful way to think of the flowof funds, which have to be collected somehow in order to go into a pool, but it does notalways describe the decisions about those funds. For general revenue or \"tax- based\" financing, which can be considered implicit insurance because risks are shared among beneficiaries but there is no defined premium and there maybe no defined benefits, a government first collects taxes and then determineswhat share of revenues to allocate to health. For any kind of explicit insurance , whether private or quasi-public (such as social security contributions), thecausal relation is actually the other way around. The definition of the pooldetermines the nature of the funding and the way it is collected. Funds arecollected\u2014voluntarily or involuntarily\u2014only because the pool exists, and thevolume of funds is the product of the premium or mandatory contributionand the number of contributing members (or the sum of such products, if dif-ferent insured members pay different premiums or contributions). Decisionsthat governments take affecting explicit insurance are in the first instancedecisions about pooling, with funding as the consequence. The argument for government to be involved in health financing turns on two facts. First, health needs are often unpredictable and can imply cat-astrophically high costs for individuals and households: hence the need forinsurance rather than relying solely on payment out of pocket at themoment of need. Second, health insurance does not work like insurance fornonhuman assets, because the need for financial protection bears no rela-tion to anyone's capacity to pay. Hence the need not only for subsidies ortransfers from the healthy to the sick, parallel to transfers from the lucky tothe unlucky in other forms of insurance, but also from the better-off to theworse-off. Pooling of funds is crucial, since it allows for sharing risks andtherefore for the first kind of subsidy. Whether it also promotes the secondkind depends on who belongs to which pool(s), how much revenue goesinto the pool(s), and how the contributions to that revenue are distributedamong the insured. Government decisions about health financing thereforetypically are joint decisions affecting the sources of revenue and the num-ber, size, and composition of pools and the relations among them. Prepayment Out of Pocket Implicit Explicit (via taxes) (via Insurance) General Health Quasi-Public Private Revenue Specific (via Social Insurance) External Assistance Other \"Sin Taxes\" Job-Related Voluntary Allocation of Allocation of Public Budgets Household BudgetsIntroduction 17 Figure I.1 illustrates some of the major choices about funding, starting with the fundamental distinction between prepayment and out-of-pocketspending, and continuing through different kinds of taxes and insurancearrangements to consider how these choices affect both governmentbudgets and those of households (Musgrove 2001). At each stage in thefigure, there are choices to be made about using particular taxes or socialsecurity schemes and promoting or inhibiting one or more forms of pri-vate insurance. Several of the issues related to these choices are not spe-cific to health, since they concern the structure of a tax system and its relation to private sources of finance. What looks at first glance like a goodway to raise resources for health may be quite ineffectual, or inequitable,when the entire financing system is considered. There is considerablena\u00efvet\u00e9 on this point in the typical Ministry of Health, so it is worthwhileto create a better understanding of financing issues generally, rather thanconcentrating only on the size of the public budget or on particular taxesor other funds that are dedicated to health. Here, economic analysis canmake a contribution that is independent of the specific epidemiological ormedical issues considered in most other chapters. Partly for that reason, itmay be easier to reach understanding between economists, whose specialtythis is, and public health professionals.Figure I.1 Decision Flowchart, Sources of Health Financing18 Health Economics in Development Who pays for health care. Chapter 18 examines the pattern of household spending on health in Latin America three decades ago, using purely eco-nomic data that said nothing about health conditions or needs. The funda-mental characteristic of the health systems generating the observed expendi-tures is that public and private health care facilities competed mostly on price,not on quality. As a result, consumers bought private care, which was moreexpensive but\u2014at least in their opinion\u2014better than subsidized public careas soon as they could afford it, leading to a very high elasticity of expenditurewith respect to income. This effect was far from uniform, however; spendingon drugs tended to rise quickly and then level off, whereas private hospitalcosts continued rising with income. This situation reflects the prevalence ofself-medication among the poor and the fact that people often have to pay fordrugs even if consultations are free or covered by insurance. T reating oneinput to medical care differently from the others makes little economic senseand merely exploits people's often desperate willingness to pay for medicines.(If what a patient needs are 15 minutes with a nurse or doctor and a bottle ofpills, there is likely to be little gain from 30 minutes and no pills, or from noprofessional diagnosis or advice and two bottles of pills.) There is now muchmore information available about families' health spending, from householdsurveys that also ask about episodes of illness and care-seeking behavior; theanalysis in chapter 4 is based partly on an early example of such surveys.However, some of the most undesirable features of health financing in poorcountries continue largely unchanged. Except for inexpensive care that presents no serious financial burden to the consumer, out-of-pocket spending is without doubt the worst way topay for health services. Almost any form of prepayment is preferable. Chap-ter 19 looks at how health was actually financed in the mid- to late 1990s,using national health accounts estimates or less reliable approximations forall 191 member states of the World Health Organization. The strongest andmost disturbing conclusion from that analysis is that out-of-pocket spend-ing is relatively highest in precisely the poorest countries where people mostneed financial protection. Public spending is often only a small share of thetotal, and private prepayment is nearly nonexistent. Most spending directlyby families is out of pocket, and the burden often falls chiefly on the poorand on rural dwellers who have little access to publicly subsidized care.Impoverishment for health reasons\u2014because people cannot afford care andfamilies lose their livelihoods to death, illness, or injury, or because theybecome poor paying for care\u2014is a serious risk and a major impediment topoor people's acquisition of capital, whether human or material.Introduction 19 The two great failings of health finance. In static or cross-sectional terms, then, the way health is financed in poor countries is far from ideal. T oo muchspending is out of pocket, insurance of whatever sort is the privilege of thebetter off, and public health spending is often financed by dedicated taxesthat may be unstable or inequitable and that in any case may not affect totalexpenditure because other sources are withdrawn in proportion. What istrue in comparisons among countries is often true also when comparing howthe health care of different population groups is financed. Those who leastneed prepayment, because they could afford all but catastrophic care, are thebest protected, and sometimes also the best covered by public spending. Dynamically, the situation is often even worse. In an economic crisis or even a downturn in incomes, the needs for health care are likely to rise justwhen people's capacity to pay for it declines because of lost income oremployment and their financial protection weakens or disappears as they loseinsurance or social security coverage. When that happens, only public expen-diture can fill the breach\u2014but it is usually cut back also, as public revenuesfall. There is a strong argument for public spending on health to be counter-cyclical, an argument first made in 1984 (Musgrove 1984). Chapter 20develops that argument and supports it with Latin American data on healthexpenditure and economic variables. A counter-cyclical health policy wouldof course require that planning for health expenditure be contingent on eco-nomic circumstances, with explicit decisions to protect health in downturnsand to let private or social security spending meet more of the need in boomtimes. Such a policy would be compensatory through time, as the allocationpolicies discussed in chapter 6 are compensatory across space. That in turnwould require long-term political agreements, including decisions as towhich kinds of public spending to cut back when income and revenue fall. Nogovernment seems to have achieved such agreements\u2014the political obstaclesare daunting\u2014and the response to economic crisis is often improvised. Inthese as in many other respects, there is still great room for improvement inhealth financing policies to promote both equity and efficiency. Concluding Reflections Economic analysis can lead to or support sound decisions to improve health: chapters 11 and 13, on polio eradication and malaria control, areclear illustrations of the potential benefits. Eventually the economic analy-sis of tobacco control in chapter 3 may prove of comparable value by20 Health Economics in Development overcoming some of the conceptual barriers to such control. And it may be hoped that the findings and arguments in chapters 14 through 17 will leadto more effective efforts to combat the huge problems of different kinds ofmalnutrition in poor countries. The contribution of health economics todevelopment is potentially even broader than such instances suggest. Eco-nomic analysis, properly applied, can often help to clarify what the choicesare for health policy, how to choose among different criteria, how to decidewhat to buy and how to pay for it, and how to evaluate the results. The indi-rect effects of good economic thinking, when dealing with such questionsas the best use of taxes, insurance, and out-of-pocket payment, or the bestway for governments to intervene in health, may affect a population's healthand welfare more than decisions about how to combat particular maladiesor risk factors. If it is true that \"the ideas of economists and politicalphilosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are morepowerful than is commonly understood\" (Keynes 1965), then it is impor-tant to get those ideas right. This is especially so when the issues areincreasingly complex and when ideology and misunderstanding, althoughon the decline, are still widespread. Getting the ideas right is not easy, for those same reasons. The impor- tance and peculiarities of health insurance, and the reasons why competi-tive private markets for it are likely to produce both inequity and ineffi-ciency (Arrow 1963) are now widely understood. How to deal with thesemarket failures without falling into equally dangerous government failuresis a question still only partly settled. And while there is far more under-standing and even rapprochement among economists and public healthspecialists concerning the state and the market than there was a fewdecades ago, the right balance of roles and the right choice of instrumentscontinue to be debated, sometimes acrimoniously. Similarly, there is todaymuch more understanding than formerly of how to relate the costs ofhealth interventions to the various kinds of benefits they can yield, includ-ing their effectiveness in improving health. But controversy continues overthe legitimacy and applicability of different methods, particularly whencomparisons need to be made over different diseases or conditions, peoplewith different health or economic prospects or cultural views, orcompletely different kinds of beneficial or harmful outcomes. Several ofthe chapters here try to develop better answers to these questions, or toprovide persuasive counter-arguments to some wrong answers and mis-taken views. The reader may judge how well this has been accomplished,and perhaps learn a little more about both the meanings of health eco-nomics in development.

Acknowledgments I must thank Bertoldo Kruse for inviting these reflections. Many colleagues and friends have contributed to these ideas, particularly those associatedwith the World Bank's Flagship Course in Health Reform. None of thembears any responsibility for what is said here. Why Do Doctors Need to Know AnyHealth Economics? The answer to this question is not obvious: after all, when a physician is actually practicing medicine there seems to be no room or need for eco-nomic understanding. In fact, it might get in the way, when what the doc-tor wants is to concentrate on the patient before him or her and bring tobear all his or her medical knowledge, which is typically much moredetailed\u2014and certainly more important at the moment of diagnosis ortreatment\u2014than what an economist typically knows or thinks about. Anddoctors have been treating patients, well or badly, for centuries withouttroubling themselves with economic concerns. Economics perhaps has no place in the surgery, the consulting room or the laboratory, but that is not what matters. In each of those settings,resources are being used and a production process is under way, supposedlyfor the benefit of a consumer\u2014and the use of limited resources to produce Reprinted, with permission, from Revista Brasileira de Sa\u00fade Materno-Infantil 1 (2), May-August 2001, (Recife, Brazil).24 Health Economics in Development goods and services for intermediate or ultimate consumers is what econom- ics is primarily about. How those resources are themselves produced, howthey are combined, who chooses what to produce with them, who will payfor them, and what all that costs, create the setting in which the physicianoperates. Almost everything that happens prior to the encounter betweenthe physician and the patient is relevant to the economist, even if the latteris kept outside of the medical practice itself. If there is something the doc-tor ought to know of health economics, it concerns those prior steps,including many of the factors that bring the patient to his or her attentionin the first place. There are at least three reasons why a physician might disregard this argument and suppose that economics has nothing useful to offer his or herprofession. One is the fact that health economics is a relatively new sub-discipline. The seminal article explaining some of the subtleties that distin-guish health from other sectors, particularly in relation to how it is financed,was published only in 1963 [1]. That opened the whole field of inquiry intorisks and information that characterize health economics today and that hasbecome steadily more important as more and more of health care isfinanced by insurance and the costs of it have risen. The Journal of Health Economics , the first publication devoted entirely to the subject, began to publish only in 1982; by now there is an entire two-volume Handbook of Health Economics [2] and a number of journals that publish on the subject. Economists are quick to \"invade\" fields they find interesting, and the prac-titioners of those subjects may take time to notice that they have become ofeconomic interest. A second reason is the mistaken supposition that economics is nothing more than accounting, and while accounts must be kept in medical practiceas in other professions, the logic of the accounting is no different and theaccountant has no special insights to offer. Much of economics does in factdepend on proper accounting: the creation of national accounts of incomeand product, starting more than a half-century ago, is the precursor oftoday's effort to create national health accounts [3] to show where the fundsspent on health come from and where they go. But the interpretation ofthose flows does not follow only from their magnitude, but from economictheory about how doctors, patients, and financing agencies behave. A third, even more mistaken reason, is summarized in the attitude that \"health is not a business\", or should not be one. Some doctors, and publichealth professionals in particular, often find it hard to accept that healthcare is financed, produced and delivered in a constellation of markets\u2014asWhat Is the Minimum a Doctor Should Know 25 though markets or \"business\" were intrinsically inimical to human health. This argument usually rests on the claim that health care is a basic right ora basic need, and therefore too important to be left to markets. But food,which is a much more basic necessity than health care, is produced anddelivered in markets, and there is nothing wrong with that. The question,in the case of health care, is whether those markets work in socially desir-able ways, or whether they lead to situations in which some people cannotafford needed care, or the wrong kinds of care are produced, or at too higha cost, or something else goes wrong. Economics is, to a large extent, thescience of how markets operate, so it is extremely relevant to markets inwhich failure may be a matter of life and death. What Economics Does a Doctor Not Need to Know? So it might be helpful for medical professionals to understand some eco- nomics, as it applies to medicine and health. Does that mean they need tocomprehend all of economics, or would it be safe to ignore large areas ofthe subject? Fortunately, there is much that a doctor does not need to know,starting with the specific economic issues that arise in sectors very differentfrom health. The frequent (and frequently loose) use of the adjective\"social\" to describe some sectors of the economy might suggest that med-ical professionals wanting to understand health economics need to knowsomething about the economics of related sectors such as education. Fortu-nately, this is not the case: in economic terms these fields are much moredifferent than they are alike [4], and although similar issues arise in both [5],it is more confusing than helpful to think of a general economics of \"thesocial sector\". The peculiarities of health economics mean that a doctorwanting to learn something about it need not try to understand the eco-nomics of any other sector in detail. Currently there is great interest in what might be called \"the macroeco- nomics of health\", and a Commission on Macroeconomics and Health [6]has been created to study particularly the question of whether better popu-lation health contributes to economic growth, making health even more ofa paying investment than it has traditionally been considered from an indi-vidual's perspective [7]. That is an interesting question, but health does notneed to be subordinated to income or growth in order to be regarded asvitally important. (It is even dangerous to justify health investments byappealing to their effect on economic outcomes, since such investments26 Health Economics in Development may pay off best for young adults and thereby lead to discrimination against the very young and the very old.) And even if there is a strong connection,it does not mean that medical professionals need to know anything aboutmacroeconomic theory in order to learn something useful for their ownfield. All that a doctor should know is that there are good macroeconomicpolicies and bad ones, that inflationary populism is a very bad policy andthat poor macroeconomic management is bad for a country's health, partic-ularly the health of poor people. Much of the criticism directed at \"struc-tural adjustment\" and its supposed damaging effects on health really shouldbe directed at the economic irresponsibility that sometimes made suchadjustment necessary in the first place [8]. Of course, what economists think they know is often a mixture of what they know and what they only think, including their more ideological posi-tions and beliefs. (The same is true of public health specialists, to be sure.)One reason that doctors are reluctant to learn more economics is that theyreject some views as ideological\u2014sometimes with good reason, sometimesmistakenly. For example, the claim by economists that most of the time,markets are an efficient mechanism for allocating resources to productionand consumption may sound like ideology, but it is actually a strong empir-ical proposition. The history of efforts to control prices, dictate productionor otherwise interfere with the normal working of markets, including par-ticularly the sad history of Soviet-style economic management, offers abun-dant evidence. However, the claim by some economists that all markets arebasically alike, and that in particular markets work just as well in health careas anywhere else, is not well supported either theoretically or empiricallybut includes a large dose of ideology. One needs to understand how marketswork, without being taken in by \"the mystique of markets\" [9]. Doctors who have never talked much with economists\u2014or who have had the misfortune to talk only to mediocre economists\u2014often think that econ-omists care only about efficiency and not at all about equity, equality, rights,or the suffering of the sick and the dispossessed. It is certainly true that ineconomic theory, it is easier to agree on what constitutes or leads to effi-ciency than to agree about equity; and it is also true that inefficiency meanswaste, which means less of something desirable for someone. But economicthought also includes a long and deep tradition of thinking about ethicalissues, about what constitutes a just society, about rights and entitlements[10] and about the possible conflicts between equity and efficiency and thefrequent necessity for choices among societal objectives [11]. Even for sucha relatively narrow question as what health interventions to purchase withWhat Is the Minimum a Doctor Should Know 27 public money, there are no fewer than nine relevant criteria, of which at least three concern equity rather than efficiency [12]. The conclusion todraw from all this is that a doctor wanting or needing to learn some eco-nomics does not have to abandon his or her ethical principles or politicalviews. What he or she should be prepared to do is to question those princi-ples and views in the light of economics and see how well they hold up. Eco-nomic thinking can help to identify contradictions or poorly formulatedopinions. It does not impose a set of ethical or political suppositions or pref-erences. (In fact, the economics of consumer behavior starts with anunquestioned respect for preferences.) Understanding How Economists Think More than knowing any particular conclusion of economics, a doctor needs to understand the way that economists think: incomprehension andconflict arise more from differences in the way the two professionsapproach questions, than from the specific answers to those questions. Aneconomist does not, contrary to popular superstition, think only or pri-marily about money, even if he or she often tries to find monetary equiv-alents of other measures. Economists think about resources , and particu- larly about whether those resources have prices and if so, whether they are the right prices to assure efficiency or equity. Since resources have costs, whether those are recognized or not, economists want to know if the useof those resources produces effects (non-monetary) or benefits (usually monetized) sufficient to justify how they are used. Much work in econom-ics is devoted to comparisons among these concepts, under the names ofcost-effectiveness analysis , cost-utility analysis or cost-benefit analysis [13]. It is important for doctors to understand that while costs are the specialty ofeconomists, the definition and estimation of effects or outcomes is theprovince of medical professionals: these analyses have to be joint efforts.Given an estimate of an effect (deaths averted, for example), economistsoften then go on to try to put a monetary value on the result, and suchefforts can be questioned and rejected. What a doctor needs to understandis that while any particular kind of effect can be related to costs withoutmonetizing the effect, there is no common currency besides money inwhich to compare different kinds of effects (health outcomes versus edu-cation, say), and that to avoid monetary valuations is to abstain from allsuch cross-sectoral comparisons.28 Health Economics in Development As mentioned earlier, economists naturally think about markets, ideally without any prior assumptions about how well they work. T o reject the ideaof markets because some market outcomes are inefficient or inequitable orboth, is to miss one of the main ideas that economists always carry withthem. But markets are not simply theaters in which two characters called\"supply\" and \"demand\" interact, important as those two concepts are. Mar-kets are places where people interact, in many different roles, as payers,investors, providers, patients, consumers and citizens; so economists con-centrate on the behavior that occurs in markets, and in particular on the incentives that people face to behave one way or another. It is true that econ- omists tend to talk mostly about financial or economic incentives, becausethey understand those best. That does not mean that other incentives\u2014thedesire to help others, professional pride, and so on\u2014do not matter, onlythat economic analysis starts by taking those for granted, and then asks whathappens to behavior when prices, means of payment, regulations or otherincentives are modified. Particularly in the health sector, the economicincentives are often perverse, acting contrary to the desired outcomes, so itis crucial to analyze them and correct them if possible. In considering the incentives and regulations to behave one way or another, economists have to assume that behavior is not simply a collectionof responses to random impulses, but that people have some set of goals orobjective function, that they are trying to get the most (or the least) ofsomething out of their actions. It makes a difference, sometimes a great dif-ference, what those objectives are. For example, a producer of a good orservice will behave differently, depending on whether he or she aims tomaximize profits, to maximize revenue, to assure a particular level ofincome, to capture a particular share of a market, to minimize risk, or toproduce the highest possible quality of output. Since objectives are notalways stated, and may not even be clearly known to the agent whose behav-ior is of interest, there is necessarily some speculation involved, and theconfrontation of different assumptions with observed behavior. In thisrespect, economics has much more in common with psychology than withaccounting or engineering. Incentives, to be effective, have to work on peo-ple's objectives; misunderstanding what they want or are trying to do canlead to perverse incentives and unwanted outcomes. Finally, economists pay much attention to who has, and who needs, how much and what kind of information . People make all kinds of decisions based on the information they have (or think they have), and entire markets canwork badly when information is incomplete (no one knows) or asymmetricWhat Is the Minimum a Doctor Should Know 29 (buyers know more than sellers, or vice versa), particularly if revealing information would damage the interests of the person who has it. Ignoranceis obviously dangerous in the face of an epidemic, or for a person who facesa risk but is unaware of it or does not respond to information about it.Smoking is a marked example of this danger [14, especially chapters 7 and8]. Some kinds of information lend themselves to accounting and standard-ized reporting (the basis of national health accounts and of much of epi-demiology), but others do not, because they concern only individual actorsor are costly to collect or interpret. Medical professionals also recognize theimportance of information for detection, diagnosis, treatment and evalua-tion. What economic thinking adds is the emphasis on how information orthe lack of it influences behavior, with economically important conse-quences [15]. Important Specifics of Health Economics First, health is a very peculiar asset because unlike almost anything else, including even some other forms of human capital, it is almost entirelyinalienable. One can donate blood or even a kidney to improve someoneelse's health, but \"health\" itself cannot be transferred, and one must havesome state of health, however poor. Since health is subject to many randomshocks of illness or accident, and since health care can be catastrophicallycostly, one needs insurance against financial risk as well as the protectionagainst physical risks provided by good nutrition, exercise and a range ofpublic health measures such as sanitation and immunization. But the char-acter of health makes it harder to insure than other assets, especially sincethe value of one's health and the financial risk are not correlated with one'scapacity to pay. Thus one of the principal obstacles to making a health sys-tem work properly, is the difficulty of financing it so as to provide a reason-able and affordable degree of protection to everyone, without creatingincentives either to do without such protection or to over-use medical carebecause the cost is borne by others\u2014and while assuring that subsidies flowin the desirable directions. This difficulty is independent of the amountspent on health. The emphasis on financing in discussions of health economics is entirely justified, then; but a doctor also needs to understand that there are threeparts to it. It matters not only how health is funded , that is, who pays for it and through what mechanisms (taxes, social security, voluntary insurance,30 Health Economics in Development charity, out of pocket payments) but also whether and how those funds are pooled to share risks among population groups, and how they are then used to purchase goods and services [16, chapter 5]. Each of these stages presents its own set of questions and difficulties, often with conflicts between eco-nomic efficiency and equity or fairness. One important source of conflict is that what people want in the way of health care does not necessarily match what doctors think people need; and when needs and demands do not coincide, it is impossible for the supply of services simultaneously to satisfy both of them [17, pp. 23-24]. Several ofthe reasons why need, demand and supply do not automatically match up,go by the name of \"market failure\", meaning that while there is a workingmarket for health care, it does not reach the kind of efficient equilibriumthat a so-called perfect market would achieve. Doctors need to understandthese reasons, which include standard economic concepts such as publicgoods, externalities, information failures, and non-competitive behavior.They also need to distinguish these problems from other reasons for unsat-isfactory health outcomes which are just as important but which are not\"failures\" in the economist's sense\u2014such as poverty, and inequality of risksor of income. \"Failure\" is one word to which economists give a fairly exact meaning that may not match the commonsense notion doctors are likely to have, andit is important, as in any dialog, to develop a clear, shared vocabulary. Argu-ing over whose definition to use, or not recognizing that the same word maybe used in two meanings, is wasteful: the best example of this is the differ-ence between the economist's term \"public good\" and the medical sense of\"public health\". All public goods in health are part of public health, but theconverse is not true, and the difference matters for public policy. Purchasing, the last stage of financing health, involves two complex ques- tions: what to buy, and how to pay the providers\u2014doctors, hospitals, ven-dors of goods and services. The difference between need and want, and theenormous variation in costs of medical procedures, are crucial for the firstchoice, as is the definition of what one is trying to achieve. Maximal overallpopulation health as an objective will lead to different choices than improv-ing the health of the worst-off, or giving everyone something like the samechance to have his or her health problems resolved. And doctors need tounderstand that while the size of a health problem\u2014for example, the bur-den of disease attributed to a particular disease or condition\u2014is highly rel-evant to how much it might cost to deal with the problem, decisions aboutwhat interventions should have priority do not depend simply on theWhat Is the Minimum a Doctor Should Know 31 magnitude of the problem [18, 19]. A full evaluation of a health system draws on many different kinds of information [20]; some ways of using orcombining different kinds of data are useful or legitimate, and some are not. Incentives are crucially important to the second question, and deciding on the best way to pay providers is greatly complicated by a feature that ispeculiar to health care\u2014the practice of referral from one level or type offacility or professional to another. There does not seem to be one ideal wayto pay all the different providers involved in a system, so a doctor needs tounderstand the virtues and deficiencies of different payment systems (fee-for-service, global budget, per bed-day, for diagnostic-related groups, andso on) and how they interact. Aligning incentives and creating a good insti-tutional environment is most important for hospitals, the most complexorganizations in the health system [16, chapter 3]. How to pay, as opposed to how much to pay, is an example of the impor- tance of institutions and regulations in health economics: it is not a matterof costs, in the first instance, but it may have a large impact on both costsand health outcomes. More generally, doctors need to know that much ofhealth economics is concerned with the rules of the game and not simplywith the flows of money, goods and services. One particular issue of this sortis that of the right degree of autonomy for individual doctors and for theorganizations in which they work and the organizations which purchasetheir services\u2014which are not the same, when there is a \"purchaser-providersplit\" between funding and purchasing agencies, and the producers of med-ical services. T oo little autonomy, too much dictation from above or outside,is practically a guarantee of waste; too much freedom may be an invitationto abuse, low quality or excessive costs. As with many other issues, econom-ics does not provide final answers, but it does offer a way of thinking aboutthem that can facilitate better decisions and ultimately better outcomes. Gains From Better Understanding Suppose a medical professional accepts the need to understand some health economics, perhaps including the specific ideas just discussed. What can heor she hope to gain thereby? What is the likely pay-off for the effort involvedin learning some new vocabulary, accepting new and different viewpoints,and possibly having to give up or modify some cherished ideas? The mostobvious benefit is that it becomes easier to talk with economists, when onecannot avoid doing so\u2014and as decisions about health care come to depend32 Health Economics in Development more and more on economic considerations, it becomes harder to keep econ- omists out of the discussion. Doctors sometimes fear being crowded out ofdecisions over which historically they had full control. Perhaps the best wayto assure that their knowledge and views continue to be respected is to learnsomething about the knowledge and views of the newcomers to the other sideof the table. Reducing the level of incomprehension and antagonism thatoften characterizes such encounters at first, is worth some trouble. Ideally, better mutual understanding between medical professionals and economists will actually improve the efficiency of health care, and maybeeven its equity. By examining their own behavior and responses to incen-tives in the light of economics, doctors may see ways to be more effectiveor less wasteful of resources; and they should be better prepared to accept,and influence, reforms to how they work and how they are paid. There isnothing guaranteed, or easy, about reform processes in health, but theyseem sure to work better when all involved have at least some knowledge ofall the relevant factors. For society as a whole, a better working health sys-tem is clearly the greatest potential gain from a fuller understandingbetween the two professions. Finally, at least for some medical professionals there can be a purely sci- entific or intellectual pleasure in exploring the thinking of another profes-sion and thereby seeing one's own profession differently. Of course, this canlead to frustration, because the new ideas may be hard to put into practiceand can lead to friction with one's own colleagues. This is especially likelywhen techniques of economic evaluation are stretched too far or their resultsconflict too strongly with perceived political imperatives [20, pp. 12-17].But such stretching and conflict are often a necessary part of learning, andmay ultimately be the basis for different political imperatives and reformopportunities.

Why the Public Role in Health Care Matters Health care in about 1990 cost at least $1.7 trillion, or about 8 percent of world income [Murray, Govindaraj and Musgrove 1994], making it one ofthe largest industries in the global economy. On average, 60 percent of thisis public spending. If this spending is excessive or otherwise inappropriate,the consequences for the economy and for health outcomes could be sub-stantial. Governments also provide a large share of health services, some-times as large as the share in spending, and often intervene in various waysin the private health care market. Since most health care is a private good,it is surprising that so much of it is provided, financed or regulated by the Excerpted, with permission, from Public and private roles in health: Theory and financing patterns . World Bank Discussion Paper No. 339, 1996.36 Health Economics in Development state. In contrast to what happens in many other sectors of the economy, this substantial public role is most pronounced in high income countries whichare generally very market-oriented; the state usually finances a smaller shareof health care in poorer countries. Does this pattern provide models for thefuture development of the health sector and the public role in it, for low-income countries? And is the variation among countries in the amount andkind of public intervention associated with differences in people's health, inwhat is spent on health care or in how well health systems function? Besides consuming large resources, many health systems are regarded as inefficient or inequitable or both; they are often described as in \"crisis\", asneeding \"reform\", or as having \"failed\". Are the supposed failures of healthsystems real? If so, they might be caused by misguided public intervention,so they could be corrected by a smaller or different public role and a greaterreliance on private markets. Or governments might intervene for soundreasons, to correct or compensate for failings in those markets; that is, out-comes would be even worse if left entirely to the private sector. Is there anappropriate frontier between private and public action, and a best combi-nation of instruments for the state to use when it intervenes? These andrelated questions must be confronted in any reform effort [Aaron 1994,Cutler 1994, OECD 1994]. It is relatively simple to conclude that govern-ments should do certain things and should leave others to private activity;but often there is a variety of possible solutions and no obviously bestapproach. Theory does not always provide clear answers, and the empiricalevidence is incomplete, extremely varied and difficult to interpret. Choices for State Intervention It matters not only whether governments intervene, but also how they do it: the second essential question is what the public sector should do, given thatsome problem in the private market appears to warrant some public action.This is particularly important because government failings in the healthsector are also common, and often result from intervening in the wrongways or with the wrong instruments. There are five distinct instruments ofpublic intervention: arranged from the least to the greatest intrusion intoprivate decisions, these are to\u2014 inform, which may mean to persuade, but does not require anyone to do anything. Governments do this when they publicize the health risks ofsmoking, or include health and basic hygiene education in publicschools. These are examples of information directed at consumers, butPublic and Private Roles in Health 37 governments also inform health care providers and suppliers of health care inputs, as by conducting research and disseminating information ondisease patterns and on the effects and risks of medical procedures. regulate, which determines how a private activity may be undertaken. Governments sometimes regulate the medical profession by setting stan-dards for doctors or accrediting hospitals, although these activities mayalso be undertaken by private bodies. And government regulation iscommon in the insurance industry, in the importation of medical equip-ment, drugs and supplies and in the protection of food and water qual-ity. More generally, governments can influence private health care activ-ity in many ways, often combining regulation with some financialincentives to offset the costs [Bennett et al. 1994] but without publicfinancing. Regulation is usually pursuant to a law, and is often deter-mined by an executive or administrative body. mandate, which obligates someone to do something and (usually, though not always) to pay for it. Compliance with regulations can also implysubstantial private costs; but a mandated activity is different in that itmust be performed, whereas a private producer can react to regulation by choosing not to undertake the activity. Mandates are usually specified inlaw, which may subsequently be adumbrated by regulation. The mostimportant mandates, in financial terms, are the requirements thatemployers provide health services or insurance to their employees, orcontribute to social insurance funds for that purpose. Governments canalso impose mandates on individuals, as by requiring that children enter-ing school be immunized. finance health care with public funds. Because mandated insurance is effectively paid for by an earmarked, involuntary contribution which isequivalent to a tax, \"public\" health expenditure is commonly defined toinclude such costs along with expenditures from public budgets. Theobverse of spending public funds is to tax particular activities or goods,such as alcohol and tobacco, at least partly for health reasons. This issueis not treated here; while taxation which reduces consumption of specificgoods may have substantial health effects, it is always limited to very fewgoods and is not used systematically to promote health. Finally, the statemay\u2014 provide or deliver services, using publicly-owned facilities and civil service staff. This is what Ministries of Health in most poor countries do; so dovarious governmental bodies in many countries at all income levels.38 Health Economics in Development Once a society has decided to finance health services with public funds, the choice arises of whether to provide them through public facilities orto pay private producers to provide them. The appropriate way to con-sider this choice is as a standard \"make or buy\" decision. The issues fora government are the same as for a private firm, and turn on costs\u2014is itcheaper to produce something than to buy from an outside supplier?\u2014and on the risks and difficulties of enforcing contracts and avoiding fraudwhen dealing with such suppliers [Coase 1988]. Because public financing requires public resources, it is perhaps the cru- cial choice about state action. However, all the instruments mentionedhave costs; even information is not free. The benefits from any interven-tion have always to be weighed against these costs. In addition, sometimestwo instruments overlap, or one requires the use of another: mandatesimply regulation, and public provision usually implies at least partial publicfinance. (User fees or even private insurance payments to public facilitiesmay cover part of the cost and could in principle cover all of it.) And twoinstruments can be alternatives: for part of the population, governmentscan either finance health care or mandate financing by employers or otherprivate institutions. Differences in ability to pay make it natural to operatemixed systems of public intervention, such as mandated coverage for thenon-poor and public finance for the poor. There are alternatives evenwithin mandated coverage, such as \"play or pay\" arrangements in whichemployers can finance health care directly for their employees or pay intoa social security scheme. A Conceptual Basis for Public and Private Roles in Health The health sector is sufficiently complicated, and the conditions of coun- tries are sufficiently different, that economic theory by itself is an inade-quate guide to where the frontier should be drawn between the privateeconomy and state action, or to which state interventions should be under-taken, and in what degree. Nonetheless, theory is essential, particularlywhere two issues are concerned. Both of these refer to market failure, or cir- cumstances in which private markets either cannot be expected to functionat all, or can be expected to yield undesirable outcomes which appropriatepublic intervention might improve on. Some such failures may occur in anysector of the economy; traditional public finance theory [Musgrave 1959]Public and Private Roles in Health 39 explains these cases and provides guidance for public action. Other possible failures arise where insurance is involved, and for reasons specific to thehealth sector, present particularly acute problems for health insurance[Arrow 1963, 1985]. Since what the health care sector provides to consumers and beneficiar- ies are specific activities or interventions, it is useful to organize a conceptual basis according to distinctions among these activities. The next section pro-vides this classification; three subsections elaborate on the peculiarities ofeach area. The three domains of health care While the activities that promote, protect or restore health are very het- erogeneous, they fall into three natural domains, corresponding to public goods, to low-cost private interventions and to catastrophically costly private goods. These domains are constructed by classifying health-related activi- ties along two dimensions, as shown in Figure 2.1: first by the degree towhich they are private or public goods, and second, by how much theycost. Both dimensions refer only to characteristics of particular activitiesor interventions themselves, not to who consumes them or pays for them. As the descriptions of the three domains indicate, private goods are sepa-rated into low-cost and high-cost, whereas all public goods constitute onedomain, regardless of their cost. The reason for this is that while the costsof public goods matter for deciding whether they should be produced, theissue of market failure related to such goods is independent of costs. Withprivate goods, in contrast, some problems of market failure occur onlywith those services costly enough to be financed by insurance; and poverty,or the inability to buy even low-cost services, is a distinct reason for pub-lic intervention. This classification of health-related activities does not reserve a place for \"merit goods\", interventions which everyone \"ought to have\". T o excludethis category is not to deny the social or political importance of views aboutwhat people \"have a right to\". The difficulty is that there is no good way todefine such goods a priori, and societies make different choices about them. Moreover, so far as these goods are supposed to justify public intervention,there are often other grounds for state financing, mandating or regulating ofthe goods or services regarded as meritorious. For example, it is widelybelieved that all children have a right to immunization, but public promotionof immunization can also be justified by the market failures involved.40 Health Economics in Development A particular intervention occupies a small space in Figure 2.1; to indicate how different interventions would be classified into the three domains,some typical health care activities are located approximately. The cost of anintervention can vary depending on many factors, such as how widespreadthe intervention is; there can also be variation in the public or private goodFigure 2.1 Three Domains of Health Care Public Public goods or large externalities Low-cost, mostly privateCatastrophically costly privateCharacter of an intervention Private22 1133 55 4466 Examples of some specific interventions 1 Immunization 2 Vector control3 Treatment of tuberculosisCost of an intervention(no upper limit) 4 Treatment of minor trauma 5 Normal obstetric care6 Surgery for cancerPublic and Private Roles in Health 41 nature of an activity. Because a health system produces a variety of inter- ventions in all three domains, it is spread widely over the space. Figure 2.1therefore does not serve to compare different systems. Public goods are goods or services such that one person's consumption does not reduce the amount available for others to consume. T ypically theseare goods from which consumers cannot be excluded: if they are madeavailable to anyone, they are available to all, at least locally or temporarily.Since people can consume such goods without having to pay for them, noone will produce them for sale to individual consumers. Therefore they willbe produced only if government (or some other source such as a charitableorganization) pays for their production. The notion of a public good is nodifferent in health than in any other sector: wherever such goods or servicesare to be available, they must be financed by government or some othernon-market alternative. Control of disease vectors and protection of food and water safety are examples of (nearly) pure public goods in health. Individual action may beineffective (if one's neighbor's house harbors rats or mosquitoes), costly(water purification) or virtually impossible (testing for food safety). Mostactivities in this category are preventive, but some curative actions are alsopartly public. And not all preventive interventions are public goods. Forexample, at low levels of coverage immunization confers some public goodbenefits\u2014because the immunization of part of the population reduces thelikelihood that un-immunized people will become infected\u2014but it still pro-duces mostly private benefit for the immunized individuals. However, asimmunization coverage approaches 100 percent, the benefit becomes moreand more public through the mechanism of \"herd immunity\": a lone un-immunized individual would be just as well protected as if he had beenimmunized, and could enjoy this protection without paying for it. Whenthe disease can be eradicated by complete immunization coverage, a pure public good is created. This is an example of how the public or privatenature of an intervention may depend on the degree of coverage. Whensmallpox was endemic, individuals had a strong incentive to be vaccinated,without regard for how many other people were also protected. Now thatthe disease has been eliminated, everyone benefits. While the distinction between public and private goods is crucial, it does not by itself define the appropriate boundary between private and stateaction. Moreover, the boundary between public and private goods is notsharply defined, because some interventions provide substantial externalities. (Figure 2.1 treats such interventions as partly public and partly private,rather than locating them in a separate domain.) In these cases, individuals42 Health Economics in Development can and do buy an intervention and benefit from it, but they cannot prevent non-consumers from also deriving some benefit. Because the purchasers donot capture all the benefit, they may be unwilling to pay for all of it: in con-sequence, private markets can exist but will produce less of these interven-tions than would be optimal for society as a whole. This problem arises most readily with communicable diseases, because the infected person puts others at risk. Curing one case therefore alsoprevents others. T uberculosis control is a clear example: no victim of tuber-culosis is likely to ignore the disease, so there is no problem of peopleundervaluing the private benefits of treatment. Rather, the cost oftreatment\u2014and the fact that they may feel better even though the diseasehas not been cured\u2014may lead people to abandon treatment prematurely,with bad consequences not only for themselves but for others. The rest ofsociety therefore has an interest in treating those with tuberculosis, andassuming at least part of the cost. Asymptomatic communicable diseases,such as some sexually transmitted infections, also create externalities; butbecause people may not realize they are infected, the demand for care is toolow even when care is free (zero price). There is then an argument not onlyfor subsidizing treatment, but for persuading those infected to seek care. Most health care, however, is a (nearly) pure private good: Figure 2.1 reflects this by showing public goods as only a narrow band at the left-handside, with private goods occupying most of the space. Largely or exclusivelyprivate activities include most curative care\u2014especially for non-communi-cable diseases which pose no threat to others\u2014and all rehabilitative care,and also some preventive or \"pre-curative\" care (such as well-baby visits,and screening for hypertension, cervical cancer, or glaucoma). They includehome treatment, using health-specific purchased inputs, as well as medicalor other professional care. This area shades into the myriad activities ofdaily behavior which also affect health, such as diet, exercise, safety pre-cautions, sexual behavior, and the use of alcohol, tobacco or drugs. Amongthese activities, child-rearing is of crucial importance, both for the imme-diate effect on health\u2014young children are especially vulnerable to infectionsand accidents\u2014and for the formation of life-long habits. The health effectsof these behaviors are usually small on a daily or episodic basis, but can bevery large cumulatively. Figure 2.1 distinguishes among private interventions according as they are cheap or costly. This is not a sharp boundary, because what is affordablefor some people is out of reach for others. And activities which are individ-ually not very expensive may have to be repeated often, creating largePublic and Private Roles in Health 43 cumulative expenditures: renal dialysis and physical therapy are examples. Nonetheless it is crucial to distinguish interventions according to whetherthey can be paid for out-of-pocket, or financed from accumulated savings,or are so expensive as to represent a catastrophic burden. The cost of med-ical care is catastrophic if a family or individual can meet it only by sellingassets, or taking on debt, to such an extent as to leave it permanently poor.As indicated above, it is initially assumed that no one is too poor to pay forinterventions in the \"low-cost\" domain. In any health system there is always some private out-of-pocket spend- ing, corresponding to the band along the bottom of Figure 2.1. Before themodern understanding of disease and medicine, all health interventions were of this kind, and were paid for by consumers or by charity. Historically,health expenditure began in the lower right corner of the Figure and hasexpanded into public goods (to the left) and also into very costly privateinterventions (toward the upper right) as knowledge, wealth and institu-tional capacity have increased. While this pattern is general, countries havefollowed different paths in the expansion. Interventions which are needed unpredictably, because disease strikes randomly, and are also too costly for households' ordinary budgets or sav-ings to finance, define the domain of catastrophically expensive care. Theonly way to deal with the combination of high cost and uncertainty aboutneeds is by risk-sharing, in which people finance health care collectively bycontributions which are related to the expected expense in the group butnot to any individual's (unknown) likely consumption of care. Although the boundaries are blurred, the domain of risk-sharing is con- ceptually quite distinct from the other two. It normally does not extend intothe many routine low-cost, health-related activities, because risk is unim-portant there. (It is true that famine relief and other responses to unfore-seen disasters amount to sharing the risk of inadequate food or other dailyneeds, but under normal circumstances it is impossible to buy food insur-ance.) And explicit insurance\u2014a contract between the consumer who agrees to contribute, and someone else who agrees to pay for specified care\u2014issimply not feasible for public goods. Of course, when the government or aprivate charity pays for public goods, it assumes the financial risk. This canbe thought of as implicit insurance, and in this sense all publicly-financed health care is a form of insurance, even if there is no explicit contract andno payment of individual claims. Risk-sharing presents the most numerous and complex issues for public policy. The growth in total health care costs is concentrated in this domain44 Health Economics in Development because it includes the catastrophically expensive activities. It also shows the greatest variety of institutional arrangements, including substantial partici-pation by private but non-profit providers and financing institutions [Frankand Salkever 1994]. The reason is that while insurance is the natural solu-tion to the risk of needing costly interventions, private insurance marketstend to fail in ways that affect both efficiency and equity, and different insti-tutions represent different partial solutions to those failures. These prob-lems are quite distinct from the inability of markets to deliver public goodsor to assure the right level of production of goods with significant external-ities. The question is how and how far governments can and should try tocorrect for the failings of the insurance market, and whether public financeis necessary or whether other instruments can be substituted for it. Becauseneither economic theory nor common sense provides as much of an answeras in the domains of public goods and low-cost interventions [Diamond1992, Zeckhauser 1994], judgments in the domain of risk-sharing are moretentative and depend more on empirical information. Intervention for public goods in health . By definition, public goods cannot be sold in private markets and so create a straightforward justification for col-lective action. However, the good or service also must be worth therequired public expenditure: simply being a public good is an insufficientcondition for state intervention. T o take an extreme example, erecting giantfans to blow away polluted air would provide a public good, but wouldalmost surely cost too much to be justified. The questions to answer thenare, which goods are sufficiently public that private markets cannot providethem adequately? and how should they be valued to determine whether it isjustified to pay for them? As to the first question, governments usually try to provide such indis- putably public goods as disease surveillance and sanitary inspection. Theyoften err, however, by trying to cover too wide a range of interventions;Ministries of Health sometimes appear to regard all of health as a publicgood. An alternative explanation is that they regard all health care as amerit good; the belief that everyone has an unlimited or ill-defined right tofree care is sometimes enshrined in legislation or national constitutions[Fuenzalida-Puelma and Connor 1989]. When public financing is insuffi-cient to fulfill that promise, and particularly when public provision is poorlymanaged, the result is likely to be both inefficient and inequitable. Govern-ments may err in another way, by recognizing that it can be efficient for thepublic sector to supply a service\u2014the alternative being to regulate privateprovision\u2014but subsidize it when most users could pay for it. Water supplyPublic and Private Roles in Health 45 and sanitation services are good examples [World Bank 1992a]; they gener- ate large public health benefits but are nonetheless mostly private goods forwhich non-poor consumers are willing to pay. Still, the state is not always wrong when it treats a largely private good as if it were entirely public. The most striking example is immunization.Had it been left to private markets during the last few decades, it is incon-ceivable that today some 80 percent of the world's children would beimmunized against the six major vaccine-preventable childhood diseases[Geoffard and Philipson 1994]. T reating the Expanded Program of Immu-nization as a public good made possible high coverage even in very poorcountries [EPI 1993]\u2014often higher than in the United States, which hasrelied more on private finance and provision [EPI 1995, Haveman andWolfe 1993]. This \"mistake\" doubtless imposed some costs, in the form ofpublic expenditure which was unnecessary because some people would havepaid for immunization privately, and in the distortions caused by the taxesto pay for the program. But such costs are negligible in comparison with thehealth gains. And the public intervention in organizing and largely financ-ing the EPI did not crowd out, but probably stimulated, much private par-ticipation in both the financing and the delivery of vaccinations [van derGaag 1995]. The second question is how to value a public-good health intervention. This is the natural domain of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses. Ifthe only benefit from an intervention is improved health, it does not mat-ter whether that is measured in health terms (lives saved, healthy life yearsgained) or monetized. When there are also significant collateral benefits,different approaches can lead to different rankings of interventions. This isthe case for education, water supply and sanitation, and other activitieswhich are valuable for health but also for other reasons\u2014and which maynot be justified for the health benefits alone [World Bank 1993b]. Cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness comparisons are also relevant to public inter-vention in the other domains of health care, but they are particularlyimportant for public goods for which no private market prices exist. The issues of which activities to consider public, and whether they deserve to be financed publicly, are difficult. Nonetheless, there are severalreasons why this is the simplest domain in which to determine public pol-icy. There is broad agreement on the substantial benefits from a few crucialinterventions, which are extremely cost-effective [Jamison, Mosley,Measham and Bobadilla 1993]. Individual poverty is not a major source ofproblems, as it is with private goods: only society's overall capacity to pay46 Health Economics in Development matters. Individual ignorance or absence of demand is also of little impor- tance. Finally, this area does not contribute much to the explosion of healthcare costs, and its financial importance declines as income rises. The public role in low-cost private interventions . This domain includes so many different activities, which are undertaken repeatedly and usually have littlehealth impact per episode, that continued, universal, direct public interven-tion is simply impossible. Governments cannot be responsible for every-one's daily life, and can probably contribute most by improving households'capacities to look after their own health. Promoting development gener-ally\u2014not only increased incomes but more education and access to all kindsof knowledge, goods and services\u2014seems to be the best way to do this[World Bank 1993b, Chapter 2]. How far interference in people's ordinary behavior is justified, depends on whether the health benefits outweigh the curtailment or modification ofindividual choices, including non-health benefits. Apart from indefensibleextreme positions\u2014for example, that only health matters, and is worth anyprice; or that only people's private appreciation of their own utility matters,and should be treated as sacrosanct\u2014there is no straightforward answer tothis question. Public action cannot be justified simply because of a healthimprovement; neither can it be rejected just because individual libertymight be limited. Specific public intervention for improved health may bejustified under three conditions: ignorance or incomplete knowledge, exter-nalities, and the failure of adults to act as appropriate agents for children.Each of these involves some kind of market failure, or violation of the pri-vate market assumption that rational adults are making informed choicesand paying the consequences of their decisions. The first problem is ignorance: people might take better care of their health if they knew how. For example, vitamins are crucial to health butare not observable in food, and people may already believe untruthsabout diet that help cause vitamin deficiencies [Johns, Booth andKuhnlein 1992]. In general, ignorance on the part of one or both partiesto a transaction is a major source of failure in the health care market. Ofcourse, \"perfect decision making is not ever possible, so the real issue iswhen the government can or ought to intervene in the information mar-ket to improve the market's performance\" [Beales, Crasswell and Salop1981]. Moreover, information is not entirely free, and people do notalways act on it. Thus while the cost-effectiveness of efforts to makebehavior more efficient can be very high, it is also quite variable, and peo-ple's reactions to information are hard to predict. Public and Private Roles in Health 47 Correcting ignorance is not simply a matter of telling people something new, but a larger question of changing beliefs and behavior. Where betterknowledge alone does not lead to changed behavior, regulation or mandatesmay also be justified even though they imply more intrusive or coerciveintervention. In all such cases, the difficult question is how far it islegitimate to try to change people's views of what they want or what is goodfor them. Information often complements these other instruments, toreduce opposition to them or improve their effectiveness. The interactionbetween information and other instruments of behavior change is seenclearly in the successful effort to reduce smoking in the United States [U.S.Dept. of Health and Human Services 1989, 1992]. This situation raises a second problem, of externalities, or interactions among presumably informed adults. Driving while drunk is an example, asis dumping feces or trash in communal water supplies. These activitiesimpose both health damage and financial costs on others, and individualprotection may be impossible or very costly. The chief instrument for pub-lic action is regulation, perhaps supported by mandates; these instances donot typically require public finance of health care activities. They may ofcourse also require negative mandates, in the form of laws against certainactivities or behaviors. In practice, there is no sharp boundary between thisand the first problem, because some of the behavior that imposes costs onothers may also arise from ignorance: thus reducing the harm from a par-ticular behavior may require both information and monetary, legal or otherincentives. It is more effective to criminalize drunk driving if people are alsoinformed of the dangers, and the health damage can be limited by man-dating the use of seat belts. The third condition is an agent-principal problem [Stiglitz 1989] and, in contrast to the externalities just discussed, is intergenerational. Children arenot yet informed, sovereign adults; they are vulnerable not just to accidentsand disease but to the indifference and even sadism of their parents. Thisproblem is somewhat similar to the situation of doctors acting as imperfectagents for their patients. However, patients often can choose and contractwith the doctors who act as their agents, whereas children have no choiceof who acts for them. (Similar problems arise for adults who are mentallyretarded or incapacitated by some kinds of disease.) What should the statedo when parents are inadequate agents for their children? Requiring thatchildren be immunized is relatively easy, but it is harder to deal with child-beating or exposure of children to secondhand smoke, and still harder toconfront parents' beliefs in such matters as sexual education. Where sexual48 Health Economics in Development behavior, vehicle use and consumption of alcohol, tobacco and drugs are concerned, these issues continue through adolescence. This is an exceptionally contentious topic, where it is hard to draw the frontier between public and private responsibilities. Different societies haveadopted different solutions, and there is often bitter disagreement withinsocieties over the rights and duties of parents and the degree to which thestate can or should interfere in family life. There are potentially very largehealth gains at stake in this debate: eight or nine of the ten worldwide lead-ing causes of illness in young children are substantially correctable at lowcost [World Bank 1993, Annex T able B.6], and four of these\u2014diarrheal dis-ease plus three nutritional deficiencies\u2014can be largely controlled by thefamily, with little public expenditure. These diseases account for about 20percent of young children's ill health; the total share of child health thatdepends on parental behavior is of course substantially larger. In all these instances, the principal instruments of state action should probably be information and regulation. Mandates are justified for a few activities such as requiring schoolchildren to be immunized, or that food-stuffs be fortified, and against a few other activities. Substantial public finance, however, is usually justified only because some people are too poorto pay for health-related goods and activities, whether these involve medi-cal care or such necessities as food. Risk-sharing for catastrophically costly private goods . When risks cannot be fully controlled, and the associated costs may be catastrophic, the only solutionis to share the risk. None of the features of this domain is unique to healthcare, but the magnitude and interaction of certain problems are especiallyimportant in health care markets. Moreover, the health risk is only partlyassociated with income or employment, and the financial risk is hardly asso-ciated at all with income or occupation. Health insurance differs sharply from insurance for non-human assets such as homes or vehicles, where the value of the asset, and therefore thecost of insurance, is usually related to income. Another fundamental differ-ence is that medical care allows for preventive maintenance and for repair,but not for complete replacement of the damaged capital, which in this caseis a human body. Insurance for non-human assets operates in just the oppo-site way, protecting against the loss of the asset but not paying for itsupkeep. Insurance may even cover the cost of a temporary substitute for thelost home or vehicle, which is impossible with health insurance. Risks arealso harder to estimate for health insurance, both because of the inherentlyPublic and Private Roles in Health 49 much greater complexity of the body than of non-human property and because there are often different possible treatments for a given healthproblem, with different costs, outcomes and risks. Insurance against healthrisks raises some well-known difficulties [Arrow 1985], leading to variouskinds of market failure. One such problem arises because insurance is a con-tract by which someone other than the patient agrees to pay for his or herhealth care. As with all contracts, there is an incentive for the insured tobehave differently because of the insurance; this is called moral hazard [Pauly 1968]. One consequence is that consumers who do not pay the fullcost of health care will consume more of it. This is desirable, since the pointof insurance is to let people consume health care they could not otherwiseafford. It means, however, that the price must cover the increased demandthat results from insurance, and not simply the care that people wouldotherwise want to buy out-of-pocket. In theory, there are two potentially more worrisome problems associated with this moral hazard. The first is that people may not only consume moremedical care generally, but care that costs too much relative to its effective-ness, yielding smaller health gains per dollar spent. The second risk is thatpeople may take poorer care of their health via daily activities, because theypay the full cost of those, but only part or none of the cost of the resultingincreased curative care. Both problems imply excess resources being dedi-cated to health care. They may also imply worse health, if increased curativecare does not fully compensate for reduced prevention and protection. Somedegree of moral hazard is intrinsic to all kinds of insurance, but it is more lim-ited in the case of nonhuman assets because the insurance does not coverordinary wear and tear. And cheating the insurer, by burning down one'shouse or abandoning one's car and reporting it stolen, is illegal, to prevent theinsured person from fraudulently collecting cash. Such compensation is gen-erally not possible under health insurance. (Cash payment for permanent dis-abilities is usually included with life insurance and represents compensationfor the loss of part of a life. The only significant moral hazard for such insur-ance appears to be suicide, which is often specifically excluded from thecauses of death for which compensation will be paid.) Moral hazard in healthinsurance is independent of how it is financed, so it does not by itself deter-mine whether insurance should be paid for privately or publicly. A consumerwho voluntarily buys private insurance ends up paying for the additionalmedical care consumed by other purchasers, and judges whether this cost isjustified by his or her own greater access to care. When insurance is paid forby taxes or mandatory contributions, however, this choice cannot be made.50 Health Economics in Development Moral hazard may then justify controls on what public money is used for, to avoid expenditure on interventions of little health value which consumerswould not voluntarily agree to buy for other people [Musgrove 1995a]. Thereis scant empirical evidence on the importance of these problems, particularlyas to whether insurance leads people to be more careless about their health than they would be if uninsured. As to the relation between insurance and lesscost-effective medical care, the evidence in the United States is that higherout-of-pocket cost for medical care (higher co-payments or lower deductibleson insurance) does not make consumers choose more cost-effective services,and may even make poor consumers forego highly justified care [Lohr et al. 1986, Newhouse et al. 1993]. Except in the latter case, there is little evidence that making the consumer pay higher costs under insurance leads to wor-sened health. Inefficiency in a competitive insurance market also takes theform of excess purchases of insurance \u2014that is, insurance for interventions which could be more efficiently financed out of pocket [Pauly 1974], or insurancewhich leads to needless or unjustified use of medical care. This is inefficientto the degree that it leads to excess administrative costs for handling numer-ous small claims, and because of the excess consumption of health care [Feld-stein 1973]. Private insurers can only partly control this tendency throughdeductibles (which remove small risks from coverage, until out-of-pocketpayments reach some limit). This problem arises partly because of ignorance:people tend to overestimate small risks and may buy too much insurance evenwhen they pay its full cost. Moral hazard, however, is a greater problem: peo-ple who do not pay the full cost of insurance will buy too much of it, just aswith medical services. Market failure in the form of over-insurance happensprimarily through the tax system. Many governments allow private employ-ers to treat insurance cost as an expense, but then\u2014in contrast to salaries\u2014do not treat the value of insurance as income to workers. Subsidy through thetax system is notorious in the United States [Pauly 1986], both for insurancefor workers which is financed by employers and for part of the Medicareinsurance for the elderly. It is estimated that employer-financed insurancewould decline by one-sixth or more in the absence of this subsidy, and that inconsequence the overall demand for medical services would fall by about fivepercent [Chernick, Holmer and Weienberg 1987]. Alternatively, governments directly subsidize social security health ben- efits (mandated insurance) out of general revenue. General revenues areused to support social security systems throughout Europe and Latin Amer-ica [McGreevey 1990]. In Chile, payroll taxes can also be used to financeprivate insurance. All these direct and indirect subsidies to insurance are notonly inefficient, but highly inequitable when only part of the labor force isPublic and Private Roles in Health 51 covered. The poor typically benefit only when coverage is (close to) uni- versal. When various profit-maximizing insurers compete to sell insurance,there are two further and closely related problems, of adverse selection on the part of consumers and of risk selection on the part of insurers. The former refers to selection of customers which would be adverse to the interests ofinsurers\u2014fundamentally, it describes the danger of enrolling people whowould cost more on average than the insurance could finance. This can hap-pen because the amount of insurance coverage people want and are willingto pay for depends partly on their knowledge of their own health conditionsand risks. People who expect to need little health care are unwilling to payas much as those who expect to need much care, so a policy costly enoughto cover high-risk people will lose out in the market to a cheaper policy ade-quate for low-risk people. Universal coverage at the same price for everyone may therefore be impossible to achieve, or may not generate enough revenue to finance allthe health care demanded [Summers 1989]. T o protect themselves againstthe combination of low premiums and high potential costs, insurers engagein risk selection or \"cream-skimming\": they spend more on administration,or create barriers to enrollment, to screen out high-risk individuals (such asthe aged) or conditions (such as cancer). Such \"underwriting\", as it is called,is particularly costly for individual applicants for insurance, and gives rise tolarge scale economies because when a large group is enrolled, the insurerneeds to estimate only the average risk of needing care [Diamond 1992].This practice is the natural market response to the problem of adverseselection. Inefficiency takes the form of increased administrative costs, andalso increased health risks for those excluded from insurance. Particularlywhen pre-existing conditions are not covered, people with health problemswho are insured by their employers cannot readily change jobs without los-ing their insurance; other differences in insurance coverage may also create\"job lock\" among workers. This labor immobility is another source of inef-ficiency, of unknown magnitude [Congressional Budget Office 1994]. Oneanswer to the problems of adverse and risk selection is price differentiationaccording to risk, which is theoretically efficient in that it allows everyoneto have the insurance he or she is willing to pay for. Such price variation iscommon to other forms of insurance: for example, rates for automobileinsurance often vary by age and by the way a vehicle is used. Unfortunately,there are serious difficulties with letting the market create comparable dif-ferentials in health insurance. One is that some people are willing to payonly a small amount, because they expect to need little medical care. Facedwith a price that would cover the cost of care for everyone, they will not52 Health Economics in Development purchase insurance. When they drop out of the market, the price of cover- age for those who expect to need more care is driven up because the risk isspread over fewer and higher-cost people. Even if they are willing to paymore than those who anticipate needing very little care, the price ofinsurance may rise beyond their capacity to pay. They will be unable to buyinsurance, despite a willingness to pay more than the average consumer.Such failures do not occur in other insurance markets because risks aremore uniform or predictable, or more closely related to income. Of course, people's willingness to buy insurance depends on their expec- tation about future needs for medical care, and they may guess wrong.People who are young and healthy today, and therefore unwilling to spendmuch on insurance, may when they are older want much more medical carethan they now anticipate. But if they become willing to buy substantial cov-erage only late in life, the cost will be higher than if it were spread over alonger period, so they may be unable to pay for insurance once they recog-nize the need for it. The difficulty of predicting health care needs is exacer-bated by the rapidity of technical change in this sector [Weisbrod 1991]. Another problem with differential prices is that despite the importance of many behaviors for specific health problems, rather little of total healthrisk is under the individual's control. People cannot be held personallyresponsible for much of their ill health since it is genetic in origin, or dueto the actions of others. Often the best that people can do by controllingtheir own behavior is to postpone problems, which is very valuable but doesnot necessarily save money over a lifetime [Russell 1986]. Behavioralchange may also take a long time to show effect on the burden of disease orthe volume of treatment [World Bank 1994a]. Because so little health riskis under people's control, behavior-related prices\u2014whether for health careor for insurance itself\u2014are of only limited value in making markets work.One can charge people for smoking (by taxation) or for not wearing seatbelts (by fines), or reward them for careful driving (by lower insurancerates), but prices are not feasible for most health-related behaviors. Peoplehave some choice of where to live and whether to drive a car, but no choiceabout inhabiting the body they were born with [Miller 1978]. Notions offairness are involved in the choice of how far to allow or control price dif-ferentiation in health insurance, because people often do not think othersshould be punished financially, in addition to their physical suffering, forbad luck. In addition, the possibility of death or substantial permanentdisability sometimes makes treatment urgent. Adverse selection is thereforea problem of equity as well as of efficiency.Public and Private Roles in Health 53 The problems of moral hazard and adverse selection arise partly from the fact that consumers and insurers possess only incomplete information, which causes market failure in the sense that markets work perfectly onlywhen both buyers and sellers possess full information [Arrow 1985].Of course, insurance is wanted in the first place because people do not knowwhat will happen to their health, and they agree to share risks when they donot know what will happen to others' health. A further complication is thatof information asymmetry: information available to only one side of a market readily leads to market failure. For example, consumers who know theirhealth risks have an incentive to conceal them from insurers so as to avoidhigher premiums. They also know how they have modified their behavior,or mean to do so, because of insurance. Insurers, in contrast, generally knowmore than consumers about average risks and about costs of care; consumerignorance of these matters can also lead to inefficiency. Unfortunately, it does not follow that the problems of incomplete and asymmetric information could be corrected just by supplying information.Better knowledge on the part of consumers about health risks may lead tomore efficient purchase and use of insurance. However, obtaining the infor-mation needed to restore symmetry would be impossible or very costly; toomuch is still unknown about how much people can control their healththrough behavioral choices. Even if it were symmetrically available to con-sumers, insurers and providers, more information might make it easier forinsurers to practice risk selection and discriminate among customers, andthereby exacerbate inequity. In fact, in an unregulated market, this is theprobable consequence of the increasing availability of information linkinggenetic endowment to the likelihood of developing specific illnesses orhealth problems [House of Commons 1995]. Information asymmetry also arises between patients and doctors, since the latter typically know much more about medical conditions and treat-ments. Patients may accept, or even demand, treatments they would not buyif fully informed, but which are advantageous, financially or otherwise, tomedical professionals. There is however little firm evidence as to how muchof this potential \"supplier-induced demand\" actually occurs [Pauly 1988]. Inany case, this is not simply a problem of rich countries, where most peoplehave insurance and therefore do not worry about costs; it has also been doc-umented in poor societies where lack of education and information maymake it particularly easy to exploit consumers [Bennett et al. 1994]. In summary, the consequence of these market failures is that in an unreg- ulated, competitive private market in third-party insurance those with54 Health Economics in Development chronic conditions or high health risks will be under-insured, administrative costs will be higher than necessary because of insurers' efforts to screen outrisks and the costs of processing claims in a market with many insurers andmany providers, and procedures of low or questionable value will beperformed because neither the provider nor the consumer pays for them. Itis in these specific senses that \"the market does not work\" in health care;these are primarily failures of the insurance market rather than shortcomingsof the market for health care itself. Private markets have developed other forms of insurance which reduce, but do not eliminate, these problems, such as health maintenance organiza-tions (HMOs). Under this arrangement, providers also act as insurers andassume the risk. Insofar as this controls costs by shifting the burden to sup-pliers of medical care rather than to consumers or third-party insurers [Ellisand McGuire 1993], it may allow more coverage of the chronically ill, andmay reduce the utilization of relatively ineffective procedures. However,without some form of public intervention such arrangements will have lit-tle effect on the problems caused by poverty and adverse selection. Thequestion remains which kinds and degrees of public intervention can bestmitigate the problems inherent to private insurance markets without intro-ducing worse inefficiencies or inequities. Market Failure and Health Care Needs Since the unregulated, unsubsidized private market is the extreme alternative to government intervention in health care, much of the debate as to appro-priate public and private roles in the sector turns on whether, how, and howbadly markets may fail. Market failure, as an economic notion, refers to pos-sible mismatches or disequilibria between what the market supplies, andwhat fully-informed, rational consumers of health care would demand. Itdoes not deal with the concept of need for health care, which is theoretically an unsatisfactory concept but is also difficult to do without [Culyer 1995].People want health care not for any intrinsic utility but because they thinkthey need it, that if care is not provided their health will deteriorate or fail toimprove. In contrast, much of the criticism by both health care profession-als and consumers of how health systems operate deals explicitly with needs. Just as demand and supply may be out of balance, there can be imbalance between demand and need or between need and supply of services, as shownin Figure 2.2. Market failures in the narrow economic sense are among thePublic and Private Roles in Health 55 reasons for these imbalances (these are indicated on the Figure by asterisks). Some failures result from barriers to the operation of competitive privatemarkets in bringing supply and demand together. Others distort demandfrom what it would be if based on complete and symmetric information andif there were no public goods or externalities; this causes imbalance betweendemands and needs. While competitive private markets are generally thebest way to bring demand and supply together, they are much worse suitedto make either demand or supply match people's needs. Public interventionin the health market, in contrast, is aimed at satisfying those needs, and runsthe corresponding risk of failing to take account of demand. Either a purelyprivate or a purely public health care system is likely to control one of thethree potential imbalances, at the cost of failing to control or even worsen-ing one or both of the others [Musgrove 1995b]. This is a major reason whymost health care systems are far from being all private or all public [Dun-lop and Martins 1995].

Similarly, it is assumed thatno one is too poor to buy insurance against catastrophic health risks; peo-ple differ in income and in their assessment of risks, but everyone can affordsome insurance. This means that the distinction between the \"low-cost\"domain in Figure 2.1 and the domain where insurance is needed is roughlythe same for everyone. A minimal state role in the absence of poverty . Under these conditions the state's role in the domain of private, inexpensive health-related activitieswould be limited mostly to information and regulation; there would be noreason to finance this kind of health care publicly if everyone could affordit out-of-pocket. (Mandates might still be justified to deal with some of theexternalities mentioned above.) In the domain of risk-sharing, people whochose not to buy insurance, or bought too little of it, would have to pay forcare out of pocket or do without it. Because doing without care wouldsometimes pose the risk of avoidable death, some kinds of care\u2014emergencyservices, at least\u2014are typically available even to the uninsured. People'swillingness to let others suffer the consequences of imprudence does notusually include letting them die because they bought too little catastrophicprotection. This kind of imprudence constitutes moral hazard, and unlikesome behavior on the part of insured people, it cannot be dealt with by dif-ferential premiums. Motorcyclists who prefer not to wear helmets can inprinciple be charged more for their insurance, just as smokers can; the moredifficult problem is how much care to provide for the uninsured cyclistwhose injuries are worse because of failure to wear a helmet. This situation provides a justification for enough public finance or man- dated insurance to cover the cost of a few crucial services to which everyonewould have access and for which everyone would have to pay through taxes[Summers 1989]. Except for these services, there would be no requirementfor the government to subsidize insurance for anyone. If there were nopoverty, then, the role of the state in the health sector might be relatively lim-ited, and would\u2014except for the minimum insurance requirement justdescribed\u2014concentrate on the adequate provision of public goods and thecorrection of market failure in the domain of risk-sharing. Whether in orderto correct or compensate for that failure the state should mandate or financeinsurance beyond that minimum of emergency care, is a question of the socialefficiency of doing so, rather than leaving insurance to the private market.Public and Private Roles in Health 57 The fact that insurance would not need to be subsidized\u2014the removal of an equity justification for interfering in the insurance market\u2014does not meanthat governments should do nothing, because the efficiency failings of privatevoluntary insurance are as important as the inequities to which it gives rise. How poverty complicates public roles . The existence of poverty, of people too poor to buy many \"inexpensive\" health activities or an \"adequate\" amountof insurance, complicates the question of what the state should and shouldnot do in several ways. These complications are not limited to the domainsof private goods, because problems of public health are often more severeamong the poor. They are likely to be at particular risk from contaminatedair and water and so to benefit more than the non-poor from public healthinterventions [World Bank 1992a, 1993b], and they often suffer more seri-ous consequences from common illnesses. In general, imbalance betweenneed and demand may be more important where the poor are concerned,because they have less knowledge on which to base their wants for healthcare as well as less resources with which to express demand. Medical indigence is in most respects no different from poverty with respect to food and other basic needs, and, as with those needs, the rest ofsociety may agree to subsidize the poor. The difference is that poverty rel-ative to predictable, low-cost needs such as food can be dealt with either bytransfers or subsidies in kind, or by supplementing income [Srinivasan1994]. With health, the risk of needing very costly care generally makes itmore efficient to deal with medical indigence by subsidizing insurance thanthrough income transfers. However, there is little experience in most poorcountries in subsidizing private providers or insurers to meet the healthneeds of the poor. This requires government administrative capacity andappropriate pricing mechanisms, to prevent excess provision and even out-right fraud, which has been a major problem, for example, in Brazil [WorldBank 1993c; Medici and Czapski 1995]. A public subsidy to private insurance, as an alternative to dealing directly with large numbers of providers, also requires premiums differentiated byage, sex or other conditions, to reduce the scope for risk selection and makeit feasible to mandate universal coverage. In consequence, one of the mostimportant effects of poverty is that it makes public provision, with all itstypical problems, look attractive or even necessary in poor countries. Asidefrom the problems of regulation, it is financially difficult to provide thepoor with the same level of services enjoyed by those already covered byprivate or social insurance. Even extending social security coverage to thepoor, to replace the more limited services offered by Ministries of Health,58 Health Economics in Development would be very costly in many Latin American countries [Mesa-Lago 1992]. Public provision often means poor health care for the poor, but publicfinancing of private services would not easily solve the underlying financialproblem even if it led to improved quality of care. Finally, in countrieswhere all public money now flows through government or parastatal facili-ties, shifting to public finance of private providers requires that public hos-pitals and clinics be privatized or at least given sufficient autonomy andcapacity to manage themselves and compete for public funds against otherproviders. Such changes are potentially very valuable, but they are likely tobe particularly difficult, since public facilities need to be exposed to somefinancial risk without the danger of collapse in publicly funded provision. The difficulty of incorporating the poor into the same insurance schemes which cover the non-poor, whether by extending social security coverage orby subsidizing the purchase of private insurance, leads to efforts to createinsurance specifically for the poor, typically at the community level. Anysuch scheme is intrinsically limited by the low incomes of participants, so itcannot finance very costly interventions and can only yield subsidies fromthe less poor to the more poor. It may nonetheless be appropriate when theinsurance is meant to pay for only such health care as can also be providedlocally and which therefore is not very costly\u2014although perhaps still catas-trophic for a poor family to finance. Unfortunately, the problems of moralhazard and adverse selection arise even in these circumstances. For example,if insurance is sold for short periods to accommodate families' fluctuationsin income, then, as occurred in Burundi, people may buy the \"health cards\"entitling them to services only when they are already sick or can anticipatea medical need [McPake, Hanson and Mills 1993]. That effectively elimi-nates the difference between an insurance payment and a fee, and reducesthe amount of money that can be raised by the scheme. These problems leadto complications such as rewarding people who use less (curative) healthcare by reducing the cost of their cards for the next period or by chargingan additional fee or \"fine\" to those who pay for insurance only when ill[Chabot, Boal and da Silva 1991]. Such incentives work against moral haz-ard and adverse selection, but if they are large enough to have much effectthey may greatly reduce the scheme's revenue or the demand for services.And administrative expenses may absorb a large share of revenue. Poverty also creates or strengthens reasons for the state to intervene in low-cost, health-related activities, whether these are inexpensive medicationsand services or such non-medical items as food supplements. Some inter-ventions can be accommodated by broadening public health services, forexample by including micronutrient supplements or treatment for intestinalPublic and Private Roles in Health 59 parasites. Others can be covered by financing private providers, such as the clinics which operate under \"covenants\" with the Brazilian social securitysystem [World Bank 1993c]. However these activities are dealt with, povertypushes governments to finance a wider range of low-cost interventions andto rely less on information and regulation. If this were the only force at work,it would lead to a larger public share of health expenditure in poor than inrich countries, simply because there are more poor people who cannot payfor those interventions. In the sum of health spending, however, this effect isoverwhelmed by the tendency (and the capacity) of governments to mandateor finance more insurance for the non-poor, as income rises. A third effect of poverty is to limit the use of prices to curtail demand or control costs. Being poor already greatly constrains demand, and poor peo-ple are necessarily more sensitive to prices for health care than the non-poor [Gertler and van der Gaag 1992]. This means both that user fees canraise relatively little revenue from the poor, and that unless there are offset-ting improvements in quality, utilization may be sharply reduced [Lavy1994, Litvack and Bodart 1993]. The experience with user fees has beenextensively analyzed, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa in connection with theBamako Initiative [Griffin 1987, Creese 1991, World Bank 1992, Vogel1993, Makinen and Raney 1994, Nolan and T urbat 1994, Shaw and Griffin1995]. There is evidence that\u2014as might be expected\u2014utilization declines,sometimes sharply, if fees are raised but nothing else changes. There israther less information on service characteristics, such as whether user feesimprove the availability of drugs. And almost nothing is known about theimpact on health outcomes or on system efficiency or cost-effectiveness.Fees are sometimes set arbitrarily or with inconsistent criteria; charges lowenough to have no effect on the poor may or may not be worth collecting;and targeting by exempting the destitute from fees does not have to beexpensive [Grosh 1992], but there is a risk of high administrative costs andlow net revenues. The same problems arise for collecting insurancedeductibles and co-payments from the poor. Not only does poverty increase the risk of ill health; sickness and disabil- ity can make or keep people poor. The relation between health and povertyis sometimes regarded as another reason for the state to invest in health, inorder to raise productivity. However, the fact that some health care increasesincomes is not a separate objective for government action. If health care made people so much more productive that the extra income could pay for thehealth care, then in perfect markets people could borrow against their futureproductivity. When capital market failures prevent such borrowing, andthose failures cannot be corrected directly, then any public intervention\u2014such60 Health Economics in Development as financing the health care or providing loans to consumers\u2014that secures the health gains will also yield the increase in productivity. Justifications and Risks of State Intervention As the foregoing analysis shows, there are three distinct, independent argu- ments for governments to intervene in health care rather than leaving itentirely to private markets. One is to ensure the optimal level of productionand consumption of public goods and goods which have a partly public char-acter because of externalities. These can be health care services themselves,activities protective of health, or information that helps people take bettercare of their health and make better use of services. A second reason is tomake insurance work more efficiently and more equitably, for those serviceswhich can be produced in private markets but for which risk-sharing isrequired because of high costs and uncertainty about needs. The third reasonis to subsidize those too poor to buy insurance or even, sometimes, thoseinexpensive activities and services which the non-poor can afford out ofpocket. These three reasons derive from the three domains of health caredefined by cost and by the public or private nature of services. Market failuresunderlie two of these reasons, but in different ways. In the case of publicgoods and externalities, the failure arises from the nature of the good or serv-ice. In contrast, problems in insurance markets arise from the way the good isfinanced. None of the three reasons is unique to the health sector, but all aremore important in this sector than in much of the rest of the economy. The arguments for not leaving health care and health insurance to uncontrolled private markets are all arguments that efficiency or equity canbe improved, if the state intervenes appropriately. They are not argumentsthat anything the public sector does, will improve matters. Just as there is awell-defined set of market failures typical of the health sector, there are con-sistent government failures, ways in which governments act to create worseoutcomes than could be reached, and in some respects even worse outcomesthan markets would generate. The most common and severe criticism ofpublic action concerns provision [World Bank 1980 and 1987, Birdsall andJames 1992]: especially in poor countries, governments offer medical carewhich is supposed to be free to users, on equity grounds, but which iscentrally-controlled, under-financed and of poor quality in both medicaland human terms. Because the budgets of public facilities often are unre-lated to service output, and civil service rules make it difficult to fire, trans-fer or discipline unproductive staff, the costs of health gains may be veryhigh even if salaries and other input costs are low. And the pervasive lack ofPublic and Private Roles in Health 61 incentives for efficiency means that capital is also bought in excess, not maintained, and under-utilized. The result is that even rather poor people,the supposed beneficiaries of the public system, often pay out of pocket forthose private services they can afford. This makes them pay twice for someof their care, exacerbating the inequities arising from the tax system andfrom difficulties of access due to the geographic location of facilities. Governments typically fail where provision is concerned, by trying to do too much and by competing with private providers only in price terms\u2014that is, subsidizing provision rather than competing on quality and satisfac-tion. With respect to the other instruments of state action, failures are morevaried, and often result from doing too little rather than too much. This islikely to be the case particularly for regulation and for the dissemination ofinformation. Mandates show a very mixed pattern: middle-income countriesin particular often mandate insurance for part of the population throughsocial security schemes, but do not effectively mandate either insurance orcare for everyone. Richer countries, in contrast, appear much less prone togovernment failure largely because they rely much more heavily on regula-tion and mandates, and much less on public provision. Where public facili-ties are important, as in some European countries, they operate undergreater autonomy than in poor countries, and this is balanced by greaterregulation of private providers. The result is to concentrate more on theright roles for public action, and less on dividing the health sector into dis- jointed private and public spheres. The distinction is particularly importantbecause in many countries, the two sectors overlap greatly: the sameprofessionals work part-time in each, private providers often use publicfacilities to treat private patients, and so on. T o provide public goods and tosubsidize health-related activities for the poor, two of the three main reasonsfor state action, both require public finance. In both these areas there is alsoroom for the other instruments of state action; and the problems associatedwith risk sharing can lead to various combinations of interventions, whichmay or may not include spending public money. Societies therefore havemuch latitude in how much, and by what means, the government intervenesin health care markets, just as they have in deciding how much to spend onhealth in relation to income and to their health problems or needs. The Appropriate Public Role in Health As a first approximation, it is easier to say what governments should not do in health than to specify what they should do. That is, it is clear that certain actions are likely or certain to violate one or more of the objectives of62 Health Economics in Development a health care system to an important degree. T o apply a topographic metaphor: such actions correspond to falling off a plateau of satisfactoryoutcomes, all somewhat different but none clearly dominating the rest, andinto one of the surrounding chasms of one or another kind of failure. Four\"don'ts\" are discussed in what follows: they refer to the way the public istaxed, charged or exempted to pay for health care; the providers to whichgovernments transfer public funds; the way providers are paid; and the serv-ices they are paid to provide. What government should not do . The first thing governments should not do is to use the tax system, or any system of fees at public facilities, to make thepoor subsidize the health care of the rich. Conceptually, subsidies are justi-fied only for the poor, and broader financing of care through insurance is aquestion of efficiency rather than of equity. This is not only a matter ofwhether the rich use more of publicly-financed services than the poor do,although great inequities often arise because the rich have more access tothose services. Financial equity also depends on who pays the taxes. Morenarrowly, governments should not contribute to social security financingfrom general revenues, unless coverage is universal, because when only partof the population is covered it is usually the poor who are excluded. Andgovernments should not treat private insurance coverage as a cost toemployers unless it is also treated as income to beneficiaries. Such practicesare not only inequitable; they are also inefficient to the extent that they leadto excessive spending on health care, or reduce labor mobility. Controlling inequitable subsidies does not mean that social security sys- tems should be dismantled or must be made universal. Even when incom-plete, such mandated insurance includes substantial progressive subsidiesfrom high-paid to low-paid workers, and the mere fact that some people insociety receive more generous health care is not necessarily a problem,so long as they pay for it. What matters is that governments not makeeveryone pay for what some are excluded ex ante from receiving. Perverse subsidies not only cause immediate inefficiencies or inequities, they alsocreate interests that oppose subsequent health system reform. This is evi-dent in the United States [Skocpol 1995] and Chile [Musgrove1995d], andit is the reason why the design of subsidies is a crucial part of any reform toextend or improve coverage for the poor. The second thing governmentsshould not do is tie public finance to public provision. The choice ofwhether to provide care through public or parastatal facilities should betreated as a \"make or buy\" decision, subordinate to the larger decisionabout what to pay for. That does not necessarily mean eliminating publicPublic and Private Roles in Health 63 provision, which will sometimes be the best solution. It means rather that competition between public and private providers should be based on costsand on quality, and not on price to the consumer, as is commonly the case. T o achieve those goals, however, requires other changes in how public institutions operate, changes that probably cannot occur so long as publicfunds go automatically and exclusively to government facilities. This con-clusion is most pertinent to poor countries where public systems are mostlikely to be inefficient and to be used only because they are free or nearlyso. High-income countries with a large share of public provision, particu-larly in hospitals, suffer less from these problems. A third thing governments should not do is pay for health care by fee-for-service, unless other mechanisms are used to control expenditures.This is seldom a problem with publicly provided services, but makes it hard tocontrol costs when governments finance private providers. Even negotiatingor controlling the fees is not enough, as the Canadian experience demon-strates, since providers can respond to fees they consider too low, by increas-ing output [Evans, Barer and Labelle 1988]. This helps explain why Canadianhealth expenditure has risen faster than that in European countries which relyon other payment mechanisms. European countries which pay for health careby fee-for-service also rely on global budgets, utilization reviews or otherinstruments of cost containment [OECD 1994, 1995]. Since expendituresequal prices times quantities, and since quantities of services respond to pricesand are difficult to control directly, countries which pursue both macroeco-nomic and microeconomic efficiency in health spending usually control bothprices and expenditures. In contrast to European and North American expe-rience, Brazil applies this system to block grants for federal expenditure instates with relative financial autonomy; but in states where federal money ispaid directly to providers, the federal government also controls one crucialquantity, the number of hospitalizations that federal money will pay for[World Bank 1994b]. In all cases, the government sets prices for services. It also helps, in controlling expenditures, to define \"services\" as complete treatments for specific conditions rather than as all the individual compo-nents of such treatments, so they can be financed by mechanisms such as theDiagnostic Related Group (DRG) payments used in the United States andthe provider can be required to assume part of the financial risk. Changingfrom a system based on overall budgets and on salaries for providers, to afee-for-service system without offsetting the resulting incentives to over-provision can lead to an explosion of costs, as in the Czech Republic [Boland1995]. Finally, if governments mean to pursue some combination of better64 Health Economics in Development health and lower costs, they should not\u2014in fact they cannot\u2014simply finance whatever people demand when care is free to consumers. This doesnot mean governments should not \"subsidize demand\" rather than \"subsi-dizing supply\" or providing services. It means only that there must be limi-tations on what will be paid for publicly. Such limitations are a particularlycontentious matter, because both good health and cost containment may beopposed to consumer or provider satisfaction, which are also politicallyimportant objectives. Nonetheless, two empirical observations are germaneto this decision. One is that private insurance always carries some limita-tions, either as to the services covered or as to cost-sharing. Except wherepoverty is important, so that cost-sharing is more difficult, there is no rea-son for public finance to be systematically more generous in this regard thanprivate risk-sharing arrangements. The second observation is that, as thediscussion concerning Figure 2.2 indicates, private markets will tend to sup-ply what people demand, and public intervention typically acts to emphasizeneeds instead. In other forms of public subsidy, it is common to distinguishbetween wants and needs, and concentrate spending on the latter. This isthe case, for example, with food subsidies, which are also very much health-related. Price subsidies are usually limited to \"basic\" foodstuffs, and foodstamps cannot legally be used to buy alcohol or other non-necessities. Thismay be considered partly a matter of efficiency, assuring more health gainthan would otherwise occur. But it is also a matter of equity: in contrast toactuarial private insurance, where every purchaser buys the expected valueof the health services needed, public finance is involuntary. It comes fromtaxpayers who have a legitimate interest in meeting needs, and thereby get-ting value for their money, but not necessarily in paying for wants. None of these \"don'ts\" is easy to implement, because some consumer or provider interests can be expected to oppose every one of them, in everycountry. But they are arguably the most important conclusions about wherethe public/private frontier should run in the health sector. It is notable thatnone of these conclusions depends solely on features unique to the healthsector. The peculiarities of health matter most for the difficulty of distin-guishing \"needs\" from wants, and\u2014partly as a consequence\u2014for thedangers of paying providers for whatever they choose to provide, withoutincentives to control costs. A system which avoided the problems describedabove would still present complex and difficult questions for the proper roleof the state, but it would have more latitude to pursue improvements. Andit would not matter so much, exactly what objectives the governmentpursued or which combination of instruments it applied.Public and Private Roles in Health 65 What government should do . Beyond the prescriptions for how the state should deal with the problems of each of the three domains of health care, several\"dos\" appear to be generally valid for governments. If the objective is to min-imize deadweight losses from public intervention and leave as much room aspossible for private choices, then the first thing governments should do is touse each less-intrusive instrument to the point where a more intrusive inter-vention is justified, following the sequence of increasingly greater interfer-ence\u2014inform, regulate, mandate, finance and provide services. That is,governments should regulate private activity when merely improving people'sinformation is not enough, deliver services if it is infeasible to finance privateproviders equitably, and so on. Public finance is inescapable for some actions,but particularly in low- and middle-income countries much can probably beaccomplished by better use of information and regulation. Failure to use theseother instruments well, can increase the need for public finance. Sometimes the problem is that governments exploit these instruments too little. They do not regulate private insurance when it first begins to expand,which makes subsequent regulation politically more difficult [World Bank1994b; Musgrove 1995c]; or they do not initially react when health-damagingbehaviors such as smoking become more entrenched. Sometimes the prob-lem is inappropriate regulation, which needlessly restricts competition, orenforces inefficiency in the public sector by centralizing nearly all decisions.And poor countries in particular often get the worst of both worlds by pay-ing for activities which should be, but are not, regulated: government subsidyof medical education without adequate control of quality or relation to needsis a common example. In the worst of cases, governments use all the availableinstruments in exactly the reverse order. They try to provide more health carethan they can pay for, with the result that most services are under-financedand of poor quality; they try to finance services, some of which might bemandated and paid for by consumers or employers; they mandate care, as bysocial security systems, without adequately regulating it; and they do too littleto inform the public and providers either of dangers to health or of how thehealth care system is actually working. Much of the criticism of government failure in the health sector, especially in poor countries, describes the result of getting things backwards. Theseideas are represented in Figure 2.3A, which shows the appropriate relationamong the instruments by which the state can intervene in health care, andFigure 2.3B, which portrays the kind of inappropriate or imbalanced relationoften found in poor nations. Figure 2.3A indicates that whatever is mandated,financed or provided publicly should also be regulated, and much else66 Health Economics in Development RRII FFMM PP Information to consumers, providers and insurersI Regulation of personal behaviorand firms, providers and insurersR Mandates for health care orinsurance coverageM Financing of health care (explicitor implicit public insurance)F Provision of health care PFigure 2.3A Appropriate Use of the Instruments of Public Intervention in Health CarePublic and Private Roles in Health 67 PP Information to consumers, providers and insurersI Regulation of personal behaviorand firms, providers and insurers R Mandates for health care orinsurance coverageM Financing of health care (explicitor implicit public insurance)F Provision of health care PRRMM IIFFFigure 2.3B Typically Inappropriate Use of the Instruments of Public Intervention in Health Care68 Health Economics in Development besides. The state can finance some care that is not anyone's mandated responsibility, and can also mandate care or insurance coverage which isfinanced privately. And most if not all public provision should be fullyfinanced by government, but possibly with much more scope for financethan for provision by the state. The largest sphere pertains to information,covering activities in which there is no other public interference with themarket. In contrast, Figure 2.3B shows a much smaller effort to inform orregulate, very little use of mandates that are not also publicly financed, anda sphere of provision as large as, or even larger than, that of finance. Of all the instruments of public action, regulation may be the most under-utilized. Brazil and Chile both provide examples of the resultingproblems. In Brazil, the state finances three-quarters of medical care butdirectly provides only about one-quarter of it, so the instruments of financeand provision are used in the appropriate order. But there is very little reg-ulation of the competence of medical professionals, of the quality of care, orof the rapidly-growing private insurance industry. The lack of regulationeven interferes with financing the system, since private insurers sometimessend their customers to publicly financed facilities without paying for care,and until recently fraud was widespread [World Bank 1994b; Medici andCzapski 1995]. In Chile, the private insurance industry was created by pub-lic action, with essentially no regulation\u2014but with a mandate allowing peo-ple to spend on private insurance, the tax contributions that formerly wereused to finance the public system [World Bank 1994a]. The lack of regula-tion may not have affected medical quality, but it has worsened the financialsituation of public facilities, raised administrative costs, and promoted riskselection. Even more serious failures to regulate have arisen in Eastern andCentral Europe, as former state monopolies of health finance and provisionhave given way to competitive private provision. A second thing governments should do is to stimulate competition in the provision of health care. This is largely a matter of promoting public/private competition, for the reasons described above, but it also includes removingany unjustified barriers to competition within the private sector, and betweenfor-profit and non-profit providers such as non-governmental organizations.The lack of competition is usually less of a problem in the domain of lowcost, health-related activities than in the domain of costlier activities requir-ing insurance. This recommendation extends a fortiori to non-medical components of health care such as the \"hotel\" services of hospitals. How farcompetition should be carried is not always obvious. For example, whetherpublic facilities should make their own purchasing decisions for such inputsPublic and Private Roles in Health 69 as drugs, depends on whether central bulk purchasing reduces costs while maintaining adequate supplies. Even in the latter case, there should of coursebe competition among suppliers for such purchases. Except for the risk that providers will compete by offering more services rather than by raising quality or reducing costs\u2014a risk that is greatest whenpayment is by fee-for service\u2014competition appears to be beneficial in healthcare provision, just as in other industries. Competition is less desirable inhealth care financing, both because administrative costs are likely to be higher and because it is competition among insurers that leads to risk selection.Experience in OECD countries suggests that good results can be obtainedwith one or with many insurers, but only if they are closely regulated. Third, governments should put as much of the incentive for cost con- tainment as possible on the supply side of the market, rather than on con-sumers. This is almost a necessity where poor consumers are concerned,since their poverty already sharply limits what they can spend. But theevidence is that even non-poor consumers do not respond to higher pricesby using health services more cost-effectively. It also appears that providershave considerable scope for controlling expenditure by limiting volume aswell as unit costs. And theory indicates that an optimal payment systemshould use supply-side measures to control costs; reimbursing providersfully according to costs is never the best solution [Ellis and McGuire 1990,1993]. As income increases and poverty declines, of course, it becomes eas-ier to pass the burden of cost containment to consumers. However, it doesnot become medically any more effective or economically any more effi-cient to do so. Moreover, as income increases the capacity for supply-sideresponses by providers also increases, so it continues to be preferable tokeep cost control incentives on the supply side of the market. Finally, it is urgent to deal with the pervasive problem of government fail- ure, and to improve the capacity to do whatever government ends up doing.This is especially important when market failures are so important that forthe public sector to withdraw, on the ground that it also is subject to failure,would only make matters worse. Much of the criticism that governments,particularly in poor countries, try to do too much in health arises because ofhow badly they appear to operate, more than from any evidence that they have exceeded some optimum degree of state intervention. More skill andunderstanding, and fewer internal barriers to efficiency, make sense whetherthe state's role shrinks, as by leaving more provision to the private sector, orexpands, to finance more coverage for the poor. One of the things govern-ments generally need to do better, particularly in poor countries where much70 Health Economics in Development private medical practice may be of low quality, is to use regulation, mandates, training and other interventions to help the private sector function better.This is increasingly recognized as an essential component of almost anyhealth sector reform, and the need for it will only increase as health systemsbecome more expensive and complex. All five instruments of intervention\u2014information, regulation, mandates, finance and provision\u2014need to be usedwell, and using less of one instrument and more of another will not, in gen-eral, reduce the need for governments to perform capably.

Vol. 8, No. 3.77 The Rationale for Government Intervention in the T obacco MarketCHAPTER 3 Acknowledgments I am grateful to all those colleagues at the World Bank who provided the opportunity to work on this subject, including those whose criticismsrequired sharpening the arguments; among the latter, Michael Waltondeserves particular mention. Introduction There is no doubt that prolonged smoking is an important cause of prema- ture mortality and disability worldwide. Strictly on health terms, then, thereis a strong reason to intervene to reduce this damage. However, smoking is voluntary and is not illegal for adults, so the exis- tence of an enormous health problem is not, prima facie, sufficient to justify interference with people's choice to smoke. An economic rationale for such intervention requires that failures in tobacco markets are sufficiently largeto justify the costs of such interference. Despite the strong consensus thatsmoking harms health, there is much debate about proper governmentroles, if any, in reducing smoking (see, for example, The Economist 1997). Co-authored with Prabhat Jha, Frank Chaloupka, and Ayda Yurekli. Excerpted and from Rationale for Government Intervention\", inPrabhat Jha and Frank Chaloupka, eds., T obacco Control Policies in Developing Countries . Oxford: Oxford University Press for the World Bank and the World Health Organization, 2000.78 Health Economics in Development We explore the economic rationale for government intervention in tobacco markets. We first discuss the two key market failures that justifygovernment intervention on efficiency grounds: first, consumers' incom-plete information about the risks of addiction and disease; and, second,external costs. We do not deal with supply side market failures, such as themonopoly power of the tobacco industry. Next, we discuss which interven-tions are available to governments to correct these market failures, notingtheir specificity and effectiveness and their economic costs. We focus in thissection on interventions that would protect children and adult non-smokers, and that would inform adult smokers. Third, we discuss whethergovernment intervention in tobacco markets is appropriate to reduceinequity between rich and poor. This exploration will take account of particular epidemiological features of the tobacco epidemic that are relevant to the economic arguments. The firstof these is the early age at which people typically start smoking, which, inhigh-income countries at least, is during the teen years. The risk of lung can-cer is far higher in individuals who start smoking at age 15 and smoke onepack a day for 40 years than among those who start at age 35 and smoke twopacks a day for 20 years (Peto 1986). Therefore, the early age of onset has adirect bearing on individuals' health risks. From the standpoint of economics,the early typical age of onset is also relevant because the standard economicconcept of consumer sovereignty, which holds that the consumer knows whatis best for him or her, may not apply so forcefully to adolescents as to adults.The second key epidemiological feature of the tobacco epidemic is that fullyhalf of smoking related deaths occur in productive middle age (defined as35-69 years) (Peto et al. 1994). This is relevant to the economic debate about smoking, since it dispels the notion that smoking kills people mostly in oldage, when the economic losses (as well as the health losses) are small. Inefficiencies in the Tobacco Market Smokers clearly receive benefits from smoking; otherwise they would not pay to do it. The perceived benefits include pleasure and satisfaction, stress relief(presumably derived in part from the nicotine content of the smoke), peeracceptance, and a sense of maturity and sophistication (most important foradolescent smokers, and derived from the act of smoking as such). An addi-tional important benefit for the addicted smoker is the avoidance of nicotinewithdrawal. There is little that economics can say about the preferences thatThe Rationale for Government Intervention 79 determine smoking, except to try to understand how the addictive nature of cigarettes influences subsequent consumption. As with other addictive behav-iors, the decision to start and the \"decision\" to continue are quite different,and different economic arguments may be relevant to each. The private coststo be weighed against those benefits include money spent on tobacco prod-ucts, damage to health, and nicotine addiction. Defined this way, the perceived benefits evidently outweigh the perceived costs for at least 1.1 billion people who smoke today. Economic theory assumes that the consumer knows bestand that privately determined consumption will most efficiently allocate soci-ety's scarce resources. Thus, ifsmokers know their risks and internalize all their costs and benefits, there is no justification, on the grounds of ineffi-ciency, for governments to interfere (Pekurinen 1991). However, these assumptions may not hold for several reasons, leading to market failures. (Note that even efficient markets do not necessarily achieveequity, and that inequity is not normally classified as market failure. We dis-cuss equity issues later in the chapter.) Below, we analyze three failures inthe tobacco market. The first is incomplete information about health risks.The second is incomplete information about addiction, specifically thecomplex issue of children's tendency to under-estimate the addictive poten-tial of smoking (and therefore the costs of quitting). The third failure con-sists of costs imposed on others. Incomplete information about health consequences Incomplete information about the risks of smoking leads to behavior that smokers would not otherwise choose for themselves. Poorly-informedsmokers often underestimate the risks of their action (Weinstein 1998).Since people usually react to known risks by reducing the risky consumption,incomplete information means more smoking than would otherwise occur.There are two principal reasons why smokers tend to be inadequatelyinformed. The first is that the market, far from providing information, hasactually hidden or distorted it. The second is the long delay between start-ing to smoke and the onset of obvious disease, which has obscured the linkbetween the two. Each of these are discussed in turn. The tobacco industry,like other industries, has no financial incentive to provide health informationthat would reduce consumption of its products. On the contrary, the indus-try has consistently hidden product information on the ill effects of smokingor actively misinformed smokers about risks (Sweda and Daynard 1996).Notably, the industry has used advertising and promotion to promote its80 Health Economics in Development products as 'safe' despite internal evidence that all types of smoking are harmful. For example, the industry has tried to advertise filter cigarettes as'healthier' (USDHHS 1989). The industry has also used advertising to reachyoung smokers (Institute of Medicine 1994). Other tactics of the industry toleave smokers uninformed or misinformed include dissuading lay journalsfrom reporting on smoking's health effects (Warner et al. 1992), and spon- soring biased scientific research (Bero et al. 1994). Internal industry docu- ments uncovered in recent lawsuits in the United States confirm suchpractices (Glantz et al. 1995). Second, consumers derive information on the costs and benefits of smok- ing primarily from their own experience and what happens to their peers, aswell as from studies largely financed by the public sector. However, the obvi-ous health damage from smoking usually emerges at least 20-30 years afterexposure. This differs from most other risky behaviors, such as fast driving,where the costs and benefits are more readily and immediately appreciated. The long delay between exposure and effect has also impeded the growth of scientific knowledge. In the United States, the 1960s evidence suggestedthat only one in four smokers died from smoking. When risks were re-assessed decades later, when the epidemic had matured, the evidenceshowed that the risks were actually much higher: one in two long-termsmokers die from smoking (see Doll et al. 1994; Peto et al. 1999). Anyone who considered starting or continuing smoking 20 or 30 years ago in high-income countries would, therefore, have under-estimated the risks, even ifhe or she had based the decision on the best available information. More-over, as the list of diseases and conditions associated with smoking expands,smokers continue to under-estimate the risks. Most developing countriesstill do not have estimates of the health hazards of smoking for their ownpopulations. It is, therefore, not surprising that even respectable journals,such as The Economist (1997), reveal their confusion about the scale of the true risks or the high proportion of smokers who die in middle age: \". . . most smokers (two-thirds or more) do not die of smoking- related disease. They gamble and win. Moreover, the years lost tosmoking come from the end of life, when people are most likely to dieof something else anyway.\" As Kenkel and Chen (2000) discuss, there are two key features of con- sumers' incomplete information: first, in low-income and middle-incomecountries, absolute awareness of the health risks is still comparatively low.For example, in China, about two-thirds of adult smokers surveyed in 1996believed that cigarettes did them \"little or no harm\" (Chinese Academy ofThe Rationale for Government Intervention 81 Preventive Medicine 1997). Second, consumers in all countries may not clearly internalize the risks, even when they have been informed aboutthem, nor may they accurately judge the risks of smoking relative to otherenvironmental exposures, such as 'stress' or radiation. Children and teenagers generally know less about the health effects of smoking than adults. A recent survey of 15- and 16-year-olds in Moscowfound that more than half either knew of no smoking-related diseases orcould name only one, lung cancer (Levshin and Droggachih 1999). Even inthe United States, where young people might be expected to have receivedmore information, almost half of 13-year-olds today think that smoking apack of cigarettes a day will not cause them great harm (National CancerPolicy Board 1998). In addition, teenagers\u2014even those with good understanding of the risks of smoking\u2014may have a limited capacity to use information wisely.T eenagers behave myopically, or short-sightedly. It is difficult for mostteenagers to imagine being 25, let alone 55, and warnings about the dam-age that smoking will inflict on their health at some distant date are unlikelyto reduce their desire to smoke. In developing countries, there is less awareness of the hazards of smok- ing at all ages, including among adults, for several reasons. Education levelsare lower, and, since education leads to more rapid and thorough absorp-tion of information, it is reasonable to conclude that less-educated popula-tions will be less receptive to health information. There are fewer local data on the hazards of smoking and less dissemi- nation of existing data on health risks. Governments less often regulateindustry information practices, such as advertising and promotion. For allthese reasons, it is unlikely that current smokers and potential smokers inlow-income and middle-income countries have adequate knowledge fromwhich to make informed decisions. Inadequate information about addiction The second major information failure in the tobacco market involves inad- equate information about nicotine addiction. Smokers acquire psychological addiction to the act of smoking itself, and physical addiction to nicotine (Kessler et al. 1997). Psychological addiction to cigarettes is hardly different from habit formation with respect to other products or practices. Nicotineaddiction, however, is not simply a matter of choice or taste reinforced byrepetition, such as choosing to listen to certain music or keeping companywith dangerous friends. Of course, as with all biologically addictive goods,82 Health Economics in Development many people can change their behavior and quit using nicotine, as the decline in smoking among adults in high-income countries demonstrates.However, the costs of quitting are significant, so much so that some peoplefind quitting virtually impossible. Most smokers who quit have to make sev-eral attempts before they succeed, and former smokers remain vulnerable toresuming smoking at times of stress (USDHHS 1990). Is addiction alone reason enough for governments to intervene against smoking? If children had full information about the likelihood of becomingaddicted and understood the long-run implications of their addiction, theymight conceivably become 'happy addicts' who are maximizing their ownwelfare by smoking. For example, the teenager might argue that it would be'better to suffer lung cancer at age 60 than to suffer Alzheimer's disease atage 80'. Models of so-called 'rational addiction' (Becker and Murphy 1988)assume that individuals maximize utility over their lifetime, taking intoaccount the future consequences of their choices. However, the keyassumptions of the model are that people are fully rational, that they are far-sighted about their choices, and that they have full information on the costsand benefits of their choices. These assumptions are not satisfied in the caseof smoking. Children are more myopic, or 'short-sighted', than adults, andthey typically have less information. Recent extensions to the rational addic-tion model by Orphanides and Zervos (1995) take some of this into accountwhen looking at youthful 'decisions' to become addicted. In their model,imperfect information about addiction early in life can result in seeminglyrational decisions that are later viewed with regret. Other recent theoretical work emphasizes the role of 'adjustment costs' for addictive goods (Suranovic et al. 1999). The presence of these adjust- ment costs, in the context of less than fully rational behavior, implies thatsmokers may continue to smoke while regretting this decision, given thatthe costs of stopping are greater than the costs of continuing. In this con-text, rather than providing benefits, continued smoking for an addictedsmoker is the lesser of two evils. Some might interpret the differencesbetween the short- and long-run price elasticities of demand for an addic-tive good as reflecting the magnitude of these adjustment costs. That is,much of the difference between the long-run and short-run consumer sur-plus may be thought to reflect the adjustment costs. Assuming a lineardemand curve, and given the evidence that the long-run elasticity forcigarette demand is about double the short-run elasticity, this suggests thatas much as half of perceived consumer surplus (based on short-run demand)reflects the adjustment costs associated with addiction.The Rationale for Government Intervention 83 Perhaps most importantly, there is clear evidence that young people under-estimate the risk of becoming addicted to nicotine, and, therefore,grossly under-estimate their future costs from smoking. Among high-schoolseniors in the United States who smoke but believe that they will quit withinfive years, fewer than two out of five actually do quit. The rest are still smok-ing five years later (Institute of Medicine 1994). In high income countries,about seven out of ten adult smokers say they regret their choice to startsmoking and two-thirds make serious attempts to quit during their life(USDHHS 1989). In sum, it is the combination of imperfect informationabout addiction and myopia that results in significant under-estimation ofthe risks of future health damage. In the absence of addiction, teenagerscould more easily quit later, when they become aware of the health risks, asthey tend to do where other risky behaviors are concerned. We discuss thisfurther below. The risk that young people will make unwise decisions is rec-ognized by most societies and is not unique to choices about smoking,although in the case of smoking it is compounded by addiction and inade-quate information. Therefore, most societies restrict young people's powerto make certain decisions. For example, most democracies prevent theiryoung people from voting before a certain age; some societies make educa-tion compulsory up to a certain age; and many prevent marriage before acertain age. The consensus across most societies is that some decisions arebest left until adulthood. Likewise, many societies consider that the freedomof young people to choose to become addicted should be restricted. It might be argued that young people are attracted to many risky behav- iors, such as fast driving or alcohol binge-drinking, and that there is nothingspecial about smoking. However, few other risky behaviors carry the highrisk of addiction that is seen with smoking, and most others are easier toabandon or modify, and are abandoned or modified in maturity (O'Malleyet al. 1998; Bachman et al. 1997). For example, teenagers often binge drink, but most grow to be responsible moderate drinkers later in life. Drivingmotor vehicles is risky, but most young drivers survive long enough to learnto drive more responsibly. With smoking, there is no comparable way tobehave more prudently, except to quit; even cutting back somewhat on con-sumption does not reduce the risks proportionally. Also, compared withother risky behaviors, such as alcohol use, new recruits to smoking face avery high probability of premature death. These factors combined create aprobability of addiction and premature death that is higher than for otherrisk behaviors. Using estimates from Murray and Lopez (1996) and WHO(1999), and studies in high-income countries, we estimate that of 100084 Health Economics in Development 15-year-old males currently living in middle-income and low-income coun- tries, 125 will be killed by smoking before age 70 if they continue to smokeregularly. By comparison, before age 70, 10 will die because of road acci-dents, 10 will die because of violence, and about 30 will die of alcohol-relatedcauses, including some road accidents and violent deaths. The tobacco industry has a clear incentive to subsidize or to give away free cigarettes to potential smokers, especially young people, in order toinduce them to smoke and become addicted to nicotine (Becker et al. 1994; Ensor 1992). The same incentive applies to creating addiction among adultsin low-income and middle-income countries by manipulating price. Thus, at best, nicotine addiction greatly weakens the argument that smokers should exercise consumer sovereignty. Given the myopia of youngconsumers and the likelihood of information failure for all smokers, it isinappropriate to regard an addiction-induced demand as representing gen-uine welfare gains to the smoker. External costs Consumers and producers in any transaction may impose costs or benefits on others, which are known as externalities. The costs\u2014or benefits\u2014imposed by smokers on others are of three types. First are the directphysical costs for non-smokers who are exposed to others' smoke. Secondare the financial externalities that cause monetary loss (or gain) for non-smokers, whether or not they are exposed to smoke. Last (and most diffi-cult to assess) are the so-called 'caring externalities' or 'existence value'effects of smoking, whereby non-smokers suffer emotionally from theillness and death of smokers unrelated to them personally. Physical externalities. Physical externalities from smokers involve both health effects for non-smokers, such as a higher risk of disease or death, and othereffects, such as the nuisance of unpleasant smells, physical irritation, andsmoke residues on clothes, and the greater risks of fire and property damage.The health effects are briefly summarized. They include, for children bornto smoking mothers, low birth weight and an increased risk of various dis-eases (USDHHS 1986; Charlton 1996), and an increased risk of various dis-eases in children and adults chronically exposed to environmental tobaccosmoke either at home or in the workplace (Environmental ProtectionAgency 1992; Wald and Hackshaw 1996). Importantly, the list of diseasesand conditions associated with environmental tobacco smoke is expanding(California Environmental Protection Agency 1997).The Rationale for Government Intervention 85 Financial externalities. Financial externalities are costs that are imposed by smokers but at least partly financed by non-smokers. In countries wherethere is an element of publicly financed healthcare, these include medicalcosts, among them the costs of treating the newborns of mothers whosmoke during pregnancy. Non-smokers also help to pay for the damagefrom fires and the higher maintenance costs of workplaces and homeswhere smokers are present. Here we briefly summarize the key argumentsrelated to healthcare costs and to pensions. In high-income countries, the overall annual cost of healthcare that may be attributed to smoking has been estimated to be between 6% and 15% oftotal healthcare costs. In most low-income and middle-income countriestoday, the annual costs of healthcare attributable to smoking are lower thanthis, partly because the epidemic of tobacco-related diseases is at an earlierstage, and partly because of other factors, such as the kinds of tobacco-related diseases that are most prevalent and the treatments that theyrequire. However, these countries are likely to see their annual smokingrelated healthcare costs rise in the future as the tobacco epidemic matures(World Bank 1992). For those concerned with public spending budgets, it is vital to know these annual healthcare costs and the fraction borne by the public sector,because they represent real resources that cannot be used for other goodsand services. For individual consumers, on the other hand, the key issue isthe extent to which the costs will be borne by themselves or by others. Asthe following discussion shows, the assessment of these costs is complex,and therefore it is not possible yet to draw definitive conclusions aboutwhether or how they may influence smokers' consumption choices. In any given year, on average, a smoker's healthcare is likely to cost more than that of a non-smoker of the same age and sex. However, because smok-ers tend to die earlier than non-smokers, the lifetime healthcare costs of smokers and non-smokers in high income countries may be fairly similar.Studies that measure the lifetime healthcare costs of smokers and non-smokers in high-income countries have reached conflicting conclusions. Inthe Netherlands (Barendregdt et al.1997) and Switzerland (Leu and Schwab 1983), for example, smokers and non-smokers have been found to have sim-ilar costs, while in the United Kingdom (Atkinson and T ownsend 1977) andthe United States (Hodgson 1992), some studies have concluded that smok-ers' lifetime costs are, in fact, higher. Part of this confusion stems from thefact that it is relatively easy to make actuarial estimates of the potentialfor smokers' earlier deaths to bring savings in public health or pension86 Health Economics in Development expenditures. In contrast, the external financial costs of smoking are more difficult to measure reliably, and may be considerably under-estimated(Chaloupka and Warner, 2000). Recent reviews that take account of thegrowing number of tobacco-attributable diseases and other factors con-clude that, overall, smokers' lifetime costs in high-income countries aresomewhat greater than those of non-smokers, despite their earlier deaths(Chaloupka and Warner, 2000). There are no such reliable studies onlifetime healthcare costs in low-income and middle-income countries. Clearly, for all regions of the world, smokers who assume the full costs of their medical services will not impose costs on others, however muchgreater those costs may be than non-smokers'. In developing countries,higher proportions of healthcare costs are borne by private individuals,rather than by the public system (Bos et al. 1999). Nonetheless, even in low- income countries, a significant percentage of medical care, especially thatassociated with hospital treatment, is financed either through governmentbudgets or through private insurance. T o the extent that taxes, co-payments, or social insurance premiums are not differentially higher forsmokers, the higher medical costs attributable to smokers will be at leastpartly borne by non-smokers. T o the extent that private business healthcarecosts are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, or to work-ers in the form of lower wages, any costs incurred by workers who smokewill similarly be partly passed on to non-smokers. However, such costs aresmall in low-income and middle-income countries (Collins and Lapsley1998). Out-of-pocket payments and risk-adjusted insurance schemes do notburden non-smokers with some of the costs of smokers. For private insur-ance, where premiums for non-smokers are lower than for smokers, theremay be little economic justification for public intervention. In reality, how-ever, most health insurance plans are increasingly group-based and containno risk-adjustment for smoking. In low-income and middle-income countries, intra-household transfers of income or welfare may be as important a source of externalities as for-mal, extra-household transfers (James 1994). Manning et al. (1991) and others argue that intra-household transfers are irrelevant, since adults'decisions to smoke are made on behalf of a whole household, and reflectthe preferences of all family members. This is implausible, since adults arelikely to become smokers before marrying or having children. They arelikely to find it difficult to quit later\u2014even if spouses or children urgethem to. Furthermore, very young children, who may be the most severelyaffected by exposure to others' smoke, have no voice in such decisions.The Rationale for Government Intervention 87 Spouses may, in deciding to marry, have taken into account the addiction of their partner, and may, therefore, be said to acquiesce in the decision; butthat is not the same thing as helping to make the decision or approving of it. In high-income countries, public expenditure on health accounts for about 65% of all health expenditures, or about 6% of GDP (Bos et al. 1999). If smokers have higher net lifetime healthcare costs, then non-smokers willsubsidize the healthcare costs of smokers. The exact contribution is comp-lex and variable, depending on the type of coverage and the source of taxa-tion that is used to pay for public expenditures. If, for example, only thehealthcare costs of those over 65 are publicly funded, then the net use ofpublic revenues by smokers may be small, to the extent that many requiresmoking-related medical care and die before they reach this age. Equally, if public expenditure is financed out of consumption taxes, including cigarettetaxes, or if third-party private insurance adjusts smokers' premiums becauseof their higher health risks, then their costs may not be imposed on others.Once again, the situation differs in low-income and middle-income coun-tries, where the public component of total healthcare expenditure is onaverage lower than in high-income countries, at around 44% of the total, or2% of GDP (Bos et al. 1999). However, as countries spend more on health, the share of total expenditure that is met by public finance tends to rise too(World Bank 1993). While it is difficult to assess the relative healthcare costs of smokers and nonsmokers, the issue of pensions has proved at least as contentious, andhas attracted some popular debate. For example, an editorial in The Econo- mist(1995) expressed the view that smokers 'pay their way'. It continued: \". . . what they cost in medical bills, fires and so on, they more than repay in pensions they do not live to collect.\" This assertion is based on analyses from high-income countries that sug- gest that smokers contribute more than non-smokers to pension schemes,because many pay contributions until around retirement age and then diebefore they can claim a substantial proportion of their benefits (Manning1989; Viscusi 1995). There are several problems with this assertion. First,there is an ongoing academic debate over definitions of the social costs ofsmoking, and particularly the extent to which 'savings' from not collectingpensions should be included. Depending on differing assumptions, otherstudies (see, for example, Atkinson and T ownsend 1977) have not found netcosts for smokers to be lower. Second, the issue is not currently relevant tomany of the low-income and middle-income countries where most of the88 Health Economics in Development world's smokers live. In low-income countries, only about one in ten adults has a public pension, and in middle-income countries the proportion isbetween a quarter and half of the population, depending on the incomelevel of the country; private pension plans are less common (James 1994).Finally, and perhaps most importantly, most of these studies have followedtraditional notions of economic externalities, and have not placed any valueon life per se . Even if smokers do reduce the net costs imposed on others by dying young, it would be misleading to suggest that society is better offbecause of these premature deaths. T o do so would be to accept a logic thatsays society is better off without its older adults (Harris 1994). Caring externalities. The third group of externalities that we consider are those that are the most difficult to assess: they are known as 'existence value'or 'caring' externalities (Krutilla 1967). There is evidence that people arewilling to pay for another's well being, even if they do not know the personand even if they do not benefit directly themselves. Public spending onhealth partly reflects such externalities. Existence value is most readilyapplied to children, whom society typically protects more than adults. Incontrast, caring externalities for adults almost directly contradict the notionof consumer sovereignty. Clearly, caring externalities differ across culturesand countries, depending among other things on the importance societyassigns to individual sovereignty. Nonsmokers may be willing to subsidizeefforts to prevent people taking up smoking or efforts to help smokers quit.They may also be prepared to contribute towards the care of sick smokers,even when these represent a financial burden. However, their attitudes maychange over time as knowledge about the health effects of smoking becomesmore widespread and non-smokers' tolerance for smokers may decline(Gorovitz et al. 1998). In any case, there is little solid information of suchwillingness, so it is difficult to use it to formulate public policies. In sum, there are clearly direct costs imposed by smokers on non-smokers, such as health damage. There are probably also financial costs, although it ismore difficult to identify or quantify these. Government Responses to Market Failure: What, For Whom and at What Price? Given that, as we have argued, the markets for tobacco products suffer effi- ciency failures that result in premature death and illness, and costs imposedon others, it is appropriate to ask if government intervention can correctThe Rationale for Government Intervention 89 them. Here we ask whether governments have interventions available to correct these failures, and discuss the costs and effectiveness of theseinterventions. Below we describe briefly those interventions that respond to, or deal with, each of the types of inefficiency in the tobacco market that we havedescribed above. Governments can use information, regulation, taxation, orsubsidies to address these market failures. Government responses to incomplete or erroneous information include, specifically, mass information campaigns, warning labels, and publicly-financed research to create more, or better, or more easily assimilated, infor-mation. All are public goods, which the market is unlikely to provideadequately. Public responses to existing addiction in adults include, specifi-cally, incentives to quit, such as cessation programs (with or without pharma-cological therapies) offered free or at subsidized prices, and educationcampaigns that raise awareness of the risks of smoking and the benefits of ces-sation. In addition, governments can encourage deregulation of the marketfor nicotine replacement therapy. Public responses to preventing new addic-tion in children (discussed in more detail below) include education campaignsabout the danger of addiction, restricting children's access to tobacco prod-ucts, bans on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, and taxa-tion. Increased taxation will also increase cessation rates among adults. Government responses to direct physical externalities include education campaigns emphasizing the right of non-smokers to a smoke-free environ-ment, restrictions on smoking in public places and workplaces, and taxes.Government responses to financial externalities may include risk-adjusted health or pension premiums, or anything that restricts tobacco consumption,whether or not in the presence of non-smokers. These may include taxation,information campaigns, and restrictions on where people can smoke. Government responses to ' existence value ' externalities also include any intervention that restricts consumption and thereby reduces the healthdamage from smoking. Concern for smokers at highest risk\u2014those alreadyaddicted who have smoked for many years\u2014would lead to specific subsidiesfor cessation programs, the deregulation of nicotine replacement markets,and information campaigns emphasizing the dangers of long-term smok-ing. However, in reality, governments do not always aim interventionsdirectly at the sources of market failures themselves, but to particular con-stituencies or population groups affected by those market failures. In thecase of the tobacco market, government intervention is often designed toprotect children.90 Health Economics in Development We turn now to a discussion of the appropriateness of the various avail- able interventions. Choosing 'first-best' and 'second-best' interventions Government intervention in the tobacco market is most easily justified to deter children and adolescents from smoking and to protect non-smokers.But it is also justified for the purposes of giving adults all the informationthey need to make an informed choice. Ideally, government interventionsshould address each identified problem with a specific intervention tailoredto solve that particular problem and none other. These may be thought ofas first-best interventions. However, a neat one-to-one correspondencebetween problems and solutions is not always possible, and some interven-tions may have broader effects. We discuss first-best interventions, theireffectiveness, and their limitations, first for protecting children, then forcorrecting the physical and financial costs imposed by smokers on others,and lastly for informing adult smokers. A common theme emerges: the useof taxes, though a second-best and more blunt instrument, is more effective. Protecting children. Several economists have suggested that protection of children is the most compelling economic argument for higher taxes(Warner et al. 1995). Governments can choose to protect children for sev- eral reasons. First, childhood is when nicotine addiction is likely to begin.Second, children are not yet sovereign adults making informed choices, sothe principal argument for not intervening does not apply to them asstrongly as to adults. Third, there is evidence that the tobacco industry tar-gets children with glamorous advertisements and promotion. Fourth, com-pared with many consumer goods that may appear desirable to children,such as automobiles, cigarettes are generally affordable and accessible: thusthe market does not spontaneously protect children from them. Finally,children have no way to become better or safer smokers as they mature,except by quitting. A priori, parents would ideally always be willing and able to protect chil- dren from tobacco themselves. If this happened, there would be little needfor governments to duplicate such efforts (Musgrove 1999). Perfect parents,however, are rare. Adults may smoke themselves, thereby modeling thisbehavior for their children, and, even though few would actually encouragetheir children to start smoking, they may also fail to educate them about therisks. Parents' responsibilities on the question of smoking are not compara-ble to, say, their responsibilities to ensure their children are immunized.In the latter case, the parent or caregiver has a defined responsibility toThe Rationale for Government Intervention 91 protect the child through a fairly simple action, and the child's lack of infor- mation is irrelevant. The next best public or non-parental interventions would be to try to educate children, restrict advertising and promotion targeted to children,and to restrict their access to tobacco products. As discussed above, infor-mation campaigns have had an important impact on overall declines insmoking in high-income countries. But information campaigns targeted atchildren are likely to be less effective than those targeted at adults, becausechildren discount the future more, and have difficulty considering conse-quences of today's behavior that may not take effect for three or fourdecades. Individual youth-centered programs, including school health pro-grams, have often been found ineffective (Reid 1996). For a specific campaign aimed at children, governments would need to ban advertising and promotion of tobacco products in the media that chil-dren are most often exposed to, such as television or radio. Empirical evi-dence (Saffer 2000) suggests that partial bans cause the tobacco industry toshift to other media, including promotional goods (such as free samples),and sponsorship of sports events, which do influence children (Charltonet al. 1997). Finally, efforts to restrict young people's access to tobacco prod- ucts in shops, restaurants, and bars appear to have had mixed success todate, given that the enforcement of bans is difficult. Moreover, youthrestrictions have relatively high administrative costs (Reid 1996). In contrast to these measures, there is ample evidence that tax increases are the single most effective policy measure for reducing children's consumptionof tobacco products. Young people are more sensitive to price changes thanolder people. Estimates suggest that a tax increase of $2 per pack in theUnited States would reduce overall youth smoking by about two-thirds(National Cancer Policy Board 1998). T o the extent that low-income andmiddle-income countries have younger populations than high-income coun-tries, tax increases would be expected to be effective in these countries too. In theory, if cigarette taxes are to be used mainly to deter children and adolescents from smoking, then the tax on children should be higher thanany tax on adults. Such differential tax treatment would, however, be virtu-ally impossible to implement. Yet a uniform rate for children and adults, thepractical option, would impose a burden on adults. Societies may neverthe-less consider that it is justifiable to impose this burden on adults in order toprotect children. Moreover, if adults reduce their cigarette consumption,children may smoke less, given evidence that children's propensity to smokeis influenced by whether their parents, and other adult role-models, smoke(Murray et al. 1983).92 Health Economics in Development Physical costs imposed on non-smokers. Governments can choose to protect non- smokers from the health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke,including the effects on children and babies born to smoking parents. Theexternalities of maternal smoking for infants are less clear than for other non-smokers exposed to others' smoke, at least where mothers are assumed to haverights over fetuses, including the right to submit them to risks. However, theliterature on the attitudes of pregnant women to their own health and that oftheir fetuses suggests that those who are informed about healthy behaviors aremore likely to act to protect their fetuses' health (Charlton 1996). Costs to non-smokers' health would appear, a priori, to be easily reduced through bans on public and workplace smoking. These 'clean-air' restric-tions have the advantage that they limit the conditions under which peoplecan smoke, without directly addressing the choice of whether to smoke. Itshould be noted that direct physical externalities do not by themselves justifywidespread government interventions, such as advertising and promotionbans, and tax increases, since what matters is not how much people smoke,but whether others are exposed to tobacco smoke. As discussed by Woolleryet al. (2000), restrictions in high-income countries on smoking in public places and private workplaces reduce both smoking prevalence and averagedaily cigarette consumption. Data from developing countries are much lesscomplete, but experience from South Africa suggests that restrictions doreduce smoking (Van der Merwe 1998). Such restrictions are clearly weak-ened where there is a lack of enforcement, or a reliance on self enforcement.However, a more significant problem with this approach is that the vastmajority of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is in homes, and thisis where children are also more likely to be exposed. (Mannino et al. 1996; NCI 1999). In contrast to clean-air restrictions, tax increases, by significantlyreducing smoking in all settings, could lower this cost to children. Financial costs borne by non-smokers would, a priori, be best reduced through adjusted risk premiums on health services or pension services.Financial costs could be calculated over short intervals, but lifetime medicalcosts for today's young smokers are more unpredictable. Private insurancemarkets sometimes include such price differentials, without requiring regu-lation; publicly-financed insurance seldom or never does. As the admini-strative costs for adjusting risk premiums are high, a less precise but moreefficient method would be to simply tax cigarettes at the source. Note thatin contrast to physical externalities, financial externalities would justify suchgeneral consumption-reducing measures, since what matters is how muchpeople smoke rather than where they do it.The Rationale for Government Intervention 93 Giving adult smokers information. Governments can use a number of meas- ures to protect adult smokers' health by inducing them to quit or to smokeless, but this most directly conflicts with the assumption of consumer sov-ereignty, except in the case of smokers who want to quit but find it difficultbecause they are already addicted. Public policy responses include informa-tion about the health risks, subsidization of cessation programs and taxincreases. Only the last of these conflicts with permitting individuals tomake risky decisions (such as playing dangerous sports, or associating withdangerous friends) on the assumption that individuals know their risks andbear the costs of their choices. Providing information, and helping individ-ual smokers who want to quit, are not in conflict with the principal of con-sumer sovereignty. Publicly financed information campaigns and research on the health risks of smoking for adults are justified as a 'first-best' intervention. AsKenkel and Chen (2000) elaborate, such information has had a powerfulimpact on smoking in high-income countries, although the effects taketime to appear. Statutory warnings on tobacco products and regulationson tar and nicotine content are also common throughout the world, butfew countries use strong and varied warning labels that convey meaning-ful information on the hazards of smoking (WHO 1997). An extensionof information measures are bans on advertising and promotion. Suchbans can help smokers to quit or to avoid starting again (USDHHS1990). As discussed above, historically the tobacco industry has usedadvertising to make misleading claims about the health risks. Thus, banson advertising and promotion are justified as a more intrusive but effec-tive intervention. Governments may also deregulate nicotine replacement, finance, or provide cessation advice, or even subsidize cessation treatment. As dis-cussed by Novotny et al. (2000) and Gajalakshmi et al. (2000), an indi- vidual's risk of premature mortality drops sharply on quitting, especiallyat younger ages (Doll et al. 1994). Note that nicotine replacement prod- ucts are not public goods, and are in fact provided by the private mar-ket: smokers wanting to quit can buy private cessation-help programsand nicotine-delivering patches to ease withdrawal. The argument forpublic intervention is only that the private market's response may besub-optimal, partly due to regulation that restricts the public's access tocessation aids. T axation is also an effective intervention. Cigarettes are taxed in nearly all countries, sometimes heavily, but mainly because of the administrative94 Health Economics in Development ease of collecting tobacco taxes and the relatively inelastic demand. Adults are less price-responsive than children to increases in tobacco tax. The economic costs of intervening Given that the effective interventions do not neatly correspond to the mar- ket failures they were designed to correct, an important consideration iswhether they also generate further economic costs that may be worse thanthe original market failure. This specifically applies to taxes, given that theyare the most blunt, and also most effective, measure to protect children.Below we discuss the key economic costs of intervening, including the costsof foregone pleasure from smoking. Unfortunately, there are few empiricalstudies of the economic costs of intervening (Warner 1997). We focus on theconceptual framework of costs from various interventions, emphasizing thecosts to individuals. We do not discuss costs to producers. Estimates by Pecket al. (2000) suggest that consumer satisfaction is the lion's share of any plau- sible estimate of benefits from smoking, with producers' benefits being muchsmaller. Ranson et al. (2000) provide estimates of cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the public sector. Control measures would cause regular smok-ers to forego the pleasure of smoking, or incur the costs of quitting, or both.A priori, this loss of consumer surplus would appear to be the same as itwould be for bread or any other consumer good. However, tobacco is not atypical consumer good with typical benefits. For the addicted smoker whoregrets smoking and expresses a desire to quit, the benefits of smoking arelargely the avoidance of the costs of withdrawal. If tobacco control measuresreduce individual smokers' consumption, those smokers will face significantwithdrawal costs. Furthermore, the costs would differ between current smok-ers and potential smokers who have not yet begun. Clean-air restrictions impose costs on smokers by reducing their oppor- tunities to consume cigarettes, or by forcing them outdoors to smoke, rais-ing the time and discomfort associated with smoking, or by imposing finesfor smoking in restricted areas. Such restrictions raise the individual's costsrelative to his or her benefits, and prompt some smokers to quit or cut backtheir consumption. For non-smokers, however, restrictions on smoking inpublic places will bring welfare gains. Given that most regular smokersexpress a desire to quit but few are successful on their own, it seems likelythat the perceived costs of quitting are greater than the perceived costs ofcontinuing to smoke, such as damage to health. By making the costs of con-tinued smoking greater than the costs of withdrawal, higher taxes canThe Rationale for Government Intervention 95 induce some smokers to quit. However, smokers who quit or cut back would face withdrawal costs from higher taxes. The extent of the lossdepends on levels of tax already paid, price responsiveness, and other fac-tors (see Chaloupka and Warner, 2000, for a related discussion on the dis-tributional impacts of taxes). In considering economic costs to smokers, it is important to distinguish between regular smokers and others. For children and adolescents who areeither beginners or merely potential smokers, the costs of avoiding tobaccoare likely to be less severe, since addiction may not yet have taken hold and,therefore, withdrawal costs are likely to be lower. Other costs may include,for example, reduced acceptance by peers, less satisfaction from thethwarted desire to rebel against parents, and the curtailment of other pleas-ures of smoking. Bans on advertising and promotion might be expected to increase the costs for smokers of obtaining information about their preferred products.However, to the extent that tobacco advertising focuses more on establish-ing brand loyalty among the new smokers it attracts rather than on provid-ing information of value to current smokers, even established adult smokerswould suffer little information loss or search costs if advertising and pro-motion were banned (Chapman 1996). In sum, interventions in the smoking market vary by specificity to the market failure and groups most affected. It is obvious that some interventionsare fairly specific to particular problems. This is notably the case for bans onsmoking in public places, which are intended to control physical externalities.It is also the case for measures to make smokers pay any additional medicalcosts due to their behavior, which are intended to control financial external-ities. But measures that are aimed at reducing cigarette consumption, ratherthan controlling where it occurs or who pays the associated costs, are muchmore general. T axation and information campaigns are both measures of thistype. When it comes to protecting or affecting particular population groups,there is similarly a mixture of more specific and more general connectionsbetween an intervention and the group(s) it is meant to affect. Government Interventions to Protect the Poor Aside from government interventions to correct for market failures, inter- vention to protect the poor is a well-recognized government role (Musgrove1999). Investing in health is one method, but another is to reduce poverty96 Health Economics in Development or alleviate its consequences (World Bank 1993). We examine next the issues of how smoking burdens are distributed and the equity implicationsof some of the interventions analyzed above. In most countries of the world, tobacco consumption is highest among poorer socioeconomic groups, and, accordingly, so is the incidence oftobacco-related disease. Comparison between countries reveals that thepoor have higher death rates from smoking-related diseases. Moreover, thepoor spend a considerable amount on tobacco as a percentage of theirhousehold income, which adversely affects household consumption of itemsbeneficial to children's health (Cohen 1981; World Bank 1993). T o someextent, the market failure of incomplete information is more pronouncedamong the poor (T ownsend et al. 1994). Government interventions to reduce the impact of smoking among the poor include taxation, information, and subsidizing access to cessationadvice or nicotine replacement therapies (NRT). Differences in the relativeimportance of different problems imply that the optimal combination ofinterventions should probably be different for poor and non-poor popula-tions. Several studies suggest that information is less effective in reducingsmoking among poor groups than among richer groups (see, for example,USDHHS 1989; T ownsend 1998). Smoking prevalence has declined muchfaster among higher socio-economic groups than among lower groups. Theprovision of information (such as mass information campaigns and warninglabels), and bans on advertising and promotion are justified on efficiencygrounds. There is little doubt, however, that the poor would use such infor-mation less, or less quickly, than would the rich. Another strategy would beto finance or provide cessation advice and cessation aids to help the poorquit smoking if they could not afford to pay for them (Musgrove 1999), pro-vided the effects justify the costs. Delivering these services may be costly ordifficult, however, since the poor tend to have less access to basic healthservices than the rich, and the costs of expanding these services to reach thepoor might be considerable. In contrast to information, tax increases on tobacco reduce consumption more among the poor and less educated than among the rich and more edu-cated. Evidence from the United Kingdom and the United States (CDC1998; T ownsend 1998; Chaloupka 1991) suggests that price elasticities inthe lowest income groups are significantly higher than in the highestincome groups. T obacco taxation would thus narrow the difference in con-sumption between rich and poor (Warner et al. 1995). In high-income countries, the poor usually spend a larger share of their incomes on tobaccoThe Rationale for Government Intervention 97 than do the rich. Thus, a tax on tobacco is necessarily regressive among those who continue to smoke . Whether the overall effect of tax increases is regres- sive, depends on what share of each group, poor and non-poor, would reactto the higher price by quitting. If more of the poor quit, then the tax effectcould even be progressive. T obacco taxes, like any other single tax, need towork within the goal of ensuring that the entire system of tax and expendi-ture is proportional or progressive (T ownsend 1998; Chaloupka andWarner, in press). Studies of tobacco taxation in the United States and theUnited Kingdom suggest that tax increases are less regressive than pre-sumed, and may even be progressive. In contrast to the taxation of othergoods, when the poor reduce their consumption of tobacco they gain ahealth benefit in return for the tax burden they continue to pay. Finally, thepoor may benefit in another way from increased tobacco taxes, if health andsocial services are targeted to the poor and financed by those taxes (Saxenianand McGreevey 1996; WHO 1999). It might be argued that taxes and other tobacco control measures would impose bigger costs on poor individuals. But if this is true for tobacco, it isnot unique in public health. Compliance with many health interventions,such as child immunization or family planning, is often more costly for poorhouseholds. For example, poor families may have to walk longer distancesto clinics than rich families and may lose income in the process. Yet healthofficials do not hesitate to argue that the health benefits of most interven-tions, such as immunization, are worth the cost, provided the costs do notrise so high that poor individuals are deterred from using services. In summary, the fact that the poor devote relatively more of their income to tobacco does not provide any strong equity-based argument against thetobacco control measures analyzed here. Conclusion We have described specific failures in the tobacco market: first, inadequate information about the health risks of smoking; second, inadequate informa-tion about the risks of addiction (and particularly the youthful onset of useof an addictive product); and, third, the external costs of smoking. We arguethat because of these market failures, government intervention is justifiedon economic grounds. However, the interventions themselves are oftennon-precise and impose costs on even informed adult smokers. What thendo these findings imply for public policy?98 Health Economics in Development First, the public health arguments and the economic arguments for tobacco control differ on goals. Public health goals would, rationally, be toeradicate smoking if possible, given that tobacco hazards increase withincreasing exposure and overwhelm any possible beneficial effects onhealth. In contrast, the economic arguments suggest that the socially opti-mal level of consumption of tobacco would not be zero. Ideally in economicterms, children would not smoke, but adults who knew their risks and boretheir costs entirely themselves could smoke (Warner 1998). Such a situation would involve considerably less smoking than at present, but would stop well short of eradication. Preventing children from smokingcould, in theory, eventually lead to the epidemic disappearing. In reality,slightly older cohorts may take up smoking, and it is unlikely that therecruitment of new smokers would cease. Several of the interventions dis-cussed here, particularly those designed to prevent smoking in youth, pro-tect non-smokers from externalities, and leave smokers better informed. However, a major problem for the 'economically optimal' view of smok- ing is the fact that nicotine is addictive. This undermines the consumer-sovereignty argument against intervention, because all evidence suggeststhat the conditions for a rational choice to become addicted are not met,and the addicted smoker is to some degree a different person from the onewho decided to start smoking. If addiction is taken into account, a 'middle-ground' rationale that is justifiable by both economic and public healtharguments becomes feasible. It still falls short of eradication, but is morerealistic and justifiable than a purely economics-led view that defines adultconsumers as rational and informed. The economic rationale for interven-tion described here largely involves information and regulation, and notdirect public finance or the provision of private goods, except perhaps to thepoor. As such, it leaves much room for private choice. As with other areas of public policy, governments have to make choices, drawing here on economics, epidemiology, and public health. Even limitedreductions in the prevalence of smoking, achieved as the result of interven-tions to correct market failures, would, by any measure, constitute an enor-mous public health victory, avoiding millions of deaths per year.

None of these concepts issimple to define or measure, so it is not surprising that no indicators ofprogress towards them have been adopted, in contrast to the situation for anumber of more specific goals such as high life expectancy or low infantmortality. However, a number of simple indicators can be used to tell some-thing about equity, even if there is no single measure of it. This article dis-cusses the logic behind various such indicators, drawing on recent datafrom Peru for empirical illustration. Equity as Equality of Treatment The fundamental idea of equity is that of equal treatment for all the popula- tion. The intention is to assure good health for all, and as far as possible,equally good health, to be pursued through preventive or curative treatment.Equity cannot simply be identified with equality in general, because of dif-ferences in needs, but it can be judged by considering certain kinds of equal-ity. The idea may be \"to provide 100% of the population with access tohealth services\" (1), but the crucial notion is that whatever the level of access,it should be the same for all. Inequity results from differences in the ability to obtain health care, whatever the reasons may be, that prevent some peopleand not others from getting medical assistance (2). Since illness and accidentare randomly and non-uniformly distributed, it cannot be expected that Reprinted, with permission, from World Health Statistics Quarterly 39 (4), 1986.106 Health Economics in Development everyone will see a doctor equally often, or that spending per person on health care will be the same for all groups in the population. T reatment andresources should go where they are most needed. It is to be expected, how-ever, that if the health-care system is equitable, certain probabilities will be equal across population groups for a given set of health problems. Probabilities of illness, treatment and recovery This idea is shown schematically in Fig. 4.1. Within a given interval of time, a person may or may not become sick or hurt; he or she may receive treat-ment or may not; and there may or may not be a cure as the result of treat-ment, or a recovery in the absence of treatment. The complete passage froman initial state to a final state (health, illness, disability or death) can bedescribed by just four probabilities, indicated by the bold arrows in Fig. 4.1.These are: P(S) the unconditional probability of needing medical care P(T/S) the conditional probability of receiving treatment, given the need for it P(C/T) the conditional probability of being cured by treatmentP(R/T*) the conditional probability of recovering without treatment If the chance of being treated when there is no need for it\u2014shown by the dashed arrow\u2014is excluded from consideration, then every other probability,including those of final good health and ill health, P(H) and P(H*), is justsome combination of these four basic probabilities (3). Figure 4.1 Schematic Stages of Illness or Accident, Treatment and Outcome S(Yes) T(Yes) C*(No) H*(Ill health, disability or R*(No) death) Initial Symptom, Treatment, Cure (C) or Final state sickness, consultation untreated state accident recovery (R) C(Yes) T*(No) R(Yes) S*(No)H (Health)Measurement of Equity in Health 107 Different Dimensions of Equity This scheme simplifies a great deal, but it serves to emphasize several issues to consider in attempting to judge the equity of a health service system.Among these are: Which stage of the sequence is analyzed. The system might, for example, provide roughly the same chance of being cured to all patients who receivetreatment, but be inequitable in reaching some people for treatment muchmore readily than others. The difference between prevention, which acts on P(S), and curative treatment, which involves P(T/S) and P(C/T). Some differences in the likelihood ofgetting sick or hurt should not be considered inequitable, since they areassociated with age or other risk factors largely outside the control of thehealth care system. Other differences in P(S)\u2014for example, in the chanceof getting diphtheria or poliomyelitis\u2014are inequitable because preventionis within the power of the system and can be applied equally to virtually theentire population. The particular condition, illness or need, studied. A health care system may provide everyone with the same chance of emergency care after a motor-vehicle accident, but maintain marked inequalities in the treatment of can-cer or tuberculosis. The level or quality of treatment. Does equity require the same type of care for everyone who is treated for a particular condition? Or should the sys-tem be regarded as equitable if every patient gets at least a minimal ade-quate level of care, even though some receive more elaborate, prolonged orexpensive treatment (3)? A similar issue arises in analyzing the distributionof income: does equity require equality of incomes, or is what matters adecent minimum income for everyone? This issue becomes particularlyimportant when analyzing expenditure on medical care. The interaction of supply (physical availability of services) and demand (individual perception of need) in determining who does and who does not get treatment. For example, is it fair to describe a system as inequitable if it provides relatively lit-tle care to a cultural group which is more stoic than average, or more likely torely on home remedies or traditional healers? How much responsibility fallsto the government to change such cultural patterns so as to relate medicalneed and individual demand in the same way for the whole population? All these questions show clearly why there cannot be a single measure of how equitable a health care system is: the same system may be quite fair by108 Health Economics in Development some indicators, and grossly inequitable according to others. It is no more possible to judge a country's health services as to equity by just one numberthan it is to summarize the population's health status in one indicator. Finally, there is one important issue which is not clear from Fig. 4.1. In order to estimate and compare probabilities, the population must be dividedinto groups on some basis. How this is done may greatly affect the appar-ent inequality. Just as income typically is distributed more unequally amongeducational classes than among geographical regions, the health care systemmay look much more equitable in one dimension than in another. An ade-quate evaluation will probably require that the population be divided inmore than one way, for example, by socioeconomic criteria as well as bygeographical location. Several of the issues discussed above can be illustrated by recent data from Peru. These include the usual administrative data collected by the Ministryof Health and analyzed by the country's Central Reserve Bank 1, household level information obtained in the 1984 National Health and Nutrition Sur-vey, and analyses conducted as part of the 1985-1986 National Health SectorAnalysis by various public and private agencies in Peru, with financing fromthe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) 2. Not all the possible measures of equity can be computed\u2014there are, for example, no data on the probability of cure or of spontaneous recovery\u2014but a variety of indicators is available. Distribution of health-related resources In comparing different countries, it is common to refer to the share of the population which has access to safe water or sewerage connections, or tocompute the ratio of population to such health care resources as physiciansor hospital beds. The same analysis can be carried out within a country, asillustrated in T able 4.1. This comparison shows that physicians are veryhighly concentrated, especially in the department of Lima, which has justover a quarter of the population but two-thirds of all the physicians in Peru.Nurses are much more equally distributed, although still tending to con-centrate in the same departments as physicians. Hospital beds are slightlymore equally distributed, and access to safe water still more so. In general,expensive resources seem to be more concentrated than cheaper ones(physicians vs. nurses, and sanitation vs. water supply). These rather easy indicators, which need no information about the pop- ulation except place of residence, suffer three important limitations asMeasurement of Equity in Health 109 measures of equity. Firstly they are restricted to geographical comparisons; without knowing who actually consults the physicians, one cannot knowtheir distribution according to other dimensions of the population, such asincome. Secondly, it is implicitly assumed that needs are uniformly dis-tributed. This is probably a reasonable assumption for sanitation facilities,but is questionable for health needs. The incidence or prevalence of healthproblems may differ substantially from one region to another, so that anequitable distribution of resources would in fact be unequal, not uniform.Third, it is presumed that the resources or facilities analyzed answer theTable 4.1 Measures Related to Equity in Health Care, Peru, 1982: Health Care Resources and Sanitation Services (Percentages of National Total) RESOURCES DWELLINGS HOSPITAL WITH WITH DEPARTMENT POPULATION PHYSICIANS NURSES BEDS TOTAL WATER SEWERAGE Amazonas 1.5 0.0 0.1 0.3 2.4 0.6 0.4 Ancash 4.8 1.2 3.4 2.7 5.1 4.5 3.7Apur\u00edmac 1.9 0.1 0.5 0.7 2.2 0.5 0.2Arequipa 4.2 5.3 8.2 6.8 4.3 5.7 6.0Ayacucho 2.9 0.2 1.3 0.9 2.6 1.5 0.7Cajamarca 6.1 0.5 0.6 0.9 6.3 2.0 1.4Callao 2.7 6.3 4.5 4.9 2.3 4.4 5.3Cuzco 4.9 1.0 2.2 2.9 5.4 2.6 2.1Huancavelica 2.0 0.1 0.4 0.7 2.4 0.6 0.4Hu\u00e1nuco 2.8 0.6 0.6 1.5 2.9 1.0 0.9Ica 2.5 2.8 3.8 3.7 2.5 3.1 2.4Jun\u00edn 5.0 1.5 4.0 4.5 5.3 4.3 3.1La Libertad 5.6 4.9 5.5 4.9 5.5 6.5 6.1Lambayeque 4.0 2.6 5.4 3.8 3.5 4.5 4.3Lima 28.1 66.6 50.7 48.4 26.4 45.1 52.8Loreto 2.6 0.8 0.7 1.5 2.2 2.0 1.8Madre de Di\u00f3s 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.0 0.1Moquegua 0.6 0.7 0.2 1.1 0.2 0.7 0.7Pasco 1.2 0.6 1.2 1.7 1.3 0.8 0.6Piura 6.6 2.3 2.7 3.2 6.1 5.2 4.2Puno 5.2 0.5 1.5 1.6 6.4 1.5 0.8San Mart\u00edn 1.9 0.2 0.5 0.8 1.7 0.9 0.3Tacna 0.9 0.6 1.3 1.4 0.9 1.5 1.4Tumbes 0.6 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.5 0.1 0.1Ucayali 1.2 0.3 0.3 0.6 1.0 Peru] . Lima, Central Reserve Bank of Peru, 1984.110 Health Economics in Development needs of the population. Again this is a more reasonable assumption for sanitation facilities, although the health effects of safe water may differconsiderably depending on the pattern of illness in a region and thehygienic behavior of the population. For health care the assumption is stillmore questionable: treatment by a physician may not be necessary in manycases; many physicians may be engaged in teaching or research; patientswith more difficult problems may travel to other departments for treat-ment; etc. Thus while these measures say something about equality in thedistribution of resources, and consequently in expenditure or health care,they should not be assumed to be the only or the best indicators of theequity of the system. Probabilities of need and of treatment A principal weakness of the resource vs. population comparisons in T able 4.1 can be overcome by referring to the morbidity and utilizationdata obtained from a large sample of the Peruvian population in the 1984survey, and given in T able 4.2. With one dramatic exception, among theurban population of the country's mountainous central region, the prob-ability of presenting with some illness or symptom was fairly uniform, at Table 4.2 Measures Related to Equity in Health Care in Peru, 1984: Morbidity and Medical Attention PERCENTAGE SEEKING MEDICAL PREVALENCE (%) OF SYMPTOMS ATTENTION WITH SYMPTOMS ALL RESPIRATORY PARASITIC ALL UNDER OVER AREA KINDS DISEASE INFECTION TOTAL AGES 1 YEAR 1-4 YEARS 4 YEARS Coast National health and nutrition survey, Peru, 1984 (unpublished). Measurement of Equity in Health 111 about one-third, during the two-week reference period. The uncondi- tional probability of seeking medical care (including a visit to a pharmacy,but excluding home care), however, ranged from almost 15% in Limadown to less than 5% in rural mountainous areas. Consequently, the condi-tional probability P(T/S) ranged from over one-third in Lima to 12.5% inthe rural mountainous areas. If equity means equal likelihood of attention\u2014not necessarily the certainty of attention, since many illnesses and symp-toms do not require more than home care\u2014then the Peruvian health caresystem shows dramatic geographical inequity. Several other features of these estimates merit consideration. For one thing the \"geographical dimension\" has several possible meanings. The datain T able 4.2 are presented according to the survey area, in order to bring outurban/rural differences. For Peru as a whole, P(T/S) is more than twice ashigh in urban areas as it is in rural areas. The results could instead be shownaccording to the \"health regions\" of the Ministry of Health, which are usedin T able 4.3. Neither of these classifications matches the departmentalboundaries used in T able 4.1, although the health regions correspondapproximately to departments or combinations of them. Table 4.3 Measures Related to Equity in Health Care in Peru, 1984 Consultations, Hospitalizations and Expenditures (Percentages of National Total) POPULATION MINISTRY OF HEALTH HEALTH WITH PATIENT-RELATED REGION TOTAL SYMPTOMS CONSU LTATIONS HOSPITALIZATIONS have been adjusted to 100% over the rest of the country.112 Health Economics in Development Differences by illness and by age. The relative uniformity of total morbidity hides larger variations for specific illnesses or symptoms. Respiratory dis-ease affected from under 10% to over 17% of the population, while para-sitic diseases, although unimportant overall, were extremely frequent in thejungle, and especially in rural areas. Conditional probabilities of treatmentcan be calculated separately for different causes such as these. T able 4.2 alsoshows that P(T/S) varies considerably by age, because infants under 1 yearhave a much higher likelihood of receiving medical care than do older chil-dren. This presumably reflects the greater risk of a serious illness in the firstyear of life. Inequality, however, appears to be worse where treatment ofinfants is concerned: for example, the urban/rural differential in the proba-bility of care is greater for infants than for other age groups. Thus higheroverall coverage or utilization of services need not imply greater equity orless inequality. Equity in vaccination coverage. As the comparison of infants and older children emphasizes, illnesses and symptoms differ in danger or severity,and this may account for much of the variation in the likelihood ofobtaining medical care. Not all such differences can be interpreted asindications of inequity. In order to control for this source of variation, itmay be advisable to study equity with respect to a single well-definedneed or condition. This is done in T able 4.4, for vaccination against thesix target diseases of the Expanded Programme on Immunization, for allchildren under 5: first by type of vaccine and then according to theschooling of the child's mother. (This is one of the few analyses so far pre-pared using a socioeconomic classification; eventually the survey data willallow classification by income, or a proxy variable for it, as well as by edu-cational level.) Comparison across the four types of vaccines shows clearly that as the total coverage drops, the inequality of coverage increases. For BCG vac-cine, the urban/rural differential is less than 2:1, reaching about 2:1 formeasles vaccination and close to 4:1 for protection against poliomyelitis,diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. This national pattern isrepeated within the mountain and jungle regions of the country. The dif-ferential is considerably less in the relatively favoured coastal region. Ofcourse, as the national coverage approaches 100%, inequality necessarilydisappears; but the great inequity occurring in rural areas when coverageis low reflects the very poor protection against these diseases in thoseareas.Measurement of Equity in Health 113 A somewhat similar pattern emerges when vaccination coverage is com- pared across educational levels. As the educational level rises, so does vac-cination coverage, and the geographical inequality diminishes. It is also truethat the lower the coverage in a given geographical area, the greater is theinequality across educational groups. Thus the most marked socioeco-nomic inequity occurs in the rural mountainous areas, where overallTable 4.4 Measures Related to Equity In Health Care in Peru, 1984: Vaccination Coverage (%) of Children under 5. BY TYPE OF VACCINE AREA BCG POLIO DPT MEASLES ALL PRIMARY nutrition survey . Peru, 1984 (unpublished).114 Health Economics in Development protection is extremely low, and the least inequity is found in Lima. Chil- dren of less educated mothers, presumably in poor families, are the last tobe reached, except for urban slums. This pattern probably reflects demandfor vaccination on the part of parents, and not simply differences in avail-ability: better educated mothers are more likely to bring their children tobe vaccinated, without requiring a public campaign to persuade them to doso, and are better able to pay a private physician for service if necessary.While the inhabitants of the slums of Lima may be very poor, T ables 4.2and 4.4 also show that they are not a particularly underprivileged group inaccess to health care. Summary measures of inequality The emphasis in T ables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 is on all the differences among geo- graphical regions or socioeconomic groups, since any of these differencesmay be particularly important for the interpretation of how equitable orinequitable a health care system is, and where its inequities are concen-trated. It is also possible to calculate summary measures of inequality, andto use them to form overall judgments about whether one distributionrepresents a more or less equitable situation than another (3). All suchmeasures, however, discard information, and the way a particular statisticsummarizes a distribution corresponds to assumptions that may or may notbe appropriate when judging equity. Because it has an easy geometric inter-pretation, the Gini coefficient is often used for this purpose; it is applied, forexample, in the Central Reserve Bank's analysis for Peru. The coefficient iscalculated by first drawing the Lorenz curve, which relates the cumulatedpopulation across groups to the cumulated resource or utilization measurestudied, ranking the groups from lowest to highest values of resources percapita. The Lorenz curve corresponding to the departmental distribution ofphysicians in Peru, calculated from T able 4.1, is shown in Fig. 4.2 It indi-cates, for example, that the departments where physicians are most scarcehave 70% of the country's population but only about 28% of its physicians.The diagonal line corresponds to perfect equality in the ratio of physiciansto population. The Gini coefficient is the ratio of the area between the diag-onal and the Lorenz curve, to the total area under the diagonal, a measurewhich increases from 0 to 1 as inequality increases. As T able 4.1 shows, thismeasure is higher for physicians than for any of the other health-relatedresources considered. The Lorenz curve can also be used to representinequality or inequity without calculating the Gini coefficient or any othersummary statistic.Measurement of Equity in Health 115 Financial Measures of Equity Physicians, nurses, drugs, vaccines and other resources and supplies are used to produce health services, but none alone is an adequate measure ofresources used in health care. The best overall measure of the resources ded-icated to health services is the cost of producing those services. This raisestwo equity-related questions. The first concerns the equality of expenditureacross population groups; the second concerns the relation between the costof providing health services and the contributions different groups make toFigure 4.2 Lorenz Curves of Inequality of the Distribution of Physicians Relative to Population (by Department) and of Ministry of Health Patient-related Expenditure Relative to Population with Symptoms (by Health Region),Peru, 1982 Cumulated percentage of physicians and of expenditure Cumulated percentage of population (total, or with symptoms)Physicians per capita Expenditure per person with symptoms 0 0102030405060708090100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100116 Health Economics in Development that cost, either by direct payment (fees for service) or by taxation. Both questions are particularly important for the equity of ministry of health serv-ices, which are typically financed largely from general government revenuesand which are usually intended to cover the population groups too poor topay for private medical care, and unlikely to be protected by the medicalservices of the social security system. Equity in the distribution of expenditure Variations in expenditure per capita on health care can be separated into dif- ferences in the likelihood of being sick or needing care, in the likelihood ofreceiving care, and in the cost per patient of the care given. Estimates oftotal cost by health region in Peru have been made for the years 1982-1984;these can be separated into costs related to individual patients, and thoseattributable to preventive and maintenance activities. Costs for the formercan then be compared to total population, to the population presenting ill-ness or symptoms and needing care, or to the population which actuallyreceives care. Some of these estimates for 1984 appear in T able 4.3, classi-fied by health region. The first of these measures\u2014cost per capita\u2014is oftenused as an indicator of equity, but like the indicators in T able 4.1, it suffersfrom the untested assumption that needs are everywhere proportional topopulation. At the other extreme, cost per consultation leaves out much thatis important for equity; the cost per consultation could be uniform, yet thehealth system would not be equitable if the chance of getting attention var-ied widely among population groups. Thus the best measure of equity inspending on health care seems to be expenditure per person needing assis-tance\u2014ideally this indicator would not include persons with symptoms toominor to require medical attention. Expenditure and morbidity. It appears from T able 4.3, that patient-related expenditures are distributed more equitably in Peru than are some of theresources which help account for those costs. The Lima health region, forexample, has about one-third of the country's population, a slightly largershare of those with illness or symptoms, two-thirds of Peru's physicians, butless than half of spending attributable to individual treatment. This percep-tion is confirmed by Fig. 4.2, which compares the Lorenz curve for expen-diture per sick person to that for physicians per capita. The former distri-bution is systematically much more equitable: the very unequal distributionof physicians undoubtedly overstates the inequity of the Peruvian healthcare system. Differences in unit costs contribute to total inequality, but theirMeasurement of Equity in Health 117 impact is small compared to the effect of differences in the likelihood of receiving treatment: costs per consultation, for example, vary over a rangeof only 2:1 in most of the health regions, and even those differences maydepend on regional variations in the incidence of particular diseases or con-ditions, some of which in fact cost more to treat than others. These resultsonly reinforce the conclusion that the chief source of health care inequity inPeru is variation in the probability of getting medical attention when sick. Inequality without inequity. Equity is related to, but not identical with equality: thus, as remarked earlier, there can be inequality which is not nec-essarily inequitable. Suppose, for example, that while the cost per consulta-tion in 1984 ranged from 8,845 to 23,843 soles among Peruvian health regions, adequate care could be given for a unit cost of 15,000 soles. That is, higher unit costs represent inefficiency, use of overqualified personnel, etc.Then, adequate medical care could have been given to all those patientsattended, for only 85% of what was spent. This situation is shown in Fig. 4.2, where the hatched area represents real inequity, and the dottedarea represents inequality. The former is due mostly to differences in theprobability of receiving care, plus some inequality in unit costs below15,000 soles, suggesting inadequate care, on average, in some regions. The latter is due entirely to average expenditures exceeding that level in somehealth regions. While the choice of a unit cost of 15,000 soles is arbitrary and used here only for illustration, the argument that not all inequality repre-sents real inequity in health care is quite general. The logic of this compar-ison is similar to that involved in drawing a \"poverty line\" in the distribu-tion of income, and regarding as inequitable the fact that some incomes arebelow that line, without being concerned with differences in income amongthose above the poverty line. Equity as getting what you pay for The comparison of costs or expenditure to population or to medical needs still does not ask how those expenditures are paid for. T o medical profes-sionals, equity is usually interpreted in terms of the satisfaction of needs, andquestions of payment arise only as possible obstacles to obtaining medicalcare. This is a somewhat different matter from the satisfaction felt by thepatient or consumer, because his demand for health care may not coincidewith his need as determined by a physician. Equity could also be consideredto require the satisfaction of wants or demands. T o economists, however,equity has another meaning: that the distribution of health care expenditure118 Health Economics in Development should be less unequal than the distribution of income, or that there should be a net subsidy (expenditure minus tax contributions) to population groupswith low incomes, and a net contribution by groups with high incomes.Equity then becomes a question of the amount and direction of net subsi-dies. Studies with this orientation commonly find that public health carespending is progressive when compared to the distribution of income, andalso that it is more equitable than some other kinds of public social expen-diture such as spending on education (4). That is, compared to what they payin taxes, the poor usually get a net benefit from public health care, whereasthey may suffer a net loss in certain other categories of government expen-diture. This kind of analysis has not yet been conducted for Peru, althoughstudies have been completed in several other Latin American countries. Thefirst of these recent studies to be published concerns Chile 3. It is important to note that these two concepts of financial equity in health care\u2014expenditure relative to need, and expenditure relative to pay-ment\u2014may, but will not necessarily, coincide. If a particular populationgroup contributes nothing and receives little or nothing, that will be equi-table according to one criterion but not the other. This question becomesparticularly important if the object is to judge the equity of a public healthservice system, when there is also private fee-for-service medical care avail-able. Is the public system equitable if it provides access to those who cannotafford private care, ignoring those who can and do buy medical attentionfrom private providers? Or does equity require the public system to reach,and subsidize, those poor consumers who now pay for private servicesbecause they are more accessible, or believed to be of better quality, thanpublic services? The answers to these questions determine which indicatorsto construct, and how to interpret the available information. Concluding Reflections Equity is too complex a concept to be reduced to a single indicator; to ana- lyze it necessarily requires a great deal of information and some subjectivejudgment as to what kinds of inequality in fact constitute inequity. However,many indicators can be constructed which are related to equity, or whichhelp to measure it. The empirical discussion of the Peruvian case illustratesboth the difficulties of analyzing equity in health care and the possible usesof administrative, financial and household data to form some overall judg-ment and to identify where inequity is concentrated, or with what factors itMeasurement of Equity in Health 119 is associated. This is much more valuable than arriving at some single over- all measure of how equitable a particular health care system is. The need to compare medical consultations and expenditures not just to population but to morbidity and perceived needs for assistance, indicatesthat relatively full assessments of equity must draw on population-baseddata and cannot be constructed only from the kind of information normallyavailable to a ministry of health. The infrequent collection and high cost ofsuch population data mean that equity is more easily studied in the crosssection than in year-to-year changes. However, given a baseline assessmentof how equitable a system is and where its principal problems are, changesover time in the distribution of resources and effort can give a good idea ofwhether the system is becoming more or less equitable. It is less importantto calculate elaborate statistical measures such as summary coefficients ofinequality, than to have a clear view of the range or variation in the proba-bilities chosen for study. All such efforts, to be useful, must take account ofthe diversity of health conditions and of responses to them, and of the dif-ferent dimensions of the population according to which equity can beevaluated.

Nothingsaid here represents the position of the Pan American Health Organizationor its Member Governments. I am grateful to Robert Robertson, DaylDonaldson, David Dunlop and anonymous reviewers for a large number ofhelpful comments, some but not all of which have been taken into accountin the revised version; responsibility for errors of fact or interpretation ismine alone. Definition of the Problem The question to which this paper is addressed was defined for me by the Coordinator of Health Services of the Ministry of Health and Education ofone of the smaller Caribbean countries. Publicly-provided health care inthat country is free, in accord with the government's ideological commit-ment that no one should be denied medical attention for economic reasons.However, it is extremely difficult to raise the revenue required to operatethe existing health care system, especially in the current economic situation,and the difficulty will only be compounded if coverage is expanded. Under Reprinted from Social Science and Medicine 22 (3), 1986, with permission from Elsevier Science.122 Health Economics in Development these circumstances, the government would like to recover some part of the cost from the consumers or beneficiaries, while doing the least violence toits principles; the question is, what prices or fees for service should theyadopt? Thus expressed, the question is not the same as, What should the price(s) of health service(s) be? In particular, prices are not assumed to determinesupply; the government decides on the number and type of facilities to buildand staff and the services to offer, on other grounds. Prices are not evenassumed to determine resource allocation within the existing or plannedlevel of supply, in the short run. Consumers will have to respond to prices,but suppliers in the public sector will not. This does not mean that it is ofno interest to operate the public health system more efficiently, only thatprices to patients are not to play a role in that effort. In these circumstances, what is sought is clearly a second-best solution. It is irrelevant to a ministry of health\u2014and most if not all ministries ofhealth in Latin America and the Caribbean find themselves in this same sit-uation\u2014that a first-best solution might involve restructuring the entire taxsystem, or changing a great many other prices in the economy. The min-istry of health does not control taxes: it simply faces pressure both fromwithin the government and from international donor agencies and from theInternational Monetary Fund, to recover some part of its costs, either so asto permit expansion of its services or so as to make smaller demands on thebudget. When allotments to all ministries are cut as part of an austerity pro-gram, imposing fees may be the only way to avoid reducing services. In anycase, the question of what, if any, fees to charge would still be present evenif the tax system were modified and the economy otherwise made to oper-ate more efficiently. Given the restricted role of prices in this view of the problem, and the short-run pressures on the public health system, two other limitations of thequestion are important. The first is that there is no requirement that feescover any particular fraction of total cost or bear any particular relation tomarginal costs. The second is that equity considerations are vital: the gov-ernment does not want to purchase efficiency at the expense of its view ofequity. Its goal is essentially that espoused by the U.S. Presidential Commis-sion, which studied the issue of securing access to health care [1, pp. 20, 111],that of an adequate level of health care for everyone, without economic diffi-culties causing people who need care to forego it or to postpone it until theirmedical problems are much worse. I have argued elsewhere that medicalequity should be interpreted as an equal probability of receiving care when itWhat Should Consumers in Poor Countries Pay? 123 is needed [2], and it is this probability which the government wants to reduce as little as possible as a consequence of charging fees. This is distinct fromconcepts of equity which consider how health care is to be financed, but thegovernment is also interested in financial equity. This issue is addressed later.The question of what the government wants is taken up in more detail in thenext section. Given some strong assumptions about the welfare function implicit in the ministry of health's actions\u2014a welfare or objective function which Iassume is characteristic at least of most governments in Latin America andCaribbean countries and perhaps in poor countries generally\u2014it is possibleto derive conditions for the optimum level of prices or fees to charge.Because this level depends on the demands of consumers for health care, thefollowing section considers what assumptions are reasonable to make aboutthose demands. Given the emphasis on equity, the relation of health caredemands to income may be particularly important. Other determinants ofdemand are considered more briefly. Although it is convenient to speak of 'the' price for medical attention, in fact medical care consists of a great variety of goods and services. Moreover,these are not independently produced and consumed; one level of utilization(consultation) may be a prerequisite to another (treatment). Even for a par-ticular element of care, the price may vary among consumers, geographicareas or other dimensions; the next section therefore considers price dis-crimination, particularly with respect to income and to the other (non-fee)costs which consumers must meet in order to obtain medical attention. Conditions for an Optimal (Single) Price Under the assumption that the price charged for medical care is not to determine the supply, the optimum price is to be determined taking accountnot of the cost of production but only of the government's welfare function,i.e. its objectives in providing care. Governments do not usually specify wel-fare or objective functions in such terms as to permit the derivation of opti-mum policies, for prices or for anything else. The member governments ofthe Pan American Health Organization, for example, have subscribed to amixture of objectives [3, p. 15], some of which specify measurable results interms of death rates, immunization coverage, etc., while others refer to gen-eral goals of \"reorganization\", \"improvement\", etc. to achieve higher levelsof (undefined) \"equity, efficiency and effectiveness\".124 Health Economics in Development I will assume as a first approximation that for the purpose of deciding what fees to charge, the government's welfare function may be regarded ashaving just two components, which do not interact with one another. Theseare N(p), the number of consultations or utilizations by patients, expressed as a function of price; and pN(p), the total revenue obtained from these con- sultations. The first element is a reason for wanting fees to be low, while the second may justify high fees, depending on the elasticity of demand for medicalcare. In order to form a welfare function, W(p),from these two elements, a parameter is required for comparing the volume of service to the monetaryvalue of revenue. If this parameter is called /H9261, and is assumed to be con- stant\u2014each consultation is treated as of equal monetary value, although itsvalue may not be the same as its price\u2014then It is assumed that for a given need, all consumers benefit equally from treatment; there is no discrimination either according to individuals' sub-jective valuation of how much they benefit from care, nor according to anymore objective criteria such as the effect on earning power. Note that the same formulation would result if the ministry were assumed to try to maximize N(p) subject to a budget constraint in which total expenditure were equal to resources from the treasury plus the revenuegenerated by fees. Differentiating W(p) with respect to p yields, after some manipulation, where /H9255 Nis the price-elasticity of demand. If demand is elastic (falling more than proportionally as the price is raised) at a zero price, then the price should be raised until demand becomesinelastic. Just how inelastic it should be depends on the relative sizes of /H9261 and p. If the ministry cared only about revenue ( /H9261/H110050), the elasticity should be exactly /H110021; whereas a high value on attending to patients ( /H9261large com- pared to the price p) means a low elasticity. At the extreme of caring only about consultations, price should be zero. This very simple form of the objective function requires only that the ministry decide for itself how much a consultation is worth, compared tothe revenue obtained from it\u2014i.e., establish a value for /H9261\u2014and then learn enough about how demand depends on price to adjust price and thereforeN(p) to the optimum level. The analysis can be complicated in a number of07/H9255 N=-1>11+/H9261>p27-1W 1p2=/H9261N 1p2+pN 1p2.What Should Consumers in Poor Countries Pay? 125 ways, such as by introducing other elements into the objective function or by distinguishing different types of demand. T wo of these possibilities areconsidered next. The government's concern with equity, for example, might be explicitly incorporated into its objective function by including a third term, where U iis the utility of the ith consumer, expressed as a function of his income Yiand the price p. Charging that price will reduce the utility of any patient who actually is attended, compared to treating him for free; the sumis therefore taken only over the set Cof patients who are seen when the price is p. The parameter /H9262compares the value (to the ministry) of these utility losses, to the revenue obtained: the loss for any customer is greateras pis higher or as Y iis lower, so if a concave utility function is assumed, the total loss of utility will be greater as the distribution of income is moreunequal, leading to a lower price. It is assumed here that interpersonal com-parison of utilities is appropriate, and that income, properly defined, is areasonable basis for such comparisons. This assumption is necessary to the'ability-to-pay' approach to price setting [4, Chap. 5], however dubious theidea is; and more generally, it is the 'old welfare economics' assumption fornecessities such as food, shelter and health care [5], for which everyone'sneeds can be assumed to be very similar if not identical, in the same physi-ological circumstances. Prices usually are not given the role of protecting equity in the economy, and for the producer of a typical good or service the distribution of incomematters only as it affects sales and therefore revenues and profits. Ministriesof health do not appear to think this way, however; and as they have somecontrol over prices but no control over their clients' incomes, they may tryto use prices to affect welfare apart from the effect on the number ofpatients cared for. If this term is included, and W(p) is differentiated, then so long as the same set Cof customers is considered, the condition for the optimum price becomes where E refers to the average or expected value of the change in utility, dU/dp, when the price is increased. Since this is negative, the effect is to/H9255 N=-1-/H9262E1dU>dp2 1+/H9261>p/H9262a i/H9255CUi1Yi, p2126 Health Economics in Development bring the optimum elasticity closer to zero and to lower the optimum price. Changing the price will have the further effect of shrinking or expandingthe set C of clients who use the medical service, so that some people's util- ity losses due to the price will cease to be, or will become, of interest to theministry. Formulating the objective this way means representing the min-istry as caring both about the total number of consultations N(p) and about the group of patients who account for those consultations, whereas theprevious formulation is concerned only with utilization and does not distin-guish one patient from another. It may seem like double-counting to con-sider both the utilization N(p) and the welfare loss that results from paying the price pfor that utilization, but public health officials do express both objectives, at least rhetorically. This formulation of their objectivesattempts to reflect the cost associated with a highly inelastic demand, so thata high price can be considered undesirable even if it does not reduceutilization. In fact, not all consultations are equally necessary or desirable on med- ical grounds. Some can be considered frivolous, so that while they arewelcome for the revenue they generate they should not be considered tocontribute to welfare, and they still represent a cost to patients. The min-istry's objective function can be rewritten to separate necessary ( N) and friv- olous ( F) demand, both as functions of price, as Differentiating yields, after some manipulation, the conditionwhere /H9255 Nand /H9255Fare respectively the price elasticities of Nand F, which may be different. Whether Nand F will be different functions of price will depend on whether consumers' views of the necessity for care coincide with doctors'opinions. The formulation shown allows for different elasticities withrespect to p, but\u2014since patients may be poor judges of how much they need medical care\u2014does not require it. In order for the maximum condition to be satisfied at a positive price, 1/H11001/H9255 Nor 1 /H11001/H9255 For both must be positive; otherwise all three terms in the expression are negative. This means that if demand is elastic (falling morethan proportionally as price is raised) at zero price, the price should beraised until at least one of the demands becomes inelastic. If necessarydemand is inelastic to start with, as is likely if patients correctly recognizeN11+/H9255 N2+F11+/H9255F2+/H9261dN>dp=0W1p2=/H9261N1p2+p5N1p2+F1p26;What Should Consumers in Poor Countries Pay? 127 the more serious needs, then any increase in price will have little effect on medically needed utilization, but may still reduce less-needed demand F. Whether in that case price should be raised above zero will depend on thelevels of both kinds of demand; it is not necessarily the case that priceshould increase until /H9255 Falso becomes inelastic. Rewriting the optimum con- dition to separate /H9255N, as in the previous analysis, yields which depends on the relative amounts of frivolous and necessary demand and on the elasticity of the former. Since /H9255Fcan be more or less than one in absolute value, the optimum price to charge can go either up or down com-pared to the case where all demand is necessary. If both kinds of demandexist but react the same way to price, then reflecting the fact that a higher price has the good effect of reducing frivo- lous demand but the disadvantage of also reducing needed consultations,and the balance of these two effects depends on F/H20862N. Introducing patients' utilities explicitly affects the optimum levels of elasticity and price, but notthe need for at least one of the demands to be inelastic. Consumer Demand and its Determinants The demand for health care, whether or not it is separated into necessary and frivolous components, can be presumed to depend on the price chargedfor care; on the costs in time of reaching a medical facility and waiting forattention; on the income foregone by seeking care; on income; on one'sgeneral condition of health; on the specific conditions or symptom(s) of ill-ness or accident; on the consumer's ability to diagnose and treat himself,which depends among other things on education; and on his opinion of thequality of care he is likely to receive [6]. With respect to price and income,I am assuming that the consumer's demand function has the shape shown inFig. 5.1. T wo consumers are represented, with incomes OY 1(poor) and OY2 (rich). Facing a relatively high commercial price PCsuch as a private doctor would charge, the amount of care demanded by the richer consumer, C2, is much larger than that demanded by the poorer one, C1. This corresponds/H9255N=/H9255F=-11+F>N2 1+/H9261>p+F>N/H9255N=-1-1F>N211+/H9255F2 1+/H9261>p128 Health Economics in Development to the empirical finding that total private spending on medical care in Latin American countries typically shows an elasticity with respect to income ofslightly more than 1.0 [7]. (For specific components of spending the elas-ticity may be quite different: for drugs, for example, it starts high butquickly declines as demand approaches saturation.) At a zero price, the poor consumer's demand M 1may actually exceed that of the richer consumer, M 2, because the former is less healthy or less well able to treat himself, or because his time is less valuable. It is not obviouswhich consumer will exhibit the greater necessary demand ( N 1and N2) when the price is zero, but it is to be expected that except at low prices, rais-ing the price will reduce the necessary demand more for the poorer con-sumer. For both consumers, the horizontal distance between Mand Nrep- resents frivolous demand; this is presumed to be more sensitive to price thannecessary demand, and is likely to be greater for poorer consumers, at leastif the non-fee costs of seeking medical care (travel and lost income) are low. Under these conditions, the optimum price discussed above is something like p*, established at a level where the demand curve has become inelastic; compared to a zero price, necessary demand is reduced only slightly andPRICE QUANTITY (UTILIZATION)INCOME Pc C1C2N2D2M2 N1 D1 M1P' Y1Y2 OFigure 5.1 Demand for Medical Care as a Function of Income and PriceWhat Should Consumers in Poor Countries Pay? 129 frivolous demand considerably more. Exactly where the optimum is depends also on the importance (if any) of consumers' disutility from havingto pay the fee, and on the weight ( /H9261) assigned to consultations in the gov- ernment's objective function; these are not shown in the figure. Thedemands resulting from p* are D 1and D2. T wo further observations concerning the assumed demand function and the consequent optimum price are in order. The first is that the suggestedrule for determining price is in one sense the opposite of what a privatemonopolist would follow. Here the price is set in relation to where the orig-inally elastic demand becomes inelastic, as price rises; a monopolist wouldset price at the other end of the inelastic range, where the price has becomeso high that raising it more begins to reduce even necessary demand sharplyand so revenue falls. The second observation is that if the optimum pricewere determined separately for each consumer, it is conceivable that itwould be lower for the richer one, despite his greater ability to pay. This isbecause of his presumed more inelastic demand. Setting the optimum rela-tive to all consumers together takes account of the distribution of incomeamong them and also of the possibility of extracting more revenue fromthose with higher incomes. Finally, it should be noted that both the government's supposed welfare function and the consumer's demand refer to instances of medical care, notto health in general or to other kinds of behavior which influence health.Medical care is undoubtedly sought to maintain or improve one's (per-ceived) health, and the government's ultimate objective is a healthy popula-tion, but models of the 'demand for health' [8, 9] are too general and toolong-term in focus to help determine what fees should be charged. Bothconsumers and the government take actions designed to promote health byother means than the provision of medical services; these actions can bestbe thought of as shifting the demand curve through better self care, moreprevention and less cure, and otherwise reducing the number of instancesin which medical care is necessary. Optimum Price Discrimination The argument thus far has assumed that all consumers will pay the same price, but it is probably preferable to discriminate in price-setting. The mostobvious reason is the disparity of incomes: richer patients can afford to paymore, without significantly reducing their necessary demand. Calculating130 Health Economics in Development the optimum price separately by income level will lead directly to prices being higher for the rich, provided the utility-loss term reflects decreasingmarginal utility of income at a rapid enough rate. If no account is taken ofutility loss as a function of income, the elasticity analysis alone could lead, asindicated above, to the poor being charged more. (Alternatively, /H9261can be considered to depend on income, but then all patients are not consideredequally valuable in medical terms, which seems unethical.) Introducing pricediscrimination among consumers of course raises two problems: patientshave to be classified by some sort of means test, which creates some admin-istrative expense, and it has to be decided for which services to charge dif-ferentiated prices. Governments do often recognize the greater ability ofsome patients to pay than others, and introduce higher fees for the former,but even then the price may remain very low, hardly justifying the adminis-trative burden and bearing little relation to incomes. This is perhaps espe-cially likely to occur with hospital charges [10]. At the other extreme, dis-crimination may mean treating indigent patients completely free of charge. Discrimination among consumers by income level may be of limited potential in many countries, simply because the better-off are unlikely to beclients of the ministry of health in the first place; if there is medical cover-age under social security, it is the better-paid workers who are most likelyto benefit from it. Of course, the arguments in favor of fees to reduce friv-olous demand apply equally well in a social security medical care system, butthe revenue argument is unimportant if the system is already financed bypayroll taxes which the beneficiaries regard as their contribution to payingfor the service. As for where to apply price discrimination, the simplest procedure is probably to set fees for particular services and then to apply uniformly ascale of adjustments based on income. However, the administrative burdenwould be reduced, and a considerable revenue could still be collected, if auniform fee were charged for consultation (set low enough not to havemuch effect on necessary consultations by poorer consumers), and pricediscrimination were introduced only at the stage of treatment. In particular,hospitalization seems an appropriate stage at which to set differential fees,both because of the large share of hospital costs in total government healthbudgets, and because higher-income consumers sometimes use private doc-tors for consultations, but go to public hospitals for treatment. One of the arguments for setting fees at all is that this will reduce unnec- essary demand, ideally with minimal effect on necessary utilization. It ismore correct to say that the total cost of obtaining medical care will reduceWhat Should Consumers in Poor Countries Pay? 131 frivolous demand; and if the cost of travel, waiting time and income lost are high enough, most or all unnecessary utilization will already have beeneliminated. In that case there will be no role for fees except to raise revenue,and so the optimum fee will in general be lower. (This argument is offset,to the extent that a given fee represents a lower share of total cost whenother costs are high, so that the price-elasticity of necessary demand, /H9255 N, is reduced, permitting the optimum fee to be somewhat higher. ) This suggests a second form of price discrimination may be desirable: fees should be lowerfor consumers for whom the other costs of obtaining care are higher. In par- ticular, fees should perhaps be lower in rural areas of dispersed populationand difficulty of access than in urban areas with good transportation and rel-atively easy access. This kind of geographic basis for discrimination has theadvantage that it does not require classifying individual patients. Moreover,since the population of thinly-settled rural areas is typically poor, the lowerfees would not usually benefit high-income consumers. The argument is sometimes made that introducing fees is a way to make the revenue of a particular health facility reflect the quality of service itoffers its clientele, and therefore to stimulate managers of hospitals andclinics to operate more efficiently and to satisfy their patients better; it notonly permits but rewards decentralization. Among facilities serving thesame class of consumers, this is a reasonable defense of fees, but it ceases tobe valid once the non-fee costs of obtaining care differ. Applied to the sortof urban/easy-access and rural/difficult-access facilities just described, itwould mean either that the urban facility would have extra funds withwhich to expand service where it is already better than average while therural facility would not, or else that necessary demand would be reducedmore in the already-under-served rural area. Equity in the raising and useof revenue from patients' charges probably requires either that fees raisedin one place be (partly) transferred to less-favored facilities and populations,or that regular (tax-financed) budgets go preferentially to those locationswhere the optimum fee is lower.

Introduction: Relations Between Nations and Localities The health of the population is often considered a responsibility of the national government, whether specified by law or constitution or throughpolitical consensus. At the same time, it is common for sub-national gov-ernments to control the public provision of health services, and even toassume the responsibility of financing private providers. This situation cre-ates the need to determine the relation between one and another level ofgovernment, particularly with respect to financing. T wo characteristics arerelevant: the differences among parts of the country, and the specific capac-ities of the national government. T ranslated and revised version of a paper in Spanish presented to the Third Inter- national Seminar on Fiscal Federalism, La Plata, Argentina, 24 April 1998.134 Health Economics in Development Local inequalities and inequity In general, a federal country is characterized by differences among regions, states or provinces, and municipalities. Relative to health, these may be dif-ferences in: The degree of poverty, which limits private spending on health; Local fiscal capacity for public spending on health;T otal health expenditure;Needs for health care (the epidemiological situation); and finally,The overall state of health. These differences, especially in health status and access to services, are often considered unjust or inequitable, requiring compensatory or redistributiveinterventions. The role of the national government At least in comparison to the poorest states or provinces in the country, the national government generally has a greater capacity to generate taxrevenues. The tendency\u2014more marked, the more public functions aredecentralized\u2014is for the federal government to raise resources and transferthem to sub-national governments. In addition to the purely fiscal respon-sibility, the nation also is expected to assure equity or even equality amongits citizens. This implies, among other things, reducing geographic differ-ences. This function can be exercised either for universal programs, towhich everyone has a right, or for targeted programs. An Example: The Medicaid Program of the United States The United States depends, more than is typical for a rich country, on pri- vate financing of health care, largely through employment-related insur-ance. Nonetheless, there are two large federal health programs: Medicarefor the elderly, which is financed by a specific tax, and Medicaid for thepoor. Both are shared between the federal government, which legislates therules under which they operate and contributes to financing them, and thestate governments, which administer the programs and also spend on them.(In contrast to what happens in some other countries such as Brazil andChile, municipalities do not figure in the definition, financing or operationof these programs.)Compensatory Finance in Health 135 Logic and objectives of the program The poor, by definition, can hardly pay for health care out of pocket. On the other hand, they seldom have jobs that allow access to adequate insurance atreasonable cost. The chief objective of Medicaid is to provide subsidizedinsurance coverage for poor people. Another goal is to allow considerablefreedom to state governments, not only to administer the program but todefine the beneficiaries, the benefits to which they are entitled, and the cor-responding cost. In contrast to some other programs, such as those describedbelow, Medicaid does not operate by distributing a fixed federal budget. Determining expenditures and their distribution The state government ( s) defines the beneficiary population ( Bs) to be eli- gible for the program, subject to the regulations in the national legislation.Similarly, and also subject to federal rules, it determines the set of healthservices to be covered by the insurance. The combination of beneficiarycharacteristics and the list of services determines the quantity of care ( Qs) to be utilized. On the other hand, and also subject to federal approval, the state gov- ernment determines, or negotiates with providers (mostly private), theprices ( /H9266s) it will pay. These prices should be the lowest necessary to guar- antee a supply of services of adequate quality. A provider who agrees toserve Medicaid beneficiaries promises not to require co-payments or addi-tional fees from patients. T ogether, the prices and quantities determine thetotal cost of the program in the state, Cs /H11005 Qs*/H9266s. What the federal government determines is the fraction ( /H9278s) of that cost that it will contribute in that state. This depends on state per capita income;at incomes above about $ 22,000 (in 1995), the share /H9278sreaches its mini- mum value of 50 percent. That is, in the richer states the federal govern-ment finances half the cost of the program. In the poorer states the federalshare is larger, reaching a maximum of 83 percent. Federal or national expenditure in the state is therefore CNs /H11005 /H9278s*Qs* /H9266s, while /H11005(1/H11002 /H9278s) *Qs* /H9266s. The relation of federal is then CNs /H11005[/H9278s/(1 /H11002 /H9278s)]CSs , with a minimum of equal expenditure at the two levels and a max- imum of federal spending being five times that of the state government. Observations: who decides what The federal government influences the determination of the beneficiaries, the services to be subsidized, and the prices to pay for them. However, the136 Health Economics in Development only parameter it directly determines is the share it contributes to financing\u2014 on the basis of income per person, which neither the national nor the stategovernment can influence appreciably. The other decisions are taken by thestates. This has an important consequence for equity: two equally poor peo-ple in two different states can be treated differently. This can happenbecause of inclusion among the beneficiaries in one state and not the other,or because more services are covered in one state than in the other. T o put it another way: the federal Medicaid program is redistributive\u2014 it contributes much more to paying for health in poor states than in richones\u2014and thereby compensates for differences in the number of poor peo-ple as well as in the capacities of states to assure them adequate health care.But the program does not impose equality of treatment, leaving it to stategovernments to decide how \"generous\" to be in applying the rules. Thisrepresents a relatively high degree of decentralization of decisions. It alsohas the consequence that the decisions by the states influence the totalexpenditure to which the federal government is committed. Finally, asoccurs with some other programs, especially that of Aid to Families withDependent Children, differences from one state to another may motivatemigration from a less-generous to a more-generous state. There are noestimates of whether this happens on a significant scale. A General Example: Explicit Redistribution Another way to define a redistributive health financing scheme is to begin with a uniform level of expenditure per capita, or a uniform set of services,for the entire beneficiary population of a public insurance. Then one deter-mines how the cost is divided between different levels of government. Thislogic corresponds more to the Canadian health system than to that of theUnited States, particularly as the former operated in Canada a decade ormore ago, when there were specific federal transfers to the provinces tofinance health. (Nowadays the transfers also pay for education and otherprograms, and it is left to the provinces to decide how to distribute thefunds among different uses.) In general, such a system can be universal, asin Canada, or it can exclude part of the population because it is rich, or hasprivate health insurance, or for some other reason (as occurs in the Nether-lands). The definition of a public system which takes into account the cov-erage of private insurance, avoiding subsidy to those who do not need it,while assuring equity among the whole population, is of particular interestCompensatory Finance in Health 137 for countries with mixed health systems such as the majority of countries in Latin America. The logic of a national health insurance What follows describes a system for defining compensatory transfers from the national government to sub-national governments, which allows the lat-ter some liberty in spending their own resources but imposes commonnational norms for the beneficiary population, the services covered, andtheir costs. Another difference from the Medicaid program is that the shar-ing of costs depends not on per capita income but on the revenues of thestates\u2014including any non-tied transfers which the state or provincereceives from the federal government for spending as it chooses. This leavesmore control to the state for determining its own taxes and consequent rev-enues, but simplifies the determination of how much the state will have tospend on health. Revenues are known more quickly and more precisely thanincomes, especially in countries with less-developed information systems.The central objective is to guarantee a uniform minimum coverage: toimpose a floor but not a ceiling. The other objective is to control federalspending, although not rigidly\u2014that expenditure is still influenced by thedecisions of sub-national governments. A redistributive formula The national government defines (perhaps through negotiation with the states or provinces, as in Canada) the population which, because it is alreadyprivately insured ( A), is not eligible for the full benefits of the public insur- ance. If private insurers cover fewer services than the public program, thatinsured population can participate as partial beneficiaries and still receivetransfers. If Psis the population of a state, the fully-covered beneficiary population is Bs/H11005Ps/H11002As. The national government also determines the minimum level of per capita expenditure ( C), or alternatively the minimum set of services ( Q) to be financed. (T rying to specify both quantities and expenditures leads torationing, if the spending is insufficient, or to expenditure which can buymore services than the minimum defined.) This determines the committedlevel of spending by each state, which can be expressed as Cs/H11005C*Bs , or Cs/H11005Q*/H9266*Bs, where /H9266are the prices, specified nationally. (This ignores the potential complexity of allowing different federal prices in differentstates, because providers' costs differ. However, that complication is often138 Health Economics in Development relevant for hard-to-reach rural areas or dispersed populations.) The state, for its part, retains the right to offer more services than are negotiated withthe federal government, Qs /H11022Q, or to pay higher prices for them, /H9266s /H11022 /H9266. In either of these cases, it has to spend its own resources: the federal com-mitment is limited to financing only Q*/H9266. If the privately insured population receives a more limited set of services than the national minimum, Qas /H11021Q, the formula for the total expendi- ture committed has to be modified to include the services not guaranteedby private insurance. The result is which can be expressed as Cs/H11005Q*/H9266*Ps /H11002Qas* /H9266*As. The program pays the cost of the minimum set of services for the whole population of thestate, less the cost represented by the services provided by private insurersto their clients. The last element of the system is the determination of how this total cost is shared between the federal and sub-national governments. There can bemany different formulas, the simplest being that the state or province isrequired to spend on health, a fraction /H9252of its revenues Rs(own tax rev- enues plus non-tied federal transfers). This way the state contributionbecomes CSs /H11005/H9252*Rs, and that of the federal government is CNs /H11005Cs /H11002 CSs. Federal expenditure is purely compensatory, guaranteeing the mini- mum stipulated spending or services for the whole population, includingany shortfall of private insurance coverage relative to the public insurance. Observations on political decisions In a system like that just described, the states or provinces can participate in two types of decisions. If the parameters Cor Q, /H9266and /H9252are not fixed by law or the constitution, but negotiated (for example, annually), the sub-national governments share in determining them. The best way to fix theparameter values depends on the country's political situation, and in partic-ular on the relative power of different states or provinces to benefit fromthese decisions. In the case of Brazil, the constitution was amended, first foreducation and later for health, to specify the responsibilities of the differentlevels of government (federal, state and also municipal). This was done toprevent the states with greater wealth and political power from continuingto obtain inequitably large federal transfers because the ceilings on federalCs=Q*/H9266*Bs+(Q-Qas) */H9266*As,Cs=C*Bs+(Q-Qas) */H9266*As, orCompensatory Finance in Health 139 resources were determined more on the basis of the distribution of pro- viders than in relation to needs for health or financing. In the second place, each state determines its own taxes, which affects the revenues Rsof which a share /H9252must be spent on health. There is some risk of moral hazard, in that a state can pass more of health costs on to the fed-eral government by reducing its tax rates. This danger is not entirely imag-inary: it happened with a corrupt and irresponsible government in the stateof Alagoas, in Brazil, which went effectively bankrupt by reducing taxes onthe sugar industry and waiting for the federal government to pay for publicservices such as health. However, in general there are two strong protec-tions against such moral hazard. One is that reducing taxes so as to pay lessfor health means losing larger revenues for other uses, especially if /H9252is low, say 10 or 15 percent. The other protection is relevant if besides its owntaxes, state revenues Rsinclude non-tied or general transfers from the fed- eral government. In a poor state, these transfers can be a large share of totalrevenue, which effectively assures that the federal government will financemuch of health expenditure and thereby protect the neediest. However, thisrequires that the non-tied transfers themselves not be very inequitable, tothe point of annulling the equity due to the tied transfers for health. Equity in Investment: The REFORSUS Project in Brazil The two examples just discussed refer to recurrent spending in health, that is for the purchase of services. The problems of geographic inequality orinequity and the need for compensatory actions also can arise for investment spending, that is for the creation of capacity to produce services. TheREFORSUS investment project in Brazil, begun in 1996 and financedpartly by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, wasdesigned to complete, equip or remodel hospitals and other health facilities.It required some arrangement to distribute the resources of US$590 millionamong the states of the country in an equitable and politically acceptableway. It therefore offers an illustration of how the ideas discussed here canalso be applied to investments. Background and objectives Federal health expenditures in Brazil at the outset of the project (before the constitutional amendment mentioned above, which specifies values of /H9252 for states and municipalities) were distributed very unequally among140 Health Economics in Development states\u2014largely because the public system ( Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade ) paid according to the production of services, and capacity for provision was veryunequal and concentrated in the richest states. The resulting inequity waslimited, at that time, by federal spending ceilings established for each state,besides a general ban on paying for the hospitalization of more than eightpercent of a state's population in any one year. The ceilings were negotiatedannually, but because of the unequal political power of the state govern-ments, did not succeed in equalizing expenditure per capita, much less toadjust it according the fiscal capacities of the states for financing healthfrom their own revenues. The goal in the REFORSUS project was to establish ceilings for invest- ment in each state, which would correct part of the existing inequity. Theywould also have to respect three important limitations: according to budgetary law, at least 50 percent of the funds would have to be assigned on the basis of population;no state should receive more funds than could be absorbed in justifiedinvestments; andthe criteria had to be transparent and the formula simple. Determination of state-by-state ceilings Many criteria were proposed for distributing the total investment fund F among the states or determining the values Fs. Among these were the level of income, the prevalence of poverty, age-standardized mortality, and manyother indicators. In principle all were relevant, but they would have yieldeda formula too complex to be understood and accepted. In consequence, andafter much discussion, it was decided to base the allocation of funds solelyon the state's population, Ps, and recurrent federal health spending per capita in the state, Cs. In addition, it was evident that the formula should be linear in these two variables, so as not to give very high or low allocationsto states with extremely high or low population or per capita expendituresmuch above or below the mean. (Note that according to the rules for theMedicaid program, the fraction /H9278sis linear in per capita income, up to the maximum income; and in the second example above, the state's contributionis linear in its revenues since /H9252is constant.) A \"gap\" was defined between federal expenditure per person in a state, Cs, and the maximum per capita spending among all the states, Cm(in the state of Paran\u00e1). The total gap or deficit of federal spending for any otherstate is calculated as Ds/H11005(Cm /H11002Cs)*Ps . This is the additional spendingCompensatory Finance in Health 141 the state would need to receive in order to reach the same per capita level as the most-favored state m. The sum of these deficits is the total additional spending needed in Brazil to bring per capita federal expenditure in allstates up to the level in Paran\u00e1: that is, D/H11005Cm*P /H11002/H9018s(Cs*Ps) , where P is total population. T o complete the allocation formula, one arbitrary parameter /H9251was needed, which represents the relative weight of population. The fraction1/H11002/H9251 is then the relative weight of the state's deficit in recurrent spending. This parameter is arbitrary in the same sense as /H9278sor /H9252in the previous examples; it must be decided politically. The difference is that instead ofdetermining federal and state contributions, it fixes the assignment amongstates of a purely federal fund. Incorporating /H9251, the formula becomes Fs/F /H11005/H9251*(Ps/P) /H11001(1 /H11002 /H9251)*(Ds/D) . The fraction of the total fund assigned as a ceiling to a state, Fs/F , depends on the state's share of the country's population and on its share of the total deficit or gap in recurrent federal health expenditure.Only the second term is explicitly redistributive, but in the circumstances ofBrazil, even proportionality to population improves equity for variousstates. In the end, a value of 0.70 was chosen for /H9251, so the redistributive adjustment has a relative weight of 30 percent. Potential long-term adjustments Obviously, if a formula such as this were applied during a long interval of investment, eventually the value of federally-financed installed capacity perperson in health would become equal among all the states. If payment con-tinued to be based on production of services, this would also tend to equal-ize recurrent spending among states. Eventually this might not be desirable,because differences in the epidemiological pattern among regions and stateswould justify unequal expenditures. Moreover, this adjustment towardgreater equity says nothing by itself about the distribution of spendingbetween the federal government and the states (not to mention the munic-ipalities, which in Brazil operate much of the network of health facilities andsometimes contribute substantially to financing it). The subsequent consti-tutional amendment is aimed at equity in this larger sense. Not only shouldfederal investment resources be directed more toward those states wherespending has been lower in the past, but states should, by assuming respon-sibility for spending according to their own resources, liberate federalrecurrent expenditure for a more equitable distribution.142 Health Economics in Development Concluding Reflections These three cases have several features in common which are worth empha- sizing. First, they deal only with geographic equity, leaving for lower levels ofdecision the allocation of funds among particular interventions, health con-ditions, or population groups. Geographic equity is at least partly a necessarycondition for more detailed distributional justice according to needs, but nota sufficient condition. Second, the variables which go into the formulas fordistribution\u2014per capita income, revenues, population, or expenditure\u2014arerelatively easy to observe, more so in the case of revenue and spending, anddo not require additional efforts to gather information. Third, these variablesare subject very little or not at all to manipulation by either federal or sub-national governments. (Fraud may be possible, and estimates of populationor income can always be controversial, but moral hazard is essentially nonex-istent.) No government at either level can obtain more funds for itself, orreduce its financial contribution, by playing with variables under its control.Fourth, each formula contains one and only one arbitrary parameter: /H9278s,/H9252 and /H9251, respectively. As a result, the unavoidable political negotiation can focus on a single number rather than dealing with a multitude of effects or relativeweights of several different variables. The resulting formula is transparentand politically comprehensible. It seems reasonable to suggest that these fourcharacteristics are valuable for any allocation formula in pursuit of equity.The case for such simple formulas with a minimum of arbitrary parametersis strengthened when information is limited or of doubtful accuracy, or whenrelations between national and sub-national governments are characterizedby mistrust or incomprehension.143 An Ounce of Prevention Is Worth How Much Cure?CHAPTER 7 The conventional wisdom in health care is that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: preventing illness or injury not only avoids pain andsuffering, it is also cheaper than treating those ill or hurt. Sometimes this isclearly true, but in other cases it is questionable. At the least, the rightbalance of prevention and cure in health care spending must depend onthe costs of the two approaches, and those costs in turn may depend on thenumbers of preventive and curative actions taken. Unless these costs areproperly taken into account there is no way to tell how far to emphasizeprevention, and at what point to give up and treat the cases that were notprevented. Still less is it possible to judge a priori how expenditure on health care ought to be divided between prevention and cure\u2014and yet it is com-mon to hear the complaint that 80 percent of a government's health budgetgoes for curative care and only 20 percent for prevention. If preventionreally isso much cheaper than treatment, that may even be the right out- come: many cheap preventive actions and fewer, but more expensive, cura-tive treatments. The fact that rice is much cheaper than meat does not byitself imply that rice will, or should, take up more of a family's food budget. In order to minimize the combined costs of prevention and cure\u2014the total cost of keeping people in good health or restoring them to it, suppos-ing that such restoration is possible\u2014the latter should take over from theformer at the point where their marginal costs are equal. Here marginalcost means the cost of providing for the next person , whether what is provided is preventive or curative. So long as prevention costs less thancure, everything should be spent on prevention; but if at some point curing Reprinted, with permission, from \"An Ounce of Prevention Is Worth How Much Cure? Thinking about the Allocation of Health Care Spending\". A View from LATHR . Latin America and the Caribbean T echnical Department, the World Bank, 1990.144 Health Economics in Development people becomes cheaper, spending from that point on should go for cura- tive care. What matters is not average but marginal cost, and these will notbe equal if the cost per patient is not constant but depends on the numberof patients for whom service is provided. Figure 7.1 illustrates this argument, for the simple case in which preven- tion is always cheaper than cure. The population at risk is N, of whom some number NVreceive preventive care: Vis the marginal cost of prevention, shown by the curve from V Oout to V. The symbol Vis chosen to suggest vaccination, which is close to the ideal of prevention in both effectivenessand cost. This cost may initially decline as more people receive preventivecare, reflecting the fixed costs and consequent economies of scale ascoverage starts to expand. Before the whole population can be covered,however, the marginal cost is likely to rise again, surpassing its initiallevel. This reflects the increasing difficulty of reaching people as they aregeographically scattered, resist being treated, or respond poorly to the Figure 7.1 Marginal Costs of a Curative and a Preventive Intervention, When Prevention is Always Cheaper andEveryone Receives One Intervention or the Other CO VOC' 0N C N V NV'VCMarginal Cost of the Intervention Number of People Receiving the InterventionAn Ounce of Prevention Is Worth How Much Cure? 145 measure. The total cost of reaching NVpeople is the area under the V curve, from zero out to NV, and the marginal cost at that point is V/H11032. The other, higher curve in Figure 7.1 shows the marginal cost of cura- tive treatment for the same health problem, C. If NCpatients are treated the total cost is the area under the curve out to NC, and marginal cost at that point is C/H11032. This cost curve may also show an initial decline and a subsequent rise, but it need not be shaped anything like the preventive-cost curve. The analysis is unchanged if the marginal cost Cincludes the non-medical cost of being sick or hurt, such as loss of income, or even anallowance for pain and suffering. In this example, the cost of prevention never becomes as high as the cost of treatment, even if the whole population is covered. The right policy istherefore to reach everyone possible with preventive care even though thiswill raise the marginal (and average) cost of prevention above what it wouldbe with lower coverage, since the last people reached are relatively expensiveto provide for. The share of preventive spending is 100 percent, whether cov-erage is provided to the whole population or only to a small fraction of it.This probably is the model most people have in mind when they argue that(almost) everything should be spent on prevention. And there are doubtlesscases where it applies: measles is easier to prevent than treat, and in an unvac-cinated population, essentially every child runs a high risk of getting measles. This example is far from universal, though. It contains two features which make prevention very attractive. First, the cost of prevention stays low evenwhen everyone is covered: there is no technological barrier to reaching thewhole population and the expense of doing so is bearable. Second, it isassumed that everyone who does not receive preventive care will, in conse-quence, require treatment\u2014every individual gets one or the other. Even formeasles, this is not strictly true. As more children are vaccinated the likeli-hood that an unvaccinated child will get sick is reduced, because transmis-sion of the disease may be interrupted with less than full coverage by themechanism of herd immunity. And for most diseases and injuries the prob-ability of requiring treatment is well below 100 percent, even in the absenceof any preventive action. Not everyone got polio before a vaccine was found. If the probability of needing curative treatment when one has not received any preventive care is P, then the right comparison to make is not between Vand C, the marginal costs per patient, but between Vand PC. The latter is the expected expenditure on an individual who gets no preventive care, allowing for the possibility that he may or may not get sick or hurt; putanother way, it is the cost per person of treatment when only a fraction of persons become patients. (If only a fraction of the entire population are146 Health Economics in Development candidates for the preventive measure\u2014are at risk for the disease or injury it is desired to prevent\u2014there is no need for a second concept of probabi-lity to apply to V; instead, Nis simply defined as the population at risk, so that the probability for Vcontinues to be unity.) Now when Pis very low, cure must be much more expensive than prevention in order to justify pre-ventive action, 1/ Ptimes as high, in fact. This will sometimes be the case\u2014 the cost of treating polio, for example, appears to be high enough to offsetthe low probability of paralysis among untreated children\u2014but not always. Figure 7.2 illustrates the two complications just discussed. First, the pre- ventive cost curve V O-Vstarts out low, just as in Figure 7.1, but then begins to rise so steeply that it becomes essentially impossible to cover the wholepopulation at risk. Second, the curative cost curve is shifted down by thefraction P, to the position PC O-PC. The result is that the two curves now PCOPC VOV' 0 NV' NMarginal Cost of the Intervention Number of People Receiving the InterventionFigure 7.2 Marginal Costs of a Curative and a Preventive Intervention, When Only Part of the Population Requires theCurative InterventionAn Ounce of Prevention Is Worth How Much Cure? 147 cross: beyond the point NV/H11032it would be cheaper to start curing patients than continue to work at prevention, even though it is much cheaper to preventNV/H11032cases than to give curative care to the same number of people. For simplicity, the Figure is drawn supposing that Pdoes not itself depend on the number of preventive actions. (Allowing for that possibility would generatea whole family of curative cost curves, each corresponding to one level ofpreventive coverage, which could cross the preventive cost curve at differentplaces. Alternatively, the diagram would need to be three-dimensional, withthe third dimension showing how Pis related to preventive coverage.) Figure 7.2 may seem to show that NV/H11032is the correct level of preventive care, but of course that is not the case: costs are compared as though allindividuals received both preventive and curative measures with the latterbecoming cheaper for the next person after NV/H11032. In fact, the expected cost of treating the first person who is not covered by prevention is shown by theheight of the PCcurve at PC Oat the left margin of the Figure. This will be equal to the marginal cost V/H11032at NV/H11032only if the cost curve is flat, with marginal and average costs equal. T o find the correct (cost-minimizing)level of preventive action when the curative curve is not flat, the curve PC O- PCis shifted (added) horizontally to the right until its starting-point meets the preventive cost curve. This is done in Figure 7.3, which shows thecorrect level of prevention to be NV*. T o the left of V*the curve V O-V* shows preventive costs and to the right the curve V*-PC shows curative costs. The first person for whom curative care is expected to be needed willcost exactly as much to take care of as the last person covered by preventivemeasures. In this example, prevention turns out to be the cheaper approachfor much more than half the population at risk, but the total cost of cura-tive care may still exceed total expenditure on prevention: the area NV*-V*- PC-N may be greater than the area O-V O-V*-NV* . This distribution of resources is not evidence of inefficiency; it simply reflects the low probabil-ity of needing cure, and the sharply rising marginal cost of prevention. (Theshaded, almost triangular area between the curve V*-V /H11032and the curve from V*toward PCshows the additional cost that would be incurred by carrying preventive action too far, to the intersection of costs shown in Figure 7.2. Asimilar triangle to the left of V*would show the extra cost associated with stopping the preventive measure too soon.) Figure 7.3 shows how both total expenditure and its allocation between prevention and cure vary, as the total number of people reached by onemeasure or the other increases. It is important to note that so far as cost min-imization is concerned, every point on the curve V O-V*-PC is an optimum,148 Health Economics in Development representing the cheapest way of reaching a given number of people. It is only in terms of health benefits, that one point can be said to be better thananother\u2014benefits increase steadily as one moves from V Otoward PC. Whether those benefits are sufficient to justify the costs incurred is a largerquestion, which is considered briefly below. At this point, what matters isthat the right balance of spending between preventing a health problem andcuring it, depends on how much in total is spent on that problem. At low lev-els of total expenditure, the correct allocation may be 100 percent for pre-vention, but when enough is spent to do something for everyone at risk, theoptimum share for prevention may be much lower, as in the Figure. Theargument that too much is being spent on curative care, particularly in poor countries, is often implicitly an argument either that the situation inFigure 7.1 prevails, and nothing should or need be spent to cure people; or,that in the situation depicted in Figure 7.3, the country cannot afford to helpPCOPC VOV' 0NV'NV*NV*Marginal Cost of the Intervention Number of People Receiving the InterventionFigure 7.3 Cost-minimizing Distribution of Effort between a Curative and a Preventive InterventionAn Ounce of Prevention Is Worth How Much Cure? 149 everybody, that budgetary constraints impose an optimum close to\u2014perhaps a little to the right of\u2014 V*, and far from PC. Does the real world ever look like what Figure 7.3 shows? In at least two important instances it does. One case is exemplified by diseases like malaria,where the preventive measures available work imperfectly\u2014eradication ofvectors is possible only in unusual circumstances, and is becoming moredifficult, it is hard to avoid the vectors, and there is as yet no effective, cheapvaccine\u2014and costs can become exorbitantly high as coverage is expanded.These problems do not mean that prevention should be abandoned, onlythat curative care is also part of a cost minimizing solution, and may have toabsorb a large share of total costs. ( Just how large depends also on the defini-tion of the population at risk, N.) The other typical case is exemplified by vehicular accidents. It is known how to reduce death and injury drastically by very inexpensive means suchas always wearing seat belts and never driving while intoxicated. But thesemeasures require repeated individual compliance: there is no vaccine yetagainst pigheadedness or drunk driving. Some people comply readily withthe required preventive actions, producing a very low initial cost V, while others are impervious to safety propaganda and can be reached only bymuch more expensive measures such as air-bags or saturating the roads withpolice who will enforce the (appropriate) laws. It is these drivers who makethe preventive cost curve rise so steeply. So do other elements outside thecontrol of individual motorists, such as the high cost of making roads saferand cars more crashworthy. Nobody even knows what the cost curve lookslike with any certainty: giving more money to the Ministry of Health (oranyone else) to reduce vehicular accidents does not translate into fewer vic-tims as readily as more money for polio immunization translates into fewerparalyzed children. Hence the high, and growing, share of expenditure totreat accident victims. Both these examples suggest that what is needed is not just more expendi- ture on existing preventive measures\u2014and certainly not just less expendi-ture to treat victims\u2014but the discovery of better prevention, cheaperand/or surer to work. That is why so much effort goes into developing newvaccines, and why governments experiment with laws, regulations andeducational campaigns to reduce drunk driving, smoking, and other risksfor which the curative costs can be very high, even, as in the case of AIDS,infinitely high. New preventive measures may eventually transform theoptimum balance between prevention and cure, just as vaccines have donefor measles and polio; and that in turn can be expected to redistribute150 Health Economics in Development spending between the two types of care. But at least when total expendi- ture is high enough, the outcome may be that curative care will properlyget a larger, not a smaller, share of total health care resources. That will bethe right solution, if effective prevention becomes very cheap for almosteveryone, but still cannot reach some people\u2014while curative treatmentremains costly. Meanwhile, the relative spending on prevention and cureby itself says nothing about whether preventive efforts are inadequate,excessive, or about right: one must get beyond budget shares to relativemarginal costs. Strictly speaking, this analysis is valid only for a given health problem, which can be prevented (with more or less success) and for which someeffective treatment exists (with greater or lesser probability of restoring fullhealth). For that particular problem marginal cost analysis can in principlehelp determine the balance of preventive versus curative spending, to mini-mize the total cost of a given health outcome or to maximize the number ofcases prevented or cured, for a given expenditure. Under these conditions,costs do not have to be compared to any measure of benefits, if one takes asgiven the budget for total spending on that problem. The preventive/cura-tive distribution of total health care expenditure, however, depends also onthe distribution of health problems on which money is spent. It is not pos-sible to determine how much to spend in total on each kind of care withoutcomparing the seriousness of different problems or, equivalently, the bene-fits of preventing them or curing them. If vehicular accidents are more of aproblem than measles, there will be more spent on curative care, in the opti- mum situation , than if measles were the more serious problem. Judging how serious a problem is means explicitly considering some measure such as loss of life, of years of life, or of quality-adjusted life years(which can also take account of non-fatal morbidity). The combination ofsuch a criterion for comparison among different health problems and the marginal-cost criterion for allocation for each particular health problem, is in principle sufficient for specifying the optimum allocation of total healthcare spending between prevention and cure\u2014again, for a given totalexpenditure on all types of health care. Arguments that too much is spenton curative care are often, implicitly or explicitly, arguments that too muchis spent on certain problems, for which effective preventive measures donot exist or for which the known curative treatments are very costly. Suchjudgments can only be based on some comparison of benefits. For a given health problem, prevention which is cheap and effective but cannot\u2014for whatever reason\u2014reach everyone in the population is likely toAn Ounce of Prevention Is Worth How Much Cure? 151 lead to an optimum in which curative care for a small number of people requires spending more than preventive measures for a much larger number.\"Success\" does not necessarily raise the preventive share in total spending,unless the prevention covers everyone at risk. The same phenomenon prob-ably operates even more powerfully between health problems: successful pre-vention of one problem, such as measles, means that some other problem,such as vehicular accidents, becomes more important, with the consequencethat the curative share of total spending should go up\u2014at least until vehicular injury becomes as easy and cheap to prevent as measles is. At each moment,the correct balance of prevention and cure depends on total spending, on theepidemiologic situation and on the state of technical knowledge about howto prevent and how to cure health problems. The \"epidemiologic transition\"is largely just the product of successful prevention, whether by medicalmeans (vaccination) or others (better diet, safer water), and it has cost conse-quences. How much should be spent in total on health care depends on com-paring health benefits to the\u2014incommensurable\u2014benefits from spendingon other things: there is no consensus on how to make that comparison. It may be unwise to guess at a long-run equilibrium of health care cost levels and composition, since technical progress is rapid and there is littleconsensus on the seriousness of different health problems. But it is at leastplausible that the correct distribution of spending in the long run will beeven more weighted toward curative care than current spending is\u2014because almost no one will die or get very sick at early ages, thanks to pre-vention, whereas the health problems people experience at later ages willnot be amenable to prevention or even to cheap treatment. This might bethe case even if society spent a smaller share of total product on healthcare\u2014for example, if it stopped spending on \"heroic\" measures to prolonglife by a few days or months, and spent nothing on people in comas or withAlzheimer's disease. A high proportion of spending on curative care may bethe inevitable consequence of the fact that certain diseases and injuries canbe prevented, but death can only be postponed.153 DALYs and Cost- Effectiveness AnalysisCHAPTER 8 Acknowledgments This note is the direct result of a request from Maria Paalman, the senior author-editor of the Review1{to which this article responded}, to read and comment on it. I am grateful to her for that impetus, and to Abdo Yazbeck,who worked on the 1993 World Development Report , for information and suggestions. Any misinterpretations are my sole responsibility, and inparticular do not necessarily represent the views of the co-authors of theWDR nor of the World Bank. Introduction The article by Paalman et al. (1998) constitutes a fairly thorough and gen- erally helpful guide to what is meant by the 'burden of disease' presented inthe World Bank's 1993 World Development Report, Investing in Health (WDR), and how it is calculated. T o a slightly lesser extent, the article is alsouseful for understanding how cost-effectiveness was estimated and used forsetting disease control priorities, 2and how these results were used in the WDR. As the title indicates, the piece is a critical review of these exercisesand not simply an explanation of them. In this respect it is less acceptable,since some of the criticisms are misguided, a few are couched in somewhatirresponsible or evasive language, and some of them are plain wrong. Thisrejoinder proposes to sort out which criticisms are sound and which are not, Reprinted from \"A Critical Review of 'A Critical Review': The Methodology of the 1993 World Development Report, 'Investing in Health'.\" Health Policy and Planning 15(1), 2000, pp. 110-115, by permission of Oxford University Press.154 Health Economics in Development or less sound, and thereby to clarify further what the WDR says and why it says it. I had the good fortune to be one of its authors, and so cannot claimneutrality in this discussion; but the experience of working on the Reportand enduring much criticism of it even before it was published, 3as well as in the 6 years since, may illuminate some of the issues raised. It is conven-ient to group the observations of the review by Paalman et al. (henceforthreferred to as the Review) under four headings: the choice of cost-effectiveness, cost-utility or cost-benefit analysis; the various subjective parameters used to calculate Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs); using the burden of disease and cost-effectiveness estimates (and other criteria) to set priorities; and things the WDR might have undertaken, but did not. Choice and Appropriateness of Analysis There are three distinct ways to compare the cost of some program or activ- ity to its outcome: the analysis of cost-effectiveness (CEA), cost-utility (CUA)or cost-benefit (CBA) ratios or, in the case of CBA only, differences. TheReview says that 'of the different economic evaluation techniques, themethod used in the WDR is cost-utility analysis, a type of cost-effectivenessanalysis used in the health sector' (p. 19). This is mostly right, although CUAneed not be restricted to the health sector, and CUA is not so much a type ofCEA as it is an extension of the latter that moves from purely objective meas-ures of effects such as cases of disease, or lives, or people, to measures such asPotential Years of Life Lost (PYLL), Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) orDALYs, which explicitly introduce one or more subjective parameters inorder to value the outcome. The distinction is clear and useful (Hurley et al.1998), and it is perhaps regrettable that the WDR did not employ it; but thereis a long tradition of using CEA to mean both things, and there is no con-venient adjectival form of CUA comparable to 'cost-effective'. The choice of CUA for the WDR meant that only health outcomes would be considered among the effects of an activity, precluding fullerevaluation of 'other sector interventions which are known to impact onhealth, such as girls' schooling, water supply and sanitation, and increasedDALYs and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 155 food consumption', as well as evaluation of the non-health effects of family planning (the Review, p. 14). The Review says of these interventions that'in terms of total welfare they may be very cost effective', but this is a con-fusion of terms, just as it is to say that 'this has the effect of reducing theoverall impact of an intervention, and thus reducing the resulting cost-effectiveness ratio' (p. 21). Such comparisons can be made only by assigningmonetary values to the outcomes and applying CBA, as the Review recog-nizes elsewhere (p. 20). That raises problems of valuation far more vexingthan those involved in CUA, such as whether to value results according topeople's willingness to pay for them, which is dependent on the distributionof income and other factors that determine whether people act as thoughthe intervention were worth its cost. Such comparisons are difficult enoughwithin a single country, and would become almost meaningless across coun-tries with very different incomes. The WDR authors chose to avoid theseproblems and accept the resulting limitations, and that choice cannot becriticized without implicitly favoring the monetization of benefits. Subjective Parameters: Life Expectancy, Disability, Discounting and Age-weights Even asking how much life is lost by a premature death, as in PYLL, requires choosing some life expectancy to define 'premature'. And any sum-ming-up of mortality and morbidity, disability, or other notion of non-fatalhealth loss requires assigning weights to states between death and perfecthealth. Thus at least two of the four subjective parameters incorporated inthe burden of disease calculations are inescapable in any such exercise, andthe only question is what values they should take. There is a more subtlereason why the future should be discounted to some degree, which alsomakes a third parameter essential to avoid problems. Life expectancies The Review admits that it is 'ethically appealing' to assign potential lives of 80 or more years to everyone in the world (p. 16), but complains that 'theuse of high standard life expectancies leads to very high burdens of diseasein countries which presently have considerably lower life expectancies', sothat 'it might be better to use realistic life expectancies when settingnational priorities'. This is, regrettably, a common confusion: people dying156 Health Economics in Development young is clearly a 'burden of disease', or the phrase does not mean anything, and it is wrong to imply that the high burden of disease in poor, short-livedpopulations is somehow an overestimate. Probably what the authors meant,but did not distinguish, is that the amount of healthy life that could begained by eliminating that disease alone might be relatively small, becausein an unhealthy environment the people whose lives were saved would stilldie young from something else. That is, the effectiveness of interventionsmight be exaggerated, even if the burden were correctly estimated. This is a plausible-sounding argument, and would imply the need for some adjustment when passing from the current burden to the potentialgain from intervention. But it runs into a paradox which hardly any criticsof the WDR have noticed: clearly if all the diseases contributing to the burden were controlled to the same extent that they are in Japan, lifeexpectancy would rise to 80 or more years, just as in that country. (It doesnot matter that the cost of achieving such control, and the best choice ofactivities to bring it about, might differ from country to country.) Thus thegain from controlling all the diseases together would greatly exceed the sumof the gains from controlling each one separately, using the current shortlife expectancy. This adding-up paradox is a further reason, independent ofthe equity argument or the desirability of uniform international compar-isons, for using the same long life expectancies everywhere when estimatingthe burden of disease. Citing Anand and Hanson (1995), the critical review proceeds to another and much blunter confusion: the argument that if high life expectancies areused, 'the global burden of disease not only measures the burden of disease , but also indicates a burden of ' underdevelopment '.' It should be superfluous to point out that by definition, every cause of death is classified as some sortof 'disease', taking the term to include perinatal conditions, malnutrition,and all forms of violence or external causes. Nobody dies directly of under-development. The notion that there is a burden of disease up to a country'scurrent life expectancy, and that the difference in years of life lost fromthere out to an expectancy of 80 years or more is due to something else, issimply wrong. The right way to think about underdevelopment is as acollection of risk factors, and it is true that disaggregating the burden ofdisease by risk factors is a much more complex undertaking thandistinguishing the contributions of individual diseases. That is why theWDR attempted such an analysis for only a handful of risk factors:malnutrition (WDR T able 4.3), poor household environments (T able 4.5),and some other environmental threats (T able 4.6). These estimates areDALYs and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 157 more preliminary and less thorough than those for particular diseases, and may be substantially revised when the World Health Organization finishespublishing the complete Global Burden of Disease series now in progress. Disability weights In contrast to the criticism of the other subjective parameters, the Review does not quarrel with the individual weights assigned to different disabilities\u2014there are, after all, many of them, grouped into six classes\u2014but focuses onhow those weights were arrived at. In particular, the authors question theuse of expert opinion, rather than that of patients or the general population,and complain that 'some of the criticisms might have been prevented if theprocess by which disability weights were established had been publishedand openly debated' (p. 18). It is certainly true that people with differentrelations to a disability\u2014having suffered it, or treated it, or only thoughtabout it\u2014may evaluate it differently, but that does not establish whose viewis more to be accepted; by definition, there are no right answers to thesesubjective elements, only answers that are reasonably consistent and defen-sible. And given the very tight deadline for producing the estimates thatwent into the WDR, there was no possibility of debate thorough enough tosatisfy all the potential critics of the procedure. There was really no alter-native to publishing the results and thereby opening them for discussion. The Review points out that there is no allowance for conditions worse than death, but while one might admit there are such cases, they are surelyrare enough, and often so short-lived as to make little contribution to theoverall burden of disease. A more serious criticism is that severity and dura-tion of disability are estimated separately, and the burden is simply the prod-uct of these two characteristics; there is no allowance for learning to live witha disability so as to suffer less from it, or for suffering more because there isno hope of cure or remission. This is an instance of a general issue that isconfronted repeatedly in the definition of DALYs, which is that of linearity . The burden of disease adds linearly across individuals of the same age whosuffer death or the same disability at the same time: this has the great com-putational advantage of permitting one to work with totals or averages. Incontrast, DALYs are not linear with age, because of age weighting, northrough time, because of discounting; a year of disability differs in valueaccording to when it occurs and the age of the person to whom it happens.Rather than imposing linearity everywhere, which would greatly simplify thecalculations, or allowing everywhere for non-linear relations, the creators of158 Health Economics in Development the burden of disease estimates introduced nonlinearity wherever there seemed to be a strong specific justification for it, and not otherwise. Finally, it is true that the assigned disability weights are uniform across cultures and circumstances, even though the ease with which someone cancope with a disability differs from place to place and person to person. Uni-formity was imposed here partly for computational convenience, but alsofor equity reasons, so as to make no distinction among people according towhere they happen to live and what resources they have for dealing withdisabilities. Discount rate Since the burden of disease incident in any one year includes all the future effects of death and disability occurring in that year, it is necessary to decidehow to value the future. The effects of choosing a high or low discount rateon the composition of the burden of disease are correctly described, as is thereason for not using short-term rates on risky investments. However, thediscussion of this issue in the Review is unfortunately rather evasive. Thus,discounting 'purportedly' converts future lives to their present values, and'is said to' avoid the time paradox (p. 18)\u2014it is not recognized that it does avoid that paradox\u2014and the paradox itself is consigned to a footnote. In aworld where resources can be invested at a positive interest rate, if one doesnot discount future benefits, it will never pay to undertake an interventionbecause each year's delay means the benefit can be increased, for example byreaching more beneficiaries. The rhetorical question, 'Whose perspectiveand values should be considered?' ignores the fact that 'the long-term [aver-age] yield on investments' is determined not by a cabal of experts but by allof society, which behaves as though it does discount the future at some ratenot too different from 3%. Age weights These are easily the most controversial of the subjective parameters used in the calculation of DALYs, and as the Review says, 'neither universallyaccepted nor valued' (p. 17). This is partly because age weights are notintrinsically necessary for comparing mortality and disability, measuringyears of life lost, or avoiding time paradox: this makes them the mostoptional of the subjective choices involved in going from CEA to CUA.However, a substantial part of the rejection they encounter is due to mis-understanding, in particular to supposing that the weights are determinedDALYs and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 159 by relative economi c productivity. If they were, they would stay close to zero up to age 15 or so, reach their peak much later than age 25, and dropsharply at retirement age. They would also discriminate according to peo-ple's income-earning ability, so that their use to set priorities for health carewould favour the rich\u2014thus the 'obvious inequity' to which Murray (1994)refers. There is nothing inconsistent about rejecting such an economicmeasure and instead using age-weights that are designed to take account ofthe emotional loss to other people from an individual's death. The weights reach their peak at 25 years, because a person that age is likely to have aspouse and young children, and parents still living. They are low at veryearly ages because parents can often replace a lost infant, before they agemuch themselves, and low at high ages because one's parents are usuallydeceased and one's children grown by then. It is inconsistent to criticize parameters that try to incorporate the loss to those related individuals, andat the same time complain that DALYs do not include any of 'the burdenswhich fall on households' (p. 18). More generally, treating all ages equally is also a subjective choice, and while it is simpler and more 'classical', it is not obviously better. Part of thesensitivity analysis conducted by Murray et al. (1994, p. 103) involves vary-ing the age weights from the pattern used in the WDR, through three inter-mediate values with the same general shape but smaller age differences, toequal weight for all ages\u2014not, as the Review says, 'shifting to more unequalage weights' (p. 19). Changing the age weights has complex effects on thecomposition of the burden of disease by age and by disease, effects partlycompensated by the discount rate, but with essentially no effect on the com-position by sex. There is no clear right answer to how to treat different ages,since it depends on how much one wishes to take into account emotionallosses suffered by people close to the disease victim. Actual Choices in Burden of Disease Estimates As of mid-1998, there had been, in addition to the global estimates used in the WDR, 15 exercises in national priority setting in health in 17 countriesand one large Indian state, which included estimates of burden of disease(Bobadilla 1998, pp. 12-15). Another such study was in preparation, andthere had been another four efforts to determine priority interventionswithout estimating disease burden. These exercises covered as few as 10major diseases and as many as 112. Several of them ignored morbidity and160 Health Economics in Development disability and estimated only the (much larger) health damage from prema- ture mortality. 'Although the indicator to assess the burden of disease mostcommonly used was the DALY, half of the countries made significant mod-ifications, and one (Russia) used a different indicator . . . Five countries didnot discount future health losses, and . . . Five countries did not apply anyage weights to health losses or used different weights from those proposedin the 1993 World Development Report . Finally, three of the countries that studied disability used a different disability scale to assess severity. In short,only seven of the 19 study results are comparable . . .' (Bobadilla 1998,pp. 17-18 and T able 3). This varied experience shows that what is proposedin the WDR is not universally imposed, for at least three reasons\u2014a diseaseburden dominated by mortality from a small number of diseases, inadequatedata (a problem on which the Review rightly insists) and subjective choiceswhich depart from the logic outlined above. While this may be interpretedas a victory for local views and values, there is no reason to think it makesthe different national studies any better than if they had all used the samemethods and numerical values. Priorities for Intervention The Review summarizes well (p. 14) the idea that an intervention is a 'good buy' if it is cost-effective and also deals with a disease or risk factor thataccounts for a sizeable burden of disease. In strict economic terms, the lat-ter condition should be irrelevant: if at the margin, an intervention dealscost-effectively with a small disease problem, then it is worth buying. Atleast, this will be true so long as there are no large fixed costs to confrontingsmall disease burdens, and the health care system can deal simultaneouslywith a large number of interventions. The reason for including the size ofthe burden as a criterion for priority setting is precisely that health systemsin poor countries often cannot efficiently administer a large collection ofprograms, and dissipate their resources trying to do so. In consequence, itmakes sense to maximize the health gains from a small number of interven-tions, economizing on scarce managerial and administrative capacity.There are, as the Review notes (p. 22), some very difficult issues of whetherdisease burden and cost-effectiveness criteria can be used for large-scalereallocations or only for marginal increments of resources, and of what thehealth system is currently doing or trying to do with its existing infrastruc-ture, which cannot easily be re-directed. These difficulties mean that aDALYs and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 161 simple ranking of cost-effectiveness cannot be treated as a list of priorities, even ignoring other considerations, unless the health system can\u2014subjectto overall resource limitations\u2014actually offer any of the interventions onthe list without interfering with the capacity to administer others. 4 The Review observes, correctly, that when a disease is expanding rapidly, the current burden it causes is a poor guide to priority (p. 23, citingBobadilla et al. 1994). But it does not recognize that the WDR applied thisreasoning to argue 'Why AIDS is a special case', requiring urgent preven-tive measures to contain its spread (pp. 99-106). Nor do the authors of theReview take any account of the discussion in the WDR (pp. 54-59) of therationales for government action in health other than that of obtainingvalue for money. Cost-effectiveness is, almost tautologically, the criterionfor getting the most health gain out of a given quantity of resources, how-ever the effect is measured. It is not necessarily the appropriate criterion forhow public resources should be spent, except in the case of public goods for which markets do not exist, or services with such large externalities thatmarkets will work quite imperfectly (Musgrove 1999). The emphasis in theWDR on disease burden and cost-effectiveness constitutes its principalnovelty, and, not surprisingly, has drawn much more attention from thepublic health community than the more conventional discussion of publicfinance criteria and of equity. Equity is a troublesome issue, because cost-effectiveness is concerned only with efficiency, and 'the fact that the most efficient interventions . . .tend to specifically benefit the poor is more a result of coincidence than ofprinciple' (p. 24), a finding that has since been more fully substantiated(Gwatkin and Guillot 1998). And neither horizontal nor vertical equity isnecessarily compatible with cost-effectiveness (Musgrove 1999); societiesmust choose how far to favor one or the other goal. Nonetheless, govern-ments can do much to promote equity by how they finance health care, even if the interventions are chosen on the basis of value for money. And theessential package which the WDR recommends was designed specificallyfor very poor countries. At higher income levels, it becomes much harderto say what should go into a package, and cost-effectiveness becomes lessrelevant as a guide. Giving some degree of priority to the poor, either because they are sicker than the non-poor or because they are less able to pay for health care, isethically acceptable and is explicitly favored by the WDR. It does not followthat other distinctions among potential beneficiaries are equally justified.Thus giving 'greater weight to mothers and children than to adult males',162 Health Economics in Development as the Review says was done in the Oregon exercise to determine what interventions Medicaid would finance (p. 17), is prima facie inequitable, par- ticularly since the greater life expectancy of children already gives them ameasure of priority over adults, where death or long-term disability areconcerned. And to judge that, ceteris paribus , a year of death or disability matters more for a woman than for a man is breathtakingly unfair. Priori-ties among population groups should not be imposed as part of the estima-tion of disease burden, but should emerge from the analysis of what healthgains can be achieved, at what cost, given those groups' disease profile. Thatis the greatest conceptual advance in the WDR, the insistence that ongrounds of both equity and efficiency 'it is appropriate to . . . prioritizehealth care interventions rather than population groups' (p. 23 of theReview). If this contradicts the common emphasis on 'vulnerable groups',so much the worse for that emphasis: everyone is vulnerable to some healthproblems, and not every vulnerability has a solution. The way to combineinformation on the main elements of the disease burden of particular ageand sex groups, with information on the availability of cost-effective inter-ventions that could significantly reduce that burden, is well illustrated inAppendix T ables B.6 and B.7 of the WDR. That exercise shows that chil-dren and women do indeed deserve priority for certain health problems , but not universally or independently of what diseases they suffer. Thus control-ling childhood diarrhoea and respiratory infections should have priority, butdealing with congenital malformations probably should not. The Review criticizes the idea of an essential package for poor countries, including a small number of interventions, on the grounds that it 'is not inline with the Alma Ata approach to comprehensive care, which has beenpushed by WHO and donors for many years now', and that 'the call for spe-cific packages could lead to vertical programs' (p. 24), as though it weredemonstrated that vertical programs are a bad thing and that the Alma Ataapproach has been shown to work adequately. 5This sounds more like cling- ing to poorly justified positions than like real analysis. A more seriouscriticism is that 'the package arrived at by experts might not be acceptableto the public, and hence less cost-effective in the end' than if people's wisheswere consulted in formulating priorities. This raises the general, and severe,problem of needs and wants not necessarily coinciding, and points to theurgency of finding out whether and why people may not use existing healthservices and reforming those services so as to attract the beneficiaries theyare meant to help. The Review correctly emphasizes that the actual cost-effectiveness of an intervention depends on the scale of utilization and theDALYs and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 163 degree of compliance by patients, which will vary with local cultural, eco- nomic and other conditions. The Review is the result of conflating and editing separate papers by the four authors.6This may explain why it says in one place (p. 24) that 'Once the most cost-effective interventions are in place the burden of disease isexpected to decrease', and then elsewhere (p. 25) claims that 'implementa-tion of the advocated good buys will most likely not result in a reduction ofthe burden of disease, but in the transition of disease patterns and increasedhealth care costs'. Certainly the former view is correct, or it makes no senseto do anything about health problems at all. The fact that the cost of gain-ing a DALY will rise if the cheapest DALYs are bought first is an indicationof success, not of failure; it would still be true that the greatest number ofDALYs could be bought for any given expenditure, or that for a givenreduction in disease burden, the cost would be minimal. All that the WDRintended to do in this regard was to emphasize the huge differences in cost-effectiveness among known interventions\u2014differences that are often muchlarger than the likely errors in estimation\u2014and the large disease burdensthat could be controlled at relatively low cost (although possibly requiringexpenditures significantly larger than the poorest countries are now dedi-cating to health). What the WDR Might Have Done, But Did Not Unlike most publications from the World Bank or elsewhere, the annual World Development Report is produced on a timetable that does not allow even one day's deviation, and with a rigid ceiling on the number of pages.These constraints precluded doing a great many things that would havemade for a more comprehensive volume. 7A good deal of the criticism in the Review concerns such desirable but infeasible improvements as: generating more and better data on disease incidence, and especially on intervention costs and effectiveness, since the existing base of informa-tion is incomplete and includes many estimates and approximations; performing more extensive sensitivity analysis to see whether any of the conclusions or recommendations would be overturned by plausiblechanges in empirical data or in the values of the subjective parameters; incorporating more views into the estimation of disability weights and age weights, and forming a wider consensus on their values; and164 Health Economics in Development providing more help to countries wishing to use the recommendations of the WDR to restructure their health systems and reallocate resources,including 'practical advice for Ministries of Health on how to deal withpolitical barriers' (p. 24). The WDR was not intended as the last word on any of these issues; on the contrary, it was meant to stimulate more and better data and analysis, byshowing what could be done even with the limited information available.And it could not, without becoming a multi-volume encyclopedia, deal withthe specific economic, political and cultural circumstances of all the soci-eties where its recommendations might be applicable. (A flood of countrystudies and project documents in the last six years have been dedicatedpartly to that end.) In particular, trying to give global political advice wouldbe even more open to criticism than the global suggestions based on narroweconomic criteria. Many of the recommendations in the Review for furtherresearch and refinement of recommendations are entirely compatible withthe aims of the WDR and the views of its authors. However, no volume ofdata and no amount of analysis will do away with the need for subjectivejudgment about key parameters. More sensitivity analysis can at best showwhether conclusions hold up under different numerical values\u2014it cannotdetermine the right values. And wider debate about those values will notnecessarily lead to agreement, as appears from the variety of assumptionsadopted in the burden of disease exercises described above. More precisionand clarity are possible, at a cost, and very desirable; certainty never will be.That is why the effort launched by the World Development Report is likely to continue for years and may gradually transform how people think abouthealth sector priorities, without ever providing final answers. Concluding Remarks The authors of the Review are nothing if not critical; I hope that this reply will clarify where those criticisms are well-founded and where they are not,including the few instances of outright error. Still, the Review concludesthat 'the World Bank is to be commended for this unique initiative,conducted in a self-critical spirit' (p. 25). In the same spirit, I believe theauthors of the World Development Report can commend the thoroughness of the critical review which their work has received, and the obvious willing-ness of the reviewers to understand, explain, and improve on it.DALYs and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 165 Notes 1.

This is one of the crucial issues treated in Better Health in Africa (World Bank 1994), which is in many ways a companion volume to the 1993 World Development Report . 5. Quite the opposite occurred in Bangladesh, where the development of anessential package of services led to the consolidation of more than 100 vertical pro-grams, 66 of them supported by donors (Abdo Yazbeck, personal communication,June 1999; the details are in reference World Bank 1998).6.

I am grateful to Ricardo Bitr\u00e1n, who developed Module 5,for the opportunity to participate in that part of the course and for his reac-tions to the ideas presented here; to my colleagues Paul Shaw, Anne Johansenand Hadia Samaha; and to the audiences for the Flagship Course in Wash-ington and at seminars or courses in Moscow, Santiago, Bogot\u00e1, Bras\u00edlia andRiyadh during the next several months, for opportunities to pursue theseideas and improve their logic and presentation. Julio Frenk, Lant Pritchettand an anonymous reviewer also provided helpful comments. Any remainingerrors or confusions are no one's fault but the author's. Introduction It is standard practice in courses on health economics to explain each of the several justifications for the state to intervene in this sector. Theseinclude the different kinds of market failure that can occur in health careinterventions and insurance, together with the equity reasons for inter-vention, such as to assure some minimum coverage of health insurance or Reprinted from \"Public Spending on Health Care: How Are Different Criteria Related?\" Health Policy 47, 1999, pp. 207-223, Copyright 1999, with permission from Elsevier Science.168 Health Economics in Development access to health care for the poor or for some other group. What is almost always missing from such a course is any explanation of how these differ-ent criteria are related to one another. In particular, the participant seldomgets any help understanding two kinds of potentially very important rela-tions between one criterion and another. One question is whether they arecompatible with each other or are in conflict, requiring one to choosebetween them in deciding how to use public resources. The other questionis whether they are connected sequentially or hierarchically, so that oneshould examine one criterion before asking if another one is applicable. This note asks and answers these two questions\u2014about compatibility and about hierarchy\u2014for nine frequently used criteria. Working out theconnections among these criteria leads to a partial decision tree concerningthree possible outcomes: a particular service should be financed publicly (orsubsidized in part), it should be left to private markets to provide or itshould not be produced at all. Helping to reach such decisions is one of themain goals of public finance theory [1], and making the decisions is amongthe principal tasks of government. Which Criteria Matter? Fig. 9.1 displays the nine criteria, and classifies four of them as being pri- marily economic (about efficiency), four primarily about equity, and one asneither of these. T o keep the analysis as simple as possible, each criterion isconsidered chiefly as a reason for spending public money on health care, orchoosing how to spend it, rather than as a justification for other, non-financial kinds of government intervention. The economic efficiency criteria start with cost-effectiveness, or the rela- tion between the cost of an intervention and the resulting outcome orhealth gain. T wo reasons for market failure which occur primarily in themarket for health care are also included: health interventions which arepublic goods and therefore have no market or which produce such markedexternalities that markets will not produce the efficient amount of the serv-ice. The fourth efficiency reason is the catastrophic cost of some healthcare, which is an argument for risk sharing via insurance. The equity criteria include both horizontal and vertical equity. Both these concepts of fairness are considered only in relation to health care, not to howhealth services are financed, although the horizontal/vertical distinction alsoapplies there. Poverty is another criterion in this group; that is, the emphasisCriteria for Public Spending on Health Care 169 is on the equitable or moral aspects of providing preferential treatment to poor people, not on whether that would be efficient because it made themmore productive, lifted them out of poverty, and so on. The fourth criterionof equity is the 'rule of rescue', the admonition to give priority to saving livesover interventions that do not make a life-or-death difference. Finally, there is something rather lamely called 'public demands', which is meant to encompass an important political aspect missing from these moretechnical criteria: that is, what does the public think its money should be usedfor? Public beliefs and wishes may be many and contradictory, but probablyinclude a mixture of equity and efficiency concerns, and it is worth askinghow they also may be related to cost-effectiveness. (Other demands and pres-sures for public expenditure arise from providers of health care and from sup-pliers of equipment, drugs and other inputs; these are not considered here.) The full set of possible binary relations among the nine criteria would require an unwieldy 36 comparisons. Only eight of these are considered,Catastrophic Cost Externalities Public GoodsPoverty Vertical Equity Horizontal EquityCost-Effectiveness Rule of Rescue Key:Efficiency Criteria Equity or Ethical Criteria Political CriterionPublic DemandsFigure 9.1 Nine Criteria for Public Spending on Health Care170 Health Economics in Development comparing every other criterion with that of cost-effectiveness. The reason is that this is arguably the most misunderstood criterion, partly because it isusually not treated in relation to other reasons for intervening in the healthsector. In consequence, it is thought by some people to be the only test thatmatters, and by others to be irrelevant or nearly so. Concentrating on therelations between other criteria and cost-effectiveness helps to clarify therole of cost-effectiveness in making decisions about public intervention inhealth care. Cost-Effectiveness and Public Goods This is the simplest relation among those considered: cost-effectiveness is the criterion for choosing which of a number of public goods are worthfinancing. Simply being a public good is not reason enough for the govern-ment to finance a health care intervention, because the result in improvedhealth might not be worth the cost\u2014the same resources could be betterused for another health service or for some non-health activity [2]. But ifsomething is a public good, there is no private market for it, and so there isno risk that government finance will crowd out private purchases. In conse-quence, the output that is paid for publicly is all the output there is, andthere is a direct relation between public finance and the gain in welfare.How large that gain is depends on the health improvement and on thewelfare evaluation of the health gain. Maximization of welfare under theseconditions leads to cost-effectiveness as the way to choose among differentpublic goods [3]. All that is necessary is that total welfare be monotonicallyrelated to total health gain, so that obtaining the largest possible improve-ment in health\u2014which is what cost-effectiveness does, for a given amountof resources\u2014also yields the largest obtainable total welfare. The relation between public goods and cost-effectiveness is not only straightforward, it is also hierarchical. That is, one asks first whether somehealth care service qualifies as a public good, and then whether it can beprovided cost-effectively. It might seem just as well to select all the cost-effective health services first, and then to ask which ones of them arepublic goods, but there are two reasons not to proceed in this way. First,too little is known about the cost-effectiveness of hundreds of health ser-vices to draw up such a set and choose from among them [4]. It reduces thedemands on information to ask about cost-effectiveness only after apply-ing some other, more easily determined, criterion. Second, the sequenceCriteria for Public Spending on Health Care 171 public good? cost-effective? is the only pair of questions that need to be asked where public goods are concerned. In contrast, the question ofwhether a particular health service is cost-effective also arises in relation toseveral other criteria, as indicated below, and it is easier to deal with eachof them in turn. Externalities, or Partly Public Goods If an intervention does not qualify as a pure public good, because private purchasers are willing to pay for it, there may still be significant effects onnon-purchasers: that is, externalities. Measures to treat communicable dis-ease can fall into this category, because while a person with the disease maybe willing to pay to be cured, treating him or her also reduces the risk oftransmission and thereby protects others. (Chemotherapy for tuberculosisis an often-cited example.) The service is then partly private, because thereis a private or individual gain that can be bought in the market, but is alsopartly public because of the externality. For this reason it seems intuitivelyclear that cost-effectiveness should also be used to choose which serviceswith externalities deserve to be financed publicly. But there are two otherissues to deal with before asking about cost-effectiveness. The first is whether the externality is significant: that is, whether it really makes for a difference between the private benefits to purchasers and thetotal benefits, including those accruing to non-purchasers. If the differenceis quite small, the service has only a little public character, and it can prop-erly be treated as if it were a purely private good. If however there is a largeexternality, it becomes appropriate to ask whether the private demand forthe service is sufficient to assure realization of (nearly) all the potentialsocial benefit. That is, will private individuals buy enough of the interven-tion that no public inducement or subsidy is needed? Or will they, for what-ever reason (poverty, high cost, under-valuation of the benefits), fail to seekor to continue treatment, so that the preventive potential is not realized? If the answer is that the private demand appears inadequate, then cost- effectiveness becomes relevant. That is, one should ask whether the poten-tial social gain from publicly subsidizing the service with the externality islarge enough to justify the cost. Since there is some private demand, thesubsidy may be only partial, rather than total as in the case of pure publicgoods. The chain of questions becomes longer: significant externalities?adequate private demand? cost-effective?172 Health Economics in Development For both public goods and services with externalities, the hierarchical relation to cost-effectiveness means that the question of whether the differ-ent criteria are consistent does not arise. One does not get into hypotheti-cal problems such as, that a particular intervention ought to be financedpublicly because it is a public good, but should not have public money spenton it because of low cost-effectiveness. The second decision dominates thefirst, and the service is not worth buying. What If the Cost is Catastrophic? T wo health care interventions may look equally justified because they have the same ratio of cost to effectiveness\u2014the same cost per life saved, per yearof healthy life gained, or some other measure of results\u2014but one may be anorder of magnitude more expensive than the other ([5] Figure 3.2). Peoplepaying out of pocket will afford the cheaper service, but the catastrophicallycostly service will be available only if the financial risk is shared. The factthat some services cost too much for individuals to buy is often regarded asa reason for public finance, but it is really a reason for insurance. Whetherthat insurance should be public or private or a mixture of the two is a com-plex question, involving the risks of failure in the private insurance marketand the costs of limiting those risks or eliminating them by public regula-tion, finance or other measures. If the cost of a service is not catastrophic,however\u2014that is, if most people can pay for it out of pocket without beingimpoverished\u2014then there is generally no argument for it to be financedpublicly. (The exceptions are services which people could buy, but do not,because of incomplete information, such as preventive screening that wouldallow early treatment and avoid later catastrophic expenses. Subsidizingsuch services is one way of overcoming this market failure.) This leaves two conclusions. One is that costs matter by themselves, and not only in relation to results. The other is that if the cost is low enough,individuals who contemplate buying the service can make their own deci-sions about cost-effectiveness. The two criteria, cost and cost-effectiveness,are independent, so they are compatible. Only when the cost is catastrophic,and there are good reasons for public finance of the service, does cost-effectiveness need to be separately taken into account. Then the two crite-ria may be in conflict, as will appear later. There is one more question to ask about the criterion of catastrophic costs, and that is, catastrophic for whom? Some individuals, after all, canCriteria for Public Spending on Health Care 173 afford much more medical care than others. The easiest answer to this ques- tion seems to be to regard a cost as catastrophic if it cannot be paid bysomeone who is non-poor, without it making him or her poor. That is, thedistinction between catastrophic and non-catastrophic depends on the dis-tinction between being poor and non-poor, where poverty is defined bysome criterion other than health, such as income, consumption of necessi-ties such as food, etc. This leads directly to the next criterion: poverty as anethical reason for public finance of health care. Poverty and Cost-Effectiveness Since poverty is defined independently of either the costs or the outcomes of health care, there would seem to be no obvious or necessary relationbetween these two criteria. The situation is not quite so simple, however, tothe degree that the poor are not only sicker and die younger than the non-poor, but are afflicted by different diseases. Both the level and the compo-sition of the burden of disease differ somewhat between poor and non-poorpopulations, with the poor suffering more from communicable diseases andfrom premature mortality, compared to non-communicable causes B, T ables B.5 and B.8), [6]. It happens that some though not all of the diseases which differentially affect the poor are also diseases for which relatively cost-effective interven-tions exist. There is therefore a fairly marked relation between poverty andcost-effectiveness, but it is also an accidental and transitory association. Itexists because the non-poor either do not need those interventions, or wouldbenefit less from them, or have already benefited, while the poor still suffer alarge reducible burden. Measles is a good example of this difference: the non-poor of the world are protected by immunization, but many of the poor stillare not. And since the poor are more likely to be malnourished, and sincemalnutrition greatly increases the risk of death from measles [7], immunizingthe poor prevents even more health loss than among the non-poor. This suggests that poverty and cost-effectiveness are often compatible criteria: doing something to improve the health of the poor has a betterthan average chance of also being cost-effective\u2014but not always. The pooralso suffer from many health problems which do not now have cost-effective solutions, and it does not automatically follow that public moneyshould be spent ineffectively, just because the intended beneficiaries arepoor. The same question of value for money arises here as with the174 Health Economics in Development efficiency reasons for public expenditures. This is the basis for the idea of using public funds to guarantee access to a package of 'essential' or 'basic'services for the poor, and choosing those services partly on the basis of theircost-effectiveness ([51, T ables 3.2 and 3.3), [8]. Some of these services arepublic or partly public goods, so public spending on them is justified for thewhole population at risk. The idea of a limited package of subsidized serv-ices for those in poverty is often attacked as being unethical, as represent-ing 'poor health care for poor people', but that criticism is misguided ontwo grounds. First, the poor would, under such an arrangement, receive onaverage more cost-effective care than the non-poor. Second, there is noth-ing unethical about taking into account the wishes of those who pay thetaxes to support the subsidy, for whom cost-effectiveness may be a reason-able criterion [9]. This issue is taken up again when considering what 'pub-lic demand' means. T o sum up: poverty and cost-effectiveness are somewhat related, but the association is partial and, historically, probably transitory. It did not exist acentury or more ago, when the rich and the poor got sick and died of thesame diseases and there was little effective health care, and it may not holdin the future, when the known cost-effective interventions will, one hopes,have been more fully applied to the benefit of the poor. Because the associa-tion is only partial, it is appropriate to ask first whether people are poor, andthen whether a particular intervention justifies its costs. Horizontal Equity in Health Care This ethical principle implies giving equal treatment to people with equal health problems, that is, not discriminating among them as to how much orwhat kind of care to provide. If two people are really equal in the nature andseverity of a disease or injury, and they get the identical treatment, then theresults should also be the same. So horizontal equity implies equal effective-ness. In practice, outcomes often differ among patients who appear alikeboth in their problem and in their treatment, but the conclusion will stillhold on average. The health gains will also differ if two people differ in ageand therefore in life expectancy, with the younger beneficiary having moreto gain from treatment. Similarly, there will be differences if one patient hasan additional health problem (co-morbidity) which limits the effectivenessof care for their common problem. Other possible differences amongpeople\u2014in income, education, location, and so on\u2014are irrelevant for thispurpose unless they affect the outcome of all interventions.Criteria for Public Spending on Health Care 175 All this implies that horizontal equity and cost-effectiveness are perfectly compatible, so long as the costs are equal, or nearly so, because then thecost-effectiveness of treatment will be the same for everyone with the sameproblem. But if the costs of treatment differ significantly between onepatient and another, the two criteria are in conflict, and, as often happens[10], a difficult choice has to be made between equity and efficiency. Fig. 9.2 illustrates this conflict: one population suffers from a problem treatable by Intervention 1, and another population from a problem for Effectiveness of an Intervention Marginal Cost per Unit of Health Gain { } Intervention 1 C** C* Number of People AffectedIntervention 2Figure 9.2 Cost-effectiveness versus Horizontal Equity: Comparison of Two Interventions Where All Beneficiaries are Identical Exceptfor Costs176 Health Economics in Development which Intervention 2 is appropriate. The effectiveness of an intervention is the same for everyone who would benefit from it, but the cost of treatmentis not the same. Some people live in remote areas, or are otherwise moredifficult to reach or to treat, so that the marginal cost of an intervention, perunit of health gain, rises as more people are treated. Intervention 2 is uni-formly more effective\u2014yields more health gain\u2014than Intervention 1, buteven for the least costly patients, the cost is so much higher that the cost-effectiveness is initially lower than for Intervention 1. Horizontalequity says nothing about which intervention to finance first, and cost-effectiveness clearly gives priority to starting with Intervention 1. Butbefore everyone in the first population is treated, the marginal cost rises tothe level C*, so high that Intervention 2 begins to give more value formoney. Cost-effectiveness would require switching some expenditure tothat intervention, slowing the rate at which Intervention 1 is extended. IfC** is the upper limit to cost per unit of health gain\u2014any less cost-effectivetreatment is judged not worth buying\u2014the result is to treat everyone withIntervention 2 but to leave part of the first population without treatment, inviolation of horizontal equity. This kind of conflict can arise no matterwhich intervention is more effective; the problem is purely that costs differamong patients who are otherwise alike. Difficulties of this sort doubtlesslie behind numerous conflicts between equity and efficiency in health care,such as those associated with urban/rural differences: it is usually easier andcheaper to treat urban residents than scattered rural populations, particu-larly if the intervention requires hospitalization. Vertical Equity in Health Care Horizontal equity presents a straightforward possibility of conflict with the criterion of cost-effectiveness, in which only one variable is involved\u2014thecost of the intervention. The case of vertical equity and its relation to effi-ciency turns out to be much more complicated, because three variables arerelevant. These are the cost and the effectiveness of different treatments,and the severity of different health problems. Since vertical equity concernspreferential treatment for people with worse problems, severity cannot beignored the way it can be when dealing with horizontal equity. Whatparticularly complicates vertical comparisons is that the effectiveness of aservice need not bear any relation to the severity of the condition or diseaseit is meant to prevent or treat. Effectiveness, however it is measured,Criteria for Public Spending on Health Care 177 corresponds to the improvement in health from an intervention, which is the same thing as the reduction in the health damage caused by the disease.(The sum of this damage over a population is called the burden of disease: the same name is not commonly used, but the same concept applies, to thehealth damage for an individual.) One intervention may lead to a largerhealth gain than another, but cause a smaller proportional reduction in dis-ease burden. For example, surgery following major trauma can be highlyeffective because it saves the patient's life, but still leaves him or her withsevere disabilities, while surgery for some minor condition restores thepatient to perfect health but causes less absolute improvement. Fig. 9.3 illustrates some of these complexities. Four diseases or condi- tions are shown, affecting different populations. For each one, the figurealso shows the size of the health loss (for an individual, this is the heightabove the horizontal axis); the effectiveness of treatment (the portion ofhealth loss prevented or relieved by an intervention); and the cost of treat-ment (the length of the vertical bar below the horizontal axis). For eachintervention, the cost is assumed to be uniform for all potential patients orbeneficiaries, since the issue of costs differing among individuals hasalready been considered in discussing horizontal equity. Interventions 1and 2 deal with the entire burden of the corresponding diseases, but Inter-vention 3 is effective for only some of the people with that health problemand will do no good at all for others, while Intervention 4 helps everyone,but only partly\u2014the effectiveness falls far short of eliminating all thehealth damage. Vertical equity requires giving preference to the sufferers from the sec- ond condition, since it causes the most health loss. Moreover, there is a fullyeffective intervention, which reinforces the choice. But the cost is muchhigher than for any other intervention, so that the cost-effectiveness ofIntervention 2 is the worst of the four. Even Intervention 1, against the dis-ease which does the least harm to people's health, looks better on the cost-effectiveness criterion. That relation can be changed only by changing howone measures the disease burden and the results of an intervention, so thatfor example Disease 2 looks not twice as awful as Disease 1, but severaltimes worse. This issue is taken up again later. Other kinds of conflict between equity and efficiency also arise in Fig. 9.3. Disease 4 causes an individual burden nearly as large as Disease 2, soequity according to severity would rank it second. And the treatment is nomore costly than Intervention 1. The problem is that the service is, as indi-cated, not very effective, so that it is also not very cost-effective. Again,178 Health Economics in Development Disease 1 looks like the more efficient place to use resources. Disease 3 presents an even more complicated case, because the treatment is as cost-effective as Intervention 1 provided it is given only to those who will bene-fit from it, but yields much lower value for money if it is given to all suffer-ers, including those for whom it will do nothing. This discrimination ofwho should and who should not receive a treatment that will help somepeople but not others is one of the difficult choices medical professionalsSeverity (health loss from the disease) Disease 3Effectiveness (health gain fromthe intervention) Disease 1 Cost of the InterventionDisease 2 Disease 4Figure 9.3 Cost-effectiveness versus Vertical Equity: Comparison of Four Interventions Differing in Disease Severity, Intervention Effectiveness and CostCriteria for Public Spending on Health Care 179 regularly make, usually without complete knowledge of the likely outcome. Erring on the side of equity then means wasting some resources. It might seem that most or all of these problems could be resolved by redefining vertical equity, so that instead of \"do more for those with worseproblems\", the principle were understood as \"do more for those who can behelped more\". That eliminates the severity of the condition as a relevantvariable, leaving only the cost and effectiveness of treatment. But that doesnot solve the equity/efficiency conflict, because more effective treatmentsoften cost proportionally more than less effective ones, which makes themless cost-effective. There is simply no systematic relation between cost andresults, just as there is none between results and severity. Is the Rule of Rescue Efficient? This last ethical criterion is much simpler to deal with than those just dis- cussed, because it does not involve comparisons among individuals, exceptof the simplest form\u2014between those who will die without an interventionand those for whom the appropriate health care will not make such an all-or-nothing difference. This choice is the basis of triage, the custom ofdividing patients into those whose lives can be saved by intervening, thosewho will die even if given treatment, and those in between because theirlives are not immediately threatened. And that seems so obviously therational thing to do that it appears there should be no conflict between effi-ciency and ethical considerations. This conclusion is correct, with one important proviso: the rule of rescue and the criterion of cost-effectiveness are compatible, so long as 'saving a life'means keeping a person alive for long enough, and in good enough health,that the effect justifies the cost. This is what is usually meant by saving some-one's life\u2014rescuing him or her from drowning or some other accident, orcuring a potentially fatal disease before it has done irreparable damage. Thepayoff can be decades of healthy life, so it does not matter that there may bea high cost. That is not the same thing as postponing death briefly, or keep-ing a person alive but terribly disabled. The effectiveness of any interventiondepends on the instantaneous improvement in health, and also on how longthat improvement lasts. Just as brief illness with full recovery contributes lit-tle to the burden of disease, no matter how severely one is sick, brief healthgains, even if dramatic, do not yield much effectiveness. That is why, amongother things, heroic measures to stave off death from chronic conditions are180 Health Economics in Development usually not cost-effective, and why the effectiveness of treatments for cancer is measured not by whether the patient leaves the hospital alive, but by the5- or 10-year survival rate. This idea is explicitly recognized in any measureof health status that has a time dimension, such as potential years of life lost(PYLL) or more complex measures such as disability adjusted life years(DALYS) [11], or quality adjusted life years (QALYS) [12]. And What Do the People Want? The rule of rescue is the last of the seven relatively technical, explicit crite- ria to be contrasted to cost-effectiveness. It remains to consider briefly howall this relates to what the public may think or want, and in particular towhether cost-effectiveness is likely to be compatible with those views anddemands. This question cannot be answered conclusively, because what thepublic thinks varies from place to place and time to time, and is often eitheramorphous or polarized. There may be no such thing as a clear demandfrom people about which criteria should be used to determine how theirmoney is spent. (In the case of public goods, there is no demand in the mar-ket sense, and there may or may not be one in the sense of public agreementas to what the government should do.) So it is possible only to speculateabout how public wants fit in with the criteria under consideration: twohypotheses seem particularly relevant to this discussion. First, the public is likely to mix up criteria or to misunderstand them. This is not surprising or reprehensible, in view of how complicated the rela-tions can be between one criterion and another. T o take one example, thedecision of which health services to subsidize for the poor depends both onan assessment of who is poor and on a notion of how cost-effective some-thing must be in order to justify public expenditure\u2014and these are relatedto the distinction between costs that are catastrophic even for people whoare not poor, and those that the non-poor can afford but the poor perhapscannot. It is a combined technical and political task to decide on these matt-ers clearly enough that a public subsidy for medical care for the poor can beput into operation at all, and its design is likely to involve many choices inboth the medical and the financial spheres, as in the Medicaid program inthe United States [13]. One of the reasons for separating a number ofpossible criteria and looking at their connections, as has been done here, isprecisely to facilitate public discussion and understanding of the issuesinvolved.Criteria for Public Spending on Health Care 181 Second, most of the public would probably agree with the general proposition that one should get value for money when spending their taxes;but whether they would support a particular criterion of cost-effectiveness,and the allocations that result from it, might depend very much on howeffectiveness is defined. And the relative weights to give to effectiveness andto costs might not be so simple as taking the ratio of the two measures andusing it to rank different services. There is little explicit experience with theissue, but the development of the 'Oregon Plan', the list of health careprocedures that the state of Oregon decided to include in its Medicaid plan,is instructive in this regard [14, 15]. The process began with an expert ranking according to perceived cost- effectiveness, using a measure that\u2014as with PYLL, DALYs and QALYs\u2014is linear across individuals. That is, 10 years of healthy life lost are valuedthe same whether they are all lost by 1 individual, or ten people each lose1 year, or 1,000 people each lose 3 or 4 days. When this ranking wasproposed to the voters of Oregon, they ended by modifying it in variousways, one of which was equivalent to regarding a concentrated loss for oneperson as worse than the same loss distributed among many [16]. This non-linearity of disease burden, and therefore of effectiveness of health care,makes calculation harder because one cannot simply use totals or averageswhen comparing different health problems. But it is perfectly defensible asan ethical view. And it affects some of the other criteria considered here. Inparticular, changing how one measures effectiveness must, at the least,affect the comparisons involved in trying to apply horizontal and verticalequity, although that will not change the possible conflicts between equityand efficiency discussed above. One conclusion from this experience seemsto be that one cannot simply settle all the other connections among criteriaand take up what the public wants at the end, because what the publicthinks, or wants, or is prepared to support, can modify some of the othercriteria and the way they are related. Putting Everything Together: A Guide to Decision-Making As promised in the Introduction, the object of this note is not only to exam- ine the compatibility of different criteria, but to relate them sequentially orhierarchically when that is appropriate. If the different criteria can be takenup in some logical sequence, some of the problems of conflict among themare reduced, and it becomes easier to decide how to choose whether to182 Health Economics in Development finance a health care service out of public funds, leave it to the private mar- ket, do some of each, or conclude that the service will not and should notbe paid for either publicly or privately. Fig. 9.4 summarizes the results of the comparisons and connections stud- ied here, in the form of a decision tree. Four conclusions deserve emphasis.First, it is possible to put together a clear sequence of questions, the answersto which ultimately determine in which of the three possible outcomes agiven health care intervention falls. No single criterion ever suffices to justifypublic expenditure; however, depending on the character of an intervention, Public Good? Ye s N o Ye s Ye s Ye s Ye sYe sYe s MarketPublic PrivateCatastrophic Cost? Beneficiaries Poor?Figure 9.4 Decision Tree for Public Resource Allocation in Health CareCriteria for Public Spending on Health Care 183 one or more criteria may be irrelevant, which greatly simplifies decision- making. Second, it is easier to arrange the efficiency criteria in this way, thanthose related to equity. Poverty is easy enough to locate in the decision tree,but horizontal and vertical equity are not, because they involve explicit com-parisons among people and (in the case of vertical equity) among services.The question of how far to respect these two principles, in particular whenthey are in conflict with efficiency, probably has to be dealt with repeatedlyrather than fitting neatly into one branch of the decision tree. The last eth-ical criterion, the rule of rescue, does not cause similar difficulties, since if'rescue' is properly interpreted it is usually consistent with cost-effectiveness. Third, there are some questions to ask about the use of public resources for health care that do not correspond precisely to any one of the criteria.This is most notably the case for interventions that are catastrophicallycostly, for which insurance is the appropriate mechanism for sharing risk andthus making the services available. The decision tree includes (but does notfully answer) two questions about insurance. One is whether a contributoryinsurance scheme is feasible\u2014one in which there is explicit coverage of serv-ices in return for a premium that may be uniform, or related to capacity topay. (The distinction whether one contributes or not is important, becausepublic subsidy of health care for the poor is also a form of insurance, but oneto which they do not contribute. If the poor are covered for catastrophicallycostly interventions, their premiums must in effect be subsidized.) When insurance is feasible and appropriate, there is a further question whether it should be public or private or some of each. This is a complicatedquestion not settled by appeal to any combination of these criteria\u2014but it isevident that both horizontal and vertical equity are relevant to the decision.Private insurance is more likely than publicly financed care to violate one orboth of these principles, by discriminating between people who have thesame health problem but differ in their other health conditions, their age,capacity to pay, or other characteristics, or by making it more difficult to getcoverage for more severe health problems, if the treatments for them areparticularly expensive. These failings go far to explain why in most richcountries a large share of insurance is publicly financed, whether directlyfrom the budget or through employment-related social security schemes [2]. Fourth, it turns out that the right way to use the criterion of cost- effectiveness is not once-and-for-all, as with some of the other criteria.Several different paths through the decision tree lead to the questionwhether a health care intervention's results are worth what it costs. One goesdirectly from the classification of a service as a public good, and is the only184 Health Economics in Development other criterion needed in that case. Another begins with the conclusion that a service has significant externalities, and that private demand for it is inad-equate to secure all the potential social gains\u2014the case of a partly publicgood. The question of cost-effectiveness arises again when considering whatservices to subsidize for the poor, although here the criterion is less clear-cut,as the experience of the Oregon Plan illustrates. It does not become irrele-vant, though, because the people paying for the subsidy are almost certain towant some kind of value for money. And for similar reasons, if a service iscatastrophically expensive, and it is not feasible to finance it through ordi-nary contributory insurance so that some separate and public funding mustbe found if it is to be provided, it is again relevant to ask whether the serviceis worth what it costs. This is the typical situation of a public program of re-insurance, superimposed on a large number of small private or semi-privateinsurance schemes which cannot afford the risks of a few extraordinarilycostly interventions. Cost-effectiveness, in other words, is decisive in onlyone circumstance but important in several other situations. T o sum up: a fully thought-out decision of which health services to spend public money on and for whom, requires looking at all nine of the criteriaconsidered, treating them in the proper sequence and taking account ofwhether they are consistent or in conflict. Public funds should be spent onpublic and semi-public goods when those are cost-effective and demand forthem is inadequate, on cost-effective interventions which disproportion-ately benefit the poor, and on catastrophically costly care, when contribu-tory insurance will not work effectively or there are good reasons to financeinsurance publicly. Interventions which do not pass these tests either are notworth paying for at all, or they can be left to regulated private markets tofinance because the costs are bearable without insurance, or private con-tributory insurance is feasible.

Introduction: The Nature of the Problem The World Bank's 1993 World Development Report\u2014Investing in Health [1] treats cost-effectiveness as the principal criterion for choosing which healthinterventions governments should pay for. The Report recognizes the public-finance arguments that government must finance some interven-tions if they are to be provided adequately or at all, because private marketswill under-provide public goods and goods with substantial positive exter-nalities. However, even interventions which meet this requirement muststill pass some test such as cost-effectiveness\u2014a public good should not befinanced simply because it is public. If it is accepted that the object of healthexpenditure is to improve health, rather than some more general conceptsuch as welfare, and what is financed is a collection of interventions, thenchoosing to finance them in decreasing order of cost-effectiveness seems tobe the way to maximize the health gain from any particular level of spend-ing. \"Value for money\" implies cost-effectiveness, so long as \"value\" ismeasured in health gains.

In that case theranking by cost-effectiveness is not stable and one cannot just proceed downa list until the budget is exhausted or the next best intervention does notseem worthwhile. T aking account of interactions is difficult, but sometimesinterventions can be \"packaged\" to exploit joint costs or synergies. Since asmall number of interventions can deal with a large share of the diseaseburden, it is not necessary to consider all possible combinations: a cost-effective minimum package can be defined to absorb all health spending inpoor countries and serve as the nucleus of a larger set of interventions inhigher-income countries [2]. Less is known about cost-effectiveness, and itbecomes harder to package interventions, as health expenditure rises,because the variety of interventions increases greatly. A more serious difficulty is that while costs are, in principle, objective, the effectiveness of an intervention is always partly subjective. The quan-tification of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Quality-Adjusted LifeYears (QALYs), Healthy Life Years or any other measurement of gains inhealth status depends on a long vector of elements. Some of these are objec-tive, such as rates of mortality or incidence and prevalence of morbidity ordisability, and the ages at which diseases strike. Many other elements require subjective valuation. For example, the cal- culation used in the Bank's Report required choosing numbers for the discount rate; the relative value of life at different ages; life expectancy; andthe relative disabilities associated with each of many non-fatal conditions[3]. If people differ in their evaluation of these numbers, each one may havehis own ranking of cost-effectiveness, but the rankings will not agreeenough for there to be a unique relation between cost and health improve-ment associated with any intervention, even for people of the same age andthe same severity of health problems. T o say that people have different evaluations of effectiveness is equiva- lent to saving they derive different utilities from the same interventionbecause they differ in their views of the utilities associated with the priorstate of ill health or health risk, the state of health after intervention, thedisutility caused by the intervention itself, or some combination of these. Ifthe objective is to maximize welfare rather than health, then the situation isstill more complicated because people can also differ in their subjectiveevaluation of non-health benefits from consumption of other goods andservices, in their aversion to risk, in income or in other factors.Cost-Effectiveness and the Socialization of Health Care 189 This problem raises two related questions. First, should individual behavior in seeking and paying for health care be expected to be consistentwith cost-effectiveness? Second, does socializing health care, whetherthrough private insurance or through public financing, make collectivebehavior different in this respect from individual decisions? This paperargues that the more decisions about health interventions are socialized, themore appropriate it is to use cost-effectiveness as a criterion for health carespending. It does not presume to show that no other criterion does, orshould, matter in making choices about health care, but only that the rela-tive importance of cost-effectiveness increases with the degree of socializa-tion. This tendency is reinforced when the socialization is compulsory,because people must contribute through taxes rather than voluntary insur-ance payments. That makes cost-effectiveness a particularly legitimatecriterion for government decisions. The argument does not depend on theparticular measure of health status, of which there are many [4, 5], which isused to derive the effectiveness of interventions. Cost-Effectiveness and Individual Choice In trying to answer the first question posed above, it is easy to invent exam- ples in which people would not be expected to choose the more cost effec-tive of two alternatives. Suppose, for example, that two drugs are availableto treat a given health problem which poses a 30 percent chance of dying.One drug costs $2 and reduces the risk of death to 25 percent; the othercosts $5 and reduces the risk to 20 percent. Each application of the firstdrug can be thought of as saving one-twentieth of a life, or one life for each20 patients who receive it, while the other saves one-tenth of a life, or onelife for every ten patients. The first drug is more cost-effective, because thecost is 40 percent as high while the health gain is half as large as with thesecond drug: the cost per life saved is $40 instead of $50 [6]. However, any-one who had $5 to spend would buy the second drug, unless the additionalutility from spending $3 on something else outweighed the extra five per-cent reduction in the risk of dying. Choosing the more cost-effective drugcan be interpreted to mean that the individual values his or her life at lessthan $60, or perhaps that unless the extra money is spent on food, he or shewill die anyway. In this example, the individual cannot spend $4 on two doses of the cheaper medication, and improve survival chances by the same amount as190 Health Economics in Development with one $5 dose of the costlier one. Spending $4 will, however, buy the same total survival gain for two patients, with $1 left over. The differencebetween the individual and the social decision turns on this possibility oftreating more than one patient and on the indivisibility of individual bene-fits. The claim that the first drug is more cost-effective also depends onadding gains in survival probability linearly across individuals, or assumingthat one-tenth of a life for one person is worth exactly the same as one-twentieth of a life for each of two people. In a much more complex model [7], an individual with an additive, mul- tiperiod utility function faces a health problem that reduces the probabilityof surviving into the next period and therefore the expected utility in thatperiod, where utility depends on disposable income or income less medicalexpenditure. The utility-maximizing decision about how much to spend onhealth care this period is consistent with cost effectiveness, and does notdepend on what will be spent in the next period if the consumer survives.The same conclusion holds when the model is complicated by discountingfuture periods, by allowing for nonfatal conditions and for expenditureswhich improve health status without affecting survival, and by admittingtwo or more possible interventions with different costs and different effectson survival and quality of life. Moreover, the optimal cost-effectiveness ratiois the same for both interventions, so that at the margin either of them buysthe same amount of expected healthy life per dollar. This is possible onlyif\u2014in contrast to the previous example\u2014the patient can buy any amount ofeither intervention, up to the limit of income, with the prices of the inter-ventions proportional to the marginal health gains. The optimal relation between prices and health improvements suggests that the overall cost-effectiveness of health expenditure should depend onwhat interventions cost the consumer, from which it is commonly assumedthat prices can be used to \"rationalize\" demand: raising the price of healthcare should increase value for money. This could happen because con-sumers were buying so much of all interventions that the marginal healthgain was very small, and a uniform reduction in utilization would savemoney but have little effect on their health. Alternatively, consumers mightpreferentially reduce purchases of interventions yielding less health gain perunit expenditure. (If the prices in the two-drug example discussed previ-ously were $200 and $500 instead of $2 and $5, the patient might choosethe more cost-effective drug despite the lower health gain, because the $300difference could buy much more compensating utility than $3 could.) How-ever, if interventions do not produce steadily declining marginal healthCost-Effectiveness and the Socialization of Health Care 191 improvement but require some minimum expenditure in order to produce any gain at all, there is a risk that consumers would cut back or stop usingmore cost-effective services, causing substantial health losses. What consumers will actually do depends not only on prices and on the true relation between utilization and health improvements but on theirknowledge of that relation. In both the formal models just discussed, theconsumer does not know for certain whether he or she will become sick orinjured or die, but does know the survival probabilities, or the expectedgains in health status, with and without each kind of health care. Real con-sumers are usually less well informed, because they do not try to find out,or because physicians mislead them, or simply because no one knows. With-out that information it is impossible to buy care optimally, and so actualpurchases cannot be expected to be consistent with cost effectiveness.Incomplete information is a pervasive reason why individuals' spending onhealth care might not be efficient even according to their own evaluationsand preferences, leading them to prefer a collective solution in which lackof information is less damaging [8]. Add to this problem the variation inpeople's utilities, attitudes toward risk and other factors discussed above,and there is little reason to expect a collection of consumers to rank healthcare interventions by a single standard of value for money, and spendaccordingly. There are numerous empirical estimates of how utilization responds to price changes or differences [9], but very little evidence of how this affectscost-effectiveness. The RAND experiment of health insurance deductiblesand co-payments in the United States found that for most consumers,higher prices reduced demand but did not much affect its composition, andhad little effect on health status [10]. Thus there was no evidence of prefer-ential reduction in the use of less cost-effective services\u2014 \"cost sharingreduces appropriate and inappropriate care in about the same way\"\u2014butsome evidence that average cost-effectiveness did increase. However, poorpeople, and especially poor people needing preventive care, tended toreduce utilization in ways that substantially threatened their health, so thattheir use of health services became less cost-effective. This result may bemore relevant for poor countries than the average findings of slightlyimproved cost effectiveness. One reason why individual consumers may not select health care accord- ing to cost-effectiveness is that they seldom choose between two interven-tions for entirely different health problems, although anyone financinghealth care for a large number of people must make such choices, if only192 Health Economics in Development implicitly. People typically suffer, and decide what to do about, one health problem at a time, and they have a clearer idea of the cost of doing nothingand the gains from health care for that problem than they have about otherproblems that might occur in the future. Ignorance about tomorrow's prob-lems compared to today's makes it hard to make cost-effective multiperiodchoices over different health care needs. Another source of difficulty is thatnot spending on care today may make only a small or uncertain contribution to one's ability to buy health care tomorrow. (The model described earlierassumes away such connections by supposing that future income and abilityto pay for interventions is independent of today's health problems andexpenditures [7].) The solution to the difficulty of paying for care needed inthe future, of course, is insurance. Socializing Decisions through Insurance For any given health care intervention, insurance pools the financial risk across all the purchasers who are covered by insurance for that intervention.\"Pure\" insurance would eliminate out-of-pocket payments entirely by pro-viding complete financial coverage. Most private insurance and some publicinsurance, in contrast, provides such zero-cost coverage only after the insuredhas spent a certain amount in the form of co-payments; thus it lowers theprice for interventions up to some level of expenditure and lowers it all theway to zero only for expenditures beyond that limit. There may also be afloor up to which a deductible applies, with no effect on the price to the con-sumer. Thus the effect of insurance on consumption of health care dependsin part on whether the insured are paying all, part or none of the cost of serv-ices. This in turn affects the administrative cost of providing the insurance. Does socializing health care financing via insurance favor cost-effective- ness? The substantial literature on the effects of insurance on behavior andon welfare does not address this question but usually compares expenditureoutcomes under insurance with the results of out-of-pocket purchases byindividual consumers. It also concentrates on the subsidy to insurancewhich occurs when employers' contributions to buying insurance areexcluded from corporate income and not taxed as income to workers; thatissue is not considered here. At first glance the answer to the question about cost-effectiveness and insurance would seem to be a simple no: insured individuals either facelower prices, or no longer have to consider costs at all, so they can consumeCost-Effectiveness and the Socialization of Health Care 193 health care without asking whether the health gain is worth the full cost. In fact, people may buy insurance partly to protect themselves from the needto consider cost, at a time of urgency and stress. Even if all the insured are spending in the range where prices (co-payments) are between zero and 100percent of costs, and even if they continue to equate marginal costs to mar-ginal benefits according to their individual utilities, they should be expectedto buy services of lower marginal health gain and thus reduce cost-effectiveness on average. The moral hazard intrinsic to insurance [12] is almost the antithesis of cost-effective behavior. T o the extent that moral hazard leads people to takeless good care of their health\u2014particularly, to spend less on preventivemeasures not covered by insurance because they will not have to pay forcurative treatment that is covered\u2014insurance even appears to underminecost-effectiveness in preventive and public health measures. More curativeinterventions may be required, at higher cost, to achieve the same healthoutcome [13]. The conclusion that insurance is inimical to cost-effectiveness because of moral hazard is modified when account is taken of adverse selection, thesecond kind of market failure characteristic of the health insurance market.Adverse selection arises because different people know they have differenthealth status and anticipate different needs for health care, and this infor-mation is not available to insurers, who must charge the same premium toall. As a potential consumer of services, each insured person seeks to maxi-mize the expected health gain from care for those problems he or she hasor expects to suffer. As a purchaser, each one seeks to minimize costs. Theinsurance industry in effect allows buyers and users to bargain with oneanother so as to balance costs against health gains, with high-risk customerswanting to buy more insurance than low-risk customers. If low-risk con-sumers predominate in the market, they can force high-risk consumers tobuy less insurance than they would like, offsetting some of the tendency ofinsurance to stimulate spending without regard for cost-effectiveness; thealternative for high-risk consumers is to pay the full cost of their anticipatedhealth care instead of being subsidized by healthier and less costlycustomers [13]. Simulations based on the RAND experiment mentioned earlier show that more generous insurance plans with higher limits on out-of-pocketspending are squeezed out of the market, compared to plans which imposemore cost on the insured [14]. Because it is difficult empirically todistinguish the effects of adverse selection from those of moral hazard, and194 Health Economics in Development because so much insurance is determined by employers (or by the state) and therefore limits adverse selection, it is not clear how much consumption isaffected, and there is no specific evidence about cost-effectiveness. These findings suggest that insurance is less inimical to cost-effectiveness than would follow from the reduction in out-of-pocket costs alone, but theydo not indicate that purchases under insurance would be any more cost-effective than without it. The expectation of lower cost-effectiveness withinsurance still follows if any consumer can buy any health service in anyamount at reduced prices, with declining marginal health returns as more isspent, at all levels of consumption. In fact, which services the insured person consumes depends on which services are covered, and insurance plans typically exclude certain servicesaltogether or impose limitations on how often they can be used or howmuch can be spent on them. If everyone had the same evaluation of the rel-ative cost-effectiveness of interventions, insurance plans would reflect thatchoice, and plans would be more cost-effective on average as they werecheaper and covered fewer services. It is only because potential customersdiffer in their utilities, risk aversion and incomes that insurance does notautomatically favor cost-effectiveness. Even so, any insurance plan which isactually bought implicitly averages together the cost-effectiveness evalua-tions of all the people who freely buy that plan. This does not mean thatevery purchaser of insurance thinks about the cost-effectiveness of eachintervention under the plan, because plans generally apply the same broadrules about deductibles, co-payments, ceilings and quantitative limits to awhole range of similar services. It does mean that the people who end upcovered by a particular plan either have no choice, or are in rough agree-ment about the relation between the expected health effectiveness of thecoverage and what it costs. This implies that a competitive third-party insurance industry may lead to relatively cost-effective coverage within each of a number of policies or groups of insured, as people with the same tastes and desire for cost-effective coverage buy the same insurance. Similarly, when workers have achoice of employers but no choice about the insurance provided by eachemployer, each employer's workforce can be expected to be homogeneouswith respect to the kind and amount of insurance wanted [15], also leadingto local cost-effectiveness. Competition among insurers or employers willnot, however, necessarily tend toward cost-effectiveness of interventionsacross all groups. Some groups will buy coverage for interventions of relatively low cost-effectiveness, while others will do without coverage forCost-Effectiveness and the Socialization of Health Care 195 interventions that are more cost-effective. Limiting consumer choice, as by requiring everyone to have the same plan or at least the same minimumplan, can therefore improve overall cost-effectiveness. The inclusion or exclusion of specific services is extremely important, because many health interventions are of an all-or-nothing character, orrequire a substantial minimum expenditure to yield any benefits at all. Ifthere are eventual declining returns to further spending, these begin only atrelatively high levels of expenditure. When people are relieved from wor-rying (so much) about the cost of care, they are free to concentrate on itseffectiveness. Insurance can be expected to have little effect on the utiliza-tion of inexpensive services which people would buy anyway, but it stimu-lates the purchase of lumpy, expensive interventions, particularly if the needfor these is hard to predict [16]. Since the cost and the cost-effectiveness of interventions are not highly correlated\u2014there are more and less effective services at all cost levels [17]\u2014stimulating utilization of expensive services does not necessarily reducevalue for money. People who are still paying part of the cost should becomemore likely in particular to consume care which is both costly and cost-effective. This may offset much of the tendency to expand utilization ofservices which are inexpensive but not very effective. When expenditurereaches the out-of-pocket limit, cost-effectiveness might be expected to fallagain, because all costly interventions become attractive if they provide anyhealth improvement at all. This will be true unless the costs in pain, incon-venience or time lost\u2014which, unlike financial costs, cannot be shifted tothird parties\u2014are too high. In summary, the expectation that insurance willundermine cost effectiveness by stimulating consumption of services seemsto depend on two conditions. First, individuals react to lowered prices byexpanding utilization at the margin, rather than by including expensiveservices which may provide large health gains but are too costly to buy outof pocket. Second, co-payments are so low that the tendency to equate mar-ginal costs and benefits leads to over-utilization independently of price. Byallowing purchases of costly but cost-effective services, and still providingan incentive to weigh marginal benefits against some cost to the consumer,insurance can promote cost-effectiveness even though it may raise totalcosts. This will be true even if the selection of which interventions to coveris independent of cost-effectiveness. Of course, an insurance plan can be used to impose cost-effectiveness by covering services, or setting co-payments, in proportion to their healthgains per dollar, but in a competitive environment such a plan will not be196 Health Economics in Development bought by all customers. In general, any uniform plan will not be Pareto optimal, in the sense of improving health or reducing costs for everyonecompared to their individual choices [13]. Of all uniform plans, however,one based on cost-effectiveness appears to be the most efficient [7]. Cost-effectiveness is an appropriate criterion for designing insurance provisions,but its scope is limited by the heterogeneity of customers and the degree ofcompetition among insurers. More Complete Socialization: Second-Party Insurance Under third-party insurance, physicians can provide, and possibly even cre- ate demand for, services of low cost-effectiveness because\u2014like theirpatients\u2014they are free to consider only the health gains and not the costs.This can happen even when medical professionals are scrupulous about notrecommending or performing services with no expected health gain. How-ever, if the physicians are also the insurers, they have to consider both thenumerator and the denominator of the cost-effectiveness ratio. Such second-party insurance is more fully socialized than third-party insurance because the patient and the doctor cannot pass any costs on tosomeone else. Insurance such as that provided through health maintenanceorganizations should therefore lead to a more cost-effective set of interven-tions than would occur with the same patients and the same doctors underthird-party insurance. This may happen because coverage of less cost-effective services is explicitly restricted, or, when such services are coveredbecause they are performed less often, at physicians' discretion, or the morecost-effective of two alternatives for treatment is used. It is hard to estimate how much this occurs, because of differences in age, health status, education, attitudes toward medical interventions or otherdifferences between those insured under second- and third-party coverage.The comparison is particularly difficult because of self-selection into one orthe other kind of insurance: neither group is a random sample of the popu-lation [11]. And because outcomes are often uncertain, even health mainte-nance organizations sometimes spend heavily on procedures that turn outto be cost-ineffective. Nonetheless, the available evidence shows thatsecond-party insurance controls cost better without sacrificing health gains[18], which suggests that it is more cost-effective. Certainly the criterion ofcost-effectiveness is more clearly embodied in the way that care is paid for,than with third-party insurance.Cost-Effectiveness and the Socialization of Health Care 197 Government Insurance and Taxpayer Support If greater socialization of private health care expenditure favors cost- effectiveness, as argued above, then what happens under the most socializedway of paying for care, namely, public financing? It helps to split this ques-tion into three parts. The first concerns what governments can do, the sec-ond what they actually do, and the third the legitimacy of cost-effectivenessas a criterion for public spending. Governments can make health spending more cost-effective, just by lim- iting public finance to the right interventions. The resulting cost effective-ness of what is paid for publicly will be partly offset by private purchases ofless cost-effective interventions, but the effect of public finance can still beto improve the average value for money of health care. Any private insur-ance could, in principle, do the same thing\u2014offer only services that arehighly cost-effective\u2014but it might lose customers as a result. The advantage of government in this respect is that beneficiaries cannot choose a different insurer without paying twice, once in taxes and once inpremiums. This kind of coercion, like that imposed by employer financedprivate insurance, may be unattractive to each consumer individually andyet acceptable when everyone knows that everyone else is subjected to thesame control. When publicly-financed services are universally available and sufficiently attractive that people actually use them, governments also can eliminate orreduce adverse selection\u2014although, as indicated above, it is not clear howmuch that interferes with aggregate cost-effectiveness in private insurance.Of course, when only part of the population uses publicly-funded services,adverse selection can actually be increased, with the highest-risk populationdepending on public finance. This in turn may reinforce any tendency tolimit services to those which are more cost-effective. When governments fail to improve the cost-effectiveness of health care, it is because they do not know which interventions are cost-effective ; or provide all services indiscriminately; or cover too few people; or wasteresources in delivery; or provide such poor quality that people willinglyspend their own money on care elsewhere. For all these reasons, govern-ments in poor countries are often rightly accused of spending their healthmoney badly compared to what could be achieved with an appropriate pack-age of care. Nonetheless, they often do no worse than the private sector;and when they finance public health measures and interventions like immu-nizations which private markets cannot or do not provide adequately,198 Health Economics in Development governments are more cost-effective. This accounts for a large part of the extraordinary gains in life expectancy and in reduction of morbidity and dis-ability in recent decades. The share of public finance in health care spending generally rises as countries become richer, and a higher public share is somewhat associatedwith lower overall expenditure relative to national income, or with betterhealth, or both. Even without examining the composition of spending byintervention, there is empirical evidence that greater public control ofexpenditure promotes value for money [8]. This presumably results from aconcentration of public spending on some highly cost-effective interven-tions which private markets usually do not provide so thoroughly; it doesnot follow that public spending is intrinsically more efficient, only that it isbetter at covering some of the interventions that provide the most healthgains per dollar. How far this interferes with Pareto optimality and con-sumers' freedom to follow their own notions of utility from health servicesdepends on the range of services that are publicly financed and on whetherthere are differential subsidies according to the cost-effectiveness of theservice. Finally, there is the question of whether it is appropriate for govern- ments to base financing decisions on cost-effectiveness, or at least moreappropriate than for individuals or private markets. Public insurance ordirect public expenditure on health care typically differs from private insur-ance in providing subsidies not only from the healthy to the sick but alsofrom the rich to the poor. The \"purchasers\" are taxpayers, who know thatthey are paying more than the average value of the services they can expectto receive. This makes them different from subscribers to an insurance plan,who know that the lucky will end up paying for the care of the unlucky, butwho also know that a priori everyone is paying (approximately) a fair share. Subsidizing health care is vastly more complicated than subsidizing food, but it still helps to compare the two cases. In both instances, taxpayers arewilling to pay for what they think others need or deserve, but not for justanything they want. Thus food stamps cannot legally be used to buy alco-hol or cigarettes; they can be spent on caviar, but then the buyer suffers forhis choice in lower food intake. Cost-effectiveness offers a way to make aroughly parallel distinction in health care, with health gain correspondingto nutritional content in the case of food subsidies. Governments cannot simply subsidize all demand for health care, because that leads to both inequity and runaway costs. They need criteria forwhat to finance, and cost-effectiveness is a relatively transparent basis fordecision. The fact that any objective criterion is based partly on subjectiveCost-Effectiveness and the Socialization of Health Care 199 evaluations of health burdens and gains does not invalidate that argument: what it means is that for cost-effectiveness to be understood and accepted asa basis for public finance, there has to be some consensus on those subjec-tive choices. With private insurance, in contrast, it is only necessary to getagreement among all the people who buy a particular policy. In fact, it may be that only government can promote the kind of public debate and understanding which can lead to consensus on those evaluationsover the whole population, as the development of the \"Oregon Plan\" in theUnited States demonstrates [19]. However, this experience also illustratesthat the public may not accept cost-effectiveness as the only or even thechief criterion for what services to finance. When the original list developedin Oregon turned out to give higher priority to some services with verysmall health gains but also very low costs than to some expensive but life-saving interventions, the cost criterion was dropped and the list restructuredon the basis of effectiveness or health gains alone [20]. Even this contributesmuch more to health than a random choice with no regard for either out-comes or costs. Since cost-effectiveness is partly subjective, it is consistentwith a greater priority for lifesaving interventions, if the disability weightsfor minor health losses are all revised downward so that death becomesmore important relative to many diseases and injuries. The same rankingresults if health losses are not added linearly across individuals, as cost-effectiveness implies, but priority is given to larger individual losses, tenhealthy life years lost by one person being treated as worse than the loss ofa year each by ten people. Public finance of health care involves coercion, which means that it can enforce pooling solutions and eliminate the effects of adverse selectionglobally, whereas competitive private insurance can do so only over smallerand more homogeneous groups. This makes it easier to apply cost-effec-tiveness as the criterion of what to pay for. This tendency is reinforced bythe explicit subsidy involved in having taxpayers finance care for poorernon-contributors: as with other subsidies in kind, individual preferences canbe over-ridden in favor of what those paying think the beneficiaries need.Effectiveness certainly corresponds to that notion, and cost-effectivenessmay also be both politically and ethically a reasonable criterion for publicexpenditure. Much of the evidence used here comes from rich countries, and particu- larly from the United States. That country is an outlier even among OECDcountries [8], in its reliance on employer-financed private insurance and itslimitation of public expenditure to the poor, the elderly and a few other200 Health Economics in Development groups or types of spending. It is therefore legitimate to ask whether the argument developed here, that socialization of health care spending makescost-effectiveness theoretically more appropriate as a criterion and easier toapproximate in practice, is relevant to the issues of health care reform inpoor countries. There seem to be two strong reasons why it is. First, while there is undoubtedly scope for more socialization of health care spending in poorcountries through private insurance, the danger from both moral hazardand adverse selection is arguably much greater than in richer countries.Such private insurance as exists or could easily be introduced is confined tothe well-off minority, who are healthier on average than the poor majority,and who are particularly likely to obtain public subsidies enabling theirinsurance to provide costly, but not very cost-effective, services. These risksalso exist for direct public financing, but can be attenuated if financing cov-ers most of the population and therefore must be more limited as to theinterventions it can cover. The argument that public financing offers poten-tial efficiency gains over private insurance in such settings of poverty andinequality applies a fortiori to out-of-pocket expenditure, where the hetero- geneity of people's conditions and utilities give no reason to think thatspending will be particularly cost-effective. Second, the poorer a country is, the sicker its population is likely to be and the smaller the range of interventions that can be financed for the bulkof the population. These circumstances make it easier to be sure what inter-ventions are more cost-effective, and to compose an essential package ofcare which may be all that can be offered to the poor, but from which every-one can benefit [21]. Because many of these interventions are relativelycheap as well as quite cost-effective, people are not likely to buy privateinsurance for them\u2014and such insurance is impossible for the public healthmeasures with large externalities. People's information is also likely to bevery incomplete, even regarding basic, life-protecting habits and procedures[1]. The welfare loss from not respecting individual preferences is thereforelikely to be smaller, and the gains from socializing health care decisionslarger, than in richer countries.

Introduction Since the eradication of smallpox in the 1970s, no other disease has been eliminated from the world by vaccination. Advances in mass immunizationcampaigns using oral vaccine have successfully interrupted the transmis-sion of wild poliomyelitis virus in many countries, however, and havesharply reduced its incidence in many others (1,2) . The benefits of polio immunization appear from some studies to outweigh its costs (3). And the Reprinted, with permission, from Bulletin of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau 22 (1), 1988.204 Health Economics in Development cost-effectiveness of mass campaigns relative to other means of reaching the susceptible population has been established, at least in some circum-stances (4). It therefore seems possible, by a suitable intensification of such efforts, to eradicate polio\u2014if not all over the world, then at least in theWestern Hemisphere\u2014within the next few years. In view of the success of the PAHO/WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in the Americas since its inception in 1977, in April1985 (5)PAHO recommended that its Member Governments support a five-year, US $46 million campaign to eliminate polio entirely from theAmericas, after which it would be relatively easy to deal with whatever casesmight be imported. The Member Governments ratified this proposal inSeptember 1985 (6); and since then PAHO has been developing the cam- paign's detailed strategy and obtaining financial commitments from private,bilateral, and multilateral donor agencies. T o satisfy some of these agencies' requirements, a cost-benefit analysis was prepared. This article describes the assumptions and findings of thatanalysis, which indicate the eradication of polio is economically justified,and discusses some of their implications. Its concluding section considersthe terms according to which the eradication of polio can be deemed analternative to curative care. Assumptions The analysis that follows attempts to answer one specific question: Is the cost of eradicating polio, through the program adopted by PAHO, justifiedthrough the medical costs saved by not having to treat or rehabilitate poliovictims? This estimate of the benefits from polio eradication takes noaccount of the gains from reduced pain and suffering, from the greater eco-nomic productivity of individuals who would otherwise be paralyzed andrendered unproductive, or from the reduction in other vaccine-preventablediseases that can be expected to result from a successful campaign againstpolio. If eradication is economically justified by reduced medical costsalone, then there is no doubt that it is still more justified when account istaken of other benefits. The logic of the argument is as follows. For each of the five years of the eradication campaign, and then for each of 10 years thereafter, estimates aremade of the following: the number of cases of paralytic polio that would beprevented; the cost of treating and rehabilitating that number of polioThe Eradication of Polio in the Western Hemisphere 205 victims; the cost of the eradication effort; and the net benefit (in terms of reduced medical expenses minus the cost of eradication). These net bene-fits are then discounted at 12% per year, meaning that $1.00 saved next yearis worth only $0.88 saved today, etc. 1(This is the discount rate used by the Inter-American Development Bank for project evaluation, and is chosenbecause the Bank is helping to finance the eradication campaign.) Because the campaign is superimposed upon continuing national efforts to control polio through the EPI, two cost-benefit calculations are made.One compares the total cost\u2014US $74 million in national effort and$46 million from international donor agencies over the first five years, plus$10 million per year in national resources thereafter\u2014with the total casesand costs that could be expected to occur in the absence of anysubstantial effort to control polio. The other calculation finds costs derived from thecurrent estimated incidence of polio and compares these to the cost of theresources being sought from donors in order to ensure polio eradication byeliminating the relatively small numbers of cases that still persist afternearly a decade of the EPI. The first calculation compares total costs tototal benefits (in terms of reduced medical expense), while the second com-pares marginal or incremental costs to the marginal benefits of going fromthe present case incidence to eradication. In both cases it is assumed thatevery polio victim would receive treatment, so that the comparison is reallybetween the cost of preventing polio and the cost of treating all those whowould otherwise get the disease. This assumption that all victims receivetreatment is relaxed later, so that no benefit is attributed to cases not actu-ally treated. A number of additional assumptions underlying the calculations deserve further explanation. These assumptions are as follows: 1. The background or \"natural\" level of polio incidence is derived from the situation existing before the EPI began, when about 3,000 cases of paral-ysis and 350 deaths were reported annually in the Americas. It is recog-nized that before the EPI started, polio was greatly underreported (5), perhaps by a factor of five. 2If this estimate is accurate, then the true pre- EPI incidence would have been about 15,000 cases per year. This shouldprobably be regarded as an upper bound. 2. The EPI helped to reduce the hemispheric total of reported polio cases to about 500 a year in 1984 and 1985. Assuming no change in the degreeof underreporting, this means the actual incidence would have been206 Health Economics in Development about 2,500 cases annually. Of course, the improved surveillance that accompanied the EPI might also have reduced the underreporting signi-ficantly, so that the true incidence might have been lower, say on theorder of 1,500 cases per year. It is also possible that expecting the levelto remain at 2,500 cases per year for the near future without eradicationis being over-optimistic. In the absence of an eradication campaign,national efforts might not be able to keep the incidence that low. For onething, polio fluctuates cyclically, and the 1984-1985 level of casesappears to represent a cyclical trough from which a slight rebound couldbe expected. For another, vaccination coverage could actually declinebecause of financial difficulties and a false sense of confidence about theextent of control in the absence of a reliable surveillance system. The example of Jamaica illustrates this latter risk. After over five years of reporting zero cases, levels of coverage declined; an outbreak thenoccurred in 1982 that produced over 50 cases. The cost of controllingthe epidemic and treating the victims has been estimated at more thanten times the cost needed over the preceding five years to prevent theoutbreak (7). There were substantial polio increases in Brazil and Colombia from 1985 to 1986 (8), although these were partly offset by declines in Mexico, Haiti, and Peru. The buildup of a pool of susceptibles and anydecline in vaccination coverage would have the same results in othercountries. For this reason it is assumed that 3,000 cases a year remain tobe eliminated, rather than the 2,500 figure that would result from 500observed cases with 80% underreporting. This 3,000 figure should alsoprobably be regarded as an upper bound, the lower bound being abouthalf as high. The external funds to be utilized in the eradication project will go to ensure that a surveillance system is built up and that supervisory systems arein place\u2014so as to guarantee continued high levels of coverage and eventualeradication of the wild poliovirus. Without these additional resources, itmay be very difficult for the countries involved to organize the needed sur-veillance systems, and it is to be feared that prevailing levels of coverage willdecline for lack of supervisory systems. 3. The cost of treating a polio victim has been estimated from a 1982 study conducted in Brazil (9). The expenses included were those of treatment during the acute phase of the disease (US $880 on the average, within aThe Eradication of Polio in the Western Hemisphere 207 range of US $350 to US $2,800 in different hospitals), together with those of surgery, rehabilitation, and subsequent therapy. Rehabilitation sometimes extends over several years, so rehabilitation costs must be discounted. In the Brazilian study, discounting was done at6% per year and was applied over 10 years; for purposes of the present cal-culations, the results reported have been adjusted to reflect the discount rateof 12% used here. With that adjustment, the average cost of the surgery,rehabilitation, and therapy phase is estimated at $4,949. Hence, the totalestimated cost of treating a polio case is $5,829. The combination of such a high individual treatment cost and a large number of unreported cases means, of course, that the estimated total costof treating all polio victims would be quite high. In that sense, cost and caseestimates could bias the results in favor of the eradication campaign. How-ever, any such bias is offset by excluding from consideration all of the othercosts associated with paralytic polio. Furthermore, the calculations basedon these high estimates are modified later in the analysis in order to deter-mine whether eradication would still be justified with fewer cases or lowertreatment costs. 4. The five-year eradication campaign could not expect to bring the inci- dence of polio down to zero in the first year. Instead, as surveillance andcoverage expand, the campaign is expected to achieve zero cases by thefifth year. It is assumed for purposes of simplicity that the decline in casesis linear over the five years of the campaign. This means that net bene-fits increase from the first to the fifth year, increase sharply in the sixthyear (when spending drops back to the maintenance level of US $10 mil-lion per year), and thereafter remain constant, apart from discounting. Atthe end of the campaign, some 15,000 cases per year are being prevented.If there are currently about 3,000 cases annually, the difference of 12,000cases that do not occur can be attributed to the current level of controlexerted through the EPI. The eradication campaign is assumed to pre-vent another 1,000 cases in the first year (for a total of 13,000) and anadditional 500 cases in each succeeding year. 5. Benefits and costs are calculated for 10 years beyond the end of the eradi- cation campaign, which carries the calculation to the end of the century.Net benefits continue to accrue beyond that point if eradication is main-tained, but discounting makes their present value quite small ($1.00 isworth only $0.18 fifteen years from now).208 Health Economics in Development Costs and Benefits When All Polio Victims Are Treated The foregoing assumptions lead to the costs and benefits shown in T able 11.1. When total costs (including national efforts as well as donor contri-butions to eradication) are compared to total savings (assuming all cases aretreated), there is a net present benefit, after discounting, of US $217.2 mil-lion in the first five years, and the eradication campaign is economicallyjustified in each of the first five years, well before full eradication isachieved. This simply reflects the fact that the current level of EPI cover-age is economically justified by the potential savings in treatment costs onthe basis of the assumptions made here. During the 10 years following eradication, these calculations indicate a further discounted net saving of US $264.2 million. Because of discounting,this is much less than the estimated sum of undiscounted savings over 10years, which is US $774.4 million. (Savings in each year of the decade wouldbe US $77.4 million, but discounting would reduce their present value toonly US $41.5 million in the first year and even smaller values in eachsubsequent year.) Discounting would also reduce the present value ofanticipated savings during the five-year eradication effort from US$288.0 million to US $217.2 million. During the whole fifteen-year interval, the present value of net savings is estimated at US $481.4 million. Whether the prevention of 220,000 casesof paralytic polio would be worth this much (or more, or less) to the poten-tial victims and their families is not considered. This estimate is so high because it is very expensive to treat even one polio victim. However, the conclusion that eradication is justified does notdepend on this cost being as high as US $5,829. In fact, if the treatment costwere only US $1,728 the net total discounted savings over the five-yeareradication campaign would be zero, and the effort would still pay for itselfover the next 10 years. (Net savings in each year would be US $15.9 mil-lion, for a ten-year discounted total benefit of US $54.3 million.) If thecampaign had the entire 15 years to pay for itself, the cost of treatmentcould be as low as US $1,207. Alternatively, the incidence of polio could be much lower than is assumed in T able 11.1. That is, assuming treatment costs of US $5,829 perpatient, the number of cases could be reduced to about 3,100 and eradica-tion could still be justified. Given that the current level of polio control by vaccination is much cheaper than treatment of all the cases that would otherwise occur, it mayTable 11.1 Costs and Benefits Associated with Polio Eradication During a Successful Five-Year Campaign and an Ensuing Ten-Year Maintenance Period, Assuming all Polio Victims are Treated YEARS OF ERADICATION CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN YEARS 6- YEARS ALL 15 YEARS, 15, PER 6-15, YEARS, TOTAL ANNUM TOTAL TOTAL 1 2345 Discount factora0.945 0.844 0.753 0.673 0.601 \u2014 \u2014b\u2014\u2014 versus total benefits (in millions of US$): Number of cases prevented 70.0 15.0 150.0 84.5 87.4 40.7 38.1 217.2 \u2014c264.2 481.4 Donor costs versus marginal benefits (in millions of US$):Number of cases prevented (thousands) 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 10.0 3.0 30.0 40.0 Savings in treatment expenses (millions of US$) 5.8 8.7 11.7 14.6 17.5 58.3 17.5 174.9 233.2 Cost of eradication or maintenance 9.2 9.2 9.2 9.2 9.2 46.0 0 0 46.0 Net saving (net benefit) /H110023.4 /H110020.5 2.5 5.4 8.3 12.3 17.5 174.9 187.2 Net present value of discounted savings /H110023.2 /H110020.4 1.9 3.6 5.0 6.9 \u2014c55.2 62.1 aDiscount factors are calculated at mid-years, thus the factor for year one corresponds to discounting at 12% annually for six m onths. bThis discount factor varies from 0.536 in year six to 0.194 in year 15. cBecause of variations in the discount factor from year to year, only the ten-year totals are shown. 209210 Health Economics in Development still be asked whether the donor contribution of US $46 million for the eradication campaign would pay for itself in terms of reduced incidence andassociated lower treatment costs. The amount requested from donor agen-cies is 38% of the total cost of eradication, but it would be used to eliminateonly 20% of the pre-EPI level of incidence (3,000 cases per year out of15,000), the other 80% being controlled by national efforts costing US $74million during the five years of the campaign. Consequently, as the second part of T able 11.1 shows, the donor contri- bution exceeds the anticipated saving (again assuming treatment of all poliovictims) during each of the campaign's first two years. This is followed bypositive net benefits as eradication is achieved, for a total net benefit of US$6.9 million during the five years of the campaign. There would also be apositive net benefit of US $17.5 million in each subsequent year, whileeradication would presumably be maintained by national efforts withoutfurther donor financial assistance. Even with discounting, over the nextdecade this latter benefit would amount to a further US $55.2 million. Theresult is an estimated net discounted positive benefit of US $62.1 millionover the entire fifteen-year period. This calculation naturally depends more for its positive value upon the assumed high cost of curative treatment. For the campaign to break even infive years (showing zero net discounted savings from the donors' contribu-tions), treatment could not cost less than US $4,874. That would result intotal discounted savings of US $46.1 million over the ensuing decade.These savings (over all 15 years) would still be positive at any treatment costhigher than US $2,106. Therefore, roughly speaking, the eradication ofpolio appears justified if treatment costs at least US $2,000, purely on thegrounds of reducing the total discounted costs of treatment plus preventionover a fifteen-year period. In other words, while the donor contribution directed at eradication pays off more slowly than the level of polio control already achieved, it is still aneconomically justified investment compared to the cost of treating everyonewho would otherwise get polio. This remains true despite the need to devoteresources to activities other than immunization (surveillance and laboratorywork) that are necessary in order to ensure that eradication is achieved andmaintained. Moreover, as in the previous calculation, no account is taken ofother benefits anticipated from this investment\u2014such as an increased capa-city to control other diseases and consequent further medical savings. In sum, there is no reason to suppose that the current level of polio con- trol has already absorbed all the potential benefit, leaving nothing more toThe Eradication of Polio in the Western Hemisphere 211 be gained from complete eradication of the disease. Rather, making an addi- tional effort to eliminate polio entirely appears justified. This conclusionseems invalid only if the cost of treating a polio victim is much less than thatassumed here, or if the number of victims treated is far smaller. The nextsection considers the second of these possibilities. Costs and Benefits When Treatment is Incomplete The apparent economic justification for eradicating polio contradicts the findings of a cost-benefit analysis of polio vaccination in Brazil covering themass immunization campaigns begun in 1980 ( 10). On the assumption that such campaigns would end in 1983, and that thereafter the normal, pre-campaign rate of vaccination would be enough to keep polio from reap-pearing before 1990, it was concluded that the mass campaigns did notjustify their costs (US $30 million), and that no more than US $43.4 millionper year should be spent to maintain the pre-1980 level of vaccinationcoverage. This study made several assumptions that differ from those reflected in T able 11.1. For one thing, the discount rate was taken to be 18% ratherthan 12%, which made future benefits less valuable. For another, the fixedcosts of treating children in the acute stage of the disease were assumed tobe zero, because of supposed excess facility and staff resources at pediatrichospitals. This amounts to supposing that any such resources would not beused for other medical care and would not be released\u2014in other words, thatministries of health would maintain superfluous staff and facilities. (Thecosts of the subsequent rehabilitation and surgery, which were acknowl-edged to require specialized personnel and facilities, were not regarded aszero.) The most important difference, however, is that savings were calcu-lated only for the estimated number of actual curative treatments, ratherthan for the number of victims who could benefit from such care but didnot always receive it. Primarily for this reason, the mass vaccination cam-paign appeared to be justified in Northeast Brazil, where the incidence ofpolio was relatively high, but not in the rest of the country. Relating the costs of immunization to actual rather than potential costs of treatment in this way raises two important issues. The first concerns theappropriate way to deal with those victims who get polio but receive nomedical care. These people are entirely ignored if only actual spending isconsidered, but of course they account for much of the potential benefit of212 Health Economics in Development immunization if any kind of price is put on pain and suffering ( 10). The sec- ond issue concerns marginal costs and benefits. Once polio has been broughtpartly under control by immunization, the remaining gain from greater cov-erage may be small. However, the cost of obtaining greater coverage is likelyto be high, since the current level has to be maintained while immunizationis extended to the rest of the population. This makes polio very differentfrom smallpox, which could be combated by concentrating only on thoseareas still reporting the disease (only surveillance activities, not vaccination,were needed in areas where smallpox had already been eradicated). As a result of this problem of increasing marginal cost and decreasing marginal gain in the case of polio, it may never seem justified to finish thejob. The calculations in T able 11.1 indicate, however, that complete eradi-cation is justified for polio if the extra expense of donors' contributions iscompared to the extra gain made possible thereby. Among the benefits fromcomplete rather than almost-complete eradication are the prevention oflater outbreaks like the previously mentioned one in Jamaica. These can beexpensive to control, but because of their uncertain magnitude and fre-quency no attempt has been made to estimate the present discounted valueof the costs they represent. It should also be noted that because of uncertainty in the estimates of costs and incidences it is impossible to determine either the marginal pointwhere preventive efforts cease to be justified or the maximum vaccinationcoverage that pays for itself. Both calculations in T able 11.1 assume that treatment would be provided to everyone who actually contracted the disease. Most of the estimatedbenefits, however, are only potential savings that greatly exceed realizablesavings attainable through actual reduction in treatment expenditures.Therefore, the next task is to see whether those realizable savings, by them-selves, are enough to pay for the cost of eradication, without attributing anybenefit to cases where people are affected by polio but receive no medicalcare. This requires estimating the number of cases that are or would be treated. Before introduction of the EPI, the number of cases treated wasroughly equal to the number reported, in part because some countriesreported only those cases actually treated. (This accounts in large part forthe very high level of underreporting.) In the absence of control measures,the number of cases treated would be at least as large as it was a decade ago.Allowing for some improvement in coverage or expansion of treatment, andrecognizing that in many pre-EPI years there were more than 4,000The Eradication of Polio in the Western Hemisphere 213 reported cases of polio, it seems reasonable to take 4,000 cases per year as the background or \"normal\" level of treatment that would occur in theabsence of immunization. As in the calculations reported above, it cannotbe supposed that the eradication campaign would immediately eliminatethe need to treat those cases. Instead, it is supposed that in the first year ofthe campaign there would be savings from 2,000 fewer treatments, and thatthis number would rise to 4,000 cases over the five-year period. This esti-mate, which appears in the first line of T able 11.2, shows that over the entirefifteen-year period some 55,000 fewer treatments would be required. Following this assumption, net savings are of course much smaller than they would be if all polio victims were treated. Savings remain negativethroughout the five years of the campaign and turn positive thereafter. Theresult is a total net discounted benefit of -US $27.3 million during theeradication campaign, followed by a positive net benefit, after discounting,of US $45.4 million during the next decade. T otal net benefits during theentire fifteen-year period are estimated at US $18.1 million. This means that eradication of polio would pay for itself by reducing the medical costs of treating those victims who actually are or probably wouldbe treated. Hence, in order to justify an eradication campaign, it is not nece-ssary to attribute any benefits to people who probably would not receivetreatment. The magnitude of the net discounted benefit is drasticallyreduced (from US $481.4 to US $18.1 million), but it continues to be pos-itive. However, because the number of treatments is much reduced, the costper treatment could not fall appreciably without turning savings negative;specifically, the minimum cost would be $5,097. Assuming that some polio victims are not treated has exactly the same effect on estimated savings as assuming that fewer people get polio in thefirst place. Ethically, of course, the two situations are very different; and thetotal benefits are also different once pain and suffering are taken intoaccount. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this analysis the two are identical.Thus, the calculations in T able 11.2 can be interpreted as meaning thatpolio eradication would be justified if there were only 4,000 cases annuallyin the absence of vaccination with all cases being treated\u2014in which caseonly about 1,000 cases would remain to be prevented by the eradicationcampaign. This implies that the results do not depend critically on theassumed high incidence of unreported polio; and so, as noted earlier, thelevel could be as low as 3,100 cases per year. The profile derived in T able 11.2 of immunization expenditures and savings ascribed to reduced treatment costs is displayed graphically in Table 11.2 Costs and Benefits Associated with Polio Eradication During a Successful Five-Year Campaign and Ten-Year Maintenance Period, Assuming only a Fraction of all Polio Victims are Treated.

This calculation shows a total discounted net benefit of only US $0.6million over the entire 15-year period. Based on reduced medical costsalone, the donors' contribution almost exactly pays for itself, assumingtreatment costs of US $5,829 per case. In summary, these estimates indicate that the eradication of poliomyelitis is a justifiable investment, even without making any allowance for benefitsother than those due to realizable reductions in expenditures to treat victimsof the disease. Indeed, the cost of treating even a small fraction of those whoneed treatment is large enough to pay for the total prevention of polio. Inother words, the eradication of polio would actually put money in the cof-fers of the Ministry of Health, or whoever now pays to treat polio victims. It is important, however, to sound a note of caution. This projected result depends on there being enough current expenditure on treatment. Itwould no longer hold, for example, if the level of treatment were only one-fourth lower than that assumed in T able 11.2. This process of justifying aneradication campaign by its effect in reducing public expenditure dependson there being sufficiently high public expenditure to start with; and so theprocess can lead to effects that are clearly perverse. In our case, literallyapplied, and giving no allowance for non-monetary benefits in terms ofreduced pain and suffering, it implies that the eradication of polio would bejustified after spending millions of dollars over many years to treat polio vic-tims, but would not be justified as an alternative to such a treatmentexpenditure. That is, eradication would be more justified the later it came,after increasingly large sums of money were spent for treatment. Immediate Versus Delayed Eradication T o see how such justification of immunization, in terms of reduced costs alone, could lead to a delay in vaccination efforts, consider two hypotheti-cal regions (A and B) with 15,000 cases of paralytic polio per year (the esti-mated pre-EPI level in Latin America and the Caribbean). Suppose thatimmunization has not begun in either region, and suppose further that inneither case are victims of the disease initially being treated. The costs oftreating a case (US $5,829), conducting a five-year eradication campaignThe Eradication of Polio in the Western Hemisphere 217 (US $120 million), and maintaining eradication thereafter (US $10 million per year) are assumed to be the same as in the previous analysis. In Region A, efforts are made to start treating victims for purely ethical reasons, treatment being extended to 1,000 patients the first year and 1,000additional patients per year thereafter. At the end of five years, someoneperforms a cost-benefit estimate of the sort presented above and discoversthat it would be cheaper to immunize people. Over the next five years,immunization is gradually extended to enough of the population to inter-rupt the transmission of wild poliovirus, and eradication is achieved. There-after, immunization of infants is maintained, and while treatment continuesfor the victims accumulated during the whole ten-year period (five withoutimmunization and five after immunization began), no new patients areadmitted for treatment in the eleventh and subsequent years. Assuming lin-ear treatment and immunization trends, as shown in T able 11.3, 112,500people get polio during the decade of whom 41,500 are treated and 71,000receive no treatment. In Region B, nobody worries about cost-benefit analysis of this sort. Immunization is begun immediately, rather than waiting for five years.T reatment of victims begins at the same time and is extended at the samerate as in Region A, except that because of immunization, treatment neverrises beyond 4,000 cases per year and falls to zero in the sixth year. Over theten-year period only 37,500 people get polio, of whom 11,500 receive treat-ment and 26,000 do not. This latter figure is only 37% of the number ofuntreated victims accumulated in Region A. From year 11 onward bothregions are identical, in that they have no new polio cases and spend US $10million each per year to maintain eradication. Any comparison of the tworegions need therefore consider only the first 10 years. What do costs look like in the two cases? Region A spends a total of US $241.9 million on treatment and US $120.0 million on immunization overthe decade, for an undiscounted total cost of US $361.9 million. Region Bspends only $67.0 million on treatment (just 28% of what Region Aspends), but\u2014since five years of maintenance are included after the fiveyears of eradication\u2014it spends US $170.0 million on immunization, US$50.0 million more than Region A. Region B's undiscounted total expendi-ture is therefore US $237.0 million, or 66% as much as Region A 's. Discounting expenditures at 12% per year has more effect on the costs in Region A, because spending there reaches its peak later, in year eight.This is due to initial postponement of the eradication campaign and alsoto the relatively slow expansion of treatment that is assumed; costs wouldTable 11.3 A Comparison of Ten-Year Costs and Results of Two Hypothetical Polio Eradication Campaigns, One Immediate and One Delayed, Discounted at 12% per Year as in Tables 11.1 and 11.2 TEN- YEARS YEAR TOTAL 123456789 1 0 Region A (delayed campaign): Number of polio cases (thousands) 15.0 15.0 13.5 10.5 7.5 4.5 1.5 112.5 Number of cases treated (thousands) 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 7.5 4.5 1.5 41.5Untreated Victims (thousands) 14.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 7.5 3.5 0 0 0 71.0 Cost of treatment (million US$) 5.8 11.7 17.5 23.3 29.1 35.0 40.9 43.7 26.2 8.7 241.9 Cost 00000 24.0 24.0 24.0 24.0 24.0 64.8 67.7 50.2 32.7 361.9Discounted Total 5.5 9.9 13.2 15.7 17.5 31.6 31.0 28.9 19.2 11.1 183.6 Region B (immediate campaign): Number of polio cases (thousands) 13.5 10.5 7.5 4.5 1.5 00000 37.5 Number of cases treated (thousands) 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 1.5 00000 11.5 Untreated Victims (thousands) 12.5 8.5 4.5 0.5 000000 26.0 Cost of treatment (million US$) 5.8 11.7 17.5 23.3 8.7 00000 67.0 Cost of immunization Total 28.2 31.8 19.7 5.4 4.8 4.3 3.8 3.4 162.7 218The Eradication of Polio in the Western Hemisphere 219 be shifted toward the early years if treatment were extended more rapidly. In Region B, total expenditure reaches its peak in year four, beinghigher than in Region A during each of the first five years. As a conse-quence, the discounted total costs are US $183.6 million in Region A andUS $162.7 million in Region B, so that the Region B costs are 89% as highas those in Region A. At the end of 10 years, neither region has any new polio cases. However, Region B is clearly better off. It has spent US $20.9 million less after dis-counting (US $124.9 million less without discounting); it has 30,000 fewertreated polio victims (who suffer some damage from the disease despitetreatment); and it has 45,000 fewer untreated, paralyzed victims. Thus,making an immediate effort to eradicate the disease pays off both in reducedhealth damage and in lower total treatment and prevention costs. If eitherthe cost of treating a polio victim or the number of victims were lower, themonetary saving in Region B compared to Region A would of course besmaller, but it would always be positive. If one assumed that eradicationcould only be justified by saving actual (not potential) expenditure on treat-ment, however, Region A pursued the right course by not starting immuni-zation until the costs of treatment had become relatively high. Concluding Remarks What accounts for this perverse result? Part of it is due to discounting future costs and benefits. When the assumed number of treatments isreduced from 15,000 per year (T able 11.1) to 4,000 per year (T able 11.2),the un-discounted net savings fall from US $1,062.4 million to US $100.7million. (This is much more than the approximately 15:4 reduction intreatment savings, because the costs of immunization are independent oftreatment levels). Discounting means that net savings are reduced muchmore than ten-fold, because savings increase through time; thus, net savingsof US $481.4 million become only US $18.1 million, a 24-fold reduction.What this means is that the higher the discount rate, the higher the num-ber of current treatments necessary to justify the cost of eradication. If, asin Region A, immunization is delayed while treatment costs increase, theeffect of discounting is to delay eradication still more. It might seem that the answer to this problem is not to discount the future, but instead to base decisions on un-discounted costs and benefits.The logic of discounting, after all, supposes that a given individual, who is220 Health Economics in Development the same person today and tomorrow, values tomorrow less than today (11). But the children who will suffer paralytic polio in the future, if the diseaseis not eradicated, have for the most part not been born yet. Discountingtheir future therefore means valuing them less than those are already here,which is very different from making inter-temporal choices for a givenperson. However, to abandon discounting means being willing to wait forever, provided that eventually benefits outweigh costs. The resources required toeradicate polio could be applied to other uses, including medical uses, whichmight pay off more quickly. So even though discounting the future raises anawkward ethical question, there is no escaping the need to give priority tothe present, at least so long as the benefits considered in the two periods canbe compared. The whole question of whether eradicating polio is worth the cost would not even arise if the private market for immunization worked properly. Noparent wants to see his child paralyzed, and the cost of immunization is lessthan the expected cost of treatment per un-immunized child. Therefore,every parent should be more than willing to pay to have his child protected. 3 If this does not happen, the fault lies with some combination of poverty andignorance. It is true that public expenditure to eradicate the disease takesresources away from competing private uses. But requiring that such expen-diture \"pay its way\" amounts to supposing that the alternative private expen-ditures would be equally justified\u2014which seems questionable in a worldwhere private demand has not yet caused all susceptible children to be immu-nized. And if the rationality of private spending is to be doubted, then it isnot clear why public spending must produce positive discounted net benefits. But the most important reason why the eradication of polio may not appear to be economically justified (as in Region A) does not arise from dis-tinctions between the present and the future or between public and privateexpenditure. It arises from the different way that curative treatment andpreventive activities are judged. The \"justification\" for immunization is thatit costs less than treating polio victims. If the aim is to minimize the expen-diture required to avoid paralysis or death from polio, then eradicating thedisease is clearly preferable to continued curative treatment. But if the aimis to reduce public expenditure on health, then immunization appears to bejustified only if curative spending is high enough. In general, the foregoing account assumes that some level of treatment will be provided, with or without economic justification, and then applies aneconomic test to see whether prevention should replace treatment as theThe Eradication of Polio in the Western Hemisphere 221 way to deal with polio. Why should this be considered the right test of an eradication campaign's merit? After all, treating polio victims does notsave money for the government; and if the aim were simply to reduceexpenditure, then curative care could not be justified either. But if \"it isunacceptable, given the technology presently available, that any child in thishemisphere should suffer paralytic poliomyelitis\" ( 5, p. ii), then the eradi- cation of polio is not only ethically justified but also economically sound. Notes 1. If benefits in year t are designated B t, while costs incurred in that year are C t, Bt /H11002 Ctis the net benefit. The corresponding discounted net benefit is (B t /H11002 Ct)/ (1/H11001i)t, where iis the interest or discount rate used. The present value of this stream of net benefits (positive or negative) is the sum of these terms over all the years of aproject, or in the present case through the first 15 years, after which net benefits arepositive but, because of discounting, are quite small.2. It is not easy to estimate polio underreporting, although surveys of residuallameness provide a basis (see 1, Session III, Section A). The assumption that beforethe EPI only about 20% of the polio cases were reported in Latin America and theCaribbean has been suggested by Ciro de Quadros and Marjorie Pollock as a rea-sonable estimate.3. Once coverage by vaccination is almost complete a parent might consider thathis unvaccinated child was adequately protected by the screen of vaccinated chil-dren, so that there would be no further gain from the child's immunization. Thisargument would apply, if ever, only when coverage was complete enough so that therisk of infection was essentially zero; it would not hold at the typically quite incom-plete levels of coverage found in Latin America. Even at higher levels of coverage,this argument would make sense only if the cost of having the child vaccinated werehigh compared to the benefit, or the risk of paralysis from the vaccine itself weresubstantial.

Introduction Although mass vaccination of vulnerable populations has been quite suc- cessful at reducing communicable disease morbidity and mortality, we stillconfront serious public health problems arising from diseases for which noadequate vaccines exist (1,2). Either a vaccine has not been developed, there having been only partial progress to date; or the existing vaccines are of lim-ited effectiveness; or they are restricted to certain pathogenic serotypes andtherefore would not protect the populations exposed to other serotypes; orthey are too costly for mass application. In view of this situation, the gov-ernments participating in the World Children's Conference held inSeptember 1990 proposed various measures including development of an\"infant vaccine\" for safe early protection against a variety of diseases (3). Reprinted, with permission, from \"Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional System for Vaccination Against Pneumonia, Meningitis T ype B and T yphoid Fever\" Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization 26 (2), 1992.224 Health Economics in Development Independently, in early 1989 the Pan American Health Organization began examining the prospects for undertaking a regional effort to perfect anddisseminate certain vaccines. These vaccines would be directed against a lim-ited number of diseases of particular interest to PAHO's Member Countriesbecause of the high morbidity and mortality they caused or because of largeexpenditures needed to treat their victims. This initiative, named the RegionalVaccine System (Sistema Regional de Vacunas- SIREVA), was seen as includ-ing the phase of epidemiological research in the participating countries, basicresearch to develop the new vaccines, clinical and field trials, and constructionand operation of a pilot production plant to support these other phases. Once a vaccine had been found effective, safe, and affordable, production on a commercial scale would begin, possibly under arrangements with stateor private laboratories; and mass vaccination of children would commence,perhaps through an extension of the Expanded Program on Immunization(EPI). The three diseases of bacterial origin considered targets of the effortare pneumococcal pneumonia, typhoid 's included three options designated \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C.\" Option A dealt only with meningitis and typhoid fever, whileoptions B and C included development of vaccines against all three targetdiseases. However, option B included only 10 participating countries with10 collaborating national laboratories, while option C included 17 coun-tries\u2014thus envisioning vaccination of a larger population and implyinggreater development costs for SIREVA directed at identifying serotypes andtesting vaccines in all 17 countries. All three options called for two princi-pal laboratories or vaccine centers to be involved in the project, one asso-ciated with the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico and the otherwith the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Brazil, these being the centers withthe greatest experience and technical sophistication in the Region. On analyzing the costs and benefits the three options, it was concluded that the pneumonia vaccine should definitely be included in the system andthat three vaccines could be applied in the countries of the Region wherethe selected diseases are now of major importance. However, it was alsodecided that the system would be developed in 11 countries, since a networkof 10 national laboratories would be sufficient for the epidemiological workand the clinical and field trials. This option became the final version of theproposal ( 4). The only variation still being considered deals with the number of people who would be vaccinated against meningitis, the cost-benefit calculationsbeing repeated for two possible scales of operation that differ by a factor ofCost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 225 two. It should be noted that the limit placed on the number of countries ini- tially involved would not limit later administration of the vaccines in othercountries of the Americas, or even in other regions, where the cost of vacci-nation might be justified by the benefits. The purpose of the present analysis is to estimate and compare SIREVA 's costs and benefits, and to establish under what circumstances the benefitswould justify the costs, and thus justify establishment of the system. With respect to costs, it is necessary to distinguish between two ele- ments: expenditures for vaccine development (including field trials and adap- tation to different epidemiological conditions) and expenditures for vaccineadministration (that is, for vaccinating the population). Beyond that, how- ever, it is not the purpose of this presentation to distinguish between differ-ent kinds of costs. Therefore, the account that follows makes no attempt todiscuss the composition of the costs attributable to SIREVA (that is, theirdistribution among basic research, clinical trials, pilot production, etc.);only their distribution over time will be considered. Similarly, we will notconsider the biologic, chemical, and epidemiological aspects of the targetdiseases and prospective vaccines. Rather, the information used in thisanalysis deals only with the number of people that would be vaccinated andthe numbers that would become sick or die if unvaccinated; the costs ofimplementing SIREVA, vaccinating the population, and treating patients;and possible additional benefits attributable to vaccination. The last part ofthe analysis estimates the sensitivity of the results to changes in the para-meters utilized, this type of estimate being especially crucial when neitherthe costs nor the benefits are known but must be estimated with varyingdegrees of precision. The costs attributable to SIREVA as such (the vaccine development costs cited above) have been estimated for a period of 10 years under the assump-tion that, although the system could continue to function for many moreyears, the expenditures in the eleventh and following years would be dedi-cated to the development of new vaccines not contemplated in the initialplans. Therefore, it would not be correct to attribute or charge expenses ofthose future years to the first three diseases, and vaccination against themwould have to justify only the expenses of SIREVA 's first decade. Theseexpenses, presented by year in T able 12.1, have been estimated at US$115.3 million in constant dollars. Any cost-benefit analysis is based on what are called present values of cost and benefit flows over time, these flows being discounted according to howfar in the future they occur. This procedure requires the selection of adiscount rate (r), which is conceptually equivalent to an interest rate. A 226 Health Economics in Development cost t years in the future is then estimated by dividing the present cost (C) by (1 /H11001r) for each of t /H110021 years ( 5), the item's present cost (C) were $1,000 and the discount rate were 10% (0.10), then its discounted cost five years in the future (t /H11005 5) would be $683, calculated as follows: total discounted cost (C*) over t years would be the sum of the costs in each of the years considered (from here on we shall use anasterisk [*] to designate a discounted sum). And so, if we let the letters CSstand for the SIREVA costs (for vaccine development), the total SIREVAcosts appearing in T able 12.1, discounted over the decade, can be expressedby the formula CS*/H11005SUM CS(t) /H11003(1/H11001r) (/H11002t/H110011), Table 12.1 Cost of SIREVA, by Year, in Constant US$a COST OF SIREVA (CS), IN YEAR MILLIONS OF US$ (CS*, discounted) 80.31 aThe analysis only attributes the costs of the first 10 years of SIREVA to the development of vaccines against meningitis, typhoid fever, and pneumonia because it is expected thatinitiation of vaccination with all three vaccines will occur in the first decade.Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 227 where CS(t) is the undiscounted cost in year t, (1 /H11001r)(/H11002t/H110011)is the discount factor, and SUM indicates the sum of the costs of all the years in question.The same method can be used to calculate discounted benefits. Box 12.1 lists the multiplicative discount factors in the form (1 /H11001r) (/H11002t/H110011) for a discount rate of 10% per year (r /H110050.10) from Year 1 of SIREVA (when the factor is equal to 1.0) to Year 30, which is the furthest horizon consid-ered in this analysis and for which the factor decreases to only 0.063. Thismeans that one dollar of costs or benefit that only occurs in Year 30 wouldhave a present value of $0.063; and conversely, $0.063 invested today at arate of interest of 10% per year would have a value of $1.00 after 30 years. Box 12.1 Discount Factors, by Year, for a Rate (r) of 10% per Year YEAR FACTOR COMMENTS 1 1.0000 2 0.90913 Start of vaccination against 0.289715 0.2394 From do not vary.17 0.217618 0.197819 0.179820 0.1635 Sum for years 16 to 20 /H110050.9981 Sum for years 1 to 21 to 30 /H110051.0045 Sum for years 1 to 30 /H1100510.3692228 Health Economics in Development The last line of T able 12.1 illustrates the effect of discounting the future costs of SIREVA at 10% per year over the course of a decade, which reducesthe undiscounted figure (US$115.3 million) to a discounted cost of US$80.3 million. The use of other discount rates would obviously give other totals. How- ever, it has been judged that any reasonable rate would fall between 8% and15% per year, and that changes introduced by using such rates as extremevalues would be a good deal smaller than possible changes introduced byuncertainties regarding the value of other variables. For example, the costof vaccinating one individual is not yet known, but it is conceivable that itcould vary by a factor of 10, while a discount rate of 8% would not differfrom one of 15% by as much a factor of two. Moreover, changes in the dis-count rate only affect the relative weights of costs and benefits occurring inthe same year. Therefore, the question of whether the benefits justify thecosts is not as sensitive to variations in the discount rate as it is to variationsin the costs or benefits taken separately. Anticipated Effects of SIREVA According to the projections for SIREVA, it will be possible to begin vacci- nation against typhoid fever in Year 7 of the system's operation. Vaccinationagainst meningitis would begin in Year 9, and vaccination against pneumo-nia in Year 10. In all three cases it is anticipated that vaccination will com-mence at a high rate, so as to reduce the number of susceptible individualsin the existing population. Later, the number of vaccinations carried outwould be reduced to focus on newborns at relatively higher risk, thoughpossible fluctuations could be occasioned by future outbreaks. In the case of pneumonia, only one year of high coverage is foreseen. This high coverage phase would extend over five years for the other twodiseases, and in the case of typhoid fever there would be a period of inter-mediate coverage followed by a second reduction in the coverage rate afteranother four years. T able 12.2 shows estimates of the numbers of people who would be vac- cinated against each of the three target diseases in any given year. However,the number of individuals vaccinated does not correspond to the numberimmunized, because development of vaccines that are 100% effective isnot anticipated; rather, the estimates of disease cases and deaths prevented(see T able 12.3) are based on the assumption that the vaccines will be 90%Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 229 Table 12.2 The Projected Numbers of Individuals to be Vaccinated, by Target Disease and Year NUMBER VACCINATED (NUM), IN MILLIONS, AGAINST: YEAR MENINGITIS TYPHOID FEVER PNEUMONIA TOTAL 7 65 65.0 65 millions: 20-year horizon 106-212 227 67 400-506 30- year horizon 126-251 253 87 466-561 Table 12.3 Total Discounted Numbers of Disease Cases Prevented, Deaths Prevented with Treatment of all Cases, and Deaths Prevented without Treatmentof any Cases, over 20-Year and 30-Year Horizons Health Economics in Development effective. It should also be noted that the T able 12.2 data refer to individu- als rather than to vaccine doses, since a series of two or more doses perperson may be needed to complete the vaccination and achieve 90% immu-nization. The cost-benefit analysis also assumes that the cost of vaccinating one individual will be independent of the number of people vaccinated. The lat-ter number will always be large enough (at least 19.5 million per year) tobenefit from possible economies of scale. Similarly, it is assumed the bene-fit obtained per individual vaccinated will be constant and independent ofhow many others receive the vaccine. Among other things, this implies thatthe chance of one unvaccinated individual becoming ill does not depend onthe number of individuals immunized; that is, a possible \"collective immu-nity\" effect is not taken into account ( 6). As a consequence of these assumptions, the total discounted costs and benefits can be found by totaling and discounting the number of people vac-cinated and later applying to that discounted sum the costs and benefits perperson. More explicitly, if the cost of vaccinating someone against disease 'i'is designated VAC(i), then by definition the total cost (CST) of vaccinatingsome number (NUM) of people against disease 'i' in some year t isas follows: CST (i, t) /H11005VAC(i) /H11003NUM(i, t), and discounting and totaling both sides of the equation yields CST*(i) /H11005SUM CST /H11005VAC(i) /H11003NUM*(i) The same type of calculation can be applied to the number of disease cases prevented (applying as a multiplicative factor the probability that avaccinated individual would have acquired the disease if he or she had notbeen vaccinated); to the number of deaths prevented (successively applyingthe probability that an individual with the disease died of it, whether or notthe effects of curative treatment on the probability of survival are consi-dered); and to the total benefit obtained from vaccination (using the indivi-dual or unit benefit as the multiplicative factor). In relating all these calculations to a discounted sum of individuals, one is not saying that an individual vaccinated 15 years from now is worth lessCost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 231 than one vaccinated before that, but only that the economic value of the cost and the associated benefit are less today because they occur further inthe future. This discounting and totaling of individuals instead of monetarysums is nothing more than a valuable mathematical simplification. Variablesemployed in making relevant calculations and the formulas used to discountand total them are summarized in Box 12.2, which also contains a glossaryof all of the terms utilized in the analysis. The discounted and totaled numbers of individuals vaccinated, desig- nated NUM*, are shown at the bottom of T able 12.2 by disease for two dif-ferent horizons /H1100220 years and 30 years. In contrast to the SIREVA costs for vaccine development (CS), which end in 10 years, the costs of administer-ing the vaccines (CST) never end, so long as the disease is controlled butthe pathogens are not eradicated. Therefore, for the purpose of this anal-ysis, it is necessary to choose a final year. It seems reasonable to think thatif SIREVA could be justified, this justification would probably occur within20 years, a period that would include more than a decade of application ofeach vaccine. Beyond 20 years, any protection becomes very speculative; in particular, it is not known what might happen to the risks of acquiring a disease or thebenefits of being protected. Solely to illustrate a longer horizon, the calcul-ations have been repeated for a 30-year period. As will be seen, this extensionof the period does not significantly affect the system's net estimated worth. As the T able 12.2 projection shows, during the 20 years following SIREVA 's initiation the equivalent, in terms of present value, of between106 million and 212 million people would be vaccinated against pneumonia.Overall, in discounted terms, between 400 million and 506 million peoplewould be vaccinated during the period, the actual figure depending on theextent of vaccination against meningitis. This total could refer to the dis-counted equivalent of 400-506 million individuals; or it could involve fewerindividuals, some of them being vaccinated against two or even three of thetarget diseases. On extending the horizon to 30 years these values increase, but much less than proportionately to the number of additional years of vaccinationbecause the discount factors (see Annex 1) give little weight to the years fur-thest away. In terms of present values, the entire third decade has the samevalue as only the last five years of the second decade, which in turn are onlyworth the same as the first year by itself. T o go from the number of people vaccinated to the number of disease cases prevented it is necessary to multiply by the effectiveness of the vaccine232 Health Economics in Development Box 12.2 Glossary of Symbols, Variables, and their Relationships\u2014in their Approximate Order of Appearance in the Text SYMBOL ORVARIABLE DEFINITION t/H110051,2,3 . . .

The effective-ness of all three vaccines is estimated at 90%, while the incidences of thethree diseases (per 100,000 population at risk) are estimated at 10 (with amaximum of up to 50) for meningitis, 150 for typhoid fever, and 28 forpneumonia. These figures give the likelihood of preventing a disease caseby vaccinating one person a probability of 9, 135, and 25 chances per100,000 respectively. (Only the lower estimated incidence is used formeningitis, because this reduces the benefits without affecting the costs; andif SIREVA is justified under these circumstances, it would be even morejustified if the disease incidence were higher.) The probabilities of preventing a case are shown in T able 12.4, which will be discussed later, while T able 12.3 indicates the estimated numbers ofcases that would be prevented, by disease, for horizons of 20 and 30 years.By far the greatest disease prevention occurs with regard to typhoid fever,PREDT(i,t) The number of deaths prevented by vaccination, assuming those ill would receive treatment.

D Delay (in years) between vaccination and the hypothetical onset of disease had the vaccinated individual not been vaccinated.The correct adjustment to the benefit derived from the preventionof one case can be calculated as follows: ADJD /H11005(l/H11001r) /H11002D234 Health Economics in Development because of its high incidence, the discounted number of cases to be prevented totaling over 300,000. For meningitis and pneumonia the esti-mated figures are lower by an order of magnitude, ranging from 10,000 to23,000 for meningitis and from 17,000 to 22,000 for pneumonia. In some cases a person who acquires the disease will die. The likelihood of this varies greatly, depending on the disease and whether the victim doesor does not receive adequate and timely treatment. With such treatmentalmost no one dies of typhoid fever, since the death rate is estimated at nomore than 1%; and even without treatment that rate rises to only 10%.Regarding pneumonia, it is estimated that the lethality is 3% with treatmentand 10% without treatment, while for meningitis the corresponding ratesare estimated at 5% and 50% ( 4). Therefore, the numbers of deaths pre- vented are not proportional to the numbers of cases prevented\u2014the risk ofdeath depending on the particular disease involved and also varying by afactor as great as 10, depending on whether one assumes that each patientdoes or does not receive appropriate treatment. T able 12.3 shows the estimated numbers of deaths that vaccination would prevent, by type of disease, and also shows the total number ofdeaths preventable by SIREVA. Showing these latter totals is appropriate;for although it would be incorrect to total the numbers of cases of diseasesthat are very different with respect to severity and danger, it is legitimateto total the resulting deaths. Depending on the horizon selected, the totalsrange from 40,000 to 52,000 deaths prevented if no treatment is assumed,and from 5,000 to 8,000 if it is assumed that every victim receives appro-priate care.Table 12.4 The Estimated Cost of Treatment (in Constant US$), Probability of Preventing One Case, and Implied Maximum Cost of Vaccination,aby Disease, Independent of the Number of Vaccinations MENINGITIS TYPHOID FEVER PNEUMONIA case, 9.0 /H1100310/H1100251.35 /H1100310/H1100232.5/H1100310/H110024 SUF(i) /H11003EFV(i) /H11003BTR(i) aThe implied maximum cost of vaccination is the value such that the cost of vaccinating one person compensates exactly for the probable cost of having to treat that individual forthe disease. It is calculated by multiplying the unit cost of treatment by the probability ofpreventing one case. For this calculation the fixed cost of developing vaccines against thetarget diseases is not considered.Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 235 Economic Benefit: Treatment Cost Saved The benefits obtained by preventing one case of a disease include some that are difficult to quantify or evaluate economically, such as reduction of thepatient's pain and suffering. Other benefits, although possibly less important,are easier to evaluate in economic terms; among these is the treatment costsaved as a result of not having to care for the patient. Clearly, attributing thismonetary benefit to vaccination depends on an assumption that the victimwould receive the treatment if he were to contract the disease. This benefitis received by the person or institution that otherwise would have to pay thetreatment cost, whether the paying party is the patient or not. Thus, one way to compare costs with benefits is to relate the cost of vac- cinating one person with the expected cost of treating that individual, con-sidering these procedures as alternatives. Obviously, this last assumption ismore reasonable when the treatment results in a complete cure, withoutpermanent injury to the patient. When the patient dies despite the treat-ment (which is possible with all diseases and occurs in up to 10% of pneu-monia cases) or is left with significant sequelae (as can easily occur withmeningitis), treatment is a very incomplete substitute for prevention. Of course, one must compare the cost of vaccination with the expected or probable cost of care, because not all vaccinated individuals wouldbecome sick if unvaccinated. The comparison depends, therefore, on thelikelihood that the vaccine would prevent a case of the disease. This likeli-hood, as already noted, is shown on the first line of T able 12.4; it is calcu-lated by multiplying the effectiveness of the vaccine (EFV) against disease(i) by the probability of suffering the disease, SUF(i). This is the same logicthat has been used to justify eradication of poliomyelitis, through the sav-ings in treatment costs that would result from vaccinating virtually theentire population at risk ( 7). The second line in T able 12.4 shows the average cost of providing a patient with correct and timely care, designated BTR(i). This is estimatedto range from less than $600 in the case of typhoid fever to more than$6,000 in the case of pneumonia. T aken together, the likelihood ofpreventing a case and the cost of treating that case determine a hypotheti-cal cost of prevention where the prevention and treatment costs wouldequal one another, and so the net saving from vaccination would be zero.This cost can be viewed as the implied maximum cost of vaccination in the sense that at any lower cost the vaccination would be less costly than thetreatment.236 Health Economics in Development As can be seen on the third line of the table, this latter cost, SUF(i) /H11003 EFV(i) /H11003BTR(i), is calculated by multiplying the probability of preventing one case by the cost of treating one case. And the cost of preventing onecase is the cost of one vaccination, VAC(i), divided by the probability of pre-venting one case with one vaccination or VAC(i) /H20862[SUF(i) /H11003EFV(i)]. On relating this expression to the cost of treatment, BTR(i), one sees that where VAC(i) /H11005SUF(i) /H11003EFV(i) /H11003BTR(i) there is exact equality between vaccination costs; and like- wise, where VAC(i) /H11021SUF(i) /H11003EFV(i) /H11003BTR(i) vaccination offers a net economic benefit. In monetary terms (see T able 12.4), the corresponding values range from $0.27 per vaccination in the caseof meningitis to $1.58 in the case of pneumonia. Regarding typhoid fever,it should be noted that the low cost of treating one case of this disease is par-tially balanced by its high incidence in the population, so that the impliedmaximum cost of vaccination against typhoid fever is $0.79, or almost threetimes the implied maximum cost in the case of meningitis. As has been said, until the vaccines are developed and administered on a mass scale, there can be no exact picture of vaccination cost. The interpre-tation of the calculations in T able 12.4 is that vaccination will be justified\u2014through savings in treatment costs, without considering other benefits\u2014aslong as it costs no more than $0.27 per vaccination against meningitis, etc.If, for example, it were feasible to vaccinate at a unit cost of $0.10\u2014whichwould cover not only the cost of the vaccine but also the cost of distributingand administering it to the population, then clearly vaccination would behighly worthwhile. In contrast, if the unit cost were $1.00, only vaccinationagainst pneumonia would appear to be justified, assuming no other benefitswere considered. Even if one compares only vaccination and treatment, however, the cal- culation presented in T able 12.4 is still incomplete because the vaccinesinvolved do not yet exist and have to be developed. This implies that thebenefits, in the form of saved medical costs, would have to cover not onlythe costs of vaccination (costs \"outside SIREVA\" or CST), but also the vac-cine development costs \"within SIREVA\" (CS). In addition, SIREVA isCost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 237 attempting to develop three vaccines, without the total cost of the program being attributed to one or another of these products. The first of these conditions implies that the maximum cost allowed for vaccination is going to be less than that shown in T able 12.4, since the ben-efits must also cover SIREVA 's vaccine development costs. The second con-dition (of co-production or inseparability) implies that judging the worth ofeach vaccine individually makes no sense, because it will be necessary tojudge the entire system with respect to the average cost of vaccinationagainst the three target diseases. This matter can be summarized as follows: For there to be a net benefit after considering both types of costs, it is necessary that BENT* /H11022CS* /H11001CST*, where BENT is the total benefit in saved treatment costs\u2014the cost of treat- ing one individual times the number of cases prevented. (T able 12.3 indi-cates the number of cases prevented, and T able 12.4 shows the unit costs oftreatment.) As noted above, CST* /H11005VAC /H11003NUM*, where VAC denotes the average cost of vaccination within the time interval involved. Both BENT* and CST* must be assumed for all the target dis-eases, and both must also be discounted and summed over time. Then, inorder for the net benefit condition to be met, it is necessary that BENT* /H11002CS* /H11022VAC /H11003NUM*. T able 12.5 presents the corresponding calculations. Starting with the values of CS* and NUM* from T ables 12.1 and 12.2, respectively, T able 12.5 pro-ceeds to list values for the three ingredients of BENT*, these being thesaved costs of treating each disease, and the BENT* totals for 20-year and30-year horizons. The last entries show the 20-year and 30-year values ofBENT* /H11002CS* and of VAC. The figures shown indicate that over a period of 20 years some US $80.3 million, at present value, would be spent developing the three vaccines,which would be administered to the discounted equivalent of 400-506 mil-lion individuals. The disease cases prevented would represent an estimatedsaving of $29-$57 million for meningitis, $179 million for typhoid fever,and $106 million for pneumonia. The total benefit would amount to$313-$342 million before subtracting the costs of SIREVA itself, yielding anet benefit of $233-$262 million. After dividing this amount by the total238 Health Economics in Development number to be vaccinated, it can be concluded that SIREVA is justified with respect to the treatment costs saved as long as the population could be vac-cinated for no more than $0.52-$0.58 each. If one individual were toreceive all three vaccines, the permitted cost would rise to $1.56-$1.74.Applying these same calculations to the 30-year horizon yields an averagepermitted cost that is greater by a few cents because the costs of SIREVAwould be distributed over more years of vaccination, and so their relativeweight in the total costs would be less. Overall Benefits from SIREVA and Vaccination Costs The exercise in the previous section fixes a value on the benefit derived from SIREVA, equating it to saved medical treatment costs, and on thisbasis estimates the maximum cost of vaccination that would be compatiblewith a net positive benefit. This procedure can be reversed by first fixinga value on the cost of vaccination and then deriving from it an estimate ofthe minimum benefits could be of any type, without being limited to the treatment costs saved. The worth of preventing a death, the value of eco-nomic production saved by preventing death or illness, the reduction ofphysical and emotional suffering, and other benefits could be included. Inthis regard, since the disease cases and deaths prevented are the mostTable 12.5 The Average Implied Maximum Cost of Vaccination (in Constant US$) Derived from the Number of Individuals Vaccinated, Treatment Costs, andthe Cost of SIREVA, for 20-Year and 30-Year Horizons 20-YEAR HORIZON 30-YEAR in millions 400-506 465-591 Saving on by disease, in millions: Meningitis 29-57 199Pneumonia 106 Net saving, SIREVA's cost(BENT* /H11002CS*), in US$ millions 233-262 290-324 Average implied maximum cost of onevaccination-VAC (net savings divided by the number of vaccinations), in US$ 0.52-0.58 0.55-0.62Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 239 quantifiable results of vaccinating the population, it seems natural to esti- mate minimum benefits in terms of these concepts. The condition that must be satisfied is BEN* /H11022CS* /H11001CST* /H11005C*, where C* is the total costs BEN* is the discounted sum of allthe ben- efits (including BENT*, the benefit of not having to treat those who wouldbecome ill). If we then designate the benefit or \"utility\" per case preventedas UTU, and the number of cases prevented as PREC*, we see that for caseprevention alone to satisfy the condition it will be necessary for UTU /H11003PREC* /H11022 C*, or equivalently, UTU /H11022C*/H20862PREC*. Similarly, if we designate the benefit per death prevented as UTUD, we see that for mortality prevention alone to satisfy the condition it will be nec-essary for UTUD /H11022C*/H20862PRED*, where PRED* is the number of deaths that would occur in the absence of vaccination and treatment. The corresponding calculations appear in T able 12.6. They are limited to the 20-year horizon, since it was determined (in T able 12.5) that exten-sion of the horizon to 30 years does not significantly affect the results. Start-ing with the cost of SIREVA (CS*), numbers of cases prevented (PREC*),and numbers of deaths prevented (PRED*) that appear in T ables 12.1 and12.3, T able 12.6 derives the other component of the total cost\u2014the cost ofvaccination\u2014from the total number vaccinated (see T able 12.2), using aunit cost (VAC) first of $1 and then of $10. The resulting total cost (C*) is then used to calculate the benefits per case prevented (UTU). It turns out that the first VAC cost ($1) yields valuesquite close to those that would permit justification of SIREVA solely on thebasis of medical treatment costs saved, while the second VAC cost ($10)yields values so high that the benefits per case prevented would have to besubstantially greater. The results of attributing the entire benefit to the prevention of death (UTUD) are shown in the last line of the table. Naturally, the benefit240 Health Economics in Development involved would have to be much greater. Given that, on the average, approximately 10% of the untreated cases would terminate in death, theminimum benefit per death prevented would have to be some 10 timesgreater than the minimum benefit per disease case prevented. For example, at a cost of vaccinating one person for $1.00, SIREVA is justified so long as an average benefit per case prevented of between $1,400and $1,700 is obtained. This is based on the estimate that a total of $480 to$586 million at present value will be spent in order to prevent a total ofsome 332,000-342,000 cases of the three diseases. The minimum necessary benefit per case rises to $12,000 if the cost of vaccination is fixed at $10; it does not rise in the same proportion as the unitcost of vaccination because the actual expenditures of SIREVA are notaffected. It should be noted, however, that when the cost per vaccination is$1.00 or greater, these fixed costs of developing the vaccines are of relativelylittle importance compared to what would have to be spent applying them.Therefore, justifying the vaccination is almost equivalent to justifyingSIREVA, if there is no other way to develop the vaccines that is less costlythan the system proposed. The final calculations (on the last line of T able 12.6) are somewhat arti- ficial, since they attribute benefits only to the prevention of death. ThisTable 12.6 Implied Minimum Benefit per Case Prevented and per Death Prevented as a Function of the Cost of Vaccination, without Considering PatientTreatment (20-Year Horizon) COST OF VACCINATION (VAC) US $1.00 US$10.00 number of cases prevented (PREC*), thousands 332-342 332-342 Total number of in of (CS*), in US$ (CST*), in US$ millions 400-506 4,000-5,060 Total Cost (C*), in US$ millions 480-586 4,080-5,140 Minimum benefit per case prevented (C*/PREC*), in US$ thousands a1.4-1.7 12.3-15.0 Minimum benefit per death prevented (C*/PRED*), in US$ thousandsb12.0-13.0 102.0-114.2 aThe values for the minimum benefits do not change significantly on extending the horizon to 30 years. bThe minimum benefit per death prevented does not attribute any benefit to preventing nonfatal disease cases.Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 241 establishes a kind of \"maximum of the minimum\" for the necessary benefit justifying SIREVA\u2014at levels on the order of $12,000 in the first instanceand $100,000 in the second. It should be noted, however, that benefits from cases prevented and deaths prevented can be combined. That is, it is appropriate to compensatefor the costs of SIREVA through any combination of benefits per deathprevented and benefits per non-mortal case /H11003(PREC* /H11002PRED*)] /H11001(UTUD /H11003PRED*) /H11022C*, where UTU, the benefit per case prevented, would be substantially less than UTUD, the benefit per death prevented. The expression (PREC* /H11002 PRED*) refers to the number of individuals who would become sick but notdie if they were not vaccinated. Both the calculations in T able 12.5 and those in T able 12.6 implicitly assume that the benefit associated with vaccination occurs immediately,simultaneously with vaccination. This assumption is justified if the targetdisease would probably attack an individual within a short time or never, asis typically true of the diseases targeted by the Expanded Program onImmunization, which affect primarily children (although those diseases canappear several years later than the normal age of immunization). If, on theother hand, a large proportion of those affected will typically become illmany years after vaccination\u2014and if the vaccine retains its effectiveness formany years, so that it is not necessary to repeat the vaccination frequently\u2014the calculations that were just presented can prove optimistic or overlyfavorable because they do not consider the interval between the moment ofvaccination and the probable moment of becoming ill. The greater this interval, the longer the benefits are delayed relative to the costs, and the greater they have to be to compensate for this delay. Theway to adjust for the possible optimistic bias is to estimate the average inter-val between vaccination and illness in years (D) and then to discount thebenefits with respect to the costs by the factor (l /H11001r) /H11002D, utilizing the same discount rate(r) applied elsewhere. By way of example, T able 12.7 shows the sizes of adjustments associated with several different intervals of delay. Thus, if the benefits were delayedan average of 10 years, they would have only 38.55% of the value theywould have if they appeared immediately. The rest of the table shows theimpact of these adjustments on parameters calculated in T able 12.5 (theimplied maximum cost of vaccination) and T able 12.6 (the implied242 Health Economics in Development minimum benefit per case prevented). As can be seen, a relatively short delay such as five years does not greatly affect the results; but longer delayssuch as 15 years produce much stronger effects\u2014resulting in multiplicationor division of the benefits or costs by a factor of four or more. Conditions Justifying SIREVA and Sensitivity of the Results It has not been possible to carry out a closed and precise cost-benefit analy- sis for the proposed system at this time because its exact costs are not knownand there is no consensus on how to evaluate its benefits. Therefore, theTable 12.7 The Effects of Adjusting for the Delay between Vaccination and Disease Onset upon the Implied Maximum Cost of Vaccination and upon theImplied Minimum Benefits of Preventing a Disease Case, in Constant US$ DELAY (D), IN YEARS 05 71 0 1 5 Adjustment factor (AJUD) 1.000 0.7513 0.5132 0.3855 0.2394 Effects on the implied maximum cost of vaccination (original value multiplied by the adjustment factor), in US$: By disease, without counting the cost ofSIREVA : Meningitis 0.27 0.20 0.14 0.10 0.58 0.44 0.30 0.22 0.14 Effects on the implied minimum benefit per case or death prevented (original value divid- ed by the adjustment factor) in US$ thousands: Per case prevented; vaccination cost /H11005 US$1.00: Minimum 1.4 1.9 2.7 3.6 5.8Maximum 1.7 2.3 3.3 4.4 7.1Per death prevented; vaccination cost /H11005 US$1.00 Minimum 12.0 31.1 50.1 Maximum 13.0 17.3 25.8 33.7 54.3Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 243 analysis presented in the above sections is based on the relationships between these unknown elements, rather than upon definitive valuesassigned to them. For every level of benefit per disease case prevented, thereis a corresponding maximum value for vaccination cost that still leaves apositive net benefit. And conversely, each unit cost of vaccination estab-lishes a minimum for the total benefit of preventing one case (or one death)compatible with net benefit from the system. The corresponding calcula-tion of these two ways of presenting the relationship, shown in T ables 12.5and 12.6, can be considered the essence of the present analysis. In general terms, the calculations allow one to conclude that SIREVA would be justified by its benefits if it were possible to develop the vaccinesat the costs estimated for the different options and later to administer themto the population at a unit cost of half a dollar or less. At this level ofexpense, the system could generate sufficient treatment cost savings to com-pensate for the entire cost of developing and administering the vaccines.Even if it were assumed that in the absence of SIREVA not all the diseasevictims would receive adequate and timely treatment, the system would stillbe justified if benefits per disease case prevented were found to have a min-imum average value between $1,000 and $2,000. Part of these benefitswould derive from prevention of deaths; and if it were estimated that itwould be worth spending somewhat more than $10,000 on the average toavoid one death, this benefit alone would justify the proposed expenditures. How sensitive are these results to variations in the different parameters considered in the analysis? If a small change in one of them causes the sys-tem to stop appearing viable, then the proposal would be risky, given thegreat uncertainty in the estimated values. The analysis has taken intoaccount all of the following factors: the cost of SIREVA itself (developmentof the vaccines), the cost of vaccinating one individual against one disease,the cost of treating one case of a disease, the number of individuals vacci-nated, the effectiveness of the vaccine, the incidence of the target diseases,their lethality with and without treatment, the discount rate, and the possi-ble delay between a person's age at vaccination and age at disease onset. Forsome of these factors, where less is known or it is possible to anticipate alarge variation, an explicit sensitivity analysis has been made. For other ele-ments the probable variation in the factor and the consequences for theresults have been discussed briefly. T o terminate this analysis, the sensitiv-ity of the conclusions to the elements mentioned are discussed below. Ingeneral, there is no reason for hesitation in exploring the possibilities ofchanges on the order of 10% or 20%; the concern is whether one ought to244 Health Economics in Development anticipate variations of an order of magnitude or so in the system's esti- mated yield. Actual cost of SIREVA . The importance of these costs depends on whether they are large or small relative to the total vaccination cost. If they are small,they can vary considerably without greatly affecting the total cost. Forexample, at the maximum cost calculated for which vaccination is justifiedin terms of medical costs saved, the costs of SIREVA itself are one-third orless of the total costs, so that they could be underestimated by 50% and stillnot have a great effect upon the system's yield. Aside from an increase in SIREVA 's cost, the relative importance of this element would be greater if the unit cost of vaccination were less than esti-mated. In that case, however, the reduced cost of administering the vaccineswould compensate for a large increase in the cost of developing them. Forexample, consider the calculation in T able 12.5 and assume that the elementCS* (the cost of SIREVA) were doubled. Then CS* would be $160.6 mil-lion, but the system would still be justified for any vaccination cost VAC lessthan $0.36. Vaccination cost . As has been seen, this element is crucial; and if one calcu- lates benefits only in terms of medical expense saved, this imposes a clearmaximum value upon vaccination cost that is at the level of $0.50. Increas-ing the unit vaccination cost to $1.00 requires greater total benefits; and ifthe vaccination cost were as high as $10.00, the saving in treatment cost byitself would be far too small to justify the system. Hence, everythingdepends on whether vaccination is achieved at a reasonable cost, and theproposal assumes that result. T o achieve such a result, it may be necessaryto incorporate the new vaccines into the EPI; that way the logistic costswould be minimal, and little more would have to be spent beyond thatneeded to cover the costs of manufacturing the vaccines. Treatment cost . It is assumed that this element is relatively well known, so that its possible variations need not be taken into account. In any case, if thescheme of analysis utilized in T able 12.6 is adopted to consider the total value of the benefits per case prevented, this treatment cost variablebecomes less important\u2014because it then constitutes only one componentof the benefits, and perhaps not the greatest of them. Number of individuals vaccinated . This factor is crucial for the simple reason that the costs of developing the vaccines must be offset by administeringthem to a large enough number of people. If it were not for this fixedCost-Benefit Analysis of a Regional Vaccination System 245 development cost, the calculations in T able 12.4 could be applied directly; SIREVA 's justification would be independent of the scale of operation; andthe average cost of vaccination could be as high as $0.78. Comparing thesecalculations with the values listed in T able 12.5 shows how the need to com-pensate for the system's fixed costs affects the results. Both the maximumcost of vaccination and the implied minimum benefit vary directly withchanges in the number of individuals covered by SIREVA. It is assumed,however, that the estimates of this latter number would not be in error bymore than a small percentage. Vaccine effectiveness . This factor cannot vary much because a vaccine would not be administered if it were not at least 70% or 80% effective. Therefore,vaccine effectiveness cannot affect the results very much. It would only beimportant if after expending millions of dollars on SIREVA, the effort failedand effective vaccines were not obtained; the entire proposal is based uponconfidence that this will not occur. Disease incidences . The estimates of these parameters are very low, the maxi- mum value used being 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for typhoid fever.Any increase would only make the system more viable; and so the only con-sideration should be whether the incidences of the target diseases have beenoverestimated. Changes in the probability of getting sick affect the benefitsthe same way that changes in the number of people vaccinated do, but with-out affecting the cost\u2014unless one could, at lower risk, vaccinate fewer peo-ple. The epidemiological studies constituting part of the system's develop-ment will help to define these risks better and so to adjust, if necessary, theprojected extent of mass vaccination. Disease lethality . This factor cannot vary much, even admitting that it is not known exactly. In any case, it is important only if one desires to attrib-ute a specific benefit to the prevention of death, for there would clearly begreat benefit in preventing each of the target diseases even if no one died ofthem. Discount rate . As has already been discussed, this element cannot vary by more than a factor of two, and its influence affects the distribution of costsand benefits over time without affecting their comparison in a given year.Therefore, the results of the analysis are not considered very sensitive to therate selected. Delay between vaccination and prevented illness . As T able 12.7 shows, this fac- tor becomes a matter of concern if it is necessary to assume a delay of more246 Health Economics in Development than about half a decade. If the disease presents risks over the entire human life-span, part of the benefit is left unperceived in terms of present value.Even though the probable impact of such a delay would only divide the ben-efits in half, this circumstance would require an average benefit twice aslarge, or a cost of vaccination half as large, as those projected. It is clear that the justification, or lack thereof, of a project such as the one being analyzed depends upon how all of these elements are evaluated,and upon the values assigned to prevention of disease and death\u2014valuesoutside the purely economic realm. The present analysis only attempts totrace a dividing line between the possible combinations of factors, known orestimated, that show whether or not SIREVA would be viable in the senseof producing benefits that more than compensate for its costs of develop-ment and application, within a reasonable span of time.

By June 1984, that region, including nineof the country's 26 states, accounted for 97% of all reported malaria cases,with high fatality rates. Between 1977 and 1988 the coefficient of mortality(deaths per 100,000 population) in the Amazon more than quadrupled. Theenormous extent of the region, the substantial and hard-to-trace migrationinto and within it, and the existence of numerous transient and dispersed set-tlements, rendered ineffective the traditional eradication strategy based onactive case detection for treatment and eliminating the vector through wide-spread use of insecticides. At the end of 1983, there were 280,000 reportedcases of the disease, but with the number of people infected rising by 40,000every year, incidence reached almost half a million four years later. In 1986 the Government of Brazil requested World Bank technical and financial assistance to develop an Amazon Basin Malaria Control Project(known as PCMAM from its Portuguese title) to support the national pro-gram. The project was expected initially to be conducted over four yearsand cost US $200 million; it became effective in September 1989 and closedin June 1996, with a final cost of US $133.7 million, of which US $72.9 mil-lion was financed by a Bank loan (The World Bank, 1996). The project wasoriginally aimed at getting the malaria outbreak in the Amazon Basin under Co-authored with Dariush Akhavan, Alexandre Abrantes and Renato d'A. Gusm\u00e3o.

Like the program which it supported, the project con-sisted of vector control (application of insecticides in dwellings and foggingof high-risk communities), entomological surveillance, treatment, specialefforts for disease control in indigenous areas and information, educationand communication (IEC). This paper provides an evaluation of the project during the interval of almost seven years corresponding to the World Bank loan. (There is no dis-tinction between the Bank project and the pre-existing government pro-gram, so this is not an evaluation of the marginal contribution of the Bank-financed project.) A first estimate of the results of the project is provided byan extensive evaluation by one of the authors (Akhavan, 1996); some ofthese initial findings have been published in a World Bank evaluation (TheWorld Bank, 1996) as well as in a government summary publicizing theresults of this and a parallel project for the control of three other endemicdiseases in northeastern Brazil (National Health Foundation, 1996). A moredetailed state-by-state analysis was conducted later (Akhavan, 1997). Thepresent study provides projections of three key variables in the absence ofthe project: the incidence, severity (proportion of falciparum ) and lethality (case fatality rate) from malaria in the Amazon Basin during the period1989-1996, and summarizes the estimated savings in lives, morbidity (cases)and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from malaria control. Old and New Strategies for Fighting Malaria Prior to 1991, malaria control was the responsibility of a semi-autonomous federal agency, the Superintendency for Public Health SUCAM), which and endemic disease control campaigns through aworkforce of 40,000. The agency was noted for its strong staff and lineorganization and had an excellent record in sustaining endemic disease con-trol programs in remote areas, under very difficult conditions. Municipali-ties and States had no responsibility for endemic disease control. Hospitalsand outpatient clinics affiliated with the National Health System (knownfrom 1990 on as the Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade, SUS) did not treat malariapatients, who were routinely referred to SUCAM facilities or staff. In 1991, SUCAM was extinguished and its functions transferred to a new agency, the National Health Foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional de Sa\u00fade,Cost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 249 NHF), which went through a period of political and organizational turbu- lence, largely as the result of rapid decentralization (Brazilian Institute ofMunicipal Administration 1996a, b). This created something of a vacuumin the field, seriously undermined staff morale and jeopardized the opera-tional capacity that had characterized SUCAM. These difficulties added tothe natural complexity of controlling malaria by the traditional strategy ofvector control everywhere that ecological conditions favored transmissionand were only overcome starting in 1993. Mortality from malaria had begun to fall in 1989, the year the project went into effect, and over the next three years fell to only half the peak levelregistered in 1988. Nonetheless, by 1992 it became apparent that thisapproach was inadequate, because the number of cases continued to grow.Beginning in late 1992, therefore, the Brazilian control program was reori-ented in line with the new Global Malaria Control Strategy (World HealthOrganization, 1993a) emphasizing disease management, which replaced anearlier effort (World Health Organization, 1978) to define control strate-gies following the failure of eradication efforts. The Pan American HealthOrganization (PAHO) collaborated with the NHF in this first large-scaleimplementation of the new approach (World Health Organization, 1993b).A key element of the change was to stratify the population by risk and con-centrate control activities accordingly (Pan American Health Organization,1991). The project was refocused, with greater emphasis on early diagnosisand immediate and intensive treatment of patients, while the use of pesti-cides was more closely targeted to municipalities and communities withhigh malaria incidence. The first of these changes aimed to prevent human deaths rather than kill mosquitoes, while the second emphasized killing those mosquitoes mostlikely to carry malaria, particularly the form, P. falciparum, which causes nearly all deaths (Miller and Warrell, 1990). This targeting drew on epi-demiological studies in the 1980s (Sawyer and Sawyer, 1987; Cruz Marques,1988), which had shown that malaria was concentrated in relatively fewmunicipalities, often characterized by new and inaccessible agricultural set-tlements or wildcat gold mining areas ( garimpos ), where insecticide spraying or fogging is typically ineffective (Najera et al., 1993, T able 13.2). In 1985, two states, Rond\u00f4nia and Par\u00e1, accounted for over 73% of all cases in theregion and were the source of infection of most cases identified in the restof the country. In 1986, only 22 out of the 458 municipalities of the Ama-zon Basin accounted for 60% of reported cases of malaria. However,resources were not being allocated according to incidence: some 70% of the250 Health Economics in Development government program's resources were being used in areas with only 3% of cases. It is much easier to misallocate preventive efforts than treatment; inconsequence, the cost-effectiveness of prevention is likely to vary muchmore, and may reflect more waste, than that of case treatment. This patternshows up when cost-effectiveness is estimated separately for each of thenine Amazon Basin states (Akhavan, 1997). The project developed new diagnosis and treatment protocols and car- ried out an extensive training program for health care professionals in SUShospitals and ambulatory clinics, which also received supplies of antimalar-ials. As a result, parasitoscopic diagnosis efficiency improved by 20%; thenumber of hospital admissions for malaria, which had increased from about10,000 in 1984 to 20,000 in 1988, rose to more than 50,000 in 1992 and1994 before declining slightly; and the better care led to a 55% fall in theestimated overall case fatality rate. One paradoxical effect of the changed strategy was initially to increase the apparent number of municipalities in every category of risk of infection, as T able 13.1 shows. In 1992, the Annual Parasitological Index (API), anindicator of the probability of contracting malaria, was available for only80% of the 654 municipalities considered to have the ecological potentialfor transmission. Improvements in the NHF information system broughtcoverage up to 98% by 1993. T o improve reporting and allow for greaterfocus on the highest-risk areas, the number of posts equipped for micro-scopic diagnosis of malaria was expanded from 405 in 1992 to 1,095 at theend of the project in 1996. At the same time that more municipalities appeared to be at high risk, the concentration of disease control efforts greatly reduced the number of Table 13.1 Population (Millions) and Number of Municipalities by Risk of Malaria Transmission, Based on API, 1988-1995 RISK CATEGORY HIGH RISK (API /H1135050) MODERATE RISK (50 /H11350API/H1135010) LOW RISK (10 /H11350API/H113501) YEAR POPULATION MUNICIPALITIES POPULATION MUNICIPALITIES POPULATION MUNICIPALITIES 3.15 126 6.06 111 4.91 159Cost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 251 people at moderate or high risk (API /H1102210.0 positive blood slides per 1,000 population), by reducing the risk in the more populous municipalities.Focusing surveillance in those areas meant that between 1992 and 1995coverage by prompt diagnosis expanded from 11 to 34% of the populationat greatest risk, among whom the share of positive blood slides went from24 to 42%. Increases in coverage and in positivity rates as a result of thisconcentration of effort were also observed for the populations at moderate,low and no risk of transmission. Collection of blood slides is more cost-effective when rates are high than when they are low and collection is main-tained only to monitor eradication efforts (Najera et al., 1993). The change in treatment strategy meant giving each suspected malaria case presenting to any level of the program (any facility, from a health postto a hospital) a complete chloroquine treatment (25 mg/kg of body weight).This is still regarded as efficacious for P. vivax infections and partly effec- tive in reducing the clinical symptoms of P. falciparum disease. Mefloquine, a synthetic antimalarial which allows effective early treatment of P. falci- parum even in ambulatory settings, was also licensed and distributed widely in SUS. As a result of earlier and more aggressive treatment, 20% fewer fal- ciparum cases required hospitalization in 1995 than in 1992. Mixed infec- tions, patients who had both falciparum and vivax , were classified and treated as falciparum because of its greater severity. Directly Observed Results: Malaria Cases, Severity and Program Expenditures Figure 13.1 shows how the malaria epidemic began to come under control. The upper panel relates the total number of blood slides positive for malariato the total expenditure on malaria control by SUCAM and subsequently byNHF; the lower panel shows the same information, but for P . falciparum only. These are all directly observed variables, involving no estimations orassumptions. The numbers in Figure 13.1 differ slightly from those used toestimate the total health benefits and the total costs of the program, whichdo involve assumptions. First, they refer to the entire country rather thanjust the Amazon Basin, but as indicated earlier, nearly all cases occur in thatarea, as do more than 90% of expenditures, so the difference is small. Sec-ond, the number of positive slides differs slightly from that of new cases,because two or more slides may be taken to confirm a diagnosis; the differ-ence is small, probably of the order of 3%. Third, salaries of staff are not252 Health Economics in Development Figure 13.1 Cases of Malaria and Total Budget for Malaria, 1975-96 1975 19771978 1979 $0$10,000$20,000$30,000$40,000$50,000$60,000$70,000$80,000$90,000$100,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 600,000 700,000Total Budget in US$1,000 Cases of Malaria 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000$0$10,000$20,000$30,000$40,000$50,000$60,000$70,000$80,000$90,000$100,000 1975 1976 19771978 1979 1981198019821983 in US$1,000 Cases of FalciparumCost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 253 attributed to the malaria control program, so expenditures in Figure 13.1 reflect only other recurrent spending. However, salaries are small comparedto those other costs, which do include the transportation and per diemexpenses of field workers. Finally, expenditures are in current US dollars,without adjustment for US inflation or discounting to present value as isdone when adding up total project costs. For year-by-year comparisons thesecond adjustment is irrelevant and that for price changes in the US is small. What Figure 13.1 principally shows is that the epidemic expanded in every year from 1975 to 1989, irrespective of the level of SUCAM's expen-ditures on control and also of whether spending rose or fell from one yearto another. Large annual increases in expenditure do seem to have slowedthe expansion, but never enough to reverse the epidemic; in any case, theassociation is not robust. In 1987-1989, the program all but collapsed, withexpenditure falling from US $78 million to just over US $10 million. Withthe implementation of PCMAM and the infusion of World Bank funds, thebudget quickly returned to almost the 1987 level and the number of casesdeclined slightly in 1990 and then increased and stabilized in 1991-1992.There was a sharp reduction in cases in 1993, despite a decreased budget,and after a rebound in 1994, stabilization and further decline in 1995-1996,when the number of positive slides fell back to the level of a decade earlierat the same or lower expenditure. The pattern is very similar for cases of P. falciparum alone, through 1988; from 1989, the falciparum epidemic was better contained than that of malaria in general, with little or no reboundin 1991-1992 and then a return to the level of 1983. This appears to reflectthe concentration of vector control in areas of high falciparum incidence and the consequent reduction of severity since the project adopted the revisedcontrol strategy. Methods: Estimating Illness, Lives and Disability-Adjusted Life Years Saved The malaria control program produced health gains partly by preventing cases, some of which would have ended in death while the rest producedonly short-term morbidity, and partly by treating cases, particularly by pre-venting deaths from P. falciparum infection. The estimate of health benefits from vector control begins with the projected incidence of cases of malariaand proceeds through the expected severity (share of falciparum in total cases) and lethality (case fatality rate) to derive the losses in deaths and mor-bidity that would have occurred in the absence of the program.254 Health Economics in Development T o facilitate comparison with other diseases which also cause both death and disability, the savings in deaths and episodes of illness are then con-verted to estimates of DALYs saved, using the same disability weights fornon-fatal conditions, the annual discount rate and the age weights as in theWHO-World Bank estimates of the global burden of disease (World Bank,1993; Murray, 1994, 1996). On a scale in which perfect health is 1.0 anddeath is zero, the health loss due to vivax illness is assigned a weight of 0.22 and the disability from non-fatal falciparum is given a weight of 0.375, reflecting the greater severity of falciparum morbidity. The future is dis- counted at a constant annual rate of 3%, which matters greatly for death(the number of discounted years lost to premature mortality is much lessthan the number of calendar years or potential years of life lost) but has noeffect on short-term morbidity. Finally, the value of life at each age, or theloss from illness or death at that age, follows an age-weighting functionwhich starts at zero, rises rapidly to a maximum of 1.525 at age 25, and thendeclines slowly and almost exponentially toward zero. An extensive expla-nation of these subject parameter values (Murray, 1996) and a sensitivityanalysis of the effects of variation in the discount rate and the age weights(Murray et al., 1994) have been published and are not reviewed here. Between 1980 and 1988 the observed coefficient of incidence (new cases per 100,000 population) rose steadily from 1,311 to 3,461, or from a littlemore than 1% of the population being sick with malaria each year, to almost3.5%. Since this increase was nearly linear, it was assumed that the sameconstant rate of increase would prevail in 1989-1996 as in 1980-1988,reaching a level of 5,611 or more than 5.5% of the population suffering anattack of malaria in one year. This is still well below what expert malariolo-gists consider to be saturation levels of incidence, and there is no evidencein the Brazilian data of a cyclic or other non-linear pattern. When incidenceis projected separately for each state in the Amazon Basin, the sum of pro-jections rises very rapidly in 1988-1991 before leveling off at a coefficientof more than 7,000 per 100,000 population, more than double the assump-tion used here for the region as a whole (Akhavan, 1997). In contrast to the projection, the observed coefficient declined in most years and never exceeded 3.5% of the population. Applying the differencebetween observed and projected incidence to the population of the AmazonBasin gives the number of cases estimated to have been prevented each year.This is the major source of uncertainty in the analysis; where treatment isconcerned, the only uncertainty is how many cases may have occurred andgone untreated, but that does not affect the cost-effectiveness of theCost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 255 program. For 1996, only half the cases treated or estimated to have been prevented are counted, because the project ended in June of that year andthe calculation of costs runs through only half the year. The observed severity, or share of malaria cases due to falciparum , reached a peak of 55% in 1986 and stayed in the range 0.53-0.55 from 1984to 1987. It is assumed that in the absence of the program, severity wouldhave remained at that peak; again, this number appears to be below the sat-uration equilibrium level. Falciparum parasites become available to infect vectors in only about 5.5 days and the incubation period before symptomsbegin is 12-14 days; for vivax parasites these intervals are, respectively, 8 and 11-12 days. In consequence of the shorter time before transmission is possible and the longer time when a person is infected but asymptomatic, the basicreproductive rate of falciparum is at least double that of vivax , which means that severity may saturate at around 60-65%. Finally, 10% of those sick with falciparum are assumed to die within a short period if not treated, while the other 90% of sufferers from falciparum and all those infected with P. vivax are assumed to be sick for 4 months (0.333 years) before recovering fully. This period is so short that discountingthe future at 3% makes almost no difference. Age-weighting, however,makes a substantial difference, because most deaths occur in adolescence orearly adulthood, when the weights used to calculate DALYs are near themaximum value of 1.525. The result is that the discounted and age-weightedinterval of illness is 0.433 years, longer than the calendar interval; being sickat those ages is worse than average, for any level of disability. Some DALYsmay also be lost in the future, because vivax malaria can cause relapses (Miller and Warrell, 1990). Since little is known about their frequency orseverity, except that they tend to become briefer and less severe, this possi-ble contribution to morbidity is ignored here and discussed briefly later. The probability of dying from falciparum malaria in the absence of any treatment is the third key parameter in the estimate of deaths prevented bythe control measures, and therefore in the cost-effectiveness of those meas-ures, and requires some discussion. Beneson (1997, p. 350) states that\"prompt treatment is essential, even in mild cases, since irreversible com-plications may appear suddenly; case-fatality rates among untreated chil-dren non-immune adults exceed 10% by a considerable margin\". Thereare few other published estimates of this rate, so several expert malariolo-gists were consulted (Mangabeira da Silva, 1996; Campbell, 1997; Collins,1997; Hoffman, 1997); all agreed that 10% is a conservative assumption,256 Health Economics in Development their own estimates ranging as high as 30-45%. Case-fatality rates in the range of 25 to 45% have been observed in Africa, but greater malnutritionand higher incidence among children, who are particularly susceptible, maymake malaria more lethal there than in Brazil. Death in 10% of untreatedfalciparum cases appears unlikely to overstate the disease risks or the cost- effectiveness of control measures in the Amazon Basin. Applying the disability weights (0.375 for falciparum and 0.22 for vivax ) to the interval of illness leads to a loss of 0.162 DALYs per non-fatal,untreated case of falciparum and 0.095 per case of vivax . The total health gain from preventing this temporary disability is some 226,000 DALYs.Although only 5.5% of malaria sufferers would die (10% of the 55%infected with falciparum ), they would account for a much greater health loss. The average age at death from malaria during this period was 14 years, atwhich age life expectancy under the life table assumptions employed (Mur-ray, 1994) is still 66 years. Age-weighting and discounting reduce this to36.27 DALYs lost per death. This value is not very sensitive to the assump-tion that life expectancy is as high as 66 years, because both discounting andage-weighting greatly reduce the importance of years far in the future.(Varying the assumption about life expectancy would, of course, affect othermeasures of health gain such as potential years of life lost.) The total healthgain from preventing deaths through vector control is about 3.65 millionDALYs, and the total gain from prevention of cases, including reducedmorbidity, is 3.88 million DALYs, as shown in the bottom line ofT able 13.3. Both because of mortality and because morbidity is more severe,nearly all this gain comes from controlling P . falciparum ; control of P . vivax accounts for less than 2% of the total. Estimating the DALY gains from treatment is simpler, because only the observed incidence and severity matter; these determine the number of suf-ferers from P. falciparum who, if not treated, would have a 10% chance of dying of the disease. Lethality with treatment is much lower; it reportedly declined from 0.72 to 0.40% between 1980 and 1988 and continued to fallto 0.15% in 1996. However, it is suspected that overall mortality is sub-stantially under-reported (Akhavan, 1996): some people die without gettingtreatment and some die even after receiving ambulatory care and thesedeaths may not be registered. The only study of under-reporting of hospi-tal deaths, undertaken in the state of Rond\u00f4nia in 1985 (Fiusa Lima and daSilva, 1988), found that actual deaths were 38.8% higher than reported. T otake account of this, it is conservatively assumed that on average through-out the period, 0.78% of treated falciparum cases would have died; thisapplies the 1985 under-reporting estimate to the average reported lethality in 1980-1988 (1.388 times the average of 0.40 and 0.72 is 0.78), with noallowance for subsequent decline. Lives saved by treatment are therefore the number of people sick with fal- ciparum , discounted to present value, times the difference between untreated and treated lethality, 9.22% (10.0 /H110020.78). Savings from reduced morbidity are similar to those gained by prevention, with the difference that it isassumed the typical patient would still suffer for 12.5 days, 10 before seekingtreatment and 2.5 days from the start of treatment to the cessation of symp-toms. (This is a very conservative assumption; if malaria victims received carewithin a few days, the health gain from treatment would be substantiallylarger.) This means that the interval of health gain drops from 0.333 to 0.299years, or 0.388 years when discounted and age-weighted. This does notapply to those falciparum sufferers saved from death, because they would probably have died quickly rather than being sick for four months. T ables 13.2 and 13.3 show how the estimates of health gains were con- structed, following the assumptions described earlier. The total number ofmalaria cases which occurred despite the control efforts was 4.1 million, or3.7 million in 1996 present value. The total number of cases prevented isestimated as 1.97 million, equivalent in present value to 1.83 million cases.Expressing the estimates in present value terms takes account of their occur-rence over a span of almost eight years, so as to match the discounted costestimates. The assumptions about severity and lethality imply that 101,000more people would have died of malaria had it not been for the preventivecomponent of the project and another 1.7 million would have been sick. The effectiveness of concentrating vector control in areas where P. falci- parum was most prevalent shows in the substantial reduction of reported fal- ciparum cases, while the number of P. vivax cases fluctuated with no trend. Under the assumption about lethality described above, treatment resultedin saving almost 130,000 lives and in reducing the morbidity caused by 1.27million cases of falciparum and 2.19 million cases of vivax . All together, some 5.5 million people benefited from the control program, either aspatients or because they did not get malaria. T able 13.3 summarizes the sav-ings in lives, cases and DALYs, according to the type of malaria and whetherthe gains came from prevention or treatment. The total gain measured in DALYs was 8.97 million: 5.08 million from treatment or 31% higher than the gain of 3.88 million DALYs fromprevention. Fully 93% of this health gain derived from preventing deaths,with almost no difference in the share between prevention and treatment.Cost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 257258Table 13.2 Estimated Cases, Lives and DALYs Saved by Preventing and Treating Malaria, 1989-1996.

In contrast to the results for preventing cases, where falciparum was nearly twice as important as vivax , the gains from reducing morbidity through treatment are almost equally divided between falciparum and vivax : this reflects the success of the program in reducing severity when it wouldotherwise have remained constant. Estimating Program Costs and Cost-Effectiveness The estimated health gains just described were derived from both preven- tion and treatment, so the costs attributable to malaria control include bothkinds of expenditures. Spending on prevention (vector control) was partlythrough the World Bank project (PCMAM), all of which occurred in theAmazon Basin, and partly through the NHF malaria control program,which operated in the whole country; it is estimated that 92% of thoseexpenditures occurred in the Amazon. Capital investment and non-salaryrecurrent expenditures (insecticides, travel costs and per diem for fieldworkers) of the NHF program were directly recorded and charged to theprogram. Labor costs are not budgeted to the control program; they wereestimated from the number and type of personnel needed for vector controloperations and salaries for each level of worker. Expenditure on treatment was partly for hospitalization and partly for ambulatory care and includes the cost of diagnosis. The number of hospi-talizations rose from 7,000 or less before 1987, to over 20,000 in 1988 andto a peak of over 53,000 in 1992. As treatment improved, the average lengthof stay fell abruptly from around 5.5 days before 1992, to about 4.4 daysfrom that year on. The number of ambulatory treatments rose from around30,000 in 1984-1985 to around 500,000 in 1992-1995. The cost of ambu-latory care was estimated by assuming that all reported but non-hospitalizedcases were treated, and applying to each patient the costs of four ambula-tory visits, two blood tests and the required medications, equal to US$18.70. 'Costs' of both hospital and ambulatory care are what the federalhealth system (SUS) paid for treatments, and understate true costs to theextent that they do not cover salaries of staff of the Ministry of Healthor NHF , or the capital cost of existing hospitals and clinics. (New invest-ments are included in the cost estimates.) SUS tariffs are believed to beCost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 261 significantly above or below true costs for many interventions, but the fact that it was possible to expand treatment rapidly in the program suggests thatfor malaria, federal payments were adequate to cover at least all recurrentcosts. Since the more severe hospitalized cases were almost entirely due tofalciparum , ambulatory patients were assumed to be infected with falciparum in only 44% of cases and with vivax in the rest. However, the cost of med- ication is only 8% of the cost of ambulatory treatment, so differences inwhich drugs are administered, reflecting differences in the distribution ofthe two kinds of malaria, have little effect on total costs. All financial information was initially reported in Brazilian currency and underwent three transformations to make the numbers comparable in pres-ent value. These are (i) conversion from Brazilian currency to US dollars inthe current year, using the average of the official buying and selling rates forthe dollar in that year; (ii) adjusting to 1996 US dollars by the US GDPdeflator for the current year; and (iii) discounting to 1996 present value at3% per year. These adjustments remove, so far as possible, the effect ofinflation in the US and the much more rapid inflation (prior to 1995) inBrazil, and express all values in constant US dollars of 1996 purchasingpower. The discount factor (3%) is the same used to discount numbers ofcases prevented or occurring, and therefore to discount the sums throughtimes of lives and DALYs saved. For recurrent expenditures (largely or entirely consumed in the same year as purchased), only these adjustments are necessary. Capital expendi-tures require two further adjustments. The first is to incorporate deprecia-tion over the useful life of the capital. This is assumed to be constant (lin-ear), with different lifetimes for the three categories; 25 years for buildings,10 years for vehicles and 5 years for equipment. The cost to the program ina given year is then the value of the capital investment divided by the use-ful life. Capital entirely depreciated during the project has its cost entirelyattributed to the program; capital with a useful life extending beyond 1996is charged to the program only for 1996 and prior years. The second adjust-ment is to take account of the opportunity cost of capital. In a stable eco-nomic environment this would be given by the rate of interest, but the highinflation in Brazil prior to stabilization in 1994 led to very high nominal andeven real interest rates. The US Prime Rate was therefore used as a betterapproximation (although possibly an underestimate) of the true opportunitycost of capital. All these steps are shown in the initial evaluation (Akhavan, 1996). T able 13.4 summarizes the final result: expenditures in discounted dollars of 1996262Table 13.4 Costs of the Malaria Control Program, 1989-1996 (Thousands of 1996 US$, Discounted at 3% for 1989-1995) and Cases Treated (Thousands of Hospital or Ambulatory Patients) CATEGORY 1989 1990 1991 1992 TOTAL 1989-1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 TOTAL in Brazil 263 value. Overall, from 1989 through the end of PCMAM in mid-1996, the malaria control program is estimated to have cost US $616.2 million,divided between US $525.6 million for vector control and related activitiesand US $90.5 million for treatment. About 30% of treatment cost was forhospitalization and 70% for ambulatory care. Preventive expendituresincluded US $48.8 million of investment in buildings, vehicles and equip-ment, US $78.6 million in salaries and US $398.2 million for all other oper-ating costs, including the costs of preparing and managing the project,insecticides, fuel, training and staff travel and per diem. Since the program is estimated to have prevented some 1.83 million cases of malaria (in present value), it also eliminated the need to treat thatnumber of episodes of disease. Assuming the same distribution betweenhospitalization and ambulatory care as in the cases actually treated, the unitcost per patient would have been the same, averaging US $22.19 over theperiod. This implies a total saving in treatment expenditures of US $41.5million. (Savings would of course be smaller, if some of the prevented caseswould not in fact have been treated had they occurred.) Subtracting thatfrom estimated actual expenditures leaves a net cost of the malaria controlprogram of US $574.6 million, and implies that for every dollar spent onprevention, seven cents were saved in treatment. Comparing the costs to the estimated saving in lives gives overall cost- effectiveness estimates of US $2,672 per life saved, or US $2,492, takingaccount of savings in treatment costs. These ratios ignore the much smallerhealth gains from reduced morbidity. If costs and gains are compared forprevention alone, the ratio is higher, because prevention accounted for thebulk of the costs but saved slightly less than half the total lives; the corre-sponding figures are US $5,200 per life saved without taking account oftreatment cost savings and US $4,808, counting those savings. In contrast,treatment appears to have cost only about US $700 to save a life. The lastthree columns of T able 13.5 summarize the results just presented for casesprevented and lives saved, which are based on the most plausible assump-tions discussed in the text and incorporated in T ables 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4.When the savings in morbidity are included and compared to lives saved,using DALYs as the composite measure, the result is an overall cost-effectiveness of US $69 per DALY (US $64, if based upon the cost net ofsavings in treatment). As with lives saved, the cost is higher for prevention,with ratios of US $136 and US $125, respectively, as savings are or are nottaken into account. With treatment, it cost less than US $18 to save onedisability-adjusted life year.Discussion Since the project helped to introduce a major change in malaria control strategy halfway through the period analyzed, T able 13.5 presents the cost-effectiveness results separately for 1989-1992 and for 1993-1996, consider-ing only lives saved by preventing or treating cases of falciparum . The same assumptions about incidence are used as for the analysis of the whole period1989-1996, because the control efforts in 1989-1992 do not appear to havehad much effect on incidence. The cost of saving a life by treatment rose25% between the early and the later years, presumably as a result of moreaggressive care (a higher share of patients hospitalized). However, the costof saving lives by prevention fell dramatically when preventive efforts weremore sharply focused against falciparum , from about US $13,000 to between US $2,000 and US $2,500. This improvement in efficiency did notcome at the cost of the absolute number of lives saved by preventing cases,which nearly tripled between one period and the other, while expenditureson prevention were cut almost in half. The overall result was to reduce theaverage cost of preventing a death from nearly US $4,000 to under US$2,000, or as low as US $1,500 when savings in treatment cost are consid-ered. (These savings increased in line with the gain in efficiency of preven-tive efforts.) This analysis validates the new control strategy and illustrateshow wasteful the preventive program previously was, which explains whythe epidemic had continued to expand. In the absence of the preventive effort, incidence was projected to rise lin- early and rather rapidly, which could lead to an over-estimate of the numberof cases prevented and therefore of lives saved by prevention. (This wouldnot, of course, affect the estimate of how many lives were saved by treatment.)By the same token, the assumption of increasing incidence could bias thecomparison between the early and later periods; higher projected numbers ofcases in the later years might magnify the apparent gains from the revisedstrategy. In T able 13.6, incidence is subjected to sensitivity analysis, to seehow much overall cost-effectiveness, and the contrast between 1989-1992and 1993-1996, depend on assumptions as to how many cases of malariawould have occurred in the absence of the project. Expenditures on the pro-gram are assumed to be the same as those actually recorded or estimated. Incidence is first assumed to remain constant at the level of 1988, or 3,361 per 100,000 population. So far as the period 1993-1996 is concerned,this is roughly equivalent to assuming that if the control strategy had notchanged, the earlier strategy would have maintained incidence constantat about the 1989-92 level, so that any gains in the later period would264 Health Economics in Development265Table 13.5 Cost-Effectiveness of Saving Lives from Falciparum , 1989-1992, 1993-1996 (Discounted Present Values).

The results of the comparison are that ifthere had been no danger of an expanding epidemic, only 49,000 liveswould have been saved by prevention and the cost of saving a life wouldhave been correspondingly much higher, US $10,731. Since fewer casesprevented would also mean smaller savings in treatment, only US $11.2million, there is little difference according as total or net cost is used. Themost striking result, however, is that since observed incidence hardlychanged in 1989-1992, very few lives would have been saved under the oldstrategy, and the cost per life saved would have been as high as US $74,000.Nearly all the gain would have come under the revised strategy, with a costper death prevented only slightly higher, around US $5,400, than with ris-ing incidence. The apparent improvement in cost-effectiveness therefore isnot an artifact of assuming that the epidemic would have continued to grow. All the indications are that, on the contrary, Brazil faced an explosive epi- demic of malaria and that the reorientation and concentration of preventionwas crucial in bringing it under control. Applying the projected incidence ineach state separately (Akhavan, 1997) would only strengthen this conclusion.If in the absence of the project the coefficient of incidence had risen steadilyto 7,500 (which is slightly slower than the sum of state-level projections), thepreventive component of the project would have saved 304,000 lives and theoverall cost-effectiveness would have been between US $1,503 and US$1,730 per life saved. Savings in treatment cost might also have been muchlarger, US $568.9 million, although it is less plausible that all this savingcould have been realized, since it would imply that Brazil had the capacity totreat an additional three million cases of falciparum malaria alone. Assuming very rapid growth in cases is also more favorable to the old strategy, whichwould have prevented 75,000 deaths during 1989-1992 even without reduc-ing observed incidence, bringing the cost per life saved down to about US$4,500. Even so, the revised strategy continues to appear more cost-effective,saving lives through preventing cases for only US $600 to US $800. Of the three crucial parameters in those calculations, only the severity or share of falciparum cases was both readily observable and nearly constant during the interval of the project. There is therefore no apparent reason toevaluate the project using different estimates of severity. The other impor-tant parameter is the case fatality rate, or lethality, for untreated falciparum , since that determines the health gains from both treatment and prevention.As indicated above, that rate was assumed to be 10%, but expert opinionsuggests that it could be substantially higher. T able 13.7 shows the outcome268Table 13.7 Cost-Effectiveness of Saving Lives from Falciparum , 1989-1996 (Discounted Present Values). Sensitivity Analysis: Untreated Rate 25 or 5% LETHALITY 25% LETHALITY 5% CONCEPT PREVENTION TREATMENT total cost 2,088 279 1,069 10,441 1,394 5,344 9,616 1,394 4,984Cost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 269 of assuming that 25% of untreated falciparum sufferers would have died: the number of lives saved increases to 593,000, with the result that the cost ofsaving a life falls to about US $1,000. Under this assumption, which may beimplausibly high for Brazil although not elsewhere, there would be largeincreases in the gains from both prevention and treatment, and no signifi-cant change in their relative cost-effectiveness. The exercise is repeatedwith a lethality rate of 5% which, holding constant the assumptions aboutexpenditure and cases prevented and treated, simply means one-fifth asmany lives saved and five times as high a cost per death prevented. Even so,most of the gain from controlling malaria comes from preventing deaths; ifthe case fatality rate were near zero, malaria would not be the dreadeddisease that it is. How much did changes in each of the three crucial parameters con- tribute to the total health gain from the project? Since mortality occursalmost exclusively when a person is infected with P. falciparum and dies of it, the probability of death can be expressed as D /H11005I/H11003S/H11003L, where I is incidence, S is severity and L is lethality. The program apparently suc-ceeded in reducing all three of these factors; how the total effect on mor-tality is partitioned among them depends on the assumptions about whatwould have happened to each factor. Comparing deaths actually registered(indicated by R) with the number of deaths to be expected (E) in the absenceof the program as estimated in T ables 13.2 and 13.3, using the most plausi-ble assumptions, D R/H20862DE/H11005(IR/H20862IE)(SR/H20862SE)(LR/H20862LE). Expressing this SE) /H11001 (log LR/H11002log LE). The share of mortality reduction attributable to reduction in incidence is then (log IR/H11002log IE)/H20862(log DR/H11002log DE) and similarly for reductions in severity and lethality. T able 13.8 shows this calculation. The coefficient of incidence in 1996 was only 2,388 per 100,000 popula- tion, against the projected level of 5,611. Case treatment has not beenshown to have any major effect on transmission (Miller and Warrell, 1990),so the reduced incidence is probably due entirely to vector control.However, early, widespread and aggressive treatment of falciparum in the Amazon may have reduced the likelihood of mosquitoes acquiring new270 Health Economics in Development infections and thereby contributed to reducing severity, which at 0.29 falci- parum , was barely half the expected level of 0.55. It is not known what level of treatment coverage might be required for a significant effect. Observed lethality among those treated had been declining slowly for some years before the project began and was expected to reach 0.33% by1996; instead, it fell to 0.15%. (Data on actual mortality are incomplete, butsince it is only the ratio of lethalities that matters for this decomposition, aconstant proportional underestimate makes no difference to the result. Ifhowever the project led to reduced under-reporting, then the apparentincrease in cases and deaths is overstated and the project was correspond-ingly more effective in containing the epidemic than it appears.) Combining these factors suggests that mortality in 1996 was only 10% as high as would have been expected: 191 deaths instead of 1,872 (coeffi-cient of mortality of 1.04 per 100,000 population instead of 10.18). Thismeans that 37.42% of the saving in mortality was attributable to reducedincidence, 28.04% to the decline in severity and 34.54% to improvementsin survival. This decomposition gives great weight to incidence, because itwas expected to keep on rising in the absence of the project. Lethality isgiven less weight because it was expected to continue declining slowly.Nonetheless, reducing the likelihood of death once people were infectedwith falciparum seems to have accounted for more than one-third of the total saving in lives.Table 13.8 Effects of Reduced Incidence, Severity and Lethality on Mortality Reduction COEFFICIENT SEVERITYOF INCIDENCE/ (SHARE OF P.

Comparison to projections Observed 1988 3461 0.51 0.0040 7.0604Observed 0.2804 reductionCost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 271 The same calculation can be performed comparing actual levels in 1996 not with those projected for that year, but with the starting point of 1988.This amounts to assuming that the three factors would have maintainedtheir 1988 levels, in the absence of the project. Over the eight years, inci-dence fell from 3,461 to 2,388 per 100,000; severity from 0.51 to 0.29; from 0.40 to 0.15 (constant proportional under-reporting of deathswould not affect the ratio of these rates and therefore would not change thelogarithmic differences). These figures imply that deaths per 100,000 pop-ulation should have fallen to 14.7% of the 1988 level. The number of deathsis registered only through 1995, so it is not known whether the death ratein 1996 matched this decline exactly. T able 13.8 shows the coefficient ofmortality consistent with these levels of incidence, severity and lethality; itfell from 7.06 to 1.04. On this comparison, reduced incidence accounted for only 19.4% of the reduction in deaths, decreases in severity for 29.5% and improved survivalfor the largest share, 51.2%. As indicated above in the methodological dis-cussion, these assumptions are much less plausible than those used in T ables13.2 and 13.3; there is no reason to believe that incidence, which had beenincreasing dramatically before the project started, would not have contin-ued rising. Even with assumptions that give less weight to prevention, how-ever, reducing overall malaria incidence and particularly cutting down theshare of falciparum cases, accounts for almost half the saving in lives. The fact that treatment appears to have been more cost-effective, on average,than prevention, does not reduce the importance of vector control as a pub-lic health measure. And both assumptions about what would have happenedto incidence coincide in showing the value of concentrating preventiveefforts against falciparum , since reduced severity accounted for close to 30% of the overall mortality reduction. Morbidity results when a person is infected by P. vivax , or is infected by P. falciparum but does not die. The probability of non-fatal morbidity is then M/H11005I/H11003(1/H11002S)/H11001I/H11003S (1/H11002L), which is equal to M /H11005I/H11003(1/H11002(S/H11003L)). Reducing incidence obviously makes the same contribution to lessened morbidity as it does to reduced mortality, whatever is assumed about inci-dence in the absence of the project, but the effects of reduced severity andlethality interact and cannot be decomposed as for deaths. In fact, reducinglethality increases morbidity, if survivors are sick for a longer interval than those who die. In any case, since morbidity from falciparum is more severe272 Health Economics in Development than that from vivax , simply adding the probabilities of being sick from one or the other does not capture the expected health damage. T able 13.8 there-fore does not partition the reduction in morbidity among the three factors. In summary, the most plausible estimate of the total gain from both vec- tor control and treatment is 1.83 million cases prevented, 230,000 livessaved and a total saving of 8.97 million DALYs. This health benefit isdivided about equally between prevention and treatment (43 to 57%), butvery unequally between mortality and disability (93 to 7%) and, because fal- ciparum causes nearly all malaria deaths, between falciparum and vivax (97 to 3%). This last distinction is an underestimate of the gains from control-ling vivax , to the extent that this form of malaria causes relapses in the years immediately following the initial attack. Such r elapses usually become less severe with time. T aking account of their contribution to morbidity, therefore,would probably not raise the gains from vivax control above 5% of total health benefit. (This estimate corresponds to supposing relapses in three successiveyears, of the same duration as the initial attack but with the disability weightdeclining linearly from 0.22 to 0.02 as each relapse is less severe than the onebefore.) With respect to mortality versus morbidity, malaria resembles some other diseases such as measles, which present a risk of death but seldomcause long-term disability among survivors. It is clear a priori that most of the health gain from a control program will come from preventing deaths,but whether that will be more easily or cheaply accomplished by preventingcases or by treating them, depends on the particular setting and on how wellprevention is focused. The experience of the Amazon Basin program alsoshows that the choice is not only between preventing cases in general, andtreating, since there are much greater gains to preventing a case of onestrain of malaria than of the other. This is evident in the substantial contri-bution to reduced mortality of reductions in the share of falciparum infec- tions. Previous estimates of the cost-effectiveness of malaria controlprograms have been made mostly in Africa and Asia and have shown a widerange of costs per DALY which depend strongly in each country on thecase-fatality rate (Najera et al., 1993, T able 13.3). The cost estimated here, US $64-69 per DALY, is low compared to the majority of these calcula-tions. It falls at about the median cost-effectiveness of 52 interventions,both public health and clinical, for which some estimate could be made atthe time of the project (Jamison, 1993, T able 1A.6). Only a few earlierestimates concern malaria programs that include both vector control andchemotherapy, and from the available information it appeared that caseCost-Effective Malaria Control in Brazil 273 treatment was generally much more costly per year of healthy life saved than vector control measures (Jamison, 1993, T ables 1A.3 and 1A.5). Theresults for the Amazon Basin suggest, in contrast, that a large share of thetotal health gain can be achieved by treating patients, and that this need notlead to a very high cost per DALY. In fact, treatment can be a significantlycheaper way to save lives and healthy years. This will be true in particularwhere P . falciparum is prevalent and where frontier conditions, both eco- logical and social, limit the effectiveness of vector control by insecticidespraying and fogging unless it is sharply targeted. It is easy to wasteresources on prevention, with consequent low cost-effectiveness, andreducing that waste by concentrating efforts yields a very high gain. In thecase of the Amazon Basin, this is evident in the better cost effectiveness in1993-1996, after the change in control strategy, than during 1989-1992,when preventive efforts were more diffuse and cost much more per lifesaved. The most cost-effective control efforts will probably always includeboth components, in proportions that depend on the distribution and sever-ity of malaria.

For help- ful comments on a previous paper derived from this study, thanks are due Poverty, and Food Prices Research on food consumption and nutritional status in Brazil, based pri- marily on the large, nationwide Estudo Nacional da Despesa Familiar(ENDEF) survey of 1974-75, appears to have established that protein-calorie malnutrition is widespread in the country, and that it is dueprincipally to poverty rather than cultural or educational factors. 1Dietary knowledge and habits do help account for malnutrition, especially amongvery young children, but many families' incomes are simply too low to pur-chase an adequate diet, even if nutrients were obtained at minimal cost andwere adequately distributed among family members. Both malnutrition andpoverty are concentrated in northeastern Brazil and are found among urbansquatter populations as well as in rural areas. Under these conditions, the prices of basic foodstuffs are of fundamen- tal importance: incomes are low only in relation to prices. If the poor pay Co-authored with Osmil Galindo.

What may be called the \"ideology ofmalnutrition\" in Brazil includes a number of hypotheses about food pricesand their role in malnutrition and poverty, 2some of which are examined in the research reported here. These hypotheses include the following: 1. Food prices are systematically high because of a combination of inade- quate storage facilities, high transport costs, and monopsony or mono-poly in food marketing, which exploits both farmers and retailers andinvolves a large number of intermediaries. 2. Poor consumers typically patronize the most expensive retailers, the very small establishments ( varejistas ) whose costs are high because of small volume, shortage of working capital, and ease of exploitation by middle-men who may be the only source of credit as well as of foodstuffs. Theseestablishments are presumed not to compete in price with larger andmore modern retailers, such as supermarkets and the \"mini-markets\"that resemble supermarkets but offer a more limited range of foods, usu-ally excluding those needing refrigeration. 3. If the poor patronize these high-cost retailers, it is presumably because there are compensating advantages. Location is one: the small retailersare widely distributed in poor neighborhoods, saving their customerslengthy trips to the better-off neighborhoods where supermarkets tendto locate. T wo other potential advantages are the possibility of buying oncredit and of buying in fractional amounts: a handful of rice instead of afull kilogram, or as much manioc flour as the customer has cash to buy. 4. If the poor customers could buy their food for less, without giving up the advantages that compensate them for high prices, they would buy appre-ciably more food, particularly calorie-rich basic foodstuffs such as rice,beans, sugar, and manioc flour. Thus lower food prices would reducemalnutrition and would not simply constitute an income transfer to bespent on other goods. These hypotheses range from the most general (that all food prices are higher than they should be) to the most specific (that in some transactions,the poor pay more because they receive a service without which they couldnot buy at all). The first two hypotheses are partly contradictory, differing asDo the Poor in Brazil Pay More for Food? 279 to whether all or only part of the food marketing system is inefficient. And the third hypothesis is necessary to explain why, if the second one is true, thehigh-cost small retailers have not all been driven out of business. Some suchhypothesis is necessary to sustain the view that poor consumers are rationalin their food buying and that their problem is poverty rather than ignoranceor foolishness. The fourth hypothesis is also \"pro-consumer\" in this sense. T ogether, these ideas about food prices suggest the importance of several variables: location (within individual towns or cities and between one townand another), wholesaling practices (number and type of intermediaries andconditions of purchase by retailers), type of retailer and conditions of sale tofinal consumers (including the provision of credit and the prevalence of frac-tional purchases). There has been rather little research on these issues, andmuch public policy seems simply to have taken one or another hypothesis forgranted. The government has invested heavily in roads and in food storageand marketing facilities in order to reduce food costs, with apparent success, 3 although there has been no differential favorable effect on the poor. All cus-tomers appear to have benefited equally from increases in market efficiency.The second, third, and fourth hypotheses together are used to justify a sub-sidy of 11 basic foodstuffs, the Projecto de Abastecimento B\u00e1si-cos em \u00c1reas de or PROAB, which operates only in poor neigh-borhoods, only in large cities of the Northeast, and only through thetraditional small retailers. The government's defense of this program, how-ever, does not rest on estimates of high price elasticities, but on the greaterease and lower cost of administration of public assistance when individualclients need not be identified and on the \"respect\" for consumers' preferencesimplicit in allowing them to spend their food money as they please ratherthan giving them fixed amounts of specified foodstuffs, as occurs in two othermajor nutrition programs. 4The subsidy program has operated since 1978; starting in 1985, the government launched a much larger program that sim-ilarly operates only through small retailers but that aims to lower pricespurely by rationalizing the market, without using subsidies. 5 There are estimates, based on the 1974-75 ENDEF nationwide house- hold survey data,6that price elasticities for basic foodstuffs among the poor are in fact very high, so that even small price reductions would have sub-stantial consequences for consumption. 7More recent research with the same data suggests that these estimates are biased because they are aggre-gated over income levels and over regions of Brazil where food habits dif-fer. Disaggregated estimates for the Northeast alone yield appreciablylower price elasticities and higher income elasticities. 8It remains true,280 Health Economics in Development however, that the highest price elasticities characterize carbohydrates, so that rice and sugar are the foods for which a subsidy is most justified. These previous investigations consider the effects of public policy on the general level of food prices, or the supposed effects on consumption and nutri-tion of reducing those prices, but they do not directly confront the hypothe-sis that the poor pay more for their food than they need to, or that high foodprices are associated with particular retailers or particular selling practices. Apartial exception is a study of food marketing in Curitiba, in southern Brazil,which found that poor consumers are not tied to the traditional varejistas but also patronize supermarkets and other vendors in search of the lowest prices. 9 In part, the scarcity of relevant research is due to the attention to temporalchanges in food prices, which were very rapid until the monetary reform andprice stabilization plan that were introduced in March 1986. During 1985, forexample, the national consumer price index maintained by the InstitutoBrasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica, referring to households with incomes ofbetween one and five minimum wages, rose by 228%. The consumer priceindex for Recife increased by essentially the same amount (230%). Food pricesincreased slightly faster than other prices during the year. Price data are col-lected only in major cities, which limits spatial comparisons to those betweenstates or regions of Brazil, and while data are obtained from different types ofretail establishments, these are not published separately. All price index datarefer to cash purchases of standard quantities of foodstuffs, so they do notallow any test of the third hypothesis stated above. The June 1985 Northeast Food Price Survey T o study the other dimensions of basic food prices, a survey was conducted in June 1985 by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Joaquim Nabuco (FUNDAJ), which pub-lishes the monthly consumer price index and other economic indicators forthe metropolitan area of Recife, with financial support from the InstitutoNacional de Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o (INAN) of the Ministry of Health andwith technical assistance from the Pan American Health Organization. T oreduce the effects of inflation on price differences between towns surveyedat different times, all prices were collected in a 2-week interval. June turnedout to be the lowest inflation month of 1985 in the Recife price index, withan increase of only 5.41%, versus a monthly average that year of 10.46%.Thus, during the fieldwork, food prices probably rose, on average, no morethan 3%. Price differences of 10% or more (our limit for economic impor-tance) therefore are most unlikely to reflect only inflation. The survey wasDo the Poor in Brazil Pay More for Food? 281 conducted in three state capitals (Recife, Fortaleza, and T eresina), six medium-sized cities in those and three other states, and 10 small towns, oneor two in each of the six states. A total of 498 retail establishments were sur-veyed, of which the majority (295) are small outlets in poor neighborhoods.In the three state capitals (where some of these are in neighborhoods servedby the PROAB subsidy) and in the large and medium-sized cities, neigh-borhoods classified as non-poor were also surveyed (in the small towns, nosuch distinction is possible). T able 14.1 shows the distribution of establish-ments by city size, neighborhood, and type, including small numbers ofsupermarkets, mini-markets, and stalls or booths in traditional public mar-kets or \"fairs.\" The sample of outlets is not proportional to the numbers ofdifferent types of establishments so as to include as many supermarkets andmini-markets as possible (typically all those existing in the smaller towns).Neither is the sample proportional to volume of purchases; in the absenceof a household survey, there is no information on where different classes ofconsumers shop. Consequently, price averages across different types ofestablishments are not reported here, as they would need to be weighted.

For three foods\u2014rice, beans, and manioc flour\u2014priceswere also obtained for the amount that would fill a cup supplied by the inter-viewer. This provided a standard measure for less-than-standard-packageamounts. For these and some other foods\u2014sugar, spaghetti, dried beef, soy-bean oil, margarine, and coffee\u2014the vendor was also asked the weight andprice of the smallest quantity he would be willing to sell. Both of theseapproaches attempt to measure the unit cost of fractional purchases. Data werealso obtained on the vendor's suppliers, the criteria used to set prices, the clien-tele served, the number of employees and of unpaid workers, and the existenceof other costs of doing business (rent, utilities, etc.). Prices were collected forcredit purchases, along with the criteria for setting them, but since credittransactions often depend on personal acquaintance and are settled in thefuture, the interviewers could not check the accuracy of the reported prices. The FUNDAJ has published a full description of the questionnaire, sam- ple, and field procedures, together with a large selection of mean pricesclassified by various dimensions. 10We have analyzed a subset of these price comparisons, looking particularly for differences that are both economicallyimportant (10% or more) and statistically significant. 11The principal con- clusion to emerge from that analysis is the remarkable homogeneity ofprices. Few price differences are large, and fewer still are statistically signif-icant. The latter restriction, of course, reflects the very small number ofobservations in some categories. If there are only two or three supermar-kets, a supermarket/ varejista comparison may yield large errors of estimate, but it might still make a significant economic difference to the consumerwhere he or she shopped. The small number of observations also make itimpossible to analyze some of the foods considered, particularly the canneditems, and here we consider only 14 foods. The next two sections displaysome further findings, including some derived from regression analysis, andthe final section considers the implications of our findings in the light of thehypotheses described above. Town Size, Neighborhood, and Establishment Type Since traditional small retailers not affiliated with the subsidy program are by far the commonest outlets in the survey, comparisons across towns arelimited to these outlets. These results appear in T ables 14.2 and 14.3.Table 14.2 Mean Prices, in June 1985 Cruzeiros, of Selected Basic Foods by Municipality for Small Retailers Not Affiliated with Subsidy Program MANIOC POWDERED DRIED CANNED SOYBEAN RICE SUGAR FLOUR CORNMEAL SPAGHETTI BREAD BEANS MILK BEEF SARDINES EGGS OIL MARGARINE COFFEE MUNICIPALITY (KG) (KG) (KG) (500 G) (500 G) (50 G) (KG) (200 G) (KG) (125 G) (DOZ) (900 ML) (250 G) (250 G) Metropolitan 283 (continued )Table 14.2 continued MANIOC POWDERED DRIED CANNED SOYBEAN RICE SUGAR FLOUR CORNMEAL SPAGHETTI BREAD BEANS MILK BEEF SARDINES EGGS OIL MARGARINE COFFEE MUNICIPALITY (KG) (KG) (KG) (500 G) (500 G) (50 G) (KG) (200 G) (KG) (125 G) (DOZ) (900 ML) (250 G) (250 G) Small towns: Lagoa da Canoa 2,371 2,400 4,922 2,050 4,628 284Do the Poor in Brazil Pay More for Food? 285 Comparisons among types of retailers are limited to large and midsize cities, respectively, in T ables 14.4 and 14.5, and all three variables aretreated together in T able 14.6. All these results refer to the standard pack-ages or quantities, commonly a kilogram or a regular fraction (one-half,one-fourth, one-fifth, or one-eighth) thereof. When mean prices are shown separately for all 19 towns (T able 14.2), there is a great deal of geographic variation. The highest price exceeds the lowest bymore than 70% for rice and for bread, by 100% for manioc flour, 160% forcornmeal, and over 200% for beans. The only pattern visible in these large dif-ferences is that traditional foodstuffs produced in the interior of the Northeast(all of the above except for bread) seem to vary much more in price than moremodern\u2014and often more highly industrialized-products, particularlyspaghetti, powdered milk, and soybean oil, which tend to be imported fromother parts of the country. The lowest price for each of the traditional food-stuffs always occurs in one of the small towns and the highest price in a largercity. Thus, for these products, local supply seems to be very important. This pattern persists when prices are averaged across towns in each size class, as T able 14.3 shows.

T able 14.4 exam-ines this question within the three metropolitan areas, and T able 14.5within the six medium-size cities. T able 14.4 shows clearly that retailerswho participate in the PROAB subsidy have systematically lower pricesthan those who do not, indicating that nonaffiliated retailers cannot or atleast do not match the subsidized prices. For some products\u2014rice, sugar,cornmeal, dried beef, eggs, and soybean oil\u2014the unsubsidized metropoli-tan area price was higher than that in the small settlements. This can beseen by comparing the last column of T able 14.3 with the first twocolumns of T able 14.4. This result does not mean, however that the fullamount of the subsidy is passed on to the consumer, since the final pricedifference may be smaller than the subsidy. Because of difficulties infinancing and managing the subsidy program, final subsidized prices haveoften been based on needlessly high wholesale prices, so that the partici-pating retailers have been selling at or above the prices of supermarketsand mini-markets. This was particularly true in 1984, as studies in Recifeand throughout the PROAB system have shown, and the problem per-sisted in 1985. T ypically, less than half the subsidy is actually transferredfor at least one-fourth of the time. 12 According to T able 14.4, unsubsidized retailers have generally been able to compete with more modern outletssuch as mini-markets. In fact, where there are significant price differences(for sugar and cornmeal) it is the varejistas whose prices are lower. A similar pattern obtains in the midsize cities, where there is no subsidy(T able 14.5). The small retailers are more expensive for a few products(cornmeal, spaghetti, and coffee), and the lowest price for beans was insupermarkets, but generally the varejistas compete with more modern establishments and sometimes they have the lowest prices (manioc flour). T able 14.6 tests simultaneously for price differences according to city size, type of neighborhood, and type of retailer, comparison being made tosmall towns, non-poor neighborhoods, and traditional markets or fairs. Theresults confirm the tendency for prices of traditional foodstuffs to be higherin the larger towns (higher still in the largest cities, for sugar and cornmeal),to be lower in subsidized shops, and otherwise not to differ among outlets.They also show some tendency for prices to be lower in poor neighbor-hoods, even when these are not reached by the subsidy. Overall, there is noevidence that the poor pay more than their non-poor neighbors simplyDo the Poor in Brazil Pay More for Food? 289 because of where they live or where they shop, at least so long as they pay in cash and purchase the standard amount of a foodstuff. Credit and Fractional Purchases As was indicated earlier, it is difficult to be sure of the price in a credit trans- action; it would be necessary to record what a real customer pays when set-tling accounts with a retailer and to know for how long credit had beenextended. Such data cannot be collected on a single visit by an interviewerwho is not a regular client. The most that was possible in this survey was toclassify sales as cash or credit and compare the prices declared by the ven-dor. 13This comparison shows significant differences only for rice, beans, and manioc flour, and for these products the declared cash price is higher,not lower, implying a negative nominal interest rate and a still more nega-tive real rate. The comparison is not, however, limited to the same estab-lishments and is not controlled for city size, so there is no evidence thatindividual vendors subsidize credit sales. We are on firmer ground in considering the other service traditional small retailers provide their customers, namely, selling fractional amountsof a product. First, prices were recorded for a cupful of rice, of beans, andof manioc flour, which weighed much less than a kilogram. The results inT able 14.6 show that these prices also went up in larger cities and down insubsidized stores, but because the quantity was smaller the price differenceswere also smaller, and in roughly the same proportion. In the case of beans,a cupful sold for more on average in an unsubsidized store in a poorneighborhood than in a non-poor neighborhood, but the difference is notsignificant. The regression coefficients do not suggest that unit prices aresystematically higher when a cupful rather than a kilogram is bought. The second approach to fractional-purchase prices was to estimate the regression: P/H11005 b 0/H11001 b1Q/H11001 b2Q2, where Qis the smallest amount a retailer would agree to sell, and Pis what he charged for it. If the amount has no effect on the unit price, then b0 andb2should be zero, and b1should equal the price per gram of the stan- dard quantity (or the price per milliliter for cooking oil). If insteadcustomers pay more to buy in fractional amounts, then both b 0and b2 should be positive, while b1can be of either sign. The results are shown in290 Health Economics in Development T able 14.7 for all vendors who agreed to fractional sales and also for vare- jistas only, who were always the great majority of such vendors. For every product except soybean oil, the hypothesis is confirmed that fractionalsales are charged the same price per gram as the standard package. Thecoefficient of quantity is indistinguishable from the mean price in T able14.3, and the other two coefficients are not distinct from zero, except forthe quadratic for dried beef. Only when buying oil in small amounts doesthe customer face a higher unit price, perhaps because the remaining oil inan open bottle or can goes rancid quickly (the Northeast climate is veryhot), whereas this does not happen so easily to rice or other dry productswhen the package is opened.Table 14.7 Quadratic Regression of Price versus Quantity for Fractional Purchases of Eight Basic Foods, in all Establishments and Small Retail Outletsonly PRODUCT AND QUANTITY (QUANTITY)2 ESTABLISHMENT CONSTANT (GRAMS) X 10/H110025 Rice: All establishments 43.1 flour: All establishments 7.50 /H110028.18 (38.3) Small retailers only 26.1 (32.3) (.24)* Spaghetti: All establishments 413 119 All establishments 9.55 aMinimal quantity retailers. *Distinct zero, with 95% confidence.**Distinct from zero, with 90% confidence.Do the Poor in Brazil Pay More for Food? 291 Conclusions and Implications The results presented here do not directly confront the first hypothesis, described in Section 1, that food prices are systematically higher than theyneed to be, but they nonetheless cast doubt on it. The hypothesis of ineffi-ciency, if true, should apply particularly to the traditional small retailerswho have no control over the wholesale purchase, transport, or storage offoodstuffs. Supermarkets, because they bypass many intermediaries andtake on many wholesaler's functions, should then achieve lower prices thanretailers bound to an exploitative or wasteful supply system. The fact thatsupermarket and varejista prices do not differ greatly or systematically makes it appear, then, that the food marketing system functions fairly well.An important corollary of this conclusion is that there is probably little orno room to lower food prices by public intervention in that system: the gov-ernment's belief that it can bring down prices to consumers simply by act-ing as a wholesaler, which is the assumption of the Programa de Abasteci-mento Popular (PAP), is almost surely wrong. Subsidies will be required,explicitly, and the experience with the existing subsidy program indicatesconsiderable inefficiency in achieving increased food consumption. The principal conclusions we reach concern hypotheses 2 and 3: there is little or no evidence that in patronizing traditional small retailers, con-sumers are paying too much for their food, and this is true even when allow-ing for their practice of buying on credit or in smaller than standardamounts. The varejist a typically does not appear to be exploiting his cus- tomers nor to be charging them significantly for services they cannot getelsewhere. Thus, persuading poor customers to buy elsewhere, or to paycash, or to buy in standard amounts would have little or no effect on theirfood bills or their consumption. Only by some more substantial step, suchas taking over the retailing function through cooperatives, could they ben-efit. This finding reinforces the largely ideological argument that poor con-sumers are economically rational and that they are not to blame for theirpoverty and malnutrition. They may be of course still be nutritionally irra-tional, buying cheaply but not buying well. 14It also means that in operat- ing a subsidy program through varejistas , the government is not necessarily supporting high-cost retailers and thus reducing the benefits of the subsidy. So far as urban-rural differences are concerned, we find that for certain traditional staples, the rural poor generally face lower prices, which does notoccur for more modern and more processed foods. This may help explain thefinding that at a given income level, the rural poor suffer less protein-calorie292 Health Economics in Development malnutrition than their urban counterparts\u2014their real incomes are in fact slightly higher.15This advantage is partly offset by the smaller variety of foods available in rural areas and small towns of the interior, as shown inT able 14.2. And this narrower diet probably contributes to the higher preva-lence of some specific dietary deficiencies, such as vitamin A shortage, in ruralareas. 16The rural advantage in prices is also offset by the subsidy program for those urban poor who live in the areas it serves. The subsidy program is,in this sense, working in the right direction, acting to lower prices to con-sumers where they are naturally highest, although this is a geographic differ-ence rather than one that is due to the high costs of particular outlets. If the evidence in favor of these hypotheses is so weak\u2014that is, if price differences seem to contribute so little to poverty and malnutrition\u2014howdid such hypotheses ever come to be part of the ideology about this issue inBrazil? The question is of practical importance, because very large sumshave been spent and continue to be spent on food and nutrition programsinspired by this belief. 17If the suppositions are misguided, then some of that expenditure is wasteful or ineffective. We can find three possible explanations for the hold these ideas have on the thinking about malnutrition in Brazil. The first is casual empiricism, orscattered and anecdotal evidence that the hypotheses are correct. At a suffi-ciently detailed level, such as comparing one small town with another, thereis in fact much price variation. The same is doubtless true of some detailedcomparisons of cash versus credit prices, of some fractional-purchase costs (aswe find for soybean oil), and of some comparisons among establishments. Ittakes only a hasty generalization to go from such observations to a belief thatthe poor systematically pay more for their food. Such careless generalizationmay be especially easy in a time of rapid inflation, because when all prices arechanging, comparisons are difficult, and when the relative price of food is infact rising, inflation is systematically more burdensome to the poor. The trouble with this explanation is that casual empiricism might just as easily have made the opposite observation, seeing only small price differencesin general, which often serve to benefit rather than work against the poor.And casual observation, even if correct, does not explain why these hypo-theses were so thoroughly accepted and incorporated into public policydespite the flimsiness of the evidence. This suggests a second explanation,which depends more on theory than on facts. It is theoretically plausible tosuppose that a market characterized by thousands of small producers and ofsmall retailers could be dominated by middlemen, who would supply scarecredit as well as transportation and storage services; that partly for this reasonDo the Poor in Brazil Pay More for Food? 293 and partly because of small scale, such small retailers would necessarily have to charge more than supermarkets; and that consumers might nonethelesspatronize them, obtaining such facilities (which in themselves would appearto raise costs) as purchases on credit or in small amounts. Unless confrontedby firm evidence to the contrary, all these propositions could seem self-evident. And this consistency could even discourage the search for evidenceby making it seem unnecessary. Investigation would then be directed to theconsequences of public food and nutrition programs rather than to their sup-positions, and this seems to be what occurred. Neither the explanation via casual empiricism nor that based on theoreti- cal plausibility takes any account of the temporal dimension of the issue. Ourprice data refer to mid-1985, but the hypotheses under attack were formu-lated and accepted in the mid-1970s. The INAN launched its first nutritionprogram in 1974 and its subsidy program in 1978; the chief source of data onmalnutrition refers to 1974-75, and the most influential analyses of thosedata were completed in 1977-79. During this period, no one collected oranalyzed price data of the sort presented here. It may be that a third explana-tion is correct: the hypothesis that the poor paid too much for their foodcould have been valid, or more nearly valid, a decade or more ago than it istoday. If that is the case, we are not showing that the ideology of malnutri-tion was wrong from the start on this question, but only that is mistaken now. It is not hard to imagine how the reality could have changed while beliefs did not. On the one hand, public investments in infrastructure have reducedtransport and storage costs, thereby reducing price dispersion. Public pro-grams of price support may have had the same effect. On the other hand,there has been a great expansion of supermarkets and mini-markets in thelast 10 years. These are no longer confined to rich neighborhoods in largercities but have penetrated poorer neighborhoods and even some smalltowns in the interior. The buying habits of poor consumer shave shiftedaccordingly, and the traditional retailers have had to compete or go out ofbusiness. There is in fact anecdotal evidence that many of them have disap-peared, and that there has been an even greater reduction in the other tra-ditional vendors to the poor, the fairs and markets composed of many smallretailers, each specializing in a few products. For those varejistas who remain in business, offering credit and allowing fractional purchases may bea way not to exploit customers, but simply to retain them, without chargingmore for those services. Anecdotal evidence suggests that both credit andfractional sales are less prevalent than they used to be. (This trend is partlyoffset by some supermarkets allowing credit or fractional sales to regular294 Health Economics in Development customers.) In almost every respect, the market for food has become more modern and more homogeneous. Part of this change is the shift to moreindustrialized foods, typically produced outside the Northeast, which varyless in price than the traditional rice, beans, and manioc flour. All thesechanges started in south-central Brazil and may have begun to affect theNortheast only within the last decade. Consequently, there seems to be little scope for benefiting poor con- sumers without cost to the government by persuading them to buy at dif-ferent outlets or in large amounts, or by improving the competitivenessof the food market and reducing price dispersion. Both of these beneficialtransformations are already well advanced. This emphatically does notmean that price differences do not matter to food consumption and thusto nutritional status. It means only that the reduction of food prices forthe poor requires subsidies, at considerable public cost. We also find thatsubsidies have less of a role to play than has been believed in \"correcting\"regional price differences. The question is whether a given cost in theform of a subsidy yields more or less nutritional benefit than the sameexpense in a program of direct distribution of foodstuffs, and here the evi-dence for Brazil is incomplete and inconclusive. 18Comparisons of sub- sidy and donation programs do not show a clear superiority of either; stillless clear is how far both types of programs could be replaced by meas-ures to generate more income for the poor or to reduce the cost of grow-ing food, relative to the incomes they now have. What is clear is that pricedifferences now play only a minor part in explaining the country's burdenof malnutrition. Notes 1.

Introduction Among Latin American countries, Brazil has undoubtedly had the most var- ied and extensive experience with food and nutrition programs meant toimprove food consumption and nutritional status of the children of poorfamilies (1). In contrast to many countries where such programs havedepended on foreign aid, usually in the form of donated foodstuffs, Brazil'sprograms have been financed almost entirely from internal sources; and in Reprinted, with permission, from \"Do Nutrition Programs Make a Difference? The Case of Brazil,\" International Journal of Health Services 20(4), 1990. This is atranslation of an article originally prepared at the invitation of the journal Cuader- nos de Econom\u00eda, published by the Institute of Economics of the Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.298 Health Economics in Development contrast to the experience of some countries such as Chile, a variety of approaches have been tried, in circumstances of competition among publicagencies and among different diagnoses or explanations of malnutrition,which give rise to different ways to attack it. The Pan American Health Organization has been studying this experience since 1983, with the objectives of giving technical assistance to Brazil and ofderiving lessons applicable to other countries. The study began with a com-parison of two approaches-a subsidy to basic foodstuffs versus direct distri-bution to beneficiaries-and then expanded to cover five programs thatoperated during some part of the period 1974-86. The analysis was publishedat the end of 1989 (2): the present article summarizes some of the most inter-esting findings, concentrating on the four programs for which the mostempirical information is available. These and some other programs have beendescribed and evaluated in other comparative studies (3-5), which do not ana-lyze the programs' results relative to their objectives. Individual programshave also been subject to particularly valuable evaluations (6-16). This studydraws heavily on these analyses, as well as on operational information madeavailable by the Brazilian public agencies responsible for the programs. T able 15.1 summarizes some features of these institutions, the popula- tion coverage and operational mechanisms of each program, and the under-lying diagnosis or \"ideology\" (17), which determines the kind of foodsprovided and the means of transferring them to beneficiaries. The principaldifference among the programs is that two of them distributed food directlyto identified beneficiaries, while the other two subsidized foodstuffs. Thereis a secondary difference between the donation programs, in that one pro-vided specially formulated foods, directed at specific family members (thePCA or Complementary Food Program), whereas the other used tradi-tional commercial foods (the PNS or Nutrition through the Health SystemProgram, later renamed the PSA or Food Supplement Program). Therewas also a difference between the subsidy programs: the PINS or IntegratedNutrition and Health Program was an experiment that registered benefici-ary families, where the PROAB or Program of Basic Food Supply in LowIncome Areas was open to any consumer patronizing the shops that partic-ipated in the program. In this last case, it is impossible to measure directlyany impact on the beneficiaries. Three programs were administered byINAN, the National Food and Nutrition Institute, which is part of theMinistry of Health, and the fourth by the LBA or Brazilian AssistanceLegion, which is part of the Ministry of Social Welfare. It is estimated that up to the end of 1986, the three permanent or non- experimental programs had cost the government a total of $767 millionTable 15.1 Principal Characteristics of Four Nutrition Programs, Brazil, 1974-86a NUTRITION THROUGH THE HEALTH SYSTEM PROGRAM/ INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROGRAM OF BASIC FOOD COMPLEMENTARY FOOD FOOD SUPPLEMENT AND HEALTH PROGRAM SUPPLY IN LOW-INCOME PROGRAM (PCA) PROGRAM (PNS/PSA) (PINS) AREAS (PROAB) Institutionalb Executing agency LBA INAN INAN/World Bank INAN Ministry of food MPAS COBAL COBAL COBALCoverage North and Northeast Nationwide, urban areas Recife Northeast (8 states), large (15 states), Federal and municipalities urban areasDistrict, Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, urban areas Point of delivery Health posts, churches, Health posts cCOBAL establishments Participating retailers community centers, etc. Mechanism Monthly donation Monthly donation Quantitatively Unrestricted subsidy restricted subsidy Problem and beneficiaries Determinants of malnutrition Low income Family Family Family, within Neighborhood or zone neighborhood or zone High prices No No Yes YesPoor intrafamily distribution Yes: Specific foods for (Partial: includes milk) Partial: includes No family members anthropometry for children (continued ) 299Nutritional deficiencies Calories Yes Principal Principal PrincipalProtein Yes Secondary (milk) Secondary (milk) Secondary (milk, meat, eggs, fish) Micronutrients Yes: blends No No NoTarget population Entire family Entire family without individual rations Pregnant women Yes: equal ration Yes: equal rationNursing mothers Yes YesChildren yr Yes Yes: equal rationChildren 4-6 yr No Yes d Health care Yes Yes Yes, some families No aSource: reference 2, Table 1. bAbbreviations: LBA, Brazilian Assistance Legion; MPAS, Ministry of Social Assistance and Insurance; INAN, National Food and Nut rition Institute; COBAL, Brazilian Food Company (a state enterprise). cIn Sao Paulo, consultations at health posts and physical distribution elsewhere. dEliminated in the PSA; age limit of three years.Table 15.1 continued NUTRITION THROUGH THE HEALTH SYSTEM PROGRAM/ INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROGRAM OF BASIC FOOD COMPLEMENTARY FOOD FOOD SUPPLEMENT AND HEALTH PROGRAM SUPPLY IN LOW-INCOMEPROGRAM (PCA) PROGRAM (PNS/PSA) (PINS) AREAS (PROAB) 300Table 15.2 Aggregate Estimates for Physical Distribution of Foods, Total Cost, and Total Public Expenditure at Constant June 1984 Prices, for the PNS, PROAB, and PCA, from the Beginning of Each Program through the End of 1986a UNIT TOTAL COST, CR$ MILLION, JUNE 1984 PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION, TONS VALUE, PROAB TOTAL 2 OR 3 PROGRAMS COST, US$ MILLION, 1986 PNS, PROAB, CR$/KG, PNS, PUBLIC TOTAL PUBLIC 1976-86 1980-86 TOTAL JUNE 1984 TOTAL COST TOTAL COST SUBSIDY COST EXPENDITURE COST EXPENDITURE Natural Products Rice 405,550 1,253,138 934 767 aSource: reference 2, Table 19. 301302 Health Economics in Development (1986 U.S. dollars) (T able 15.2). The largest share of this was due to the PNS, both because of its large coverage and because it began much earlierthan the PROAB. These factors offset the higher unit cost of the foods dis-tributed through the PCA, about $1.00 per kilogram versus approximately50 cents per kilogram for the nonformulated foods. The total value duringthese years of donated and subsidized food reached $934 million, includingthe beneficiaries' contribution to buying the subsidized products. Theseestimates are based on the quantities distributed, amounting to some1,662,000 tons, of which three-fourths correspond to the PNS. Nonethe-less, the dollar estimate is very close to calculations based on annual budg-ets in cruzados (Cr$), adjusted for inflation and exchange rates (5). During 1984-86, expenditure on the programs ran about 0.1 percent of Brazil'sgross domestic product, and a much larger share of total public spending. Data on the programs' operations and outcomes can be interpreted in various ways. Here, they will be used to test a series of hypotheses or expec-tations related to the objectives of food and nutrition interventions and thedeterminants of their success or failure. Specifically, evidence will be pre-sented concerning beneficiaries' participation, program costs and their rela-tion to benefits actually transferred to clients, and nutritional impact, asdetermined by anthropometry. This last subject can be further divided,depending on whether the data refer to all participating children, to thoseinitially malnourished, to those less than one year old, or to those born tobeneficiary mothers. Beneficiaries' Participation The \"ideology\" of all the programs presumes that malnutrition is caused chiefly by poverty, being due to low incomes or high food prices or both. Inthe case of the PROAB, which merely subsidized foodstuffs, this was effec-tively the only cause considered, whereas the donation programs (PNS andPCA) admitted a role for medical care and for nutrition status and health.The emphasis on economic factors carries with it the implicit assumptionthat the beneficiaries\u2014provided they are correctly chosen\u2014will be too poornot to take advantage of the subsidy or donation, so they can be expected toparticipate regularly in the program benefits. The available evidence sug-gests, however, that participation can be interrupted or abandoned for vari-ous reasons, due to the program itself or to clients' behavior. T able 15.3 shows what happened to the number of participants (families with the right to buy subsidized food) and the number of users (familiesTable 15.3 PINS: Number of Families Entitled to Purchase Subsidized Food (\"Participating\") and Number of Families that Actually Bought, by Subsidy Model, 1978-80a 1978b1979 1980 I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV Model A (initially 2,500 families) Participating 919 942 936 949 951 981 928 Model C (initially 2,563 2,508 2,305 1,091 850 878 880 772 781 782 Buying 630 1,271 1,512 976 745 740 875 786 661 694 625 Total pp. 169-172. bEach year is divided into four 3-month periods, denoted I through IV. cDuring the first period (January-March 1978 for Groups A, B, and C, and April-June 1978 for Group D), not all the families had yet been reg- istered; the total of 10,071 families registered was reached in July-September 1978. 303304 Health Economics in Development actually purchasing) during the three years of operation of the PINS. The total of more than 10,000 families registered in 1978 fell rapidly during1979, to stabilize at about 5,600 in 1980. The number of users fell lessmarkedly, but still substantially. The loss was smallest for Group A, whichcould buy at a 60 percent subsidy, and greatest for Group D, which receivedonly a 30 percent subsidy. This shows that the subsidy had to be quite highto offset the obstacles the program posed for its clients\u2014limited quantities,restricted times when they could buy (which did not always coincide withtimes when the families had money to buy), and poor quality products. Thediscrepancy between results for Groups B and C is explained by the fact thatbeneficiaries in the former had to take their children once a month to beweighed and measured: both groups received a subsidy of 45 percent, butthe bother of the anthropometry session reduced participation in Group B.The differences in participation between one group and another, due to dif-ferent subsidy rates and requirements for consultation, were not reflected indifferences in the purchase of foods per person and per month among thoseremaining in the program. This amount was stable at 4 to 5 kilograms in allgroups throughout the experiment (2, T able 7). Some related evidence concerning the PNS is presented in T able 15.4. During a period of two years, the beneficiaries were entitled to receive food24 times; however, as the \"total\" column shows, fewer than 20 percent ofthem took advantage of this right as many as 18 times, and more than 10percent of them received food on six or fewer occasions. Among the reasonsgiven by participants for not participating regularly in the program were thepoor quality and small amounts of foodstuffs, and the variation in their owneconomic circumstances (11). They accepted the donation when the alter-native was to go hungry, but did without it when their own resources per-mitted. This may be entirely sensible behavior for beneficiaries, but it illus-trates again how being \"poor\" is not enough to guarantee stableparticipation in a nutritional program, if the benefits appear quite small. Costs and the Transfer of Benefits One of the chief justifications offered for the experimental subsidy pro- gram, the PINS, was that it should be cheaper to administer a subsidy thana donation program, allowing for a larger share of costs to consist of foodand to reach the beneficiary. It is very difficult to obtain comparable data onthe structure of costs of the different programs, but the slight evidenceTable 15.4 Changes Observed in Weight for Age in Children Participating in the PNS in Two Municipalities in S\u00e3o Paulo, March 1980-April 1982, According to Frequency of Visits to Receive Food; Expressed as Number of Childrena FINAL NUTRITIONAL STATUSBCHANGE OF STATUS NO.

There was no systematicdifference in this regard between the PINS and the food donation programs(T able 15.5). Including some health care service greatly reduces the share ofcost in food, both in the PINS and in one model of the PNS that incorpo-rated such services; but when these are not included, expenditures on foodgenerally account for 80 to 90 percent of total spending. The PINS identified its clients, and limited the places where they could buy at subsidized prices; in addition, the experimental design required someadministrative expenses for data collection and analysis. All these featureswere discarded in the PROAB, which sold at a subsidy to retailers, who inturn promised to sell to the public at the prices fixed by the program. Thissimplification, as well as the use of already established retailers who mustcompete with other sellers (at least for nonsubsidized products), created theexpectation that a larger share of total expenditure should reach the con-sumer in the form of reduced prices. The need to control not only pricesbut also the quantity sold to each participating retailer (to avoid resale atwholesale prices) still implies substantial administrative costs. Even so, itwas to be expected that the program would reduce food prices by the sameamount as the subsidy, if the government were no less efficient than the pri-vate sector in marketing foods. T ables 15.6 and 15.7 show to what degree this expectation was not ful- filled. First (T able 15.6), the nominal subsidy (which varied from 15 to 30percent, according to the product and the moment) is compared with theeffective subsidy or the reduction in the final price to the consumer relativeto prices in supermarkets. There were intervals when the effective subsidyexceeded the nominal one, but there were also many times when a nominalsubsidy of 20 percent succeeded in lowering the retail price by only 5 or 10percent. On many occasions, indicated by the plus signs in T able 15.6, thefinal price would have exceeded that of the supermarkets, were it not for thesubsidy. This shows that the program was unsuccessful in competing withthe wholesale private sector. In T able 15.7, a shorter period (23 weeks instead of seven years) is exam- ined to estimate the degree of effective transfer of the subsidy. Althoughduring many weeks it was possible to transfer all or nearly all of the nomi-nal subsidy, there were also many weeks in which only half or less of theprogram's expenditure on the subsidy reached the consumer. If the com-parison is made with the minimum price observed during the week, theresults are of course still worse. This does not by itself demonstrate theTable 15.5 PNS, PCA, and PINS: Cost Structure in Percentage Terms (Data for One or More Years between 1978 and 1980)a PNS, 1978-79 MODELS E, FbPCA, JANUARY-JUNE 1980c 1979 WITH WITHOUT RIO DE BELO FEDERAL TOTAL, 3 PINS, JANUARY 1978-DECEMBER 1980d EXPENDITURE ITEM TOTAL HEALTH HEALTH JANEIRO HORIZONTE DISTRICT REGIONS A B C D TOTAL Food: total and storage Personnel 1.39 1.91 personnel Consumption material 0.17 0.50 0.03 0.06 0.37 0.10 0.07 0.10 3.53 aSource: reference 2, Table 11; from 10, section 4.23, with arithmetic corrections. bTwo PNS evaluation experiments were included, up to January 1980, in the PINS project (models E and F).

Prices in suc h an establishment are normally no higher than those in a full supermarket. 309310 Health Economics in Development inferiority of a subsidy compared with a donation, but it does show how dif- ficult it is to assure that a dollar of public expenditure on food becomes adollar of benefit to the participant. Another reason given to justify the PROAB was that the poor paid arti- ficially or unnecessarily high prices for their food. It has been shown thatthe government's intervention as a wholesaler did not produce retail pricescomparing favorably with those of the private sector. Beyond that result, adirect examination of prices in June 1985 found no support for that hypoth-esis (18-20). It may have been true a decade earlier, when the assumptionsthat guided the programs were formed, but it was no longer true. Povertyis a problem of low incomes, not of high prices. Additional Consumption and Physical Growth The ultimate goal of all the programs was a normal nutritional status for the beneficiary; the justification for pursuing this end through a free orsubsidized transfer of food was the assumption that without the program,food consumption would be insufficient, and that the transfer would serveto raise consumption. However, none of the programs had any way todetermine, directly, whether this increase occurred. If the beneficiaryrelies on the program for only a small fraction of total intake (typically 20to 25 percent of estimated needs, and an unknown share of actual con-sumption), then the change in consumption need not correspond to theamount of the transfer. In consequence, the only way to estimate theincrease in consumption is to calculate food consumption functions basedon survey data, taking account, in principle, of the most important deter-minants of intake such as income, family size and composition, and foodprices. Estimates of this kind have been extensively used to evaluate theprograms analyzed here (21, 22), but it must be emphasized that the datawere not generated within a nutritional intervention. For this reason, andin addition to the difficulties of estimating such functions, these estimatesmay be a poor guide to the impact of any program other than a pure dona-tion or subsidy, with no educational or health care components. Theywould thus be more helpful for evaluating the PROAB than for any otherprogram. The most complete and most valuable information on the impact of the programs was generated in several evaluative exercises, which measured theheight and weight of beneficiary children before and after their participa-tion in a program, and related the changes in nutritional status to age, initialDo Brazilian Nutrition Programs Make a Difference? 311 nutritional situation, and length of participation. (In the case of birth weights, the comparison was not before-and-after, but between a group ofbeneficiary mothers and similar group who did not participate in the pro-gram.) Four examples of this kind of analysis are discussed in what follows,corresponding to four hypotheses or expectations about what a food andnutrition program should be able to accomplish. Change of nutritional status The most general expectation is that participating in a program should improve the status of a malnourished child, and keep normal those whoenter the program normal. At the group level, this means more normal chil-dren and fewer malnourished children after some interval of participationthan before. The first expectation corresponds to a curative, and the secondto a preventive, criterion; program ideology does not emphasize one ofthese criteria over the other. T able 15.8 summarizes the results of the three most complete anthropo- metric evaluations, referring respectively to the PCA, PNS, and PINS, andto weight for age. In these cases (although not in all the available informa-tion about the programs) the initial and final nutritional status are knownfor each individual child, so that the instances of improvement and worsen-ing can be counted, rather than just knowing whether the number of chil-dren in each category grew or shrank. Four findings, more or less commonto all three programs, are worth mentioning. First, the majority of partici-pants showed no change in status: whether well nourished or malnourished,they tended to stay in the same category during intervals as long as 48months. A large share of this stability is due to children who started out nor-mal, but many malnourished children\u2014especially those with first-degree(grade I) malnutrition\u2014also did not change. Second, there was a marked recovery for those children who began with moderate or severe malnutrition. In this curative sense, the programs showan impact. It is not clear whether this was due simply to the transfer of food,or whether the transfer of information about the danger to the child and theway of saving him or her was more important; the lack of evidence from thePROAB program does not allow a comparison with a pure physical trans-fer. Consistent with this finding, a child with moderate malnutrition rarelydeteriorated further. Data in T able 15.9 are limited to children initiallyunderweight for age, in the PNS and the PINS. The information distin-guishes according to age at entry into the program and length ofparticipation, as well as separating cases of improvement according toTable 15.8 Changes Observed in Children Participating in the PCA, PNS, or PINS, According to Anthropometric Criterion, Duration of Participation, and Initial Nutritional Status, 1976-80, Expressed as Number of Childrena FINAL NUTRITIONAL STATUSbCHANGE OF STATUS NORMAL I II & III TOTAL NONE IMPROVED WORSENED Weight for Age PCA (6 months) Normal 598 56 6 651 589 \u2014- 62Malnourished I 170 196 12 378 196 170 12II & III 12 33 12 57 12 45 \u2014- Total 771 285 30 1,086 797 215 74 693 203 903 693 \u2014- 210Malnourished I 198 509 66 773 509 198 66II & III 21 148 167 336 135 197 4 Total 912 860 240 2,012 1,337 395 280 PNS (24-28 months) Normal 480 121 8 609 480 \u2014- 129Malnourished I 296 558 71 925 558 296 71II & III 68 272 155 495 113 376 6 Total 844 951 234 2,029 1,151 672 206 PINS (12 months) Normal 2,261 849 2,261 2,866 248II & III 36 350 2,774 3,340 55 985 63 6 1,054 985 \u2014- 69Malnourished I 145 34 9 188 34 145 9II & III 31 20 13 64 7 56 1Total 1,161 117 28 1,306 1,026 201 79 PNS (24-28 months) Normal 450 32 6 488 450 \u2014- 38Malnourished I 128 26 2 156 26 128 2II & III 35 4 \u2014- 39 \u2014- 39 \u2014-Total 613 62 8 683 476 167 40 Height for Age PNS (6-24 months) Normal 303 210 72 585 303 \u2014- 282Malnourished I 58 209 146 413 209 58 146II & III 18 65 225 308 152 114 42Total 379 484 643 1,306 664 172 470 PNS (24-28 Months) Normal 125 89 17 231 125 \u2014- 106Malnourished I 70 110 44 224 110 70 44II & III 30 64 134 228 91 118 19 Total 225 263 195 683 326 188 169 aSource: reference 2, Table 30; from 10, section 7.25; 14, pp.23-25; and 16, Tables 47, 48, and 51-54. bSee footnote b, Table 4. 313Table 15.9 Changes in Weight for Age in Initially Underweight Children Participating in the PNS or PINS, by Program, Initial Age, and Duration of Participation, Expressed as Number of Childrena IMPROVED NO CHANGE DETERIORATED TOTAL TO TOTAL NORMAL PARTIALLY IMPROVED PNS, participation 6-24 months Age 6-12 months 82 62 145 263 41 449Age 12-36 months 137 113 250 381 29 660 PNS, participation 24-48 months Age 6-12 months 81 82 163 179 31 373Age 12-36 months 283 226 509 492 46 1,047 PINS, participation 12 months Age 0-12 months 54 58 112 214 88 414Age 12-72 months 459 332 791 2,378 179 3,348 PINS, participation 24 months Age 0--12 months 64 64 128 193 77 398 Age 12-72 months 398 307 705 1,524 158 reference Table 66; and 14, pp. 23-26. 314Do Brazilian Nutrition Programs Make a Difference? 315 whether the child reached normal nutritional status (full recovery) or remained malnourished (partial recovery). Cases of improvement weremore frequent than stability only for children initially older than one yearwho participated in the PNS for at least two years. The results in T able 15.9indicate that recovery\u2014especially complete recovery\u2014when it occurred,did not tend to happen quickly. They also suggest that the programs weremore successful with children aged over one year than with younger infants:cases of deterioration are concentrated among infants. At older ages, a lackof change in nutrition status was more common. The question of childrenyounger than one year is treated in more detail below. Third, at least in the donation programs, improvement was more fre- quent than deterioration. That is, the net impact was for improvement.This did not happen, however, with the PINS subsidy. It is not clearwhether this was the fault of the program which brought only a fraction ofthe beneficiaries to a health post and therefore could not obtain the poten-tial medical and educational benefits of such intervention, or whether it wasdue to differences between Recife, where the PINS operated, and the citiesof Bras\u00edlia and Salvador. The different evaluations were conducted in essen-tially the same period, so it is unlikely that the general economic conditionsof the country can account for this phenomenon. Finally, the programs were only partly successful in maintaining normal status for those children who entered with no nutritional problems. In allcases a substantial fraction of the beneficiaries worsened, usually to a stateof mild malnutrition. Apparently these interventions are more effective atcure than at prevention. However, the lack of observations on changes ofnutritional status in a control group makes it impossible to attribute successor failure to a program. T able 15.8 includes information on two other indicators, height for age and weight for height, just for the PNS and for only a subset of the childrenwhose weight was recorded. T able 15.10 also provides data on all three indi-cators in the case of the PINS, but without registering the individual tran-sitions. In both cases, one sees a tendency to retardation in growth, givingrise to an increase in the number of children who were slightly short for ageand a decrease in the number of normal height. On the other hand, cura-tive results were obtained in weight, but it is difficult to recover losses inheight. In consequence, the data on weight for height show few cases ofdeterioration; slowed growth in stature is not accompanied by a propor-tional slowing in weight gain, so that weight is usually adequate in relationto height although low relative to age.316 Health Economics in Development Length and regularity of participation The data in T ables 15.8, 15.9, and 15.10, like those of T able 15.4, throw some light on the relation between changes in nutritional status and theinterval of participation in a program, or the frequency with which food wasreceived. The expectation in every program is that the benefit will begreater, and the outcome better, when the client participates regularly andfor a long enough time to take full advantage of the benefits. Returning toT able 15.4, one can see that there is no relation between the number oftimes food was received during two years of participation and the relativefrequencies of improvement and worsening. The reason is simple: The chil-dren who participated most frequently came from the families with theworst food situation at home, which offset the benefit or more regular par-ticipation. (In contrast to comparisons by age or initial nutritional status,frequency is not compared among random subsamples of the population ofbeneficiaries: frequency is endogenous to the experiment.) In the case of the PNS there are data on children participating between six and 24 months and on another group participating between 24 and 48months, without registering the number of times they actually receivedTable 15.10 Number of Children Initially Aged Under Six Participating in the PINS, According to Initial and Final Nutritional Status, by AnthropometricCriterion and Duration of Participation, 1978-80 a NUTRITIONAL STATUSb NORMAL I II III TOTAL Weight for Age Start 3,658 3,545 1,027 122 8,45212 months 3,547 months 3,212 57 Weight for 6,788 202 77 6,600 months 4,967 reference 2, Table 31; from 14, pp. 16, 18, and 20. bSee footnote b, Table 4.Do Brazilian Nutrition Programs Make a Difference? 317 food during those intervals (T able 15.8). The evidence conforms to expectations for all three anthropometric indicators\u2014the longer the inter-val, the better the results. The data in T able 15.9, referring only to childreninitially malnourished, confirm the findings of T able 15.8. Note that thisresult cannot be due to differential abandonment of the program, becausethe children who withdrew after a few months would tend to have betternutritional status, which would show up as greater success over shorterintervals. On the other hand, withdrawal from the program after less thantwo years could be due to greater age at entry: the data do not controlsimultaneously for age. The data on the PINS in T ables 15.8, 15.9, and15.10 show less of a pattern: the frequency of worsening tends to rise, as theinterval of participation is longer. However, these typically are transitionsfrom normal to mildly malnourished. Reduction in the frequency of mod-erate and severe malnutrition continues in evidence. Infants younger than one year Infants present more of a problem for the success of food and nutrition pro- grams than children at least one year old on entry: that is, the program seemless effective for the younger children, particularly in preventive terms(T able 15.9). This question is examined in T ables 15.11 and 15.12, whichare limited to infants initially less than 12 months old and six months orolder in the PNS but with no minimum age in the PINS. (The PINS reg-istered families rather than individual children, so there was no minimumage for participants\u2014as there is in the donation programs, so as not tointerfere with breastfeeding.) In both tables, the individual transitions ofnutritional status are recorded. T able 15.11 shows two alarming results. First, there were many more cases of deterioration than of improvement among the infants supposedlybenefited by the PINS; second, the absolute number of cases of moderateand severe malnutrition increased. This means that the worsening was notlimited to children initially normal, although these were the most frequentinstances. This result may not be surprising, because the PINS includedhealth check-ups for only one group of infants, and it was in this group thatthe most families abandoned the program. It seems evident that a pure foodsubsidy, without any medical or educational intervention, is ineffectiveagainst deterioration of nutritional status in the first year of life. Thisworsening is almost surely due to the tendency not to breastfeed, or to stopnursing after only a few months, which leaves the child exposed to illnessTable 15.11 Changes in Weight for Age Observed in Children Initially Aged Under 12 Months, Participating in the PINS, According to Duration of Participation, 1978-80, Expressed as Number of Childrena FINAL NUTRITIONAL STATUSbCHANGE OF STATUS DURATION OF PARTICIPATION/INITIAL NUTRITIONAL STATUS NORMAL I II & III TOTAL NONE IMPROVED WORSENED One year of participation Normal 501 383 36 920 501 \u2014- 419Malnourished I 46 173 84 303 173 46 84II and III 8 47 56 111 56 55 \u2014-Total 555 603 176 1,334 730 101 503 Two years of participation Normal 357 411 47 815 357 \u2014- 458Malnourished I 50 169 75 294 169 50 75II and III 14 56 34 104 24 78 2 Total 421 636 156 1,213 550 128 535 aSource: reference 2, Table 34; from 14, pp. 23-26. bSee footnote b, Table 4. 318Do Brazilian Nutrition Programs Make a Difference? 319 and therefore to weight loss or, at best, inadequate growth. The PNS, in contrast, included health and education components, in the form of amonthly check-up for clients, and this probably explains its greater successin protecting infants. As T able 15.12 shows, cases of worsening wererelatively less frequent; and for children who participated for two years ormore, worsening was absolutely less frequent than improvement. Thiscontrast does not invalidate the assumption that malnutrition is causedprincipally by poverty, but it clearly indicates that a small economic trans-fer, with no intervention in health or family behavior, is insufficient to pro-tect or cure infants. Weight at birth The donation programs (PCA and PNS) gave free food not only to the chil- dren registered as beneficiaries, but also to pregnant women and nursingmothers, as a means to improve birth-weight and prevent malnutritionat early ages.

The implicit hypothesis, corresponding to a purelypreventive criterion, is that there should be fewer cases of low birth-weightin the beneficiary group. The results appear to confirm this expectation,although the differences are never substantial. In the PCA, for example, thefrequency of births with weight below 2.5 kilograms differed by no morethan two percentage points in the control group. (This difference can be aslarge as 19 percent, but that happens because all the percentages are small,not because the program achieved a large change.) The data on the PNSprovide additional information, by distinguishing women who participatedfor three months or more before giving birth from those who were clientsfor shorter periods. The frequency of low birth-weight does not differ fromthat in the control group when all beneficiaries are considered together, butit falls by four points, from 15 to 11 percent, when counting only those whoparticipated for at least a trimester. One may suspect the results for the PCAwould improve if the same distinction were made. Concluding Remarks It is difficult to reach any conclusion about the apparently simple compar- ison that initially motivated this study\u2014that is, whether it is preferable toattack childhood malnutrition through direct food donations or through asubsidy to basic foodstuffs consumed by poor families. The results do notdisconfirm the underlying hypothesis that malnutrition is, above all, a con-sequence of poverty, and that therefore it cannot be prevented or correctedwithout an economic transfer. Nonetheless, the analysis of two donationand two subsidy programs leads to rejection, or at least weakening, of aseries of associated secondary hypotheses or expectations. Thus for exam-ple, it is not the case that the poor pay too much for their food; nor thatthey are so poor as to guarantee their regular, long-term participation in aprogram; nor that a subsidy is cheaper to administer; nor that a nominalsubsidy is automatically transformed into a real benefit for the client; northat the beneficiaries of a subsidy reach a final nutritional status as good asor better than that of those who participate in a donation program.In summary, the economic diagnosis of malnutrition justifies a directintervention just as well. It also appears that this diagnosis is incomplete,as it does not adequately value the medical and educational componentsthat characterize a donation program. Particularly when the results areDo Brazilian Nutrition Programs Make a Difference? 321322 Health Economics in Development compared for infants under one year old, it is evident that these compo- nents may be crucial. Aside from the comparison between these two approaches, the empirical analysis leads to a series of other conclusions, of greater or lesser solidity. Itis shown that despite the small economic value of the transfers, either typeof program can help to reduce the frequency of malnutrition. It is alsoevident\u2014and sad\u2014that this impact is quite small, and that the majority ofbeneficiaries experience no change in their nutritional status. The changesthat are produced tend to be more curative than preventive, with the obvi-ous exception of the results for birth weight. Given a system to identifybeneficiaries and know when they suffer moderate or severe malnutrition,recovery is possible for many if not all of them. It is much more difficult toprevent the decline of a normal child to a state of mild under-nutrition.Finally, the programs are successful primarily with respect to weight (inrelation to height or to age), and for children older than one year. They areless effective in maintaining or increasing children's height in relation toage; and they are relatively ineffective in protecting infants from the risks towhich the first year of life, and premature weaning, expose them. This find-ing reinforces the importance of regarding malnutrition as a health prob-lem, and not merely as a deficit of food consumption. Despite the extensive, rich, and varied experience accumulated in Brazil during the last decade and a half, it takes some daring to draw recommen-dations for the design of operation of nutrition programs in that country,and still more so for other countries. These experiments say nothing aboutthe value of interventions of the types studied relative to other potentialinterventions\u2014changes in wages or employment opportunities, expansionor reorientation of health services, educational campaigns about breastfeed-ing or other practices, and so forth. (Several of these interventions havebeen tried in Brazil; what is lacking, but would not be easy to provide, is acomparative evaluation among programs of very different natures.)Nonetheless, it seems legitimate to draw a few lessons, with emphasis on: The value of combining food transfers with health interventions and educational efforts; The importance of operating programs efficiently, so that the supposed benefits actually reach the client, a question of particular importance whenthe program is intended to compete with the private commercial sector;Do Brazilian Nutrition Programs Make a Difference? 323 Attention to the quality and acceptability of foodstuffs, without relying on the assumption that the beneficiaries are too poor for such things tomatter to them; Minimizing the costs the program imposes on the client, in time, dis- tance, or other obstacles, assuring that for every cost or difficulty therecorresponds a real gain for the beneficiary; and Abandonment of ideological or predetermined ideas, in order to take advantage of real experience and learn from it in practical circumstances. In the absence of data and analyses, there is no alternative to trusting in the most plausible assumptions one can reach; but once empirical informa-tion exists\u2014as it does, abundantly, in Brazil\u2014this should be the basis forany decision about food and nutrition interventions.

Introduction: Is Food Fortification Economically Interesting? Since this note deals primarily with the economic aspects of fortifying foods with micronutrients, rather than with the nutritional consequences of doingso or the technical issues of how foods are fortified, it is reasonable to beginby asking whether there is anything about the subject which is intrinsicallyinteresting from an economic point of view. That is, would it attract theprofessional attention of an economist who was not also interested in theresults for people's health? Since the most salient fact about fortification isthat it costs very little compared to the value of the food being treated\u2014independently of the specific foodstuff and the particular micronutrient(s)employed\u2014the short answer would appear to be no, fortification is not eco-nomically interesting. It does not seem to pose any special problems or torequire any deep or unusual analysis. The interest in fortification expressed by the World Bank and other agencies concerned with reducing micronutrient malnutrition in poorcountries is consistent with this view. Essentially all the emphasis is on thecost-effectiveness of the technique, compared to other ways of dealing with Paper presented to the Ninth World Congress of Food Science and T echnology, 30 July-4 August 1995, Budapest, Hungary. Reprinted from International Journal of Food Science and T echnology, with permission from Blackwell Science, Ltd.326 Health Economics in Development micronutrient deficiencies and, in general, other interventions to improve health, educability and productivity. It is this emphasis which led the Bankto sponsor the study of Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries [ Jamison, Mosley, Measham and Bobadilla, 1993] and to include in it achapter on various interventions against micronutrient deficiencies [Levin,Pollitt, Galloway and McGuire, 1993]. The effectiveness of all the inter-ventions studied is measured in units called Disability-Adjusted Life Years,or DALYS, which take into account the age at incidence of a health prob-lem and\u2014if it results in permanent or temporary disability rather than pre-mature death\u2014how severe the disability is [Murray, 1994]. The disabilitiescaused by severe deficiencies of iodine and vitamin A include cretinism ormilder mental retardation, and blindness, and they strike at early ages, so theburden of disease associated with them is substantial, even when the futureis discounted so that long-term disability is not simply summed throughtime. Iron-deficiency anemia tends to strike also at later ages and typicallycauses less severe health damage, but it affects far more people, so the healthburden it causes is still very large, greater in fact than the direct burden dueto deficiencies of either iodine or vitamin A [Murray, Lopez and Jamison,1994]. Since vitamin A deficiency increases the risk of young children dyingfrom other causes [Humphrey, West and Sommer, 1992], there is also alarge indirect burden of mortality which can be reduced by preventing orcuring the deficiency [World Bank, 1993: T able 4.3]. Iron-deficiency anemiaposes a risk of mortality in childbirth, but otherwise iron and iodine defi-ciencies do not appear to cause appreciable indirect disease burdens. The combination of the low cost of fortification with these three micronutrients and the large potential health gains in populations wheredeficiencies are prevalent mean that food fortification can be among themost cost-effective health interventions known, costing as little as $5-$20per DALY gained, whereas many other interventions yield health improve- ments only at a cost of $100 or more per DALY [ Jamison, 1993: T ables IA-3and IA-6]. These findings are the basis for the World Bank's recommendationthat micronutrient interventions, including fortification, be included in an \"essential package\" of public health and clinical services which governmentsshould ensure are available to the whole population and should subsidize forthe poor [World that \"No as largean opportunity to improve lives . . . at such low cost and in such a shorttime\" is the basis for Bank policy on overcoming vitamin and mineral mal-nutrition in developing countries [World Bank, 1994], with or without theEconomic Aspects of Food Fortification 327 development of a complete essential package of services. What is econom- ically interesting in this approach is the very high value for money that canbe obtained when deficiencies are prevalent enough and can be effectivelyreduced by supplementation, fortification or changes in diet. This narrow view of the economic aspects of fortification arises from sev- eral limiting factors which are of particular relevance in very poor countries: Prevalence is quite high (the cost-effectiveness estimates are based on 15% of the population being vitamin A-deficient, 24% iodine deficient,and 50% suffering from iron deficiency anemia, with the share rising to63% among pregnant women); Only three well-studied micronutrients are considered, and no account is taken of interactions among them or between any of them and othertrace elements or compounds: there are thus no complicated questionsof what is happening to the entire diet; The objective is always to increase consumption of the nutrient, never to decrease it or simply to inform consumers so that they can choose tocontrol their intake; and Fortification is most often applied to relatively unprocessed foods (or, in the case of iodine, to well water) such as sugar, salt, rice or flour,which most of the population already eats, although more industrializedfoods are sometimes used [World Bank, 1994: T able 4.1]. One result of these limitations is that deficiencies can be considered a public health problem justifying or even requiring strict government inter-vention, typically by mandating that all commercial supplies of a food befortified, with sanctions for noncompliance by producers [World Bank,1994: 31-32 and 46-47]. The same conditions may justify governmentfinancing of the additional costs imposed by fortification, including thecosts of protecting the food from nutrient loss, informing the public, andmonitoring compliance with the mandate. Poor consumers may reducetheir consumption in response to even very small price increases, whilepoor, artisan producers may find fortification more costly than large indus-trial producers. As a result, fortification may provide micronutrients prefer-entially to those consumers who need them least, and may discriminateagainst small, low-income producers unless the costs are subsidized.Another consequence is that fortification is rather sharply distinguishedfrom dietary change, because while the fortified foods may be perceived by328 Health Economics in Development the population as different from traditional, unfortified foods and it may be necessary to gain public acceptance of the fortification, the object is not tointroduce any completely new foods or to change markedly the character-istics of what people already eat. In fact, if it were not for the possibility thatconsumers will perceive\u2014or imagine\u2014such differences and avoid the forti-fied foods, there would be no reason to explain fortification to them or toincur the costs of labeling and experimentation to gain public acceptance. All these limiting assumptions change as a population becomes richer and more educated. The economic questions change accordingly. It is still impor-tant to know whether fortification or other modification of a foodstuff is cost-effective in improving health, but both the costs and the effects can be quitedifferent when the health consequences may be primarily changes in cardio-vascular disease or cancer rather than blindness, anemia or mental retarda-tion, and the costs are increasingly related to information and monitoring.Such costs can be much larger relative to the costs of modifying the fooditself, than in the simpler situation of poor countries and minimal informa-tion expense [US Food and Drug Administration, 1991]. As fortificationbecomes less a uniform procedure applied to a small number of foods andmore a way for producers to differentiate their products in a highly competi-tive market, retailers as well as producers may adopt particular strategies toexpand or defend their market shares, to protect themselves against liabilitiesand to affect government regulation in favorable ways [Caswell, 1991]. Bothbecause prevalence of micronutrient problems is likely to be lower andbecause consumers and producers are better able to bear the costs of fortifi-cation, it becomes less clear that public subsidy is justified, and the questionof who should pay to fortify foods becomes more important. The Relation of Fortification to Poverty, Ignorance and Disease It is convenient to identify these three factors as the crucial causes of mal- nutrition, whether that refers to protein-calorie undernutrition or tomicronutrient deficiencies [Musgrove, 1993: 27-28]. There are of coursefactors which may be considered more fundamental, such as iodine-poorsoils which lead to iodine shortage in foodstuffs\u2014but for that to lead toiodine deficiency disease, people have to be too poor to buy foods grown orcaught elsewhere, or too ignorant to know that they need such foods inaddition to those produced locally. Illness is least important as a source ofmicronutrient deficiency disease where iodine is concerned, and probablyEconomic Aspects of Food Fortification 329 most important for iron-deficiency, since infection by malaria or intestinal helminths can cause iron-deficiency anemia even when the diet 252]. Diarrheal disease also contributesto deficiency of both iron and vitamin A. Poverty is arguably most signifi-cant in the case of iron, since the foods richest in readily available iron, suchas meat, are also relatively expensive. And ignorance is perhaps the chiefcause of vitamin A deficiency, since foods rich in the vitamin or its precur-sors are available almost everywhere and often are not expensive. However,there is no one-to-one connection between particular micronutrient prob-lems and particular causes. The economics of food fortification is partly a matter of how fortifica- tion is related to these three causes of malnutrition, since the differentcauses have different economic implications. Fortification appears to beleast relevant where disease is concerned: the low, regular doses of micro-nutrients in fortified foods are too small for therapeutic purposes\u2014incontrast to supplementation with vitamin A as part of the treatment ofmeasles, for example [ Jamison, Mosley, Measham and Bobadilla, 1993:165-6]\u2014although they might reduce the severity of infection. This meansthat fortification will never entirely supplant supplementation where thereis a short-term need for appreciably larger doses, which may be the case notonly for disease treatment but also for iron supplementation during preg-nancy. Supplementation of pregnant women appears to be cheaper per lifesaved than fortification for the entire population [Levin, Pollitt, Gallowayand McGuire, 1993: T able 19E-3], since the risk of death associated withiron-deficiency anemia is highest for that group, because of the chance ofhemorrhage. However, fortification for the whole population is more costeffective in total DALYs gained per dollar, when anemia is also highlyprevalent among men and children. Expressing health gains in DALYs or asimilar measure is more consistent with economic theory than simplycounting deaths averted, since DALYs are integrated through time, incor-porate judgements about the disutility associated with disability at differentages, and take account of non-fatal losses. Economics says that all these fac-tors matter, but does not dictate the values of several subjective parameters;different values for these parameters yield different estimates of diseaseburdens and therefore different rankings of health interventions [Murray,Lopez and Jamison, 1994; Musgrove, 1994]. The relation among the threemajor strategies for micronutrient deficiency control is treated further inthe next section.330 Health Economics in Development In contrast to the situation with respect to disease, fortification is clearly an important response to the problems of poverty and ignorance. Poverty ismost relevant where it keeps people from eating more expensive foods sup-plying the needed micronutrients, so that fortification of cheaper foods isthe equivalent of a price reduction for the micronutrient. Thus iodized saltis, so far as iodine deficiency alone is concerned, equivalent to a reduction in prices of seafood and other iodine sources, and iron fortification of flour isequivalent, with respect to iron-deficiency anemia, to a reduction in theprice of meat. If the consumer were actually buying iron, iodine, vitamin Aand other micronutrients separately from the foods which serve as vehicles,these effects would be potentially very important, because the lower a con-sumer's income, the greater is the response to price changes. Richer con-sumers can afford to respond less. The price effects need not be constant:the availability of a food fortified with vitamin A, available at a fixed price,could lower the cost of the vitamin at those times when the prices of leafygreen vegetables are high, offsetting seasonal price and consumption fluc-tuations [Bouis, 1990]. This effect should in principle be unimportant fornutrients like vitamin A which the body can store for long periods; however,if average intake is too low to build up adequate stores, fortification can pre-vent deficiency during periods of low consumption, even for vitamin A. Price decreases are relevant, of course, only if the food is available and the consumer is accustomed to buying it. The main reason poverty is rele-vant to the economics of fortification is that being poor is associated withsubsistence food production and low cash incomes. This is probably thechief limitation to the market for fortified foods, since there is no way tofortify what people grow on their own small plots and eat with little or noprocessing. However, simply being poor does not put people beyond thereach of commercial fortification, because the degree to which poverty isassociated with non-market food consumption varies greatly among placesand populations. For example, extremely poor peasants in the mountains ofPeru obtain about half their income in cash, partly from the sale of agricul-tural produce, and spend about half that cash on food [Figueroa, 1981].This exchange serves mostly to increase dietary variety, and incidentallycreates opportunities for micronutrient fortification of such foods as salt,sugar, oil and processed cereal products. In practice, the consumer buys the foods and not their individual charac- teristics, so the effect on micronutrient consumption is the increase due tofortification, less any decline in consumption of the fortified food caused bythe consumer having to pay part of the increased cost of fortifying it, plusEconomic Aspects of Food Fortification 331 any increase in consumption motivated by the knowledge that the food is now worth more because it has been fortified. Estimates of the cost effec-tiveness of fortification generally ignore both the latter effects, assumingthat if the fortification program is properly designed and implemented,consumption will not be affected. People will simply buy and consume asmuch of the fortified food as they formerly did of the unfortified food: noone will eat more sugar in order to get more vitamin A, the demand forsugar being determined rather by its caloric content, price and other bulkfeatures. The crucial question is not whether consumers will want to eatmore sugar or flour because they know it to be better for their health, butwhether they will continue to prefer the traditional, unfortified foodbecause the fortified alternative tastes different or must be cooked differ-ently, or because they believe there is some danger in eating it. This way of looking at the demand for a fortified foodstuff is equivalent to supposing that poverty is the main source of malnutrition, and that igno-rance is a problem primarily so far as people believe untruths about forti-fied foods that would reduce the willingness to eat them. Perfect ignorance,in which people do not know that they need the nutrient but also do notknow that the food has been fortified, would have no effect on consump-tion, and \"thus, even those consumers who may be unaware of thediet/health revolution may inadvertently eat a better diet\" [US Food andDrug Administration, 1991: 60857]. However, such perfect ignorance isprobably rare or nonexistent, and fortification programs almost invariablyassume that people should be educated about the benefits of the fortifiedfood, since \"the creation of demand [is] the indispensable factor for success\"[World Bank, 1994: 19]. Even if there is no net effect on consumption, sucheducation at least will counteract the risk of reduced demand because ofincomplete or erroneous beliefs. Thus food fortification is intimately linkedto ignorance as a cause of malnutrition and\u2014although this is not intrinsi-cally necessary\u2014is often one of the means to reduce that ignorance. In the terms of economic theory, a fortified food is a different product, not simply the old product at a possibly higher price, and in order for it to pro-vide utility and therefore be demanded, its benefits have to be known. In thelong run, these benefits might be learned empirically by ignorant consumers,just as people have learned the health value of traditional, unfortified foods.Those populations which eat capsicum peppers as part of their regular diet do not need to know anything about vitamins in order to avoid vitamin deficien-cies. But there is no reason to wait for that slow learning: a great part of theattraction of micronutrient fortification is that it can improve health rapidly.332 Health Economics in Development The Relation of Fortification to Supplementation and to Dietary Change The question of how fortification is related to the three causes of malnutri- tion helps to understand how it is related to the other two principal strate-gies for combating that malnutrition\u2014individual supplementation apartfrom foods, and changes in diets to include more natural sources of themicronutrients. Much of the discussion of cost-effectiveness concerns therelative costs and likely relative outcomes of these strategies, from which todetermine in what proportions they should be used for lowest overall costper DALY gained in a particular population. The answer depends, amongother things, on the particular deficiency, its prevalence and severity in dif-ferent sub-populations, the current diet, people's knowledge of food andhealth, and the structure of the industry producing the foods which are can-didates for fortification. This variety of factors makes it impossible to specify a uniform strategy for controlling micronutrient deficiencies: in particular, the approach thatappears to be cheapest is not necessarily the best for the whole populationbecause of variation in the effectiveness. For example, the cost of protect-ing one person from deficiency for one year may be 3-4 times as high withvitamin A capsules as with fortification of sugar [Levin, Pollitt, Gallowayand McGuire, 1993: T able 19.6], but if some children are severely vitamin-deficient or live in such poor or remote places that they do not eatpurchased sugar, then supplementation with capsules may be the most cost-effective approach for them . Despite these complications, there is a general pattern of recommendations [World Bank, 1994: T able 7.1]. Supplementa-tion is most appropriate for dealing with severe deficiencies, especially indefined and easily reached sub-populations. For iron deficiency, it isexpected that supplementation may be justified for a long time, at least forpregnant women, because of the difficulty of providing them adequate ironthrough either fortification or dietary change. Supplementation is regardedas only a short-term remedy for most situations of iodine or vitamin A defi-ciency, to be supplanted by fortification (particularly for iodine) or changesin diet (particularly for vitamin A). Fortification comes closest to being the crucial strategy for iodine, since iodine deficiency in the soil will show up inwhatever foods are produced, and dietary change has to involve not simplydifferences in what people eat but differences in where the food is grown orcaught. For iron and vitamin A deficiency, it is often assumed that dietarychange can take over some (iron) or nearly all (vitamin A) of the scope forfortification.Economic Aspects of Food Fortification 333 Of course, this comparison is limited to those three micronutrients: there is little discussion of the relative scope of the three mechanisms fordealing with deficiencies of other nutrients such as calcium, zinc or vitaminsother than A. In part, this reflects less complete knowledge of the econo-mics of other micronutrients and their deficiencies. More to the point, itreflects the fact that concern with poor countries is concentrated on thetropics, and on populations which until recently had such short lifeexpectancies and such a disease pattern that most of the easily-correctabledisease burden falls on young children [World Bank, 1993: T ables B6.7;Murray, Lopez and Jamison, 1994]. Thus there is no concern with possibledeficiency of vitamin D, in populations exposed to strong sunlight all yearlong\u2014although fortification of dairy products with vitamin D produceddramatic health gains by eradicating rickets in northern Europe. And con-cern with deficiencies of such minerals as calcium or zinc has been over-shadowed by the dominant problem of what is usually called protein-energymalnutrition\u2014even though the low weight and height by which that con-dition is measured may actually be due, in large part, to micronutrientshortages which are not expressed as disease but which interfere withgrowth [Golden, 1991]. Fortification of foods that people already eat, and persuading people to eat (more of ) different foods, clearly are different approaches to micro-nutrient deficiencies in several respects\u2014in the degree to which consumersneed to be educated, in the involvement of food producers, and in the extentto which food is bought or produced at home. There also seems to be, insome discussions, a belief that dietary change is more \"sustainable\" than for-tification, because it depends more on a permanent change in people'sbeliefs about food and health. Fortification is seen as more vulnerable toreversal, whether because in economic downturns people would withdrawfrom the market for purchased food, or because producers would find com-pliance onerous and evade it, or because governments can change and aban-don their commitment to controlling deficiencies. It is partly in response tothis possibility, that fortification programs are accompanied by education ofthe public about the beneficial health consequences\u2014even though thatwould not be necessary in the situation of perfect ignorance described earlier. As fortification depends more on information, and as consumers become richer and more educated, and produce less of what they eat and buy more ofit, the sharp distinction begins to blur. In richer countries, fortification is notso much an alternative to dietary change as it is one kind of dietary change. People need to be persuaded to consume the product in both cases, and they334 Health Economics in Development must be able to afford it: after that, it hardly matters whether the micronu- trients in the food were put there by nature or in a factory. It is abundantlyclear that people value variety in the diet, and expand the diversity of foodseaten as they get richer\u2014suggesting, among other things, that they do notconsider calorie shortage to be their main nutritional problem, since they willspend additional income on other food characteristics and increase theircaloric intake only very slowly unless they are acutely hungry [Behrman andDeolalikar, 1989]. This increased dietary diversity does not seem intrinsicallyto favor either natural or processed foods; tastes, knowledge and prices willdetermine which foods are consumed and therefore what happens to nutri-ent intakes. In fact, so far as micronutrients are concerned, the principal fac-tor working against the expansion of fortification may be that voluntary,unsubsidized supplementation\u2014in the form of oral vitamin and mineralsupplements\u2014also becomes much more available and affordable. \"Dietary change\", as a strategy to control micronutrient deficiency, means \"change for the better.\" But of course much dietary change in theworld is neutral, or even change for the worse; it is driven by changes intastes, income and relative prices, not simply by a search for better health[Popkin, 1992]. This is the case not only for increased consumption of sugarand fat, with the attendant risks of diabetes, caries, cardiovascular diseaseand possibly cancer. It is also the case for reduced consumption of some tra-ditional foods of the poor, such as pulses, which are a relatively rich veg-etable source of iron. In the quarter century from 1961 to 1986, worldwideavailability of pulses fell by about one-third [World Bank, 1994: Figure 5.1],with most of the decline being replaced by increased consumption of cere-als. This may have been largely an unintended consequence of the \"greenrevolution\". Such changes can contribute to decreased availability ofmicronutrients, especially iron but\u2014at least in the Sahel and in West Africaover the last two decades\u2014also of vitamin A [World Bank, 1994: Figure 1.1;UN Subcommittee on Nutrition, 1992: Figures 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5]. (Estimatesof these average availabilities are based on food balance sheets and saynothing about the distribution of a micronutrient in the population, so theymay or may not be correlated with evidence of increased deficiency. In somecountries, they reflect increased poverty as well as income-neutral dietarychange.) Fortification of the foods being consumed in greater quantities toreplace those foods people are eating less is a protective reaction to dietarychange which threatens health by reducing nutrient availability. There has been so much dietary change, in most of the world, in the last couple of decades, and such dramatic health progress, that any guessesEconomic Aspects of Food Fortification 335 about the future of food fortification must be very speculative. But it seems reasonable to expect, based both on the experience of richer countries andon the needs and opportunities in poor populations, that fortification willbe a natural and substantial part of any long-term dietary equilibrium. Thedisappearance of deficiency disease is not going to remove the need formicronutrient intakes, but only reduce the need for large-dose interven-tions; increased health knowledge will probably continue to expand thescope for fortifying with other nutrients; and modern retailing will reachmore and more of the population. For example, the expansion of super-markets has already done away, in middle-income countries such as Brazil,with price differences that in the past may have penalized poor consumersand contributed to their malnutrition [Musgrove and Galindo, 1988] Thepeople at risk of being left out of this process will be those who continue tolive by subsistence farming in remote rural areas, or whose mistaken beliefsabout food and health are, for whatever reason, especially resistant tochange. Everyone else should end up largely protected from micronutrientdeficiencies, either because of deliberate dietary choices or just because somany of the inexpensive foods available to them contain adequate amountsof those nutrients. Who Can and Should Subsidize Whom? In economics, it is seldom enough to show that on some criterion of bene- fit, a good or service is worth buying: the analysis is not complete unless onealso knows who should bear the cost. Thus an important part of the discus-sion of food fortification in poor countries concerns who should pay for it\u2014the consumer, the producer or the government. This may seem odd,because at first glance it appears that even a very poor consumer should bewilling to pay the small extra cost of protection against micronutrient defi-ciency diseases, given the very large potential health benefits. For example,at an income level of $1 per person per day, such protection could be had,for iron, iodine and vitamin A deficiencies, for about $1 per year, or oneday's income in the year. (This is the level at which the World Bank'srecommended essential health service package would cost about $12 perperson per year [Bobadilla, Cowley, Musgrove and Saxenian, 2],including the cost of vitamin A supplementation; adding supplementationor fortification for iron and iodine would still account for only a small shareof the total package cost.) Considered purely as an investment in their336 Health Economics in Development children, preventing micronutrient deficiency disorders is one of the best- paying things poor parents could spend their limited money for. In high-prevalence environments, such expenditure can often mean the differencebetween a healthy child who can contribute to the family's income, and ablind, cretinous or severely anemic child who is a drain on his or her par-ents' resources. Immunization is probably the only comparable low costinsurance against a major health loss [ Jamison, 1993: T able IA.3]. However, as the example of immunization shows, parents do not spon- taneously demand and buy this insurance: if close to 80% of the world'schildren are protected today against the six EPI diseases, it is only becauseof sustained public expenditure, both to cover the cost of immunization andto educate and mobilize parents to take advantage of the subsidy. It is pro-bably illusory to suppose that people will be any more rational or willing tospend their own money on micronutrient protection than on protectionagainst communicable disease. They may even be less willing, when sup-plementation or fortification represents a repeated expense, whereas immu-nizations are few and long-lasting. In economic terms, there are three quite distinct reasons for govern- ments to intervene in the health sector rather than leaving it to private mar-kets. One is to assure the adequate provision of public goods or serviceswith large externalities. Private markets cannot exist for pure public goodssince people can benefit from them without paying for them; and marketswill under-produce goods with positive (beneficial) externalities since thosepaying do not obtain all the benefits. Another reason has to do not with thenature of the intervention but with a characteristic of the beneficiary: gov-ernments subsidize health services, just as they subsidize other services, forpoor people when this is more efficient than transferring income. Finally, inthe domain of expensive, private goods, it makes sense for governments tointervene to correct or offset market failures, particularly in the market forhealth insurance [Musgrove, 1996: Part 2]. Clearly the last of these reasonsis irrelevant where micronutrient deficiencies are concerned, since they costso little to prevent. Any argument in favor of public intervention mustdepend on poverty or on some public good or externality. And, as indicatedabove, poverty should not really be an obstacle to people paying the cost offortification, provided they are already eating one or more of the foods thatcan be cheaply and easily fortified. There is perhaps even less of a publicgoods reason to subsidize fortification: micronutrient deficiencies are notcommunicable, so protecting one person does not protect anyone else evenpartially, and if the cost of a fortified food is passed on to the consumer, thenEconomic Aspects of Food Fortification 337 no one can benefit without also paying for it. (Fortifying a communal water source, such as a well, with iodine is an exception: the water is a public goodunless people are required to pay to use the well.) Nonetheless, it is common for governments to subsidize micronutrient deficiency control programs, and common to argue that this should bedone. This is particularly the case for supplementation, which has to be pro-vided individually, so that unwillingness to pay on the part of the benefici-ary may be more of a problem\u2014payment is exclusively for the supplementrather than going predominantly for a desired food. It is also common forgovernments to pay for consumer education and demand-creationprograms, as part of dietary change programs, but here the public-goodargument does apply; markets are unlikely spontaneously to generate thatinformation and change of habits. Where fortification is concerned, it isusually argued that even if governments do not pay for the process, theyshould intervene to require all producers to comply and to educate the pub-lic so that demand for the product is not affected [World Bank, 1994]. Where governments actually subsidize the fortification, two arguments are probably most important. One is that the cost is so low that even if it istheoretically inappropriate, there is no harm in spending public money, andmuch health gain to be had. In the same way, it may be a mistake in theo-retical economic terms for the state to subsidize the Expanded Program ofImmunization, but that error is surely justified by the results. In both cases,government action makes up for the ignorance or indifference of parents,which leads them to be inadequate agents for the health of their children\u2014who, not yet being sovereign adults, cannot choose for themselves whetherto buy fortified foods, pay for immunizations, and so on. In market-failureterms, this is a \"principal-agent problem\", possibly the most serious one inthe health sector. The other argument for subsidy is that until consumers fully understand the value of fortification and are willing to pay for it\u2014in fact, until theycome to reject unfortified foods as not being worth the cost saving\u2014it isbetter not to let even a small price difference separate the traditional, unfor-tified food and the new, fortified substitute. Initially, producers are not surethey can pass on the cost to consumers, and so ask for subsidy or try to evadethe requirement to fortify; governments cannot easily enforce complianceon the industry, particularly if it includes many small producers; and con-sumers will be more willing to try the changed food if there is no cost tothem. Spending more to subsidize the fortification may actually even save agovernment money, if less has to be spent on enforcement, and in any case338 Health Economics in Development fortification may be cheaper than the associated cost of monitoring the quality of the product at the retail level. (There is even more potential sav-ing, if the government would otherwise have to pay for the medical care ofthe victims of micronutrient deficiency diseases.) Arguments like theseexplain, for example, why the government of Brazil has chosen to pay thecost of fortifying salt with iodine, and thereby virtually eliminating a previ-ously serious problem of cretinism and endemic goiter in some parts of thecountry [Medeiros-Neto, 1988]. These obviously are transitional arguments, justifying public subsidy in order to launch fortification and assure that customers will become accus-tomed to it and eventually demand it. Once that happens, there is much lessreason for subsidizing fortification (although there may continue to be acase for subsidy to supplementation, and there will always be a case for pub-lic finance of information that contributes sufficiently to better health.)Subsidies to fortify traditional foods such as salt or sugar, with the mostimportant micronutrients\u2014especially iodine and vitamin A\u2014may continuejust because it becomes politically difficult to do away with them, but therest of the industry can evolve toward the current situation in richer coun-tries. Fortified foods, like foods processed in other health-related ways,such as by reducing the content of fat, salt or cholesterol, will have to passa market test and be paid for by consumers, while the government rolebecomes primarily one of setting standards and assuring compliance withthem [US Food and Drug Administration, 1991]. It becomes particularlyimportant for the government not to subsidize any and every instance offortification, as more and more foods are fortified and there are multiplesources of individual micronutrients and also more than one micronutrientadded to an individual food product\u2014it would be neither cost-effective norcheap to subsidize whatever producers offer in the market, and so it is cru-cial to pass the cost to the private market, to be divided between producersand consumers according to the price elasticity of demand. Finally, since some people continue to be poor even in richer countries, and should not be condemned to micronutrient deficiency diseases justbecause they are poor, there may be continued occasion for public subsidy forthem. But if poverty is a serious problem, the solution probably is not to sub-sidize only the cost of improving foods' micronutrient content, but (part of )the total cost of the fortified food. Government policy is then a mixture ofsubsidizing some foods for the poor, and of setting nutritional standards forwhich foods can be subsidized. This is the case in the United States, forexample, where the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) ProgramEconomic Aspects of Food Fortification 339 subsidizes only certain foods, determined by their nutrient content, whereas the more general Food Stamp Program of income supplementation pays partof the cost of a wide variety of foods and does not discriminate among themaccording to health criteria (apart from such limitations as excluding alco-holic beverages). T o return to the question of the evolution of fortification,the natural trend is toward less subsidy and control of micronutrients as such,but governments will continue an active role in assuring information andproduct quality. And the costs of those activities will still have to be justifiedby their consequences for health, including the effects on food safety.

Introduction The mean heights and weights of individuals of a given age and sex vary substantially across countries; it is common to find the difference in meansbetween two national populations to be several times the standard deviationof the distribution within a reference population [1]. In high-income popu-lations, the parent-child correlation in height is high, and it is well estab-lished that genetic differences between individuals account for most of theindividual variation in anthropometric status in such populations [2]. Thatsaid, available evidence suggests that differences across ethnic groups in the Co-authored with Dean T. Jamison and Joanne Leslie. Reprinted with permis- sion from Food and Nutrition Bulletin, vol. 24, no. 2 \u00a9 2003. The United Nations University.342 Health Economics in Development distribution of genetic potential account for a relatively small part of the observed differences among populations in anthropometric indicators. Themore important share of variation across populations results from differ-ences in the proportion of individuals in each population who fail to reachtheir genetic potential and in the magnitude of that growth failure [1-3].Factors influencing the magnitude of growth failure within a populationinclude dietary adequacy, disease patterns, and variations in nutrientrequirements induced, for example, by variation in required activity levelsor ambient temperatures. 1 Understanding the determinants of malnutrition\u2014and how they vary from one environment to another\u2014is of central importance to health pol-icy: in a recent quantitative assessment, fully 50% of the total number ofdeaths in children under five years of age were associated with malnutrition[4]. Better understanding of the magnitude and nature of dietary and otherrisk factors for malnutrition would provide a valuable avenue for improvingdisease-prevention strategies relevant to the needs of the poor. Recentresearch points to a substantial contribution of disease to malnutrition [5].Easterlin presents historical evidence suggesting that reduction in diseaseaccounted for the rapid rise in the rate of increase in male stature thatoccurred in Europe from around 1800 to around 1900 [6] (from an average1.1 cm per century increase to an average 7.7 cm per century increase).While acknowledging the importance of infectious diseases, this paperfocuses on the role of diet as a determinant of malnutrition, and in particu-lar, it utilizes several aggregate-level data sets to assess the quantitative sig-nificance of dietary quality, particularly the protein content of the diet, as arisk factor for malnutrition. Although dietary protein can be utilized by the body for energy, with 1 g of protein providing 4 kcal of energy [7], high-protein foods tend to be sev-eral times more expensive per kilocalorie of energy provided than foods thatare low in protein or relatively inadequate in one or more essential aminoacids. 2It is generally accepted that when diets are low in energy, available protein will in fact be used for energy, although the empirical evidence forthis seems to be strongest for severe reductions in energy intake. The impor-tant empirical question is how variation around current levels of energy andprotein availability influences levels of malnutrition. Just as diets that are lowin cost per kilocalorie of energy are low in protein, diets that are low in costper gram of protein are relatively low in energy. This tradeoff underscoresthe reason for quantifying the relative importance of increasing the energycontent of diets versus improving their quality in reducing malnutrition.Malnutrition and Dietary Protein 343 Nutrient Intake and Growth: Data and Methods We specified a simple function relating an anthropometric indicator to a number of potentially determining variables. Multivariate regression is thenused to estimate the parameters of this function. The first data set containsinformation on average adult heights and weights (both male and female),income, and energy and protein availability from urban areas of 13provinces of China. The second set also comes from China and refers to 64largely rural counties. Nutrient availability (energy, protein, lipids, andfiber) is measured from a population sample of actual dietary compositionand intake at the county level, rather than from aggregate food balances.Estimates of income were also available. The third data set contains infor-mation on national averages from 41 populations in 40 countries of adultmale height (but not weight) and from 33 populations in 32 countries ofadult female height, energy and protein availability (from aggregate bal-ances), per capita gross national product (GNP), and predominant ethnicgroup. The sources, methods of analysis, and main results for each data setare first discussed. The final section compares the three sets of results anddraws some conclusions concerning the relative importance of energy andprotein as determinants of achieved growth. The contribution of this paperlies in the inclusion of dietary energy and protein levels among the deter-mining variables. A previous study also utilized a regression approach toassessing determinants of adult height and included a broader range of vari-ables in its analysis [8]. A number of caveats accompany our analyses. First, available data do not include a number of variables that are potentially important determinantsof growth, and the variables they do include are averages rather than indi-vidual values. 3The data also refer to one moment in time rather than to the interval over which people grow, resulting in their final adult height (and,with much more variation, their adult weight). In all three data sets, the esti-mates of nutrient availability refer to the approximate time when adultheights and weights were measured; we assume that these contemporarymeasures provide indicators of relative availabilities during the precedingtwo or three decades. This assumption is most defensible for the secondanalysis, because \"dietary patterns in these rural areas of China, being sim-ple in food variety, have probably remained simple and similar for manyyears, since foods consumed in each area are produced locally under rea-sonably stable local crop conditions\" [9]. We also assume that few people inthe sample populations have migrated to or from the province, county, or344 Health Economics in Development country in which they grew up, so that the nutrient availability in the place where they lived when surveyed is probably similar to the nutrient avail-ability when they were growing up. Growth Failure and Health Our principal dependent variable, stature, is increasingly used in many fields as an indicator of general well-being [8]. Evidence from a wide rangeof studies suggests that malnutrition impairs mental development, in themost severe cases by a direct effect on brain cells and in more moderatecases by lowering the child's motivation and energy level and thereby reduc-ing the amount of effective learning time [10, 11]. There is also evidencethat malnutrition reduces the activity levels of poor children in developingcountries [12], and that malnourished children are less likely to attendschool and less likely to succeed if they do attend [13, 14]. The mortality consequences of malnutrition are probably mediated through a cyclic interaction among dietary inadequacy, malnutrition,immune status, and infectious diseases. Malnourished children are moresusceptible to disease, and they are more likely to die if infected. Childrenwho are ill eat less and are less able to absorb what they do manage to eat[15-20] at a time when their nutrient requirements are actually increased. Quantitative estimates have been developed of the extent to which infec- tion accounts for observed levels of malnutrition in a broad range of envi-ronments [5], and such estimates vary greatly (10% to 80%) across envi-ronments, suggesting that the entry points for intervention to break theadverse cycle will also vary. Data Set 1. Height and Weight of Young Urban Adults in 13 Chinese Provinces A concern with the identification and development of sports talent among the youth of China gave rise to a detailed study in 1979 of 183,414 school-age children and young adults from 13 provinces and the three provincial-level metropolitan areas of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin [21]. This studyreported heights and weights of urban males and females in the age range18 to 25 years in each province. The variables used to explain these anthro-pometric data came from several other sources. An early World Bank policyMalnutrition and Dietary Protein 345 paper on the health sector in China used the 1979 data, data from other published sources, and data collected specifically for the report to documentlevels and trends in nutritional status [22, 23]. These reports describe anenvironment of rapidly improving nutritional status, particularly in urbanareas, and of possibly worrisome inequality in the distribution of proteinconsumption. We used the official Chinese estimate of total industrial and agricultural output per capita in 1981 [24] to measure provincial income. Provincial-level data on energy and protein production were obtained from anotherWorld Bank study of trends in food and nutrient availability in China [25].These data on income and on nutrient availability cover another 13provinces besides those for which anthropometric indicators are available.All data were for the year 1979, except the total value of industrial and agri-cultural output, which was for the year 1981. T able 17.1 gives the defini-tions, means, and standard deviations of all the variables, over all provincesfor which they were available. Although there were 16 observed locations for adult heights and weights (including the metropolitan areas), the relations between energy and pro-tein, and between height and weight, are based on only 13 observations.The figures for the urban areas of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin could notbe included, since the data on nutrient availability excluded all interprovin-cial and international trade in food crops and hence resulted in gross under-estimates of nutrient availability. For the 26 nonmetropolitan provinces, Table 17.1 Variables for Urban China in 1979 NO.

All analyses are based on multiplelinear regressions using height or weight as the dependent variable. T o provide context, relations between income and nutrient availability (for total energy and for energy from protein) were calculated from the log-arithms of the provincial averages. Although the demand for and supply ofnutrients cannot be distinguished in these data, we assumed that demanddetermines availability and interpreted the coefficients as demand elastici-ties. Not surprisingly, the income elasticity of demand for protein (0.68) wasmuch greater than that for energy (0.40), but both were substantial and sta-tistically significant, suggesting that the poor derive a smaller percentage oftheir total dietary energy from protein sources. Results A previous analysis used univariate regressions to relate each of these vari- ables separately to male and female heights and weights for both urban andrural areas of each province [25]. It found that male anthropometric statuswas systematically more closely related to all the explanatory variables thanwas female status, and that urban heights and weights were better explainedthan those in rural areas\u2014much better, when energy and protein availabil-ity were used as explanatory variables. Univariate regressions say nothing about whether protein availability affects adult height or weight, given a particular level of energy availability, nordo they distinguish the nutrient effects from those of income and other vari-ables.

Because rural anthropometric status appears much harder to explain with these variables, ouranalysis is limited to urban areas. By itself, higher income was found to affectmale height positively and significantly and to have a positive but not statisti-cally significant effect on female height (these simple regressions are notreported in table 17.2). When available energy and the proportion of energyfrom protein were entered together with income, protein, but not energy, wasfound to have a positive and highly significant effect on height for both sexes. The effects on weight were, not surprisingly, quite similar to the effects on height. The effect of income on weight was less strong than its effect onheight, whereas the effect of protein on weight was almost as strong as itseffect on height. In contrast to the effect on height, total energy availabilitywas also found to have a marginally significant positive effect on the weightof males but not of females. 4 Data Set 2. Adult Height and Weight in 64 Rural Chinese Counties In 1976 a major study was conducted of the causes of death in China, cov- ering some 20 million deaths during the period 1973 to 1975. Primarily inorder to relate cause-specific mortality, and particularly mortality from sev-eral different cancers, to a variety of lifestyle factors, including diet, a sup-plementary survey was undertaken in 1983 in 65 mostly rural counties.Attained height and weight for both male and female adults were also meas-ured. Some 1,950 families participated, and three-day dietary intake meas-urements were made for 13,000 individuals [9]. As in the provincial-level study, the estimate of income refers to the total value of industrial and agricultural output per capita in 1982 at the countylevel. Average food intake in these data refer to average consumption in thespecific communities studied. Relations were again estimated between theanthropometric variables and income, total dietary energy, and the share ofenergy obtained from protein. T able 17.3 shows the means and standard deviations of the variables ana- lyzed. These differ slightly between men and women\u2014apart from the sex-specific differences in height and weight\u2014because we used data for 64counties for females and only 63 counties for males. Both men and womenare shorter and weigh less in rural than in urban areas. Rural energy intakesappear to be very slightly higher and rural protein intakes somewhatsmaller, but the comparison is complicated by the difference in the way348 Health Economics in Development intakes were estimated\u2014by province-level availability (table 17.1) and by direct household-level observation (table 17.3). Results T able 17.4 shows the regression results for male and female heights and weights.

Income is not significant in any of the regressions. The only notable difference between the results for men and those for women is that the coefficient on the share of protein in total energy is onlyabout 60 percent as large for female height as for male height and abouttwo-thirds as large for female weight as for male weight. In the provincial-level urban analysis, these coefficients do not differ between the sexes forheight, but the female coefficient is appreciably smaller for weight. Male-female differences in predictors of attained weight may result from differ-ences in the typical percentage of body mass in fat. Data Set 3. Intercountry Differences in Adult Height The source for adult anthropometric data in the third analysis was Eveleth and T anner [1]. The authors of this compendium draw on an enormousrange of scientific studies, some based on national samples but most basedon regional samples or samples drawn from particular ethnic groups; theydescribe the variation in growth, adult size, and body proportions foundacross countries and between different genetically similar groups. The fourmain groups into which samples were divided were Indo-Mediterranean,European, African, and Asian. Among adults, the European and Africanpopulations were the tallest: Indo-Mediterraneans were on average shorterthan Europeans by approximately 5 cm, and Asians were shorter by approx-imately 7 cm. Data For adult males, data on average heights from 41 populations were used as the dependent variable. (These correspond to 40 countries, since Suri-namese of African and Asian origin were treated as separate populations.)Data on female heights were available for 33 populations (32 countries).There was considerable variation among the years in which the data wereobtained, but the majority of the studies were from the 1960s (with a fewfrom the late 1950s and a few from the early 1970s). Also included was anindicator of major ethnic group\u2014taking a value of 1 for either Indo-Mediterranean or Asian, the two shorter populations\u2014in order to controlat least partly for possible genetic variation in potential height acrosscountries. Since the data include only four European countries and nonefrom North America or northern Europe, this variable serves mostly to350 Health Economics in Development distinguish these two groups from African populations. The other hypoth- esized determining variables\u2014per capita GNP and energy and proteinavailability per capita\u2014were obtained from two World Bank documents:the World Development Report 1979 [26] and the Social Indicators DataSheet [27]. T able 17.5 shows the means and standard deviations of the variables in the regressions seeking determinants of cross-country variation in averageheight of adult males. A comparison of the values in table 5 with those intables 17.1 and 17.3 shows that the average height of males in the 41 pop-ulations (166.9 cm) falls between the values for urban (170.3 cm) and rural(163.4 cm) males in China. The average per capita availability of energy wasslightly lower (2,207 kcal) than in the Chinese samples (2,300 kcal in urbanareas and more than 2,500 in rural areas); the average percentage of energyavailable from protein was nearly identical in the 40 countries (10.6%) tothat in urban China (10.7%). Results T able 17.6 shows the results of regressions of the average height of adults in the 41 (or, for women, 33) populations on two different combinations ofexplanatory variables, using the same formulations for nutrient availabilityas in the analysis of the Chinese data. For males, the total available energyis not a significant determinant of height, but the percentage of energyTable 17.5 International Comparisons MALES FEMALES VARIABLE MEAN SD MEAN SD Male height (cm) 166.9 5.00 \u2014 \u2014 Female height (cm) \u2014 \u2014 154.5 4.451960 income: GNP/capita (1977 US$) 507 468 available (kcal/capita/day) 2,207 349 2,207 364 Protein share: fraction of available dietary energy from protein (%) 10.61 1.67 10.64 1.71 Ethnic group: Asian or or African /H110050 0.54 0.50 0.48 0.51 No. of observations (populations) 41 \u2014 33 \u2014 Sources: height, weight, and ethnic group from Eveleth and Tanner [1]; income and energy from Piazza [25]; protein share calculated from energy and World Bank [26].Malnutrition and Dietary Protein 351 available from protein is highly significant; this result is the same whether or not the (significant) ethnic distinction is included. For female heights,the coefficient on the share of energy from protein is only about 60 percentas large as that for male heights, while the standard error of the estimate isunchanged, so the variable is not significant. (The ratio of the coefficientsfor men and women is about the same as for the analysis of rural Chineseheights: protein seems systematically to make less difference in femaleheight, except in purely urban populations.) T otal energy intake continuesto be nonsignificant, and ethnicity highly significant, for women. We also tried a specification different from that used for China, which included per capita GNP , energy available from protein sources in the diet,and energy available from nonprotein sources. Energy available from pro-tein sources was a significant predictor of adult height of males, whereasenergy available from nonprotein sources was unrelated to height. Theseresults are not reported here. Adding a control variable for ethnic groupindicates that belonging to the Indo-Mediterranean or Asian group has asignificantly negative effect on height (about 4 cm) relative to that ofAfricans or Europeans, but controlling for this component of variation inheight does not reduce the significance of energy available from protein(nor does it alter the nonsignificance of per capita GNP). When dietarycomposition is controlled, the estimated differences between ethnic groupsin adult height are much reduced, to slightly less than 4 cm for both malesand females.Table 17.6 Determinants of Adult Male Height (41 Populations in 40 Countries) and Adult Female Height (33 Populations in 32 Countries), ca. 1960 INDEPENDENTURBAN RURAL VARIABLE MALES FEMALES MALES FEMALES 1960 income 0.12 0.09 0.25 0.28 No. of observations (populations) 41 33 41 33 aThe t-statistics are given in parentheses after the coefficients. bR2is the (adjusted) percentage of variance accounted for. *p /H11021 .10, ** p /H11021 .05.352 Health Economics in Development Conclusions Substantial differences exist across population groups in the average values of adult malnutrition as measured by anthropometric status. Only a smallpart of this can be accounted for by genetic differences among populations.It is well established that disease accounts for varying (but often large)proportions of malnutrition in different environments. The analysespresented in the three preceding sections attempt to explain the extent towhich levels of nutrient availability can further account for growth retarda-tion. Controlling for average incomes and\u2014when populations are ethni-cally different\u2014for differences in genetic potential, the analyses address thequestion of the extent to which energy availability in the average diet (inkilocalories per capita per day) and protein availability (in percent of totalenergy from protein) are associated with differences in the anthropometricstatus of population groups. Limitations of the Analyses Several caveats are important. First, the numbers of observations are small, particularly for the first (urban) analysis of China; undue importance mighttherefore be given to a few observations. Second, our international datawere collected at different times, in different ways, and with differing sam-pling frames. Although these shortcomings are in principle more likely toobscure than to illuminate the relations we examine, the heterogeneity ofthe data is cause for concern. However, neither of these limitations mattersfor the analysis of rural China, for which the data are most numerous andalso most uniform, and where we find the same results. A third caveat is that individual diets\u2014and disease patterns\u2014determine individual growth, and our data concern only average diets and averagegrowth. Individual, longitudinal data on nutrient intake, disease episodes,and growth allow for more definitive assessments of the relative contribu-tions to growth failure of energy and protein deficiency in diets that aretypical of those found in today's developing countries. An example of suchan analysis is a longitudinal study of 123 children 2 to 19 years of age fromlow-income families living in Lima, Peru. It found the percentage ofprotein from animal sources, but not total energy intake, to be stronglyassociated with achieved male height and weight [28]. (Our analyses do notMalnutrition and Dietary Protein 353 distinguish animal and plant sources of protein.) Another study followed 70 much younger children for over a year in Bangladesh; it concluded thatdietary inadequacy accounted for perhaps 50% more of the observedretardation of weight gain in the sample than did infections, but it wasunable to apportion the dietary effect among nutrients [29]. Other studies(Chernichovsky [30] and Deolalikar et al. [50]) have modeled individualgrowth trajectories for different samples of children in India, and Bhargava[31] has done the same for a sample of Filipino children, again finding thatprotein but not energy intake is important. These individual-level longitu-dinal analyses complement the much more aggregated ones we present and,reassuringly, reach broadly similar conclusions. Synthesis of Findings Despite the aggregated and cross-sectional nature of our data, the results consistently suggest that protein rather than energy deficiency is the prin-cipal dietary cause of growth failure in the populations studied, as indicatedby attained adult height and weight. These findings not only complementsimilar ones from the limited number of studies using data on individuals,but are consistent with the observations of economic historians that highlevels of animal protein availability\u2014and therefore probably total proteinintake\u2014may have accounted for the earlier increase in average height in theUnited States than in Europe [32] and that periods when protein-densefood was relatively costly may have been associated with lower attainedheights [33, 34]. A recent assessment [35] concluded that the Native Amer-icans of the Great Plains in the United States were probably the world'stallest population in the mid-19th century, with males being 1 to 2 cm tallerthan American soldiers of European descent. The authors attribute this inpart to diets with high diversity and high animal protein content. Increases in protein availability thus appear to be more important than increases in energy availability for ameliorating growth failure. One possi-ble reason for this is that the distribution of energy and of protein to indi-viduals within a population almost certainly differs substantially, with pro-tein (especially animal protein) much more unequally distributed thanenergy. Thus, a larger proportion of the population is likely to be in proteindeficit than in energy deficit if the average availability of the two nutrientsis at the same percentage of estimated requirements. Energy requirements354 Health Economics in Development are expressed as average population needs, on the assumption that individ- uals will consume more or less than the average, depending on need. Thepopulation requirements for protein are given as the average requirementplus 2 SD to cover nearly all of the population. In contrast to Steckel [8], we found that per capita income levels were generally unassociated with anthropometric outcomes (except for maleheight in urban China). Our finding of low association appears after con-trolling for nutrient intake, and, to the extent that the effects of income aremediated through increased protein consumption (and the income elastic-ity of demand for dietary protein is very high), the positive results concern-ing income in Steckel and ours concerning protein are consistent. T o theextent that protein content correlates with other potential determinants ofnutritional status and growth (e.g., disease and micronutrients), this paper'sconclusions on the importance of protein would need to be qualified. Our findings suggest that an increase of one percentage point in the pro- portion of total energy accounted for by protein would raise adult heightsby about half a centimeter in urban China, by 0.60 to 1.01 cm in ruralChina, and by 0.65 cm (females) to 1.16 cm (males) across a large sample ofcountries. 5Except in urban China, the effect would be much larger for men than for women. For Chinese men, these increases amount to 0.32 to 0.38SD in height, indicating that they are fairly large relative to the natural vari-ation in the population. The increase is smaller relative to the variationacross countries (0.23 SD), because in that comparison ethnic differencesmake the total variation much larger. As we have stressed, there are many other possible correlates of protein availability that are potential determinants of growth. Examples of otherinfluences include water supplies, education levels, health services, generalsanitation levels, and so forth. (In a sufficiently broadly specified model,these would be endogenous.) We have partly controlled for these otherpotential influences by including income in our regressions; however, thepossibility remains that some of the effect attributed to protein availabilityin our regressions is due not to protein itself but to correlates of proteinavailability that are less well correlated with energy availability. This mightbe the case particularly for micronutrient deficiencies that can cause growthfailure without causing specific signs of disease [36], even when protein andenergy availability are adequate. If that is the case, then dietary variety maybe crucial to growth because it increases access to all essential nutrients.That said, the results from each of our three data sets suggest that energyavailability is usually not the problem and that protein availability may be. 6Malnutrition and Dietary Protein 355 Notes 1. Several lines of evidence suggest the importance of nongenetic determinants of variation in anthropometric status. Historical records indicate dramatic increasesover time in anthropometric indicators for European populations, increases thathave reached a limit as adequate levels of nourishment and health have extended tovirtually all members of the populations studied [3]. Alternative sets of interactingvariables have been proposed to account for the observed improvements [37, 38].Evidence is available on increased height and also better health, as a result of moreand better food consumption, in Europe and the United States in the 18th and 19thcenturies [39], and there are studies of individuals from one country growing up inanother (e.g., Japanese in California) who showed substantial anthropometricimprovements [1]. 2. Proteins are composed of different combinations of 20 amino acids, of which 9 are essential for humans in the sense that they cannot be synthesized but must beingested [40]. In order for protein to be used for growth, rather than for energy, allthe essential amino acids must be present in adequate amounts. Generally speaking,foods of animal origin supply needed amino acids in approximately the requiredproportions, and foods of plant origin are relatively deficient in one or more essen-tial amino acids. Therefore, the amount of available protein that can be utilized fromanimal sources is in the range of 80% to 90%, whereas the amount of protein thatcan be utilized from an individual plant source is in the range of 45% to 55%. Inconsequence, individuals consuming only foods of plant origin must usually con-sume more protein or a carefully balanced mix of foods in order to meet their pro-tein requirements. 3. The disadvantages of utilizing data aggregates to estimate production processes that occur at an individual level (person, firm, farm, or household) are wellknown; see Jamison and Lau [41] for an extended discussion of the advantages anddisadvantages of using aggregated data in empirical work and Stoker [42] for a dis-cussion of empirical approaches to the aggregation problem. King [43] presents anovel approach for utilizing aggregate data to illuminate relations at the individuallevel, along with computational algorithms. Because relative income elasticities indi-cate protein consumption to be much more unequally distributed within popula-tions than is energy consumption, aggregate per capita availabilities of energy andprotein that are equally satisfactory for an individual diet will result in a larger pro-portion of the population being short of protein than short of energy. Scrimshaw[44] presents evidence suggesting that utilizable protein is even more unequally dis-tributed. Whether this means that aggregated data would result in higher or lowerestimated elasticities of growth with respect to protein consumption than would beestimated from individual data depends on where the aggregate observations areconcentrated along the true, individual relation, since that curve is likely to risesteeply at low levels of protein consumption but level off as protein intake becomes356 Health Economics in Development adequate for reaching one's genetic potential growth. Unfortunately, dietary infor- mation obtained at the individual or household level is costly and often highly unre-liable, although some individual-level studies (e.g., Graham et al. [28]) allow esti-mation of the impact of specific nutrients on growth. Other studies [45] often arerestricted to utilization of much less precise determinants, such as food-consumptionfrequencies, or to inferences concerning relative inadequacies of particular nutrientsfrom body composition data [46]. 4. Data have also been published on anthropometric indicators of nutritional status for children between 7 and 17 years of age from the 1979 Chinese survey. Pre-liminary analysis of the data for seven-year-olds found neither energy nor proteinavailability to be a significant determinant of nutritional status. One plausible expla-nation is that diarrheal disease (and other health factors) are more important asdeterminants of children's growth than of attained adult stature. 5. This increase is comparable to the increase in the average height of native- born white males in the United States in the two centuries following the mid-1700s, which was approximately 1.2 cm [47]. Heights increased much more rap-idly in the United States than in European countries, so that by the mid-1700s,male heights in the United States already exceeded those in Europe by 2.5 to5 cm [34]. 6. A recent econometric assessment [48] found further effects, in that both energy and protein in the diet remained important for worker wages (in Brazil), evenafter individual height and body mass index were controlled for, but with energyimportant only for the very malnourished, whereas increased protein content wasimportant for a much broader range of individuals. A recent broad overview of therelation between nutrition and poverty may be found in Svedberg [49]. References [1] Eveleth PB, T anner JM. Worldwide variation in human growth.

Introduction Expenditures by consumers on health care are in many respects like any other kind of expenditure; they are directed toward particular goods andservices in order to satisfy wants for a more general good ('health'), and theprocess by which health is built up by investment or lost by depreciation oraccident can be described by models of utility maximization under a varietyof constraints and suppositions [Grossman (1982), Rapaport et al. (1982)]. In other respects, spending on health care is different from any other ele-ment of the consumer budget, because a large share of it is provided pub-licly although it is neither entirely a public good nor is it somethingrequired by law (such as education). In consequence, in order to understandhow much health care households demand and buy, one needs to analyzethe determinants of total health care expenditure and also the interactionbetween public and private spending. Reprinted from Journal of Health Economics 2 , Copyright 1983, with permission from Elsevier Science.362 Health Economics in Development Previous analyses [Kleiman (1974), Newhouse (1977), Maxwell (1981)] have typically relied on highly aggregated data, and have concentrated onunderstanding total health spending. They indicate that health care is rela-tively elastic with respect to income across countries, with the elasticitydeclining toward one as income rises; that income and spending are much lessrelated within countries; and that inter-country differences depend not onlyon income but on relative costs of particular medical services, the age struc-ture and health problems of the population, the mechanisms of payment andother factors. Private expenditure, as a share of the total, depends not only onthe factors determining demand for health care but on the availability and costof public services and on the coverage and operation of private insurance. Most of the analyses cited above have been limited to high-income coun- tries, in part because of the limitations of data, especially data on privatespending and its determinants. Studies of health care financing in poorcountries have been based almost exclusively on a national accounts esti-mates [Pan American Health Organization (1982), Zschock (1978)] whichgive little more than a disaggregation of public financing by major sourceand a rough estimate of total private spending. More detailed studies, as forexample of the social security system [Mesa-Lago (1978), Zschock (1983)]make use of the disaggregated information collected by public institutions,but still provide very little analysis of out-of-pocket spending by consumers.This situation is beginning to change, as surveys are undertaken with thespecific objectives of measuring private expenditures and their causes[World Bank (1982)] or the use by consumers of the public health system[Selowsky (1979)]. Data of this type are still limited to very few countriesand have so far been subject to relatively little analysis. Meanwhile, given the preponderance of public sector data and of aggre- gated estimates, it may be valuable to make use of standard household incomeand expenditure surveys to study private health care spending. Data of thissort are also relatively rare in Latin America, but not nearly so rare as infor-mation collected specifically to study how health care is demanded andfinanced. Without adjustments for subsidies and transfers, such data are alsolikely to give biased measures of net expenditure and of the amount of medi-cal care actually obtained; this problem is discussed further below. However,family budget data have the great advantage of covering a wide range ofincomes and of other relevant variables, including detailed geographic anddemographic information. In the long run, there may be no reason to expectmuch association between income and health care spending, or between thelatter and actual health status, because of the great changes in medical tech-nology and in living conditions generally [Fuchs (1979)], but in a cross-sectionFamily Health Care Spending in Latin America 363 at a given time it may be possible to measure a definite income elasticity. This is all the more likely if private spending only is studied, since the choicebetween private and public care may be highly income-dependent once pub-lic care is available to a consumer. This reasoning suggests that a family'sincome and its access to publicly-provided services\u2014perhaps indicated bywhere it lives\u2014should be worth studying in household budget data, even ifother features which influence the need for health care and which belong ina full model of family decision-making are not considered. This paper used such data from several household surveys in six Latin American countries between 1966 and 1975, primarily to estimate incomeelasticities and\u2014for the one survey with substantial geographic variation\u2014to investigate how the availability of public services and the way they areprovided and paid for appear to affect family expenditures. Other sourcesare used to provide some information on these public services, but it shouldbe emphasized that these data are not available in the same detail as privateexpenditures; some of the findings, while plausible and perhaps easy to con-firm with more disaggregated public sector data, should therefore beregarded more as hypotheses than as conclusions until more thoroughresearch is conducted. In a previous study of household incomes and expenditures based on data from ten South American cities in five countries [Musgrove (1978a)], I esti-mated expenditure elasticities for total family health care spending and alsofor spending on insurance other than social security contributions, of whichhealth insurance is a component. The results, show below, give fairly preciseestimates of the health spending elasticity, which however differ among coun-tries by more than 50 percent (from 0.81 to 1.34). Much of this variation maybe due to differences in the cost and availability of public services, on whichthe surveys contained no information. Health and other insurance elasticitiesvary even more and are less precise. In the case of Chile, there is some evi-dence that the health care elasticity converges toward one as income rises, butthe errors of estimate are quite large. The regressions from which these elas-ticities come also show health care spending to be influenced by family size,age of head of household, and employment of spouse, but these variables donot have consistent effects across countries. See T able 18.1. In the case of spending on education\u2014which like health care includes a great many zero values, and much variation due to factors besides income\u2014elasticities estimated from the individual observations appear to be under-stated. When I used as observations the means of spending on educationand of total spending by income quartiles, eliminating any transitoryincome effects within quartiles, the elasticities rose from about 1.0 to nearly364 Health Economics in Development 2.0 [Musgrove (1978b)]. I have therefore applied the same procedure to the data on health spending, combining observations for all ten cities. Theresults appear in T able 18.2, quartiles being defined by income per personin households and compared in dollars of equal purchasing power. The dataare also shown in Figure 18.1, yielding an estimated elasticity of 1.5, higherthan any of the individual countries' values for disaggregated data. In onecity (Caracas) a second survey was taken nine years later, permitting ananalysis of how spending changed as real income rose. I have calculatedquartile-specific price indexes and used them to compare incomes andexpenditures in real terms in the two years [Musgrove (1981)]; the resultsfor health care spending also appear in T able 18.2. In the top three quar-tiles, the shifts imply an elasticity of about 0.9, but in the poorest quartilefamily health care spending declined, the implicit elasticity being about-0.5. It is not clear whether this is due to expansion of free public services,which would have reduced the need for private spending, or whether itreflects other factors such as better nutrition and sanitation, which wouldhave improved the health of the poorest families. The largest household expenditure survey yet taken in Latin America was conducted in Brazil in 1974-75 [FIBGE (1978)]. Published tables showmeans of total family spending (on several slightly different definitions) andof spending in total on health care and on several components such as doc-tors, hospitalization and surgery, drugs and medicines, etc., by region of thecountry, metropolitan/other urban/rural location, and class of total expen-diture (nine classes are distinguished for most regions and locations).

I have used thedata on total health care spending, shown in T able 18.3 and Figure 18.2, forthe same analysis as that discussed above, with one difference: the muchgreater number of observations makes it possible to estimate the effects ofregion and location as well as an elasticity with respect to total expenditure.Total Expenditure per Person, 1968 Dollars per Y ear (PCE)Expenditure per Person on Health Care, 1968 Dollars per Y ear (HEA) 100 200 500 1000 2000125102050100Figure 18.1 Family Health Spending versus Total Family Spending, by Inc ome Quartile, in 10 South American Cities Table 18.3 Mean Values of Total Family Expenditure (PCE) and Private Health Care Spending (HEA), within Each of Nine Classes of Total Family Expenditure, by Urban and Rural Areas, in Four Regions of Brazil (Cruzeiros of August 1974 per Year).

Moreover, at anylevel of total spending, rural families spend the most on health care, fami-lies in small and medium-sized cities spend less and households in thelargest urban areas (seven of which are distinguished in the four regionsstudied) spend the least. These relations are tested by regression analysis,the results of which appear in T able 18.4. Regional differences as a wholeare significant, because spending is higher in Region 5 than in Region 4, butmost pairs of regions do not differ. The metropolitan/other urban/ruraldifferences are significant and of the order of 30 percent (urban) and 50 per-cent (rural) with respect to metropolitan areas. The estimated income elas-ticity is 1.17, and differs insignificantly among the four specifications tested.There is no evidence, in the range of total expenditure studied, either of sat-uration at high incomes or of a threshold below which families show a muchhigher elasticity. All three of these results\u2014the high income elasticity, the regional differ- ences and the differences by location\u2014are consistent with the followingsimple model: total health care spending is a normal good, with an incomeelasticity declining toward one [Newhouse (1977)], but private care is aFigure 18.2 Brazil: Family Health Spending versus Total Family Spending by Income and City or Region 500 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200150 20 101002001,0002,0005,00010,000 Total Family Expenditure (PCE), thousands of August 1974 cruzeiros per yearFamily Expenditure on Health Care (HEA),August 1974 cruzeiros per year Metropolitan AreasOther Urban Areas (URB)Rural Areas (RUR)Family Health Care Spending in Latin America 369 luxury relative to publicly-provided free or subsidized services. Therefore private health care spending can have an elasticity above one even at veryhigh incomes, because as household incomes rise, private services replacepublic services; and at a given level of income private spending will behigher where fewer public services are available. In Brazil, most publichealth care is provided through the Instituto Nacional de Assist\u00eanciaM\u00e9dica da Previd\u00eancia Social (INAMPS), which is part of the social secu-rity system. Expenditures by INAMPS are high relative to government taxrevenues (including the payroll taxes which finance much of the system) inthe poorer regions of the country [McGreevey (1982, p. 54)] so that thereis some net transfer from richer to poorer regions; but expenditures percapita are still lower in the poorer regions [McGreevey (1982, T ables 8 andV .14)]. Private expenditure is higher in Region 4 (Center-West), whereINAMPS spending per head of population is 95 percent of the nationalTable 18.4 Brazil, 1974: Private Family Health Care Spending as a Function of Total Family Expenditure, Region and Metropolitan/Other Urban/Rural Differences.

This relation breaks down,however, for Region 5 (Northeast, the poorest part of the country), whereINAMPS spending is only half the national average and private spending isalso lowest; in this comparison, private and public spending appear to becomplements rather than substitutes, perhaps because the relative impor-tance of different components of medical care changes. (This point is con-sidered further, below.) As for the metropolitan/other urban/rural differences, coverage of the population by INAMPS is more complete in urban areas, although Brazil isone of the relatively few Latin American countries in which there is sub-stantial rural coverage [Zschock (1983, pp. 35-37)]. Much of theurban/rural difference might be due to the difficulties of providing publichealth care to agricultural workers, so I repeated the analysis in T able 18.3using an agricultural/non-agricultural classification. Private expenditure ishigher, for a given total expenditure, in the agricultural sector, as expected;there is also no significant difference among the three agricultural occupa-tions distinguished in the survey, or among the eight non-agricultural occu-pations. However, the way in which INAMPS provides care probably exag-gerates the real difference in private spending by location: in themetropolitan areas, most health care is provided directly, with little or noout-of-pocket cost to the consumer, whereas in smaller cities and rural areasINAMPS often reimburses consumers for private expenditures, as well aspaying other public-sector institutions for services provided. Since thehousehold budget data do not show medical spending net of reimburse-ments, private costs are somewhat overstated in non-metropolitan areas[Zschock (1983, p. 6)]. Data do not seem to have been assembled showingthe distinction between direct provision and reimbursements for urban andrural areas; but 'complementary services paid by INAMPS', which includereimbursements, are available by state and region [McGreevey (1982, p.116)]; these are a slightly higher share of total outlays in the more ruralNortheast, and a notably low share in the more urban South of the country. The simple constant-elasticity relation characterizing total private health spending does not apply to all components; regional and locational differencesin spending also vary according to which component is studied. T able 18.5shows mean expenditures on the two items which diverge most from thepattern for the total\u2014drugs and medicines, and hospitalization and surgery.The data for the former are also displayed in Figure 18.3, which shows thatexpenditure on drugs tends toward saturation, irrespective of region andTable 18.5 Mean Values of Private Family Expenditure on Drugs and Medicines and on Hospitalization and Surgery, within Each of Nine Classes of Total Family Expenditure, by Urban and Rural Areas, in Four Regions of Brazil (Cruzeiros of August1974 per Year).

Rural spending is higher than in metropolitan or other urban areas at high levels of total household spending, but at low levels, rural familiesappear to spend less on drugs and medicines; this may reflect a distribution ofthe poorest rural families in areas where even pharmacies are rare, so that theexplanation again turns on the availability of the goods and services. Hospitalization and surgery, in contrast, shows an explosive growth with increasing income; this is undoubtedly the category for which private care ismost clearly a luxury compared to public hospital services, so that the poor-est families spend essentially nothing in this category. Metropolitan/otherurban/rural differences do not seem to be stable across regions, but there arepronounced regional differences, with especially high expenditure in Region3 (South) in all three locations. Brazil is unusual among Latin Americancountries in having a high share of private hospital beds [Zschock (1983,Metropolitan Areas Other Urban Areas (URB)Rural Areas (RUR)Family Expenditure on Drugs and Medication,August 1974 cruzeiros per year Total Family Expenditure (PCE), thousands of August 1974 cruzeiros per year1 2 5 10 20 50 100 20020501002005001,0002,000Figure 18.3 Brazil: Family Spending on Drugs and Medications versus Total Family Spending by City or RegionFamily Health Care Spending in Latin America 373 T able 2)], which may be concentrated in the relatively urban, high-income South of the country. Of course, to the extent that private hospital care isreimbursed to consumers, net expenditures may be exaggerated much morethan net total private health care spending.

T o analyze the adequacy of spend-ing, and the distribution of financial burden among sources of finance andhouseholds, we used simple comparisons and linear regression analyses.Most of the analyses consider all the Member States, to maximize the num-ber of observations, and cover a wide range of incomes. Some analyses werealso conducted on a regional basis, the results of which are sometimesreported, but not shown in detail. The principal source of our data is the set of national health accounts estimates prepared by WHO, with revisions up to 31 May 2001. Because ofsubsequent revisions, the numbers do not always match those that havebeen published previously (1). The estimates refer to 1997, although theymay be based on data for earlier years as well. We do not discuss the primarydata sources or estimation methods here, since they have been describedelsewhere (2). The quality of the information varies considerably amongcountries, so that initial estimates for 1997 were classified as follows: \"com-plete data with high reliability\", \"incomplete data with high-to-mediumreliability\", or \"incomplete data with low reliability\". Originally, there wereonly 15 countries in the last category. The classification has not been Co-authored with Riadh Zeramdini and Guy Carrin. Reprinted, with permission, from Bulletin of the World Health Organization 80(2), February 2002.376 Health Economics in Development modified as improved data have been obtained, so the data for a country are at least as good as the categorization shown here. We do not expect thatrevisions to the data used here will significantly modify the patterns found. The three data categories are always distinguished in the graphical pre- sentations which follow, and in the statistical analyses. T able 19.1 showsWHO estimates {of three absolute expenditures in international dollars percapita, and of nine percentage shares}, and T able 19.2 classifies countriesaccording to WHO region and per capita income level, distinguished as fol-lows: very low income ( /H11021US$ 1000), low (US$ 1000-2200), middle (US$ 2200-7000), and high-income ( /H11022US$ 7000). Although WHO regions are further divided into strata according to estimated adult and child mortalitylevels (3), as indicated in T able 19.2, we did not analyze the data accordingto the strata because sometimes there were very few countries in aregion/mortality cell. The analysis begins with total health spending relative to gross domestic product (GDP), as a function of GDP per capita (GDPC). T o visualize rela-tions to income, we took natural logarithms of all money amounts. Fig. 19.1shows the share of total health expenditures in GDP as a percentage ofGDP (THE%GDP), as a function of Ln (GDPC), over the income range6-11 (ca. US$ 400-60,000). Figs. 19.2 to 19.4 refer to the same incomerange. All graphical, and most statistical, analyses refer to percentage shares,relative to total health expenditure, government revenues, or total public orcentral government expenditure. Comparisons to the need for healthspending, however, require amounts in US$, so per capita levels of totalhealth expenditure, out-of-pocket spending, and total public spending arecompared to per capita income in purchasing power parity dollars (PPP$). What Do Countries Spend on Health? The THE%GDP rises from 2% to 9% as income increases (Fig. 19.1). Regression analysis shows that health spending is (slightly) a luxury good:the regression coefficient on income for all countries together is 0.0109,and 0.0137 for the set of 72 countries with high-quality national expendi-ture data. The complete regression statistics for all three country groupsaccording to data quality, and for all 191 countries together, are shown inT able 19.3. In this and all other regressions, the absolute value of the coef-ficient is greater for the high-quality data, but the difference between theestimated coefficients for all countries and for the high-reliability group isaCountries are classified according to whether their data are judged by WHO to be complete and of high reliability (H), incomple te and of medium to high reliability (M), or incomplete and of low reliability (L). bAbbreviations HE /H11005 /H11005 purchasing power parity.Table 19.1 National Health Accounts Estimates for 191 WHO Member States for 1997, Revised Data as of 31

coefficients always differ from zero. The fit of the regression line, adjusted for degrees of freedom, sometimes improvessubstantially when only the most reliable data are used. In summary, theinclusion of lower quality data introduces additional \"noise\", but does notappreciably change the slope of any relation. A better comparison would be to use per capita income net of subsis- tence, rather than income without deduction for basic needs, but there is nocommon estimate of the concept. Many countries are so poor (28 haveincomes under US$ 1000 per year; T able 19.2) that spending even 4% oftotal income on health is equivalent to a high share of non-subsistenceincome, comparable to that in richer countries. The share of health spend-ing in total income varies greatly at all income levels: the standard deviationof the share is 0.014 for the very low income group, and 0.0198-0.021 forthe three higher income groups. The health share of GDP ranges from /H110213% to 6% among African coun- tries at incomes under US$ 2500. This is as high as the 5-10% spreadamong the Americas at incomes of US$ 10 000-20 000, or the 3-6% rangein the Eastern Mediterranean Region, for the same income interval. Thiscounter-intuitive result\u2014that countries which seem to have less scope forvariation nonetheless vary as much as countries with more leeway forspending differences\u2014shows up repeatedly in the analyses.Table 19.3 Regression Statistics for Health Expenditure as a Percentage of Gross Domestic Product DATA QUALITY REGRESSION STATISTIC LOW MEDIUM-TO-HIGH HIGH ALL DATA Constant 104 72 191 aProbability that the true value of the coefficient is zero.Basic Patterns in National Health Expenditure 389 Shares of GDP translate into a wide range of US$ amounts per capita. All health expenditures are converted to US$ at the same PPP$ rates as incomes,because health-specific price indices are unavailable. Relative differences arelargest in poor countries, as high as 5:1 at incomes under US$ 5000, but areabout 2:1 among most countries at incomes of US$ 10 000-20 000. Thereare no marked regional differences in the shape or slope of the expendi-ture/income relation, so we do not show the results by region. There are big-ger differences in how health is financed, but these do not systematicallyaffect the total. In most countries, total health spending is low (less than US$45 per person per year in 25 countries with incomes below US$ 1000) andbelow US$ 110 in another 32 countries at incomes under US$ 2200. Some countries spend less than the cost of a package of cost-effective serv- ices, estimated in 1993 to be US$ 12 per capita in very poor countries andUS$ 22 in middle-income countries (4). This is not enough to assure avail-ability of even a few highly justified services to the whole population, whetherthe justification is based on cost-effectiveness, protection from catastrophicexpense, or other criteria. Inadequate spending in this sense is distinct fromlow health expenditure causing loss of potential economic growth (5). Paying Beforehand or When Care is Needed Because of its relation to financial risk, the crucial distinction in health spending is between prepayment in all forms, and payment out-of-pocket attime of service. Small out-of-pocket costs are harmless for all but the poor-est users. High cost spending, however, should be covered via prepaymentto avoid the risk of impoverishment, or of doing without needed care. Sincethe poorer a person is, the lower is the threshold for catastrophic expenses,the out-of-pocket share ought to be lower in poorer countries. However,exactly the opposite occurs: at low incomes, the average out-of-pocket shareis high and extremely variable (20-80% of all health spending, Fig. 19.2). With increasing income, the range also narrows: the standard deviation of the share drops 0.220-0.160 between the low- and high-income groups.Except for four or five countries with highly reliable data, there is a sharpfrontier of maximal out-of-pocket spending in the total, visible as adownward-sloping diagonal in Fig. 19.2. This frontier also shows up sepa-rately in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas and the Eastern Mediterraneanand North Africa, but not in Europe, where the out-of-pocket share isnearly always below 40%. Regression analysis gives an income coefficient of390 Health Economics in Development -0.0635 for the share of out-of-pocket expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure (OOP%THE) for all countries together, and -0.0862for countries with high-quality data. Both coefficients are significantly neg-ative (T able 19.4). The declining share of out-of-pocket spending does notoffset the rise in total spending on health, so the dollar amount spent out ofpocket climbs rapidly but not quite proportionately as income and totalspending increase. Absolute spending amounts are analyzed below. A given overall share of out-of-pocket financing represents little finan- cial risk to households when it is low and distributed in proportion to capac-ity to pay. Everyone then buys those, and only those, health goods and serv-ices that are individually affordable. In other cases, important financial riskis indicated by the percentage of households whose estimated health costsexceeded 50% of their income net of food expenditures, a measure of cata-strophic spending. In household surveys in 21 countries, this proportion isusually below 5% of all households, but in a few cases the share exceeds10% (6). There is no relation between this share and the level of income.The sample is rather small and includes no high-income countries; andthere is no clear connection between the level of out-of-pocket spendingand the fraction of households with very high levels of such spending. Pre-liminary WHO results from a larger sample of 44 countries, including somethat are richer than the 21 countries considered here, seem to show this Table 19.4 Regression Statistics for Out of Pocket Payments as a Percentage of Total Health Expenditure DATA QUALITY REGRESSION STATISTIC LOW MEDIUM-TO-HIGH HIGH ALL DATA Constant 72 191 aSee footnote a, table 19.3Basic Patterns in National Health Expenditure 391 effect: the share of households with catastrophic spending, and the share of catastrophic spending in the total, both fall somewhat with rising income. Household survey data usually do not indicate how families financed such catastrophic expenditures, but in India health needs often push fami-lies into selling assets or borrowing cash, even in the upper-income quin-tiles. Only about one-half of all families can afford a medical emergency outof current income or savings, and the loss of savings leaves them exposed toother risks (7). Similar evidence comes from a survey in northern Viet Namin 1995: only 30% of poor households could rely on savings to pay forhealth services, while close to 40% had to spend less on essential items (foodor fuel), or borrow money, or sell livestock (8). Reduced risk of asset loss orimpoverishment is the chief benefit from extending prepayment and con-fining out-of-pocket payment to easily affordable services. How is Prepayment Financed? Some mechanisms are not widely used and contribute little to total health spending, such as \"health cards'' bought in advance of need and which enti-tle purchasers to a restricted amount of care. This was the case in the ThaiHealth Card Program established in 1983. In 1992, the program was con-verted to a voluntary health insurance program with a broad benefit pack-age (9). Aside from schemes like these, there are three basic ways to financeprepayment: private insurance (voluntary or employment-related), socialhealth insurance contributions, and taxes (general revenue). All publiclyfinanced health is prepaid; private spending is divided between insuranceand out-of-pocket payments. When private insurance is negligible, which isthe case in most countries and virtually all poor countries, the prepay-ment/out-of-pocket distinction coincides with that between public and pri-vate expenditure. Public spending is then the complement of out-of-pocketspending. Relative to total health spending, public spending shows a simi-lar frontier, for the minimum rather than the maximum share (Fig. 19.3). The share of public health expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure (PHE%THE) rises with income, with a regression coefficientof 0.0573 for all countries together and 0.0758 for countries with the mostreliable data (T able 19.5). Europe is the only region where the public shareis always above 40% and nearly always above 60%, with little relation toincome. Finally, the relative variation in public spending shrinks: thestandard deviation decreases from 0.228 in the low-income group to 0.160392 Health Economics in Development at high incomes. This illustrates the same phenomenon as the reduced vari- ation in the out-of-pocket share in total health spending. Public spendingincludes both social health insurance contributions (the \"Bismarck'' model)and general revenues or \"tax-funded'' expenditure (the \"Beveridge'' model).The latter is the predominant, often the only, mode in most countries (Fig.19.4). Countries where social security is the principal mode of public spend-ing are concentrated in Europe (10). In high-income countries, eithermodel can achieve essentially universal financial protection and account fora large share of total health expenditure. In low-income countries often nei-ther mode accounts for even half of total spending. The social security/general revenue distinction shows no convergence as income rises. High-income countries rely chiefly on one model or theother, whereas at lower incomes part of the population is covered by socialhealth insurance and another part is protected by Ministry of Healthfinancing, chiefly from general revenue. Particularly in Latin America,there is a great variety of institutional arrangements, and the populationnominally covered under one scheme often also uses services financed by adifferent mode (11). The lack of convergence and the variety of financingcombinations arise for historical reasons, unrelated to income. There isconsiderable debate whether social health insurance or general taxation isTable 19.5 Regression Statistics for Public Health Expenditure as a Percentage of Total Health Expenditure DATA QUALITY REGRESSION STATISTIC LOW MEDIUM-TO-HIGH HIGH ALL DATA Constant 72 191 aSee footnote a, table 19.3Basic Patterns in National Health Expenditure 393 better (12), but nothing can be concluded from financing data alone, espe- cially when public expenditure of both kinds together is only a small shareof the total. The third main mode of prepayment, private insurance, is virtually non- existent in the majority of countries. In only 47 countries does it account for5% of private health expenditure (only five of which are in Africa), and thatmay mean a share of total spending as low as 1-2%. Private insurance is evenmore of a luxury than public spending, being important at high incomes,mostly in a few countries of the Americas and Europe. This is not surpris-ing, since so many countries are poor and many people cannot afford ameaningful degree of financial protection of this form. Unless they are pro-tected by publicly-financed health care, including the possibility of publicsubsidies for private insurance, many people rely on out-of-pocket financingand face the risk of catastrophic costs (1). Even where it is affordable by alarger part of the population, private insurance is not widespread in mostcountries because of the efficiency problems inherent in the distribution ofmedical risk among people, and uncertainty both on their part and on thatof insurers (13). The shares of insurance in total health spending vary considerably, from a significant form of prepayment (as in South Africa and the USA), to acomplement of publicly funded services (as in Canada and several Euro-pean and Latin American countries). The importance of private insurancealso depends on whether the well-off must purchase it and leave the publicsystem (as in the Netherlands), or may direct their social security contribu-tions to private insurers (in Chile). Employers purchasing for their employ-ees account for a large share of insurance in Brazil and the USA, and formuch of health financing in the formal sector in many other countries. How Much of Public Spending Goes for Health? Public expenditure on health can be low because of low total public expen- diture, or because a low share of public expenditure is devoted to health, orboth. The ratio of public spending on health to total general governmentexpenditure (PHE%TPE) seldom exceeds 20% and is below 10% for mostcountries, including almost all of the African and the Eastern Mediter-ranean Regions. The share increases as income rises, approximately from5% to 10%, with an income coefficient of 0.0159 for all countries together394 Health Economics in Development and 0.0161 for countries with more reliable data (T able 19.6). Variation around the mean share stays fairly constant across the four income groups,the standard deviation varying from 0.038 to 0.045. IMF estimates of this relationship calculate total central government expenditure relative to GDP , and the shares for health, education, defenseand interest payments (14, 15). These estimates do not match the nationalhealth account numbers estimated by WHO, when much expenditurepasses through subnational governments, as in Brazil, China, and India.The average share of GDP spent by central governments increases onlyslightly (from 24% to 29%) from very low- to middle-income countries,with a further increase to 32% among high-income countries. Within thelower income groups, and often within each mortality stratum, there is vari-ation of as much as 3:1. Failure to capture much of a country's income for public use does not generally explain low health spending in poor countries, but it helpsaccount for the low shares that central governments spend for health incountries such as El Salvador, China, and the United Arab Emirates. Chi-nese spending is much higher when general rather than central governmentis included. At high incomes and low mortality, the shares converge some-what for total spending, but less so for health expenditure. The relationbetween the two fractions of GDP fans out as central government accountsTable 19.6 Regression Statistics for Public Health Expenditure as a Percentage of Total Public Expenditure DATA QUALITY REGRESSION STATISTIC LOW MEDIUM-TO-HIGH HIGH ALL DATA Constant 72 191 aSee footnote a, table 19.3Basic Patterns in National Health Expenditure 395 for more of the economy. This is consistent with the widening variation in the share of GDP spent on health. Summary of findings The analysis of national health accounts estimates does not lead to striking or unexpected conclusions, so far as shares are concerned. Analysis ofabsolute dollar amounts shows that out-of-pocket spending, total healthexpenditure and total public spending all rise with income. The respectivedouble-logarithmic elasticities are 0.9733, 1.2052 and 1.1431, for all coun-tries together (T ables 19.7 to 19.9). When only the highly reliable data areused, the corresponding estimated coefficients are 0.8839, 1.2223, and1.1944. These elasticities mean that the share of out-of-pocket spending inGDP falls modestly as countries become richer, and that such spendingtakes a decreasing share of non-subsistence income and becomes less of aburden on average. In contrast, both total health expenditure and total pub-lic expenditure of all kinds rise with income. The relationships between different health expenditure concepts fall into two groups: some do not converge toward a common pattern as income Table 19.7 Regression Statistics for Out-of-Pocket Payments per Capita as a Function of Income per Capita DATA QUALITY REGRESSION STATISTIC LOW MEDIUM-TO-HIGH HIGH ALL DATA Constant 72 190 aSee footnote a, table 19.3396 Health Economics in Development rises, whereas others clearly do. The former group includes the share of GDP spent on health; the share of public spending financed by general rev-enue rather than by social security; and the share of health in total govern-ment spending. Countries show little or no regularity in these shares. Asincome rises there is a convergence in the average level of the shares ofTable 19.8 Regression Statistics for Total Health Expenditure per Capita as a Function of Income per Capita DATA QUALITY REGRESSION STATISTIC LOW MEDIUM-TO-HIGH HIGH ALL DATA Constant 72 191 aSee footnote a, table 19.3 Table 19.9 Regression Statistics for Total Public Expenditure per Capita as a Function of Income per Capita DATA QUALITY REGRESSION STATISTIC LOW MEDIUM-TO-HIGH HIGH ALL DATA Constant 72 191 aSee footnote a, table 19.3Basic Patterns in National Health Expenditure 397 health spending represented by public expenditure (increasing) and by out- of-pocket spending (decreasing). There is an even more marked commonpattern for the variation in those shares at a given income level. As incomerises, the relative variation in health spending among countries narrows; thepublic share becomes more uniformly high; and that of out-of-pocketspending becomes more uniformly low. Increased prepayment, most ofwhich is public, is what allows the out-of-pocket share to fall markedly. Thisreduces catastrophic financial risk for households, while avoiding the mar-ket failure that makes competitive, private health insurance inefficient,because those who need it most can least afford it, if insurers charge accord-ing to risks (15). Several conclusions emerge, as outlined below: In many poor countries total health spending is very low, even compared to the cost of a package of highly justified interventions. Out-of-pocket spending is already catastrophic for several percent of households. Even if consumers were willing to pay more for better qual-ity services, the poor could not pay much more and would require pref-erential treatment (16). Prepayment via health insurance is limited to the wealthy and those with formal employment. The poor could afford meaningful insurance cover-age only with public subsidy. These conclusions, and the need to provide public goods and services with large externalities (which private markets will not deliver adequately), makepublic expenditure on health particularly important in poor countries.However, these are the countries with the lowest relative public spendingin health. What actually happens appears to be at odds with what is needed. Needs Versus Actual Spending Nothing here indicates how much a country should spend on health, because there is no consensus as to what services to finance for its citizens,and different packages of services have different costs. It is particularlydifficult to specify appropriate voluntary private spending on health, sincepeople differ not only in needs, but in their tastes and their degree of riskaversion. Nonetheless, a given package of services corresponds to a rela-tively well-defined minimum cost, if it is provided for the whole population.398 Health Economics in Development If a country is to deliver that package, it should spend at least the corre- sponding minimum amount. (It might spend considerably more for thesame package, because the way health is financed can greatly affect costs.) The cost for a package will depend on several characteristics of the country, including its income. The package might cost more to provide inhigh-income countries than in low-income ones, because inputs are moreexpensive. But in poorer countries, it may instead be costlier to reach every-one because the population is widely dispersed. The low level of schoolingand worse health status may also require more intensive intervention. Thus,the need for spending the services in the package may be constant, ordeclining with per capita income, at least at low incomes. Whatever the relationship between income and total need relative to the package, the need for public expenditure on those services, as a share of the Total expenditure Public expenditure Need for public expenditure WHO 01.222Ln (GDP per capita) A-B Gap on total need versus expenditure at GDP of Y* C-D Gap on public need versus expenditure at GDP of Y*Ln (need and expenditure) A B C D Y*Total needFigure 19.5 Hypothesized Needs and Actual Spending for an Essential Package of Health Services versus Gross Domestic Product(GDP) per CapitaBasic Patterns in National Health Expenditure 399 total need, almost surely declines with income. This can happen either by declining absolutely, or by rising more slowly the richer a country becomes.People can spend more privately, because out-of-pocket expenses are lessonerous, or they can afford wider private insurance coverage. More publicspending would simply crowd out some of that private expenditure. The relation between actual total spending and actual public spending is just the opposite of that for needs: the difference between them narrows asincome rises. Any gap between needs and actual expenditure is greater forthe public component than for the total (Fig. 19.5). For a country withGDP per capita of Y*, spending is not enough to provide the package toeveryone and there is a gap, A-B; the public gap, C-D, is much larger. Evenif the total gap were closed, there might still be a shortfall of public spend-ing. Part of the population would not benefit from the services, and theadditional expenditure would buy other interventions and be distributedless equitably. These findings indicate that the challenge for poorer coun-tries is not merely to spend more on health, but to spend more equitably byincreasing prepayment, especially for potentially catastrophic expenses, andby public resources. Rich countries have not converged on a single healthfinancing model or institutional arrangement, but they have converged ona high degree of protection from financial risk through prepayment.

Economic crisis versus structural adjustment It is difficult to distinguish the demographic consequences of structural adjustment from the reactions to the economic crisis which provokes theneed for adjustment, whether or not that adjustment is part of a formal pro-gram involving short-term foreign assistance and policy advice from insti-tutions such as the World Bank. Thus it is not clear that whatever bad con-sequences for health occur should be attributed to the adjustment program(Cornia 1989) rather than to the economic mismanagement, sheer bad luck,or other factors causing the crisis. Focusing on the adjustment process maymean supposing that the alternative was not to adjust, rather than suppos-ing that the only choice a country faced was how to get its macroeconomyback into balance, and how soon to start doing so. Whether adjustment looks like needlessly throwing the car into a skid and a possible collision, dependson whether the alternative looks like going over a cliff. The general ques-tion is whether the economic crisis, including such responses to it as a \u00a9IUSSP 1997. Reprinted from Demographic Responses to Economic Adjustment in Latin America, edited by Georges T apinos, Andrew Mason, and Jorge Bravo. (Inter- national Studies in Demography, 1997), by permission of Oxford University Press.402 Health Economics in Development formal adjustment program, has had any systematic effect on health policy. Specific policy changes may be part of, or linked to, specific decisions onadjustment, but they need not be: they may be contemporaneous reactionsto aspects of the crisis itself. Connections to demographic phenomena Ultimately, one wants to know what happened to births, deaths, age distri- butions, and other quantifiable demographic variables. This chapter doesnot carry the story that far, except for a brief discussion of previous empiri-cal research on the health consequences of the crisis of the (early) 1980s.One of these sources (Grosh 1990) concentrated on expenditure on healthcare; the other (Musgrove 1988) also considered the output of services andthe outcomes for health in the population. But since next to nothing wasknown about morbidity, the scant evidence available on health outcomesconcerns mortality. Here the emphasis is on what, if anything, happened to health policy. It is possible a priori that crisis or adjustment made for substantial changes in health policy, but without having much effect on anyone's health status. Itis just as possible that there were large effects on morbidity and mortality,but that these had little to do with any official policy. T o consider the like-lihood of these and other possible outcomes, it will help first to think of thechannels by which an economic downturn can affect health, and then toconsider whether and how policy\u2014particularly health policy\u2014may beimportant in each of those channels. Channels for health effects of economic crisis Almost anything can affect one's health, and almost nothing in a modern economy is immune from the effects of economic contraction, so there ishardly any limit to the ways that economic crisis might affect the health ofthe population. Many of the possible channels are, however, likely to bequantitatively unimportant, affecting very few people or changing the inci-dence or prevalence of disease or other variables by insignificant amounts.Figure 20.1 (modified from Musgrove 1988) shows the principal ways bywhich an economic crisis could be expected to have significant effects onhealth. The diagram is incomplete in two demographically importantrespects: it does not show any of the mechanisms likely to affect birth rates,and because it has no spatial dimension it does not suggest impacts onmigration.TTTT Lower quantity or quality ofpublic services TT TTT T TT TTEconomic Crisis and Health Policy Response 403 Some of the channels portrayed are direct\u2014that is, they modify the like- lihood of getting sick or hurt, or dying\u2014while others are indirect, in thatthey pass through the health care system and would show no effect if thecrisis did not affect that system. T o the extent that publicly provided (orpublicly subsidized) health care is free to users, it is particularly importantwhat happens to the publicly-funded health sector.

Whether the relation between need and demandfor health care changes during an economic downturn is one of the majorquestions to which policy might be addressed. In principle, one or more kinds of public policy are relevant to every channel of mediation between economic events and demographic out-comes, including health. Some of these, such as policies affecting prices,wages, and employment, are crucial to adjustment programs. Health policycan affect only some of the channels although, on a broad definition, theseeffects can reach far beyond the narrower decisions concerning the publicprovision of medical care. The diagram distinguishes those paths for whichhealth policy is most relevant, in both the broad sense, including regulationand incentives, and in the narrow sense of spending public resources to buyor produce health care. The reach and importance of health policy Health policy is essentially unable to affect people's employment and income at the moment of a crisis, however much the provision of healthcare may overcome disabilities and raise people's productivities in the longrun. The direct economic effects of economic downturn on health are there- fore beyond the reach of health policy. Other direct effects, however, maybe more amenable to control: health policy affecting the environment, andpublic health measures generally, are examples. Among the indirect effects,it is not only the public provision of care that responds to health policy; itmay be just as important to determine who has access to social securitymedical care, or to regulate the private insurance market. In general, it canbe expected that these indirect consequences of policy become moreimportant as the economy, and the health sector, become more differenti-ated and complex. In a poor country where few people can afford privatedoctors and all hospital care is publicly provided, public policy affectshealth through fewer channels than in a richer country with a large privatemedical sector and substantial private insurance. Thus, apart from differ-ences in the specific health policies of one and another country, there aredifferences in the reach of policy; this is reason enough to suspect that sim- ple relations between policy and outcomes will be hard to find or nonexist-ent, that what is true of Nicaragua or Bolivia will not characterizeArgentina or Brazil.Economic Crisis and Health Policy Response 405 Health Policy: Definition, Ambiguity, and Attribution Up to this point, the phrase \"health policy\" has been used as though it needed no definition and presented no ambiguity: it should be possible to tell what apolicy is, whether and how it has changed, what caused any such change, andwhat effect that might be expected to have on health and demographic vari-ables. On closer examination, all these assumptions appear questionable. What do we mean by health policy? Consider two extreme possible meanings for these words. One is that health policy is defined by the declarations of governments, in the broadest termsand at the highest political level. In that sense, every government that partici-pated in the Alma Ata Conference in 1978 has a policy of giving priority toprimary health care (World Health Organization 1978). Everything else\u2014thedefinition of strategies for implementation, the decisions about investment,budget allocation, and regulation\u2014would then be just the expression orworking out of the policy. The limitations of this view are well known: whatgovernments (and others) do, does not necessarily follow from what they say.In any case, what was said is often left so vague that it is hard even to tellwhether a given action or decision is consistent with the supposed \"policy\". At the other extreme, everything that a government does can be regarded as revealing or conforming to an implicit policy: \"real\" policy isthe sum of actions. But this is no easier to interpret, because actions are sonumerous, and so often apparently inconsistent, that policy may be toocomplex to mean anything more general. Policy itself may also be contra-dictory, which is hard to tell from the absence of policy. We are left with thepuzzlement of Alice, listening to the White Knight explain the differencebetween the Thing, and the Name of the Thing, and What the Thing isCalled, and What the Name of the Thing is Called (Carroll 1865, chapter8). At the very least, it must be recognized that policy may be defined at dif-ferent levels of generality, and bear different relations to what actually goeson in a health sector. Change in policy is therefore at least equally compli-cated, and different policies could change in inconsistent directions underthe same, or simultaneous but unrelated, impulses. How can we tell if policy has changed? Clearly a change in rhetoric is a different thing from a change in activity, so whether a change in policy has occurred depends on whether one is406 Health Economics in Development concerned with words or deeds. But there is another dimension to policy change which is more subtle and probably more important than the dis-tinction between saying and doing. That is the conditional reach of a policy, the period over which and the circumstances under which it is supposed toapply. Consider a Ministry of Health whose budget has for several years been growing at 5 percent per annum, and which has routinely devoted 10 per-cent of the budget to capital investment. In the first year of an economic cri-sis\u2014of unpredictable depth and duration\u2014the budget is cut by 10 percent(the same as for the government budget generally), and all investment isstopped, leaving the recurrent budget the same as the year before. Wasthere a change of policy? If \"policy\" meant a constant share for investment,then clearly policy changed. But if it meant never reducing recurrent expen-diture, then there was no change in policy, and the stoppage of investmentwas necessary to uphold the policy. This simple example illustrates two important issues. First, it is neither easy nor fair to infer policies solely from certain actions. Criticizing the out-come is a different matter, and does not depend on what happened to pol-icy along the way. Second, governments have competing objectives\u2014tokeep investing to expand services, but also to try never to cut existing serv-ices\u2014and in general, they do not really have a policy for reconciling those conflicts when suddenly choices have to be made. Policies are seldom or neverspelled out with all the \"ifs\" and \"buts\" that circumstances may impose, par-ticularly if that would require a long planning horizon. As another example,there are good reasons why public expenditure on health care should becounter-cyclical, to cope with the fluctuation of needs mentioned earlier(Musgrove 1984), but no government in Latin America has such a policy. Itwould imply a privileged position for health in recessions (which every Min-ister of Health would endorse), but require reduced spending or at leastreduced growth in boom times (which no Minister seems prepared toaccept). It seems more nearly the case that there is one policy in good timesand another in bad times, with no policy for getting from one situation tothe other. Attributing causes and effects Much of the focus on the possible damage from recession and adjustment is on the issue of public spending, but the more interesting questions abouthealth policy are not so narrow. Is there a shift among different kinds ofEconomic Crisis and Health Policy Response 407 interventions? Between one institution and another for delivery of care? Between hospital and ambulatory care? Does the government change itsmind about user fees or internal prices and tariffs? Does it change the waystaff are hired, assigned, or promoted? Does it change the way inputs otherthan staff are ordered and allocated, or the way they are paid for and the waythey are combined with human inputs? Change in any of these dimensionsmay carry implications for the budget, but the impact may be very differentfrom what the money amounts would suggest, and even run in the oppositedirection. An economic crisis is likely to have two kinds of adverse effects on health. It reduces people's incomes and therefore both exposes them to increasedrisk of getting sick and makes it harder for them to buy medical care if theyneed it; and it reduces government revenues and therefore makes it harderto provide or subsidize health services. Health policy cannot do anythingabout the loss of income, whether individual or public, but it can affect allthree of the possible consequences just described. A good health policy, or a good change in existing policy, would main- tain the output of those services most essential to health, or even extendthem, for the counter-cyclical reason mentioned earlier. It would reducewaste in the system both in the sense of technical inefficiency or lowerthan possible output for given inputs, and in the allocative sense of givingpriority to those interventions which buy the greatest increase in healthstatus per dollar spent (Jamison, Mosley, Measham. and Bobadilla 1993).Moreover, to the extent that economic hardship was regressive, policywould become offsettingly progressive, taking particular care to protectthe poor. The latter aspect is usually described as \"equity\", although it isonly one of the possible meanings of equity in a health care system (Mus-grove 1986). Thus the opportunity for good change in policy is greater theworse policy was before the crisis. It is easier to fast, if one is too fat to startwith, and it is easier to become more efficient or progressive if the systemwas initially wasteful or regressive. Ceteris paribus, we should expect improvements in health policy to be correlated negatively with the qualityof prior policy. Policy or policy change is bad if it reduces service coverage more than necessary, reduces it more than proportionally for the most valuable serv-ices, cuts back more on services to the neediest, or makes provision less effi-cient by (further) unbalancing the combination of inputs. The better a sys-tem was functioning before an economic shock, the greater the risk that itwill become less effective or more regressive or inequitable. Because policy408 Health Economics in Development can be judged by four distinct criteria\u2014total coverage, allocative efficiency, technical efficiency, and progressivity\u2014it is obvious that many possiblepolicy changes look good on one criterion and bad on another, with theirtotal effect uncertain. Such ambiguous policies are particularly likely tohave redistributional effects, benefiting or protecting some groups andworsening the situation of others. A priori, policies such as introducing or raising user fees fall into this category, with their outcome depending onwhat happens to demand, to net revenues, and to purchases of inputs. What Happened in Latin America in the 1980s? There were substantial changes in declared policy or actual public practice in many countries all over the world during the 1980s. In some cases thesechanges resulted from political upheaval rather than simply economic pres-sure; the formerly communist countries of eastern Europe, such as Romania(Fox 1992) or Poland (World Bank 1992), provide the most striking exam-ples. In other cases, changes in the health sector have followed economicshock, as in Indonesia after the collapse of oil prices (World Bank 1991) orin Ghana, following an adjustment program that began in 1983 and led tosubstantial change in budgets and (temporarily) in real user fees (Berk1992). These cases illustrate the diversity of causes leading to changes inhealth policy and the variety of possible responses and outcomes. The rangeof events in Latin America has been somewhat narrower, but it still showsthe importance of political and ideological as well as economic factors inaffecting health policy. Declared policy change: words as policy One approach to the question of how health policy responded to economic stress would be to review all the constitutional and legal changes affectinghealth over the decade in as many countries as possible. A study byFuenzalida-Puelma and Scholle Connor (1989) limited the analysis ofhealth policy to what is specified in national constitutions and certain majorlaws. Not surprisingly, these documents refer primarily to the right tohealth or health care, and sometimes to the duty of the state or governmentto guarantee or provide it. (The constitution of Guyana goes so far as todeclare a right to a happy life, free of disease.) The degree to which rightsand duties are spelled out depends very much on the age of the constitution,Economic Crisis and Health Policy Response 409 and on whether the country has a common law (formerly English) or civil law (formerly Spanish, Portuguese, or French) tradition. Nineteenth-centurydocuments such as the constitutions of 1853 in Argentina or 1886 inColombia (or 1787 in the United States), do not even mention healthexplicitly. Newer charters, particularly those adopted during the 1970s or1980s in such countries as Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala,Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru are much more explicit,sometimes declaring it the duty of the state to provide care (Panama) or toprovide it free to the indigent (El Salvador) or to everyone (Cuba). Over the long run, the analysis of constitutional provisions shows a clear increase in the social importance of health and health care, and a steadyexpansion of \"rights\", generally in the direction of universal access. Whenbudgets fall and services are curtailed or allowed to deteriorate in quality orequity, however, the disjunction between actual practice and the goalsespoused in the law becomes temporarily wider. Certainly the law, at thislevel of generality, offers no guide to what will actually happen under eco-nomic pressure. Evidence on spending: budgets as policy What a government actually spends on health is commonly taken as a test of whether it has \"put its money where its mouth is\". If public expenditureon health care were to change substantially when nothing in the economicenvironment or in the burden of disease faced by society had changed, thatwould indeed be an indication that policy had changed, that health hadacquired greater or lesser priority among claims on public resources. Aneconomic crisis is obviously a poor time for that kind of test, since the eco-nomic environment changes abruptly, and that in turn may directly increasethe burden of ill-health. It is still possible to ask the simpler questionwhether health expenditure was relatively protected or not, but even thenthere are at least three reasonable denominators to compare it to: popu-lation, total public spending, and gross domestic product. These threeratios do not necessarily move together, and even if they do, it is not clearwhat that indicates about policy. Estimates of these ratios for thirteen countries, for 1980-5 or 1980-6, are shown in T able 20.1.

(CostaRica and El Salvador are notable exceptions, where spending declined sub-stantially between 1980 and 1982.) In every country except Honduras and Venezuela, public spending per person on health was lower, sometimes much lower, in the mid-1980s thanit had been at the start of the decade. Whether expenditure could have beenmaintained more generally, despite failing incomes, is an open question: itwould certainly have required a strong counter-cyclical commitment. Theabsence of any policy to give health more priority in times of hardship isalso shown by the decline in the share of GDP which governments devotedto the sector: again, Honduras and Venezuela are exceptions. It may be more reasonable to judge policy by comparing health spend- ing with total public spending. This indicator also fell in most countries,often quite sharply, indicating that health lost in relative budgetary priority.The results are more varied both within and among countries, however.The share rose, at least temporarily, in Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, andUruguay\u2014suggesting that there was no continuous policy but rather a year-to-year improvisation. Certainly these were not, in most countries, years inwhich conditions were favorable to defining and implementing stable,future-oriented policies. Inputs and outputs: allocation and provision as policy The expenditure estimates just presented have been purged, so far as pos- sible, of general price inflation.

Gaps in table indicate data missing in originalsources.412 Health Economics in Development standardize them for price changes specific to the health sector, or for changes in the mixture of inputs used or outputs produced: no one hasmade up the indices necessary for such deflation. Particularly during eco-nomic turmoil, it cannot be assumed that there is a stable relation betweendollars spent and health gains produced. It is therefore natural to lookspecifically at some crude measures of sectoral output and at the absoluteor relative amounts of different inputs used. Given the magnitude of the decline in expenditure, it is surprising to find that public sector health output, in the form of ambulatory consultationsand hospitalization, generally did not fall proportionately in the five coun-tries where these measures were studied (Musgrove 1988: 40-53). There isa great deal of variation among countries and from year to year, but no evi-dence that output depended linearly on budgets. Four possible reasons maybe suggested: 1. Investment was reduced very sharply, at least at the start of the crisis, so that recurrent expenditure was partly protected. This clearly happenedin all countries. 2. Real salaries fell, so that although there was no reduction in public sec- tor health staff, the cost of employing them declined. The tendency ofemployment to grow even during the crisis suggests that one of the fewconstant policies of most governments was to provide jobs for as manymedical graduates as possible. The evidence on salaries is more mixed:these fell more often than not, however, indicating that medical person-nel paid part of the cost of budget reductions. This is a reminder that\"health policy\" is not only policy about patients and their needs but alsoabout staff and their demands, and that a major policy problem is toreconcile these two groups' claims. 3. Existing inefficiencies in the use of resources were reduced, by pro- viding more ambulatory and less hospital care, or more preventive andless curative care, or by making better use of low-level staff relative todoctors, or by improving the balance among staff, drugs, and otherinputs. Here the evidence is extremely mixed. Musgrove (1988) foundalmost no data by which to judge either allocative or technical effi-ciency. Hospital use increased in Honduras, largely because severalnew hospitals had been completed just before the recession began. Itwould have been a change of policy notto put them into operation, and consistent policy meant shortchanging ambulatory care. In Brazil,Economic Crisis and Health Policy Response 413 there was a clear policy to hold down hospitalization and direct more resources to non-hospital care (Piola and Vianna 1991). Grosh (1990)found evidence of reductions in the already low ratios of nurses todoctors, suggesting that inefficiency actually increased in severalcountries during the 1980s. And in the case of social security medicalcare in Peru, Petrera (1989) found that expenditure on drugs wascut drastically while staff increased, clearly indicating a worsening ofinefficiency. 4. Quality declined, so that consultations and hospitalizations made poorer contributions to health improvements than before. This idea is hard todistinguish from that of reduced efficiency, and there is almost no directevidence bearing on it\u2014no evidence, in particular, of lower gains inhealthy life years or other outcome measures. These four possible explanations refer to total output in the form of con- sultations and hospitalizations. It is a different question whether health out-comes varied in relation to sectoral output. Almost nothing systematiccould be found out about allocation among different programs or healthproblems. However, immunization programs were generally protected andthis probably helps account for the continued decline in infant mortality inseveral countries during the 1980s. What do these fragments of evidence say about how health policy reacted to the budget reductions? The short answer has to be, not much:what evidence there is, is too incomplete and inconsistent, and often isbased on very crude indicators. Nonetheless, two conclusions suggestthemselves. One is that there is a cost to changing policy, even whenchanged circumstances require it. The choice may be between leavingnew investments idle, and using them even though cheaper or moreeffective programs had to be cut back, as seems to have occurred in Hon-duras. Because investment in buildings and people takes a long time tomature, quick and substantial changes in input use are difficult and costly.Second, while it might be possible to define coherent policy change withrespect to one objective, there is no easy way to take account of compet-ing objectives. This is true not only when allocating resources to differ-ent treatments, which means making choices among patients, but alsowhen sharing the burden of recession between patients and health sectorworkers. The burden seems to have been shared quite differently in dif-ferent countries.414 Health Economics in Development Improvisation, coping, and interest group struggles The foregoing discussion suggests that not only has there been no uniform response to economic crisis and adjustment across countries in LatinAmerica but that even within any one country, \"policy change\" has usuallynot been well defined or internally consistent. Implicit policy, indicated byhow much is spent and on what, has of course changed, but in an oftenerratic fashion. Moreover, the explicit enunciation of policy, particularlywhen embodied in constitutions, laws, and statements for political publicconsumption, may have little to do with reality. Significant, coherent shifts of policy can be debated and implemented. But that process is not automatic, takes more time than an abrupt economiccrisis allows (at least in the first year or two), and is likely to respond toother, long-term factors independent of the crisis. Particularly in the shortrun, what happens is much more a matter of coping with the immediate financial pressures, improvising adjustments within the public health sector, and struggles between interest groups over who and what is to be protected, or sacrificed. These are messy processes, which helps explain both the year-to-year variation in expenditure and service production and the frequentinconsistency between what is said and what is done. Coping is what administrators of clinics and programs have to do, when their budgets are cut or they face some other restrictions such as failure todeliver drugs and supplies. T raditionally, Latin American public health sys-tems have been grossly over-centralized, so that administrators cannot real-locate budgets significantly, make their own personnel decisions, or other-wise respond effectively to resource shortage. This problem long antedatesthe economic crisis, and would need fixing even if no recession hadoccurred; the crisis has merely made more painfully evident the inefficiencysuch centralization imposes. Improvising means trying to adjust policy in the short run, usually with- out an adequate conceptual basis. Particularly in the first years of a crisis,improvising is nearly all that can be done: there is too little experience fromwhich to predict the consequences of policy changes, and the system usu-ally starts so far from equilibrium that many different possible changesappear to make sense or at least to offer some good effects. Many improvi-sations are implicitly revealed in the budget, but as was argued above, it ishard to read any clear policy shift out of them. What is needed is detailedresearch on what actually happened at the level of programs and facilities,who took the relevant decisions, and what if any difference they made.Economic Crisis and Health Policy Response 415 Some research exists, particularly in the case of Brazil (Piola and Vianna 1991; Couttolenc 1991), but in most countries rather little is known aboutthe details of policy improvisation. Struggling for resources and control goes on all the time within govern- ments and among the interest groups affected by the crisis in health carefinance, but it can be expected to intensify when funds are reduced. Ideally,policy means a decision about who is to bear the burden, who is to win andwho is to lose. These decisions are seldom made clearly or enforced consis-tently, and the results often escape the control of those trying to makehealth policy. For example, doctors in Honduras secured most of the budgetincreases in the form of higher salaries for themselves, blocking any expan-sion of services (Musgrove 1988, Chapter 6). In Brazil, the largest strugglehas been over the sharing of funds and responsibilities among the federal,state and municipal governments, with revenue-sharing determined outsidethe health sector and central health policy having to adjust to the newfinancing pattern (Piola and Vianna 1991). Exogenous trends in policy In the absence of economic crisis and adjustment the need to cope and the pressure to improvise would have been much less, and it would havebeen easier to accommodate the normal struggles between interestgroups. But there would still have been some strong scientific and intel-lectual or ideological currents running in the Latin American healthsector, and it is reasonable to suppose they would still have had someinfluence on health policy. Three such tendencies are those towards spe-cific, cost-effective interventions, particularly those applied in \"childsurvival\" programs (T ask Force for Child Survival 1990), towards priva-tization in the provision of services (Roth 1987; World Bank 1987); andtowards \"cost recovery\" or user fees at public facilities (Jimenez 1987;Griffin 1988). Each of these ideas has been sold on the grounds that governments' eco- nomic difficulties require them to concentrate on what works best and costsleast\u2014that faced with a crisis, they cannot afford the \"luxury\" of high-cost,ineffective care (usually identified with hospital care), or of inefficient pub-lic provision, or of free care for everyone in the population. But these ideaswould surely have been pressed on governments even if no crisis hadoccurred; what the crisis did was to make it harder for governments to resistthem on purely ideological grounds. At least, this is the case for privatiza-416 Health Economics in Development tion and for user fees, ideas which most Latin American governments generally rejected before the 1980s, but which have subsequently beenembraced with varying degrees of enthusiasm and desperation. The peculiar case of Brazil In some of the smaller countries, particularly those in Central America which are relatively dependent on foreign assistance and especially on helpfrom USAID, policy change can be strongly pushed by a combination offinancial need and external conceptual or ideological pressure. These pres-sures are less effective in larger and more self-sufficient countries, and whathappens to policy can be correspondingly more complex. Brazil is probablythe most studied example. As in other countries, there was a sharp reduc-tion in central government health care spending at the beginning of the cri-sis (1983-94), and this provoked a search for \"fat to burn\" or opportunitiesto reduce waste and inefficiency (Piola and Vianna 1991). Partly for this rea-son, and partly for perceived equity reasons, there was also a push to curtailhospital services and expand ambulatory care. At the same time, Brazilshows some tendencies that were generated domestically and with little orno reference to the economic situation. These include the near-universal-ization of social security coverage, even to people not contributing to thesystem; the express inclusion of an unlimited \"right to health\" in the newConstitution of 1988; an increase in the public provision of care, at the expense of public finance for privately provided care through contracts withthe social security system; and a devolution of both money and responsibil-ities, including the transfer of control over health facilities and the transferof personnel, to states and municipalities. All these changes have muchmore to do with the democratization of the country in the 1980s than withanything else. Brazil also illustrates the improvised, turbulent nature of health policy reform to an extreme degree, because of the struggles among levels of gov-ernment, agencies of the federal government, and interest groups. Thecountry has had three substantial efforts at reform in the last decade, andwhile they are consistent in some respects, there are also instances of rever-sal (Couttolenc 1991; Piola and Vianna 1991). Thus the decentralization ofservices under the 1988 SUDS (Unified and Decentralized Health Systems)operated through the states, which determined how much of their newlyacquired federal money and facilities to turn over to municipalities, whereasthe subsequent 1990 SUS (Single Health System) reform reasserted federalEconomic Crisis and Health Policy Response 417 control and provided for the social security system to deal directly with municipalities. Concluding Reflections It is difficult to reach any substantial and defensible conclusions about the relation between economic crisis and health policy, so these final reflectionsare not so much a summing up as suggestions of other questions tocontemplate. How much does health policy matter? Health policy responds to many factors, some of them political and some quite ideological, in addition to the economic circumstances that constitutea crisis or the adjustment to one. That alone makes it difficult for healthpolicy to change quickly and sensibly if a crisis arises. Most \"policy change\",leaving aside the most general pronouncements of goals or wishes, involvesa great deal of coping with adversity, improvisation, and struggle amongcompeting interests. That means that what actually happens is unlikely tocorrespond exactly to declared policy, and generally has to sacrifice someobjectives to satisfy others. T ogether these two arguments suggest that theimportance of policy, and of changes in policy, is overrated. Perhaps therhetorical component should be ignored altogether, and the real compo-nent judged simply by how much health improvement is obtained, relativeto money spent. Good results mean, implicitly, good policy: bad resultsmean something needs to be changed. The limitation of this view, of course, is that bad results by themselves do not tell one what needs to be changed. And if policy is (part of) what medi-ates between inputs and outputs, then one has to look at policy to see whatis, or has gone, wrong. So the argument that \"policy matters\", and thatgood policy is preferable to bad policy, survives this skeptical view. Whatmay not survive is any simple notion of a one-to-one correspondence fromeconomic phenomena to health policy, and from there to health outcomes.There is similarly not much reason to believe in a relatively uniform, sys-tematic response to economic crisis across countries or even across a fewyears in one country. From the scant empirical evidence, it is hard to sayhow much health policy has mattered recently in Latin America, and whilemuch past and present policy can be roundly criticized on theoretical418 Health Economics in Development grounds, it is hard to tell how much better outcomes might have been with better policies. Dealing with crisis and adjustment: are there any lessons? There is no shortage of attempts to answer this question, in both theoreti- cal and empirical terms (Bell and Reich 1988). Even if the economic crisisof the 1980s turns out to have had little impact on life and death in LatinAmerica, it largely halted the expansion of public health coverage, probablyreduced the quality and accessibility of care, and severely shook the publicinstitutions which had to cope with it or adjust to it; so it is natural to try toderive lessons from the experience. Most of the lessons really amount tosuggestions for better policy, which would be just as relevant if there had never been a crisis. T o concentrate on cost-effective interventions, to favourthe poor and those most at risk, to finance the system on a sound basis, toavoid duplication of effort, to use prices and fees both for internal efficiencyand to steer demand in appropriate directions, to buy and use inputs in theright proportions\u2014all this excellent advice may carry more weight whengovernments are broke and desperate, but it will make just as much sense ifeconomic growth resumes and health budgets expand. There is even apotentially perverse effect, in that any public health sector which becomeslean and efficient will have no \"fat to burn\" if confronted with a futureretrenchment. A little bit of waste in good times is a protection in bad times;how much waste ought to be tolerated depends, unfortunately, on the likelyduration and severity of bad times, which are hard to predict. This suggests that governments need policies not only for a point in time, but for a course over time. T o have to change policy when budgets arecut\u2014or to need to do so, but fail to come up with anything but panickyimprovisation\u2014indicates that the pre-crisis policy did not adequately con-template the possibility of a crisis or spell out what to do about it. Amedium-term policy should have built into it the \"expansion path\" of thesector, both when budgets are rising and when they are falling; it shouldalready say what to cut and what to save, if resources drop by X percent.Like all plans, such a policy would need to be revised every year, becausewhat to do depends on what one is already doing or has the capacity to do.But it should avoid the need to introduce entirely new policies purely underfinancial pressure, and it should forbid the kind of retrenchment whichguarantees reduced efficiency because some inputs are protected while oth-ers are abandoned. It might even build in a counter-cyclical protection forEconomic Crisis and Health Policy Response 419 health care. This kind of policy\u2014actually a portfolio of contingent plans, of \"what to do if\" policies\u2014seems to have been conspicuously lacking in LatinAmerica at the beginning of the 1980s, and that, as much as the pressuresof adjustment, may account for the reduction in effective health protectionin the early years of the crisis.

Simultaneously a guide for professionals with an interest in health promotionand social policy, and a robust defense of economics in promoting growth and social development. Nicholas Barr Professor of Public Economics, London School of Economics Health economists now participate widely in global debates on health and development and contribute to better healththroughout the world. It wasn't always so. This excellent collection of Philip Musgrove's pathbreaking contributionsconfirms his pioneering role in this growing international field. Musgrove's persistent enquiry, conceptual clarity, andrefreshing irony enrich this collection. Lamps he lit will illuminate important questions for years to come. Peter Berman Professor of Population and International Health Economics Director, International Health Systems Program Harvard School of Public Health At the Pan American Health Organization, and then at the World Bank, Philip Musgrove has furthered the understand-ing of health financing, analysis of costs and benefits, the political economy of health reform, and related topics. His con-tribution has been central to the debate in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America, where crisis seems to be the norm andit is difficult to think soundly about health reform. This book shows that despite ignorance and misunderstanding, arational and productive encounter between economics and health is possible.
