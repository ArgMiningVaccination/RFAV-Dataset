Contents POLICY + GOVERNMENT Should the ASPR Lead the National Response to a Public Health Emergency? Going forward, ASPR, now a stand-alone agency (phased in over the next two years), is to be deemed commensurable with other HHS agencies, such as the CDC, FDA, or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The decision to reclassify ASPR doubtlessly reflects the ongoing efforts of HHS to address its widely publicized operational shortcomings during the COVID-19 pandemic. HHS Secretary Becerra expressed his conviction that the reclassification of ASPR will strengthen the \"long-term preparedness posture\" of HHS by \"better positioning the division to continue coordinating health-related emergency response in collaboration with our various HHS teams.\" This article considers the backdrop to the elevation of ASPR and the implications to the national response to future public health emergencies. [JAMA Health Forum](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2800136) Pandemic Preparedness Measures Passed as Part of FY 2023 Omnibus President Joe Biden signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617) into law on Dec. 29, 2022, a year-end government funding package that includes substantial policies to address pandemic preparedness. Key elements in package include: a new requirement for Senate confirmation of the CDC director beginning in 2025; provisions to address undue foreign influence in research, including a requirement for the HHS to develop a risk framework for the conduct of federally funded research involving human genomic information that considers any associated national security risks; policies to modernize and strengthen the Strategic National Stockpile and pandemic response supply chain; establishment of an advisory committee to the CDC director; and passage of the Tracking Pathogens Act (S. 3534), to expand activities related to detection and sequencing of pathogens. [AAMC](https://www.aamc.org/advocacy-policy/washington-highlights/pandemic-preparedness-measures-passed-part-fy-2023-omnibus) Future Planning for the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Enterprise \"We have witnessed the greatest political and public health failure in our nation's history.\" Activities that were specifically called out include: legacy under resourcing of health departments; poor communication of the evidence base to support guidance; lack of adequate rural health care systems; lack of behavior research into the structural drivers of vaccine hesitancy; pandemic response by polling and magical thinking; and inability of CDC to support program implementation. Currently, only about half of the U.S. population is served by a comprehensive public health system; and only 28 percent of hospitals, on average, earned a top-quality safety grade in states. Since FY 2003, PHEP has been cut in half, when accounting for inflation, and the hospital preparedness program has been reduced by two-thirds. These are not the actions of a prepared nation.

Russia was mad, mostly that no one would entertain its made-up claims of a US-funded bioweapons program in Ukraine. Iran was mad, apparently about sanctions. And everyone was haggling over language in the final review document for the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC), the nearly 50-year-old international treaty that prohibits states from developing or deploying biological weapons. Diplomats, delegations, and experts feared this is where the review conference (or \"RevCon,\" as it's known) might stall out. But after three weeks of discussions that ended about a week before Christmas, the BWC RevCon ended up a modest success.

Some of the responsibilities of the new office seem like they overlap quite a bit with the existing NSC Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense. It's also unclear from the legislative text whether the office would have its own budget.

In addition, the policy could unintentionally fuel anti-Asian bias and xenophobia. The U.S. must consider broader measures to mitigate Covid-19 transmission including supporting people staying home when ill, masking when appropriate, and getting all vaccinations and boosters.

It's no longer just the special operations forces fighting terrorists who might be exposed to chemical or biological weapons deployed by regional actors such as Iran or Syria, Watson said. Now, the problem has evolved to threaten the entire force. \"It's a different scale,\" he added, \"and it's a different environment in which our soldiers are going to be asked to potentially find it.\" [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/09/russia-china-chemical-biological-weapons-pentagon-00077035) COVID Drug Paxlovid Was Hailed as a Game-Changer. What Happened? When clinical trial data for the antiviral drug Paxlovid emerged in late 2021, physicians hailed its astonishing efficacy \u2014 a reduction of nearly 90% in the risk of severe COVID-19. But more than a year later, COVID-19 remains a leading cause of death in many countries. Physicians have prescribed the drug in only about 0.5% of new COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom, and in about 13% in the United States. Sentiment against the drug has persisted even as regulators globally have rescinded authorizations for monoclonal antibodies against COVID-19, leaving Paxlovid as one of the only tools to prevent death in high-risk individuals.

Drugs designed to bind and disrupt essential and conserved RNA structures have a high barrier to resistance. These drugs are based on locked nucleic acids (LNAs), which can be designed to bind to specific regions of viral RNA. LNAs have a longer half-life, and are more shelf-stable, than other nucleic acids like mRNA. They can persist in the body after a single dose, making them a convenient drug to administer.

The early missteps of the global COVID-19 response have spurred calls to expand regional manufacturing for health commodities, rethink intellectual property rights, and redraw the architecture of global health governance. The data support calls for dismantling power imbalances that too often dominate donor-driven development and aid efforts. Governments and international actors must embrace governance structures that promote regional and country-level health autonomy and security.

The U.S. government's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the largest bilateral, disease-specific foreign assistance program in the world and the cornerstone of the U.S. global health portfolio. PEPFAR was created nearly 20 years ago in response to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. The program is credited with supporting at least 20 million people on antiretroviral treatment, saving 25 million lives, and further galvanizing the broader global HIV/AIDS response that exists today, ultimately helping to change the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. While there was considerable concern over the potential for the Covid-19 pandemic to be especially disruptive in countries with a high HIV burden, PEPFAR-supported initiatives have proven to be uniquely positioned to respond to Covid-19.

These results are evidence of transmission of the virus and meets the criteria to be classified as circulating VDPV2 (cVDPV2). Aceh province has very low polio vaccination coverage in the routine immunization program; however, coverage is also low in several other provinces in Indonesia, including three provinces nearby Aceh (North Sumatera, West Sumatera and Riau). In 2021, in Aceh province, bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV3) coverage was 50.9%, and IPV 28.2%. and for Pidie district the coverage was 17.7% for OPV3 and 0.5% for IPV. There is low population immunity against all polioviruses but primarily type 2 in children born after the switch from the trivalent to bivalent OPV in April 2016.

Interestingly, data showed comparable T cell and binding antibody responses from both survivors and their contacts, while neutralizing antibody responses were primarily seen in the LF survivors and not their contacts. Neutralizing antibody responses were found to be cross-reactive against all five lineages of LASV with a strong bias to Lineage II, the prevalent strain in southern Nigeria. They identified the regions of the LASV glycoprotein and nucleoprotein that induced the broadest peptide-specific T cell responses. This data informs immunological readouts and potential benchmarks for clinical trials evaluating LASV vaccine candidates.

Since its initial discovery, several cases of BRBV infection in humans have been identified in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Thus far, BRBV has remained limited to a small number of confirmed human cases. Many unanswered questions persist that are related to both virology and ecology of BRBV. Recent evidence suggests increasing potential for BRBV genetic evolution through recombination with related thogotoviruses. The recent discovery in Japan of Oz virus, which exhibits high sequence identity to BRBV, in Amblyomma sp. ticks, which share the same genus as the lone star tick, illustrates the necessity for further examination of thogotoviruses and their geographic distribution.

This means that Evusheld may not provide protection against developing COVID-19 for individuals who have received Evusheld and are later exposed to XBB.1.5. [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-releases-important-information-about-risk-covid-19-due-certain-variants-not-neutralized-evusheld) Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Coinfection Among Children Who Were Hospitalized or Died with Influenza During the 2021-22 influenza season, 6% of hospitalized pediatric influenza patients had SARS-CoV-2 coinfection; a higher percentage of patients with coinfection required invasive or noninvasive respiratory support compared with those with influenza only. Among influenza-associated pediatric deaths, 16% had SARS-CoV-2 coinfection; only one coinfected decedent received influenza antivirals, and none had been fully vaccinated against influenza.

Now that is playing out in New York and the Northeast regions of the United States. A recent paper established that the immune evasion for XBB.1 is more than BQ.1.1. Yunlong Cao just posted new data to show that XBB.1.5 is not more immune evasive than XBB (good) but it has tighter bind to its ACE2 receptor, which would explain its higher level of transmissibility. Infection These results suggest that BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 extensively, but incompletely, escape omicron subvariant breakthrough neutralisation, including the most recent BA.5.1.2, BA.2.76, and BF.7 infections. However, serum samples of BA.5.1.2 breakthrough infection were effectively neutralised by BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, suggesting that previous BA.5 breakthrough infection might prevent BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, and BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 might not completely replace BA.5.
