AREAS OF CONCERN: This document will focus on: Contractor / Supplier Considerations Consultant / Design Professional Considerations CMS COVID19 HEALTH CARE STAFF VACCINATION RULE REQUIREMENTS (effective February 10, 2022): All Contractors and Vendors performing work at UHC for more than ten (10) calendar days per calendar year should have their vaccination or exemption documented by following one of the compliance paths in order to obtain a badge. If the individual will perform work fewer than ten (10) days per calendar year and are not badged, they will be required to be escorted by a badged individual at all times when working at UIHC facilities. This requirement is in addition to the completed background check and orientation through Gatefeed prior to gaining access to work at UIHC. Companies will manage this process through Gatefeed and will need to designate an Administrator in Gatefeed for their company, who in turn should do the following. 1. Failure of compliance may result in revocation of access to UIHC for the worker. The Owner shall not bear the cost of replacement or change to subcontracts as a result of failure to comply. 2. To be compliant, upload documentation of one of the following categories to the ETS module of Gatefeed (required forms will be provided by the Owner for items b and c below): a. Proof of COVID19 vaccination (either 2 shot or 1 shot series of approved vaccines); booster isn't required at this time. b. Attestation for a Religious or Strongly Held Belief exemption (signed by individual) c. Medical exemption (signed by a licensed medical practitioner) 3. Once documentation is uploaded, it will be evaluated by UIHC to confirm compliance. 4. If the individual is not vaccinated and needs a temporary delay of vaccination compliance due to a medical condition, a delay in compliance may be granted upon discussion of the individual circumstances with the Owner. BADGING: For REPLACEMENT badges (those who have active badges prior to February 10, 2022), individuals or Company Representatives (as a proxy for the individual workers) who meet all requirements may present at the Safety & Security desk in the Fountain Entrance of UIHC on Level 1 RCP to obtain replacement badges. Contractors/Vendors will receive a date when replacement badges can be picked up separately from this notification. Replacement badges can be picked up MondayFriday from 7:30am to 3:00pm. Once received, old badges will have existing access removed within three (3) business days, and the old badge can be turned into Safety & Security at the Fountain Entrance or Capital Management in Hospital Parking Ramp 3. 1. Contractors with current badges will retain the access currently assigned to their badge at the time the new badge is granted. For NEW and RENEWAL badges (those going through the Background Check, Orientation, and CMS COVID19 Mandate Compliance), Individuals who meet all requirements should present at Capital Management in the Subbasement of Hospital Parking Ramp 3 to obtain a new badge. 1. At that time, Capital Management Staff will electronically verify the background check and orientation completion as well as CMS compliance. 2. Contractors will then have a photo taken and a badge granted. 3. Site access is not automatically granted to new Employees. The UIHC Project Manager must provide the names of individuals who require access before access is granted. 4. Contractors with current badges will retain the access currently assigned to their badge at the time the new badge is granted. EACH PERSON REQUESTING A NEW BADGE MUST HAVE THE FOLLOWING: 1.

Testing and Symptoms of COVID19 Should any outside parties providing service to UI Health Care test positive, negative or display symptoms of COVD19, individuals will be asked to adhere to the guidelines put forth by the UI Health Care Epidemiology leaders. a. Full Risk and Exposure Policy link: https://medcom.uiowa.edu/theloop/hr employee health B. Exposure Contractors and Vendors shall follow the CDC standards for the general population with regards to exposure and isolation/quarantining. Highrisk exposure to COVID19 at work or outside of work is defined as: You (exposed person) had contact with a person with laboratory confirmed COVID19 (source person) during the time frame when the source person was likely to be infectious. Highrisk exposure is: 1. Being within 6 feet for 15 minutes or longer while: The exposed person was not wearing a face covering (cloth face mask, medical face mask, or respirator); regardless of the PPE worn by the source person OR The source person was not wearing a face covering (cloth face mask, medical face mask, respirator) AND the exposed person was not wearing both a mask and eye protection 2. Being in the same room as the source person during an aerosol generating procedure (AGP) if the exposed person was not wearing gown, gloves, eye protection, and a respirator 3. Being a household contact of a source person who is unable to isolate If proper PPE was used throughout the interaction, the exposure risk is low, and further evaluation and management are not necessary. Infectious period 1. Source person is symptomatic: Starts 48 hours before the source person's symptoms start. Ends when the source person meets criteria to stop COVID19 isolation precautions. 2. Source person is asymptomatic: Starts 48 hours before the source person's first positive test. Ends 10 days after the source person's first positive test. If the time of exposure that led to the source person's infection is known, then the infection period starts 48 hours after the earliest exposure. o Sometimes, public health may define the infectious period for an asymptomatic person as starting 10 days before the source person's first positive test. Exposure protocol & work restrictions If a highrisk exposure occurred, the Contractor/Vendor will be placed on quarantine, with the duration dependent on vaccination status. (See HighRisk Exposure section above for definition) If the Contractor is fully vaccinated and asymptomatic (no symptoms) o Do not need to be placed on work restrictions or quarantine outside of work o Should wear a mask in public for 10 days following exposure and at all times in UIHC facilities - unless alone in a private office. o If the Contractor remains asymptomatic, should be tested on day 5 after their last exposure. If they get symptoms then test right away, even if they had a negative test before. If the Contractor is NOT fully vaccinated and is asymptomatic (no symptoms) o Quarantine outside of work for 5 days following last exposure. o Must be tested on day 5 following last exposure and may return to work on day 6 following a negative test. They must wear a mask when around others when they leave home on days 610 and at all times when in UIHC facilities - unless alone in a private office. o If the day 5 test is positive, but continues to be asymptomatic, the Contractor goes into home isolation for 5 days after the date of the positive test and can return to work after the 5 day isolation period if: Feverfree for 24 hours without feverreducing medications No symptoms have developed If the Contractor becomes symptomatic at any time - regardless of vaccination status o Quarantine at home and should receive a COVID19 test right away. o If the test is negative, they may return to work when they have no fever for 24 hours without feverreducing medication and symptoms are improving. o If the test is positive, while symptomatic the Contractor should isolate (isolation means not coming into work, staying home and away from others) at home for 5 days, test again after 5 days from the date of symptom onset. On days 610, they may return to work if symptoms have significantly lessoned, and they are feverfree for 24 hours without feverreducing medication. They should wear a mask at all times when around others when they leave home and at all times when in UIHC facilities. As a reminder, you are considered fully vaccinated if 2 weeks following receipt of the second dose in a 2dose series, or 2 weeks following receipt of one dose of a singledose vaccine. "}
