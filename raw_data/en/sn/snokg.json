By car, by bus and by foot they came to one of nearly 50 sites in Jefferson County for the first of three doses to again fight polio. Adults, teens and parents with children close at their side or resting on their hips waited in line. Helicopters buzzed overhead, whizzing additional vials across Louisville. Hundreds of volunteers at each site directed traffic, prepared paperwork and doled out doses in tiny paper cups. Oct. 7, 1962, had finally come, and with it hope that the dreaded disease that paralyzed children and struck fear into parents would finally be stamped out. Polio was already dealt a significant strike in the United States after a massive push a few years earlier to inoculate children with the first polio vaccine, an injection developed by Dr. Jonas Salk. Now, a newly developed oral vaccine was aiming to knock another big blow to the disease \u2014 on a tiny cube of sugar. Ruth Carrico clearly remembers standing in line at a local union hall for her sugar cube. Now a family nurse practitioner and professor with a specialty in infectious diseases at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, Carrico is working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. \"We were able to gather together for that vaccine and go and stand in lines,\" she said of the polio program. \"Now, of course, we can't.\" While today's vaccination effort reminds Carrico of mass immunization events of the past, including the polio program and Louisville's mobilization against the [swine flu a decade ago](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html), coronavirus poses unprecedented challenges. \"You can see that everything is different with this vaccine and this disease,\" she said. \"The sense of urgency is not just for the health of the individual, it's for the health of the world, the shared economy, our shared value systems and our desires to keep people at work, at church, at play.\" Since January, Carrico has spent her days at Louisville's Broadbent Arena, making sure health care workers know how to prepare and administer the COVID-19 vaccine to the hundreds of people that pass through the arena each day. The 6,600-person stadium, better known for hosting graduations, Kentucky Derby Festival events and state fair equestrian competitions, has been converted into a drive-thru mass vaccination site known as LouVax. [The work at Broadbent is part of the largest mass inoculation drive in history. But as the nation fights the coronavirus, which has killed millions globally and taken more American lives than were lost in World War II, it's worth looking back at other efforts.](https://www.courier-journal.com/in-depth/news/2021/01/19/covid-19-deaths-americans-dying-faster-than-our-soldiers-did-wwii/6602717002/) Polio, the fear of families In the mid-1950s, the effort to wipe out polio via vaccination marked the largest mass vaccination program ever. Naomi Rogers, professor of the history of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, said while polio was not a large driver of childhood illness or death, the possible paralytic effects of polio struck fear in many American families, particularly during the summer months when polio cases were known to rise. Cases of polio \u2014 which we now know is [spread through contact with an infected person's feces ](https://www.cdc.gov/polio/what-is-polio/index.htm)(perhaps through water) or less often by droplets from a sneeze or cough \u2014 peaked in the United States in 1952. That year Kentucky saw nearly 1,800 cases of the disease and Jefferson County almost 740. Tom Owen, a former Louisville Metro Council member and a longtime U of L archivist, said he remembers the fear associated with polio from his childhood. The disease left visual scars, forcing children onto crutches or into wheelchairs, leg braces or iron lungs - large metal tanks used in those days to help patients breathe. Believing the disease was transmitted in dust, Owen's parents told him not to play in the dirt that collected in street gutters. He remembers how polio fears forced the closure of public swimming pools and how a boy who lived just a block from him, Bobby, was infected and paralyzed for life. Owen's grandmother prodded his parents to place small cloth asafetida bags, a tool of old alternative medicine, around his and his brother's necks. \"The bag contained some kind of noxious herbal mix that smelled so badly as the summer progressed that no one would get near us,\" he said. \"It must have worked! We didn't come down with polio!\" A scientific search for a cure accelerated in 1938 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2014 the most well-known American to have suffered polio at the time \u2014 founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The foundation later became known as the [March of Dimes](https://www.marchofdimes.org/mission/eddie-cantor-and-the-origin-of-the-march-of-dimes.aspx), inspired by the campaign encouraging people to donate even a single dime to the cause. [This private fundraising supported rehabilitation efforts, including those at the Warm Springs treatment center in Georgia where Roosevelt received treatment \u2014 as did current Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who was sickened by polio as a child.](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2020/12/17/covid-19-vaccine-mitch-mcconnell-take-in-coming-days/3951029001/) The funds also helped enable Salk's development of the vaccine, which in 1954 was given in experimental field trials involving about 1.8 million schoolchildren across the country. Nearly 7,500 second graders in Louisville and Lexington were part of the field tests, receiving a certificate and pin that read \"Polio Pioneer\" after getting their third shot. The Courier Journal reported the students were also rewarded with a lollipop. The following April, results from the 1954 experiment would be released, potentially greenlighting the vaccine for national distribution. A 1955 Courier Journal article optimistically declared April 12 \"V-P (Victory Over Polio) Day.\" 1/3 It was on that day scientists declared the vaccine safe, and within two weeks Kentucky schoolchildren were lined up for it. The Courier Journal reported approximately 182,000 Kentucky students would be eligible to get the vaccine, including about 40,000 in Jefferson County. Civic clubs volunteered to transport children. Polio foundation volunteers, PTA groups and homemaker clubs sterilized needles, packed supply baskets and kept records. Doctors and nurses administered shots.

About 34,000 children across 117 sites in schools received the first dose of the vaccine April 28, 1955. \"When they put that stuff in that 'fringe' (syringe), I was looking the other way, so I didn't even know when it happened!\" said a child after he got his shot. Black-and-white photos from the time show children, some with closed eyes or pained faces wrapped in adults' arms, as the needle drew near. The process was apparently enjoyed by some. An Associated Press story that April told of how New Mexico clinic organizers debated not giving ice cream and candy bars to vaccinated kids, as \"two youngsters had gotten back in line and received two ice-cream cones \u2014 and two vaccinations \u2014 each.\" Rogers said schools made perfect sense to use as vaccination sites for polio. They were a familiar part of every neighborhood and had the ability to efficiently reach large numbers of children. \"That was seen as the natural logistical institutional setup,\" Rogers said. In the early rollout, limited supply contributed to a prioritization of who could be vaccinated, much like is happening today. Vaccine distribution focused on first and second graders, as children were considered to be most at risk. In time, older youths were eligible for vaccinations and later, adults were encouraged to roll up their sleeves. To boost vaccination rates among teens, a 21-year-old [Elvis Presley was photographed ](https://www.neh.gov/article/elvis-presley-set-example-getting-his-polio-vaccination)in 1956 receiving his dose backstage at \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" before singing \"Hound Dog\" to screaming fans. By 1957, the county was recording promising new data. Cases fell from nearly 300 in 1954 to less than 50 in 1957. By January 1958, about 45% of children under 10 in Jefferson County had received all three doses of the Salk vaccine and 80% had received two, The Courier Journal reported. The program, it seemed, was working. 'Nothing scary about a sugar cube' Seven years after the introduction of the first polio vaccine, John F. Kennedy was early in his term as president, the Vietnam War was in its infancy and a liquid polio vaccine invented by Dr. Albert Sabin was newly approved. People of all ages were encouraged to get the oral vaccine, including those who received the Salk injection, as the new version would help create community immunity. Jefferson County embarked on a monthslong effort aimed at vaccinating 95% of its citizens, and in doing so, again faced the challenge of designing a program to quickly immunize as many people as possible. Dubbed Sabin Oral Sundays \u2014 S.O.S. for short \u2014 the Sabin vaccine drives came in three phases in Louisville, each made up of two Sundays in October and November 1962 and February 1963. Each month's dosage protected against a different type of polio. Unlike [today's COVID vaccination rollout](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2021/01/04/broadbent-arena-coronavirus-vaccine-drive-thru-opens-in-louisville/4101468001/), supply was not an issue. Three drops of tasteless, colorless and odorless liquid were dropped onto sugar cubes, cutting vaccine administration time and taking needles out of the equation. \"That was considered a much easier way to vaccinate everybody against polio because there's nothing scary about a sugar cube,\" Rogers said. A state law passed in 1962 required the immunization of all those under 18 against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria. First graders were required to show proof before starting school that fall, though Louisville leaders and the state agreed to allow students to start classes with the understanding they would be vaccinated in October.

In Bourbon County, among the 6,000 recipients were toothless babies who took the vaccine via dropper. A Lexington clinic was so slammed with students it had to turn many away when supply ran dry. These spring and summer campaigns caused some who were eager to receive protection to question why Louisville was waiting until the fall. In July, The Courier Journal editorial page called for an earlier mass vaccination date, without success. Local steering committee organizers pointed to a need to plan and initial concerns over procuring enough doses. It would also be harder to organize a mass effort during the summer, when people take vacations, officials argued. Forty-six sites at schools across the county were selected by Louisville's organizers from the Jefferson County Medical Society, Junior Chamber of Commerce and Advertising Club of Louisville. Sites were selected with walkability in mind and locations with stairs and common entrances and exits were avoided. Registration forms were passed out in schools, drugstores, churches and printed in newspapers to save time come vaccination day. Thousands of \"Stop Polio Forever\" signs were hung at bus stops and other strategic locations. Sabin Oral Sunday reminder notices appeared for weeks leading up to the Oct. 7 vaccination, often among comic strips and occasionally tucked beside the fresh meats and produce of Kroger advertisements. Even the post office chipped in and used stamp cancellation marks as reminders of the vaccination dates. Volunteers were vital to the campaign, [much as they are today ](https://louisvilleky.gov/government/louisville-covid-19-resource-center/covid-19-volunteer-information-center)at many COVID-19 immunization sites. Some 2,000 volunteers were recruited to help run the 46 sites over the six Sundays, the newspaper reported. PTA members became record keepers. Boy Scouts handed out immunization cards, and Girl Scouts relayed messages from sites to a centralized office. The Red Cross contributed pharmacists and first-aid staffers. Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co. workers ran a phone line on each of the Sundays to answer questions about the clinic. Volunteer doctors and nurses dispensed the sweet squares \u2014 grocery chains donated a million sugar cubes \u2014 in tiny paper cups. \"The crunch of sugar cubes will be heard across Kentucky and Southern Indiana today,\" read a newspaper story from Oct. 7. \"The sound will signify the crushing of polio.\" Lines formed early at most sites and tens of thousands received the vaccine every hour. Two helicopters and a fleet of police vehicles dispatched doses where needed. One helicopter on a vaccine run landed at a golf course near Fern Creek Elementary School and sent golfers running. Attendance slowed around 1 p.m. during the airing of Game 3 of the World Series matchup of the San Francisco Giants and the Mickey Mantle-led New York Yankees. On the two October dates, Jefferson County immunized over 85% of the population, above the threshold considered necessary for community protection. By the end of the six Sabin Oral Sundays, nearly 1.4 million doses were given in the county. There were no reported cases of polio in Kentucky in 1963 and 1964. By 1979, the United States was considered polio-free. Dr. Virginia Keeney, one of the coordinators of the Sabin blitz, gathered with other organizers for a 40th anniversary reunion in 2002. She was proud, she told the newspaper, to have been part of such a historic undertaking. \"It was certainly one of the most meaningful things in my life.\" Drive-thru not new for Louisville While drive-thru vaccinations seem particularly apt in the time of social distancing, drive-thru immunization clinics aren't new to Louisville. In the mid-'90s, U of L's Carrico helped pioneer the method in Louisville, applying a hallmark of the fast-food industry to yearly flu inoculations. Thousands of people each year were vaccinated from the comfort of their cars, and over the years, organizers developed best practices and shared that knowledge with other cities, Carrico said. \"We brought a totally different way of thought about immunization,\" she said. When swine flu \u2014 also known as H1N1 \u2014 hit in 2009, the city already had a model to scale up for vaccinations. Related: [When can I get a COVID-19 vaccine in Kentucky? Your coronavirus questions answered](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2021/01/15/when-can-i-get-coronavirus-vaccine-kentucky/6637095002/) Over an 18-hour period in November 2009, about 20,000 people walked or drove through vaccination lanes set up in the parking lot of U of L's Cardinal Stadium. [Photos from those days look much like images seen in recent weeks, as states stage drive-thru operations in ballparks, football stadiums and even the Toy Story parking lot of Disneyland.](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2021/01/12/covid-19-vaccine-disneyland-inoculation-site/6635828002/) In December 2009, Jefferson County Public Schools and other schools in the county launched a three-week program in 170-plus schools, hailed as the most ambitious immunization effort since the polio era. Now, to fight COVID-19, Carrico said Louisville is again drawing on its decades of experience while figuring out how to most efficiently and safely host a mass vaccination site, which draws people together at a time when close contact carries increased risk. Another challenge is combating misinformation. Public trust in science was at a peak in the 1950s, Rogers said, and while there was anti-vaccination sentiment, it was limited. \"One of the things you can see in the distrust even of the truth of the pandemic itself is the enormous politicization and wider mistrust of science itself,\" she said. \"That's been very striking to see.\" Will Kentuckians take the vaccine? [COVID Watch: New study reveals percentage of Kentuckians receptive to vaccine](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2021/02/01/saliva-covid-19-testing-now-available-in-louisville/6700526002/) Carrico, too, is concerned about the politicization. \"Unfortunately, there are people that have the ability to create fear and mistrust in others,\" she said. \"And I wish they would pick something else other than the only thing that we have that may stop the spread of this virus to which we have no natural immunity.\" Another departure from typical vaccinations: patient emotion. Workers at the Broadbent site have been sharing similar stories about the gratitude they're hearing from those they vaccinate. \"I've had people that will drive up and literally they are sobbing,\" Carrico said. \"They are crying so hard in their car because they are so happy that they can get a vaccine and they are "}
