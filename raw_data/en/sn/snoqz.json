Energy healing combines the same energy that is the source of all life and the source of medicine, which treats debilitating diseases. In energy healing, energy is \"medicine.\" It's as old as human history and as new as the most innovative medical technologies in modern hospitals. It's also very natural and safe\u2014and one of the most exciting fields of study. Considered a \"new\" field in modern medicine, energy healing is separated into two categories by NCCAM (U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine): Energy healing has been around for thousands of years. The ancients knew that, in addition to bodily threats, we are also exposed to invisible hazards, whether from our own thoughts or from other people or from dark forces from beyond. These invisible threats affect our psychological and physical functioning. This is one of the reasons that energy healing is so valuable: it goes beyond the body to factor in the psychological and spiritual dimensions. Every ancient society and spiritual group had a system that identified energy centers in the human body, what the East Indians call chakras, which means \"wheels of light.\" The Chakra Chart available for free download here displays the various chakras or energy centers and how they connect to the physical body and related illness. The Egyptians, the East Indians, the Chinese, the Greeks, and indigenous societies like the Native Americans (North and South) share similarities in their understanding of the energy centers of the body. The ancient Mayan and Aztec civilizations had well-developed systems of spiritual energy healing, with many crossovers and similarities with the ancient East Indian and Chinese. It was the Greeks who began the formal study of energy healing with the Hippocratic school of thought. The Greeks are the ones who conceived of a split between the mind and the body and viewed the body as evil. They believed that disease was caused by sin, which became a pervasive theme in Judaic teachings. The connection between sickness and sin is rampant throughout Greek and Judaic writings. This led to a lack of appreciation for spiritual energy healing and even practices that led to good health. This changed when Jesus came on the scene. In his brief ministry, over 40 distinct instances of physical energy healing were recorded, many involving healing big crowds of people. The cornerstone of his teaching was the power of love, not the prevalence of sin. He told his followers also to go out and heal, and for some 300 years after his death, his followers successfully performed signs and wonders in his name. We believe that it's quite possible that Jesus was exposed to ancient teachings from outside his own culture. There are many stories of Jesus spending time in India with great Masters. Another possibility is that Jesus was able to access the power he used to heal through expanding his awareness and connecting to the Unified Field. "}
