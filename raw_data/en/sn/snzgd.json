THIS HISTORY I CARE ABOUT THE ONE WE MAKE TOGETHER JUNE JORDAN, ON A NEW YEAR'S EVE11 CONNECTIONS 2023GRACE DETREVARAHWORDS AND IMAGE USED WITH PERMISSION FROM THE WRITER. When I was in custody in 2012, my last time in custody, I knew I didn't have it in me anymore. I didn't know what I was going to do, but I knew that time, after three other terms, contact with the criminal justice system, contact with homeless services, having to commit a crime just to survive... I knew I didn't have the energy. At that time I was 54, and I had accomplished only DIN numbers and indictment numbers, lost clothes, and lost things, over and over. The whole cycle of nothingness. Like a lot of people in prison, we each come to determine that either, I can do it again, or I'm not doing this ever again. It took me three times. It may take that person who went in today their only time. When I knew that things had changed for me I left with two degrees and several certifi - cations. I learned the system and I learned that the things I did illegally, I could do legally. You know how to run your damn mouth, now you can tell a story that can save lives, including your own. I walk around now with keys to a house, a refrigerator full, and I'm satisfied. I remember having all the money in the world, but no keys, my healthcare all messed up. When you start thinking that is your only way to survive, other things happen. Bad health, bad decisions, you lose your mental capacity, you lose a whole lot of things. When you go from being stopped, from doing nothing to 12 PROFILESdoing something, that's when you become impactful. I've always been somebody, it's just that I had stopped doing as somebodys do. I came to New York in 1983. It was the beginning of the HIV and AIDS epidemic. The drugs, heroin and crack, ran around me but I never indulged in them. You had some of the best minds and the best talent, but they were friends who were living with dyslexia, chronic health disparities, AIDS. They didn't get diagnosed, and they got secondary diseases that took them out. Some people were never able to address their drug use, some never learned to read, and they died with those health disparities and in prison because of a lack of education. But I came here knowing what a mother and father look like, and having both of them. I ran away from a middle-class family in Detroit when I came to New York, to end up being homeless. It was homeless to someone in Detroit, but for me here, it was freedom. I wasn't conforming to anything. I may not have had my own house keys but I was free. And it sounds ridiculous to someone who comes from where I come from. They'd say, no, freedom is when you have your own keys, your own home. And both those things are right. At times I had to bury the experiences I brought with me, but they would sneak their way out and people noticed. I remember the backhanded racist comments that were made to me. They would say, you know Miss Grace, she's so white. It was such an ignorant thing to say. In their way they thought they were complimenting me, because they thought if you had a high school diploma, if you knew anything about history, if you knew how to hold a sentence together, that was the epitome of white. What do you mean white? There's nothing white about me. But I didn't suffer through the same things that affected a lot of my peers. There were so many brilliant people who should still be here. A whole generation of people. So we have to look to the generation coming up now who are changing things. At the 2022 New York City Black Pride Heritage Image Awards I was honored for my advocacy work with the trans community. At the ceremony, a group of young people approached me full of energy. When I say young people I mean I've got shoes older than some of these kids. They said Grace, we want to invite you to a 13 CONNECTIONS 2023barbecue. Now, I didn't know any of these kids from a can of paint, but I found out they had come to see me at the awards because they had been following my work and had seen me speak. They all got on the train or hopped the train, from all over, and they got to the Schomburg Center. I live for these young people because these are the kids who don't always get acknowledged for being kids. I went to their barbecue and I was floored. I never felt so much love in my life. Those young kids were from high school, from no school, sex workers, everything. I don't know who put the money together or whose backyard it was. When I got there they had a sign that said, We Love You Miss Grace. Do you know how that feels? That's when you know that the work you're doing stopped being about you a long time ago. Whatever your purpose is, you want that impact. Like the trans girl I met who was able to stay close with her family, who didn't have to go through that loss, and who now gets her family to connect to others. There are young girls doing this. These are not hopeful future stories, I hear these stories now. There is so much work being done in this generation. I always say we are the living legacies of Marsha P. Johnson, the children of Sylvia Rivera. We're not the tragedy. It's easy for the government, for communities, for families, and even ourselves to continue to retell the tragic stories. But there are families who are loving their trans children, their different children. We are now fami - lies who are communicating, asking the questions, not bringing more trauma. We don't want the tragedies inflicted on Marsha and Sylvia to be the end story. They wouldn't want that for us. In the justice system there's something called precedence, where a law has come to be. And then for some reason, 51 years later, here come a bunch of men going to say, now it's time for us to take this on back. Those are the times when the balance of the scales of justice is far off, but it's never going to be equal, so we'll always have plenty more work to do. But there's a blueprint, there's a pathway for us. Every generation can do this with new language, with new circumstances. We know what the word circumstance means, the circle, the things surrounding you. It means that it can change. Do not allow those tragic stories to be the story. Let the story evolve.14 PROFILESKELLY HARNETT WORDS AND IMAGE USED WITH PERMISSION FROM THE WRITER. When I was 28, I was charged with a crime where I had been too afraid to intervene, because of the abusive relationship I was in. I went to trial and received a 17-year-to-life sentence. The person who committed the crime took a plea and received a 15-year sen - tence. In jail, leading up to my trial, I ended up studying the law for about 16 hours a day. I did not particularly care for it at first but I told myself I had no choice. It was the only way to gain control of my sit - uation. I taught myself everything on my own. There was not even a legal dictionary for me to use in the law library but I found that I was capable of using context clues after seeing the same phrases repeatedly and comparing the situations. I read statutes and case law, over and over, until they made sense. When they made sense, I would memorize them. When I memorized them, I learned to enjoy it, and understood that most people enjoy the things they are good at. In essence, I forced myself to find my gift and my passion. I wish that I never had to use the skills I learned, but during my trial three of my charges were dismissed based on the research and case law that I provided to my attorney. I often addressed the 15 CONNECTIONS 2023Court on my own accord. At times, the whole courtroom became my adversary, even my own attorney, but I consistently fought for my right to present my own defense. They did not expect that from me, especially because I am a woman. I was convicted, but the ADA and I took part in a 17 month battle for a new trial. I went to court over 125 times. This kept me at Rikers for a total of five years. After my various submissions for appeal were ultimately denied, I immediately got a job as a law clerk upon entry into Bedford Hills. This gave me power. I authored a supplemental pro se brief for a woman after having been in Bedford for a year and a half. Her entire indictment was dismissed on a manslaughter charge and she went home immediately. This showed me that all of those years of hard work were coming to fruition. While I continued to diligently work on my own case, I assisted hundreds of women in Bedford, which inspired a collective hope in us. When the Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act was passed in 2019, there was no existing template for using the new law, so I made my own. The very first day it went into effect, I asked a woman in the law library if domestic violence was a part of her case and she responded in the affirmative. Using the template I wrote, I inserted her information. She went to court three weeks later and was resentenced. I then used the template again with another woman and she was ultimately resentenced as well. Finally, the night before a friend of mine was leaving, she thanked me and said, \"Kelly, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be walking out of those doors tomorrow.\" This instilled an obligation in me to continue to advocate for fundamental fairness in the system for the rest of my life, whether inside or outside. The system could not take something that is inside of me...I have a gift. This gift ulti - mately led to my release with a reduced sentence in May of 2022. I had not seen my mother in ten years because of her declining health. Upon release, I went straight to the hospital to see her and could not believe my eyes. When I walked into the hospital room, she was in shock and started to cry, saying, \"I didn't think I was ever going to see you again.\" I spent the next three weeks going to see her everyday. By the grace of God, I spent Mother's Day with my mom, bought her balloons, a card, and her favorite chocolate 16 PROFILEScake. When her insurance ran out, they sent her home from the hospital and she died three days later, making that a mere three weeks that I got to spend with her. I thank God that she held on for me, and I truly believe that this is what she did. Prior to being released, I was hired by the Robert and Helen Bernstein Institute for Human Rights at NYU School of Law as a part of The Jailhouse Lawyer Initiative (JLI). While still incarcerated, I began to work with the JLI on modules to teach Legal Research courses throughout NY State. This, for me, was literally a dream come true. I got the opportunity to contribute writing to the CUNY Law Review, addressing the conditions of confinement and advo - cating for the other women inside, and I'm serving as a guest teacher at Brooklyn Law School. I am now interning for a Judge of the Supreme Court of New York County, which was also a dream come true. My interview was in chambers. I stepped into the court - room without handcuffs this time. When I was resentenced, my judge cried and told me that she had read every motion that I had ever written, which was not her obliga - tion. She said that I stood there before her as a woman who never gave up. Truer words have never been spoken. Now, I am putting that same perseverance toward assisting others who are in the sit - uation that I was in. My sentence was originally 17-to-life. Although life has now been omitted from my sentence, in essence it remains there as a reminder that I will spend my life dedicating my gift to ensure due process and fundamental fairness to all who find themselves trapped behind those walls. For me it was not a trap, it was an opportunity and I am finally receiving my blessings for it. I just want everyone to know that you are all capable of achieving what I achieved. You must find the dedication within you in order to unleash something that has been inside you the entire time.17 CONNECTIONS 2023TERRENCE COFFIEWORDS AND IMAGE USED WITH PERMISSION FROM THE WRITER. \"Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs only to the people who prepare for it today.\" \u2014 Malcom X, from the founding rally for the Organization of Afro-American Unity, June 1964 at the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights NYC. After spending over 19 years incarcerated and six prison bids, I knew I had to do something different. Upon my release the first thing that was apparent to me was, don't go back to prison. My last incarceration was in 2009. After learning about a transitional program in New York City, I began a journey that would expand my horizons and place me in a position to create change on behalf of countless people impacted by the criminal justice system. My journey actually began in November 2008, while serving what would be the last incarceration of my life. It was the night that President Barack Obama was elected the first African American President of the United States. The guards allowed us to stay up to see the election. It was a night filled with hope and fear. One that spoke to the future of America to truly embrace change (the hope), or one that would continue the status quo. As I sat in that dayroom I began to think of all the jokes and ridicule associated with a 18 PROFILESBlack man becoming President of the United States. To be quite honest, I really just wanted to go back to my bunk, and just hold on to the idea that a Black man had even been selected as the Democratic nominee, but I couldn't. Even in the confines of prison walls, I wanted to be a part of something special, I wanted to know in my own way that I believed in and supported the \"Yes We Can'' movement. Although my life was far removed from the likes of President Barack Obama, somehow his message of America being more than its past resonated with me. Somehow I could be more than my past. Somehow I could look past the naysayers of society and political pundits that said, and I believed, that the life of a incarcerated person wasn't worth investing in, that I would always be a failure, and this cell, my life and my future would confirm the data that stated that 77% of the those incarcerated would be rear - rested within the first five years of release. When it was announced that Senator Barack Obama was now President-Elect, and the first African American in that office, my world changed. I was still in prison. The guards still said \"alright, shut it down,\" I still went to my bunk, but that night I did not sleep. I sat up that entire night reflecting on the history that had just been made. I sat up remembering the tears, smiles, disbelief and prayers of the countless men and women, black and white, gay and straight relishing with me in a \"hope fulfilled\". A hope that surpassed fear, ignorance, and caution. A hope that inspired in me, hope! Although the circumstances of my life that night did not change, the way in which I saw myself did. I would do more and be more, but what that would be I did not know. Today, I am an adjunct lecturer at New York University, where I also earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in the field of Social Work from NYU Silver. I was named the 2016-17 Excellence In Leadership Award Recipient, the 2016 President's Service Award Recipient and the 2017 NYU-NYC Alex Rosen Student of the Year. I am the founder of the Social Justice Network and Educate Don't Incarcerate. My work has afforded me the opportunity to speak on numerous platforms and publications such as USA Today and Forbes Magazine on issues related to criminal justice reform in America. I am also fortunate enough to serve as faculty with the NYU Prison Education Program, where I teach the course subject of Social Work 101.19 CONNECTIONS 2023The single most important aspect for returning citizens is prepa - ration. We had a saying, which I am sure exists today, \"don't let your time do you, you do your time.\" For me that meant taking advantage of the programs offered to better prepare myself for the challenges of release, and society. Secondly, I connected myself with men who were just as committed to improving their lives as I was while I was incarcerated and upon my release. These relation - ships served as a support system of encouragement during those days when the life of prison and my past haunted me. It was through these relationships and experiences that led me to found the Social Justice Network, an organization that is com - mitted to providing support to returning citizens prior to and after incarceration. One of the principles we stand on is that those who are closest to the problem are also closest to the solution. Who knows better the challenges of returning citizens than those returning citizens? This type of insight and information allows us to improve the conditions of those currently incarcerated, as well as those returning home. Our goal is to disrupt the cycle of incarcera - tion by providing the necessary support and resources needed to succeed. Our work consists of not only encouraging and supporting return - ing citizens, but also educating society, influencing the legislature, policy-makers and stakeholders of the importance of sensible policies that improve the reentry process for those impacted by the criminal justice system, creating a system that places value in the lives of those with justice involvement. The mistakes of one's past should not be a life sentence of one's future. As Bryan Stevenson shared in his book Just Mercy , \"Each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.\"COVID-19 YES, WE DO HAVE TO REBUILD OURSELVES FROM THE GROUND UP EVERY SINGLE DAY. NO, I DO NOT BELIEVE LIFE, AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, WILL GET ANY EASIER. BUT WE ARE WORTHY OF OUR PROCESS. WE ARE THE WORK. SAEED JONES21 CONNECTIONS 2023Introduction Please be advised that the moment Connections is printed, it is out of date. This is especially true due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 will continue to be felt in unpre - dictable ways and may impact the organizations in Connections and the services they provide. We highly encourage everyone to contact organizations before visiting in person to confirm operating hours, services (in-person or remote), and any mask or vaccination requirements in order to have the most up-to-date information. For the most recent information and updates on COVID-19, includ - ing data by area, variant information, vaccines, vaccination sites, testing sites, symptoms, prevention, mask guidelines, treatments, and more, contact: For New York State \u2014Call the COVID-19 Hotline: 888.346.3065, the Vaccination Hotline: 833.697.4829, visit . For New \u2014Call 311 , COVID to 692-692 , or visit www. nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-main.page . Information on COVID-19 It is important to get information and updates about COVID-19 from reliable sources. The World Health Organization (WHO) is an agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. WHO's COVID- 19 information page is available at www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 . The website has a question and answer section providing information on many topics including vaccines, variants, youth, pregnancy, breastfeeding, cleaning and disinfection, contraceptives and family planning, homecare, tips for health and safety, and more. They also have a mythbusters page providing factual information on rumors and misinformation about COVID-19.22 COVID-19New York State's COVID-19 website is www.coronavirus.health. ny.gov/home . Visit the website for updated information on trans - mission levels, symptoms and prevention, testing, vaccines, treatments, rights, and more. New York City's COVID-19 website is www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/ covid-19-main.page . Visit the website for updated information on transmission levels, testing, vaccines, new variants, masking guid - ance, symptoms, treatments, and more. Anyone can get COVID-19 and spread COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself and others is to get vaccinated and to follow masking and physical distancing guidelines. COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. These droplets are released when someone with COVID-19 breathes, sneezes, coughs, or talks. Not everyone develops symptoms, but even asymptomatic people can spread COVID-19, including to those who are at a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Scientists and doctors are still learn - ing about COVID-19 and the long-term effects it can have. Prevention measures to decrease the spread of COVID-19 include: Stay up-to-date with vaccinations, if you are medically able to do so. Wear a high-quality mask in public indoor settings and around crowds outside. Practice physical distancing as much as possible, when trans - mission rates are high. Stay home if you are sick. Keep your hands clean: frequently wash your hands for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Cover your mouth by coughing or sneezing into your sleeve or a tissue, and discard tissues in a closed container. Disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. Test before and after travel or gatherings, or if you were recently exposed to someone who has COVID-19.23 CONNECTIONS 2023Along with following these prevention measures, WHO recom - mends avoiding the \"3C's\" to minimize the risks of COVID-19. When considering activities; avoid: Closed spaces with poor ventilation. Crowded places with many people nearby. Close contact, such as close-range conversations. The risk of getting COVID-19 is higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. These environments are where the virus appears to spread by respiratory droplets and aerosols more efficiently. Face Coverings Wearing a high-quality mask helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 by: Protecting the wearer, by reducing their exposure to respiratory particles that may contain the virus. Protecting others, by reducing the amount of respiratory par - ticles that enter the air when someone with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. For more information about face masks visit www.nyc.gov/site/ coronavirus/resources/facecoverings.page . COVID-19 Tests Testing remains an important part of reducing the spread of COVID-19. All New Yorkers should get tested for COVID-19 if they have symptoms or were recently exposed to someone with COVID-19. For more information about COVID-19 testing, including drive-thru testing, antibody testing, to find a testing site, and how to get free at-home COVID-19 tests: For New York State \u2014Call 888.346.3065 or visit https://forward. ny.gov/covid-19-testing . For New York \u2014Call 311 , COVID TEST to 855-48 , or visit www.nyc.gov/site/coronavirus/get-tested/covid-19-testing.page . You are advised to check with the testing site and your insurer in advance of being tested to confirm you will not be responsible for any fees associated with your test.24 COVID-19For more information about where to get free at-home COVID-19 tests and N95 masks call 311 or visit https:/ /portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-03467 . Expiration dates for some at-home testing kits have been extended. The FDA has created a searchable chart, available at www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests , to look up brands of test kits for more information. If a test kit has been updated, a link will be present to take you to another webpage to search by the lot number of the test kit for updated information. Vaccines According to medical experts, the best way to protect yourself from becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 is by getting a vaccine. It is possible to get COVID-19 multiple times, so even people who have had COVID-19 should get a vaccine. The vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing serious illness or death from COVID-19. In March 2021, a judge in New York Supreme Court ruled that every person incarcerated in NYS jails or prisons, must be offered the vaccine. Four COVID-19 vaccines are used in the United States: Pfizer- BioNTech , Moderna, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen, and Novavax. For more information about COVID-19 vaccines, including how many doses are needed to be up-to-date, additional doses and booster shots, and vaccines offered by age group, visit www.cdc. gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html .

Also provides information and resources to answer questions about vaccines, and connect callers to information and services that promote independent living and address fundamen - tal needs, such as food, housing, and transportation. Vaccine Card Information After receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, people are given a vaccina - tion card. The card includes information about which COVID-19 vaccine you received, the date you received it, what lot number the vaccine is from, and where you received it. It is important to keep your vaccination card in a safe place, as it will be needed for travel purposes, to enter certain businesses, attend events, and for addi - tional doses or booster shots. Do not laminate your card as vaccine providers will not be able to write additional information on it, such as booster shot informa - tion.26 COVID-19If you have lost your vaccination card, call the NYS COVID-19 Vaccination Hotline at 833.697.4829 for information on how to get a replacement card. The NYC Health website has information on lost vaccination cards for those who need verification of their vaccine status, available at www.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/cir-parents-guardians.page . COVID-19 Treatment New Yorkers who test positive for COVID-19 can now seek treat - ments that help prevent severe disease. The treatments work best when you receive them as soon as possible after becoming sick, so it's important to get tested and talk to your doctor right away.

AUDRE LORDE ARTWORK BY LEROY LEBRON TAYLORUSED WITH PERMISSION FROM THE ARTIST.58 EDUCATIONAdult Literacy, High School Equivalency (HSE), & English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) There are three levels of adult literacy classes: Beginning programs help adults learn to read and write. Intermediate programs help those who read below a sixth-grade level improve their reading and writing skills. Advanced programs assist people who read at a sixth- to eighth-grade level. Sometimes literacy programs are called Adult Basic Education (ABE) programs, while advanced adult literacy programs are often referred to as pre-High School Equivalency (pre-HSE). These focus on reading, writing, math, social science, and other subjects. A High School Equivalency (HSE) diploma is the recognized alter - native to a high school diploma. In New York State, there are four pathways for a person to earn an HSE diploma. The GED Test is the current HSE exam in New York State. Passing subtest scores from the TASC from 2014 to 2021, and prior GED scores from 2002 to 2013, will continue to be applicable toward current HSE subtest requirements. The GED Test includes four sections: Reasoning Through Language Arts (RLA*) Mathematical Reasoning Science Social Studies *The RLA includes reading and writing subject tests. If only the reading or the writing was previously passed, by taking the GED (2002-2013) or the TASC Test, the RLA must be taken in full. To qualify for an HSE diploma, testers must receive a score of 145 or higher on all four subjects. The entire GED test (all four subtests) 59 CONNECTIONS 2023takes about 7.5 hours to complete and tests do not have to be taken all at once. The National External Diploma Program (NEDP) is a computer- based assessment program for out-of-school youth and adults ages 18 and over. The NEDP is not a test, but a self-paced assess - ment program where students work independently on assignments that cover a variety of academic subjects including reading, writing, math, and workforce readiness skills of participants in life and work contexts. Students meet with an advisor every 1-2 weeks for one hour to review their progress. It is an alternative to the TASC, especially for people who have test anxiety or find timed tests chal - lenging, people who work or have other obligations that affect their ability to attend class, those who struggle with higher-level math, or those who have limited English proficiency. The College Credit Program allows students to use earned college credits to obtain an HSE diploma. Candidates must be enrolled in a college program leading to a degree or certificate at an approved institution and must have earned 24 credits (or equivalent) in certain specified subjects. The Regents\u2014HSE Exam Pathway allows candidates to use passing scores on certain Regents Examinations in place of corre - sponding GED subject tests. Candidates who have passed Regents Examinations in all four core subject areas must still pass at least one GED subject test to earn an HSE diploma. Such candidates may take any GED subject they choose. For more information on the GED test, along with information on the alternative pathways to earn an HSE diploma, visit www.acces. nysed.gov/hse/high-school-equivalency-hse , write to the NYS Education Department-HSE Office, 89 Washington Avenue, EBA 460, Albany, NY 12234 , or call 518.474.5906 .

Housing for individuals convicted of a sex offense It can be difficult to find housing providers that can meet the stipulations for both parole and Strict and Intensive Supervision and Treatment (SIST) for a person registered as a sex offender. Consequently, reentry organizations in New York City face chal - lenging obstacles in connecting such individuals with housing providers. While some organizations do work with registered sex offenders, each individual is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and successful placement in supportive housing takes time and is limited. For these reasons, those looking for housing immedi - ately upon reentry are recommended to go directly to 30th Street Intake, listed on page 85 . For counseling services for individuals convicted of a sex offense, please see the listings for Mustard Seed Counseling Services (page 140 ), New York Counseling for Change ( page 140 ), and Shiloh Consulting ( page 141 ).

DHS programs include counseling, case management, employment training, mental health services, specialized services for veterans, substance use treatment, and programs for older people. Social workers, employment specialists, housing/vocational counselors, and health coordinators work closely with clients in an individual - ized approach that aims to provide clients with the skills needed to achieve the highest level of self-sufficiency. All adults entering the shelter system are expected to work with shelter staff to accomplish this goal.

Securing Shelter for Homeless Families NYC's shelter system is designed to provide temporary emergency shelter to families with no other housing options available to them. Before being placed in a shelter, a family must be found eligible. In order for a family to be eligible, DHS must verify that the family 88 HOUSINGis in immediate need of temporary emergency shelter. DHS will conduct an investigation to determine whether there is any other safe and appropriate place for the family to stay, even temporarily. To aid the investigation, individuals should provide any documents that will help investigators understand why they now are homeless. Examples include eviction papers, a marshal's 72-hour notice, letters from landlords or managing agents, letters from people the individual used to live with, and documents from doctors or other professionals showing that a former apartment is no longer live - able.

Once a family arrives at PATH, they will first be interviewed by a Human Resources Administration (HRA) caseworker, who will inquire about their living situation and explain the services that may help them avoid entering shelter including family mediation, anti-eviction legal services, out-of-city relocation assistance, Family Eviction Prevention Supplement (FEPS), or a deal through HRA. If these services do not apply to a family's specific circumstances, a DHS family worker will interview the family to obtain information about their prior living situation. Families may be assigned a tem - porary shelter placement for up to 10 days while DHS investigates the information provided during the interview. DHS determines whether the family is eligible or ineligible for shelter, based on whether they have fully cooperated with the application and eligibil - ity process and/or have other housing options available to them. Every household has a right to a legal conference at PATH if they are found ineligible and disagree with the decision. In addition, they have 60 days after being found ineligible to request a Fair Hearing from New York State. What to expect Once a family enters a shelter they have certain responsibilities that they must meet, including obtaining and maintaining employ - ment for all those who are able to work. With the assistance of their caseworkers, families will develop an Independent Living Plan (ILP), a document that outlines relevant goals to exit the shelter as soon as possible. Through DHS' policy of Client Responsibility, families in a shelter must actively partici - pate in this process and take strides toward independent living. Families are expected to cooperate in developing and complet - ing their ILP, which includes steps toward obtaining permanent housing: Applying for Public Assistance (PA) and completing all require - ments necessary for establishing and maintaining eligibility for PA benefits92 HOUSING If able to work, actively seeking employment and accepting a suitable job when it is offered Working closely with their caseworker or housing specialist to locate and view available apartments Actively seeking permanent housing by viewing available apart - ments several times per week Halfway & Three-Quarter Housing Halfway housing Halfway housing is temporary housing for individuals recovering from a substance use disorder or finishing a sentence post-incar - ceration. Halfway houses usually house people between 30 days and two years. Individuals can be mandated to reside in halfway housing, often after a period of incarceration. Individuals can also independently enter some facilities. Many halfway houses have strict rules of conduct that must be followed in order to remain in residence or finish a sentence. Rules often include maintain - ing sobriety, checking in when coming and going, and attending programs and meetings. In NYC, halfway houses are run both by government-sponsored organizations and by for-profit companies. Three-quarter housing Three-quarter houses are buildings that rent beds in apartments and houses. These buildings are operated by for-profit companies and are currently unregulated in NYC. Originally fed by referrals from the city shelter system, operators now also recruit tenants leaving substance use disorder units, or being discharged from hospital psychiatric units or correctional facilities. Some com - panies advertise support services and assistance with finding permanent housing, but the quality and frequency of these ser - vices are varied and have received criticism by residents and advocacy groups.

Tenant Rights & Housing Discrimination In New York City, tenants have rights relating to the safety and quality of their housing. Visit the NYC Housing Preservation and Development's website at www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities.page to find resources and information. Some people confuse fair housing rights with tenant rights. If an individual experiences difficulties with an application, lease, lease renewal, services, or rent that are believed to be the result of a discriminatory act (occurring because of one's membership in a particular protected class [e.g., race, creed, national origin]), that person should call 311 and ask for the Commission on Human Rights . See the full listing for the NYC Commission on Human Rights in the Legal chapter on page 212 . Eviction Information It is important to stay up-to-date with policies and legal processes for tenants to know what protections you may have. A letter or notice from your landlord demanding rent is not an evic - tion. Only a judge can evict you . However, if you receive an eviction notice from the Civil Court of the City of New York, this is a legal document and requires a response. You have the right to a tenant attorney to defend you in court. Under New York City's Right-to-Counsel (RTC) law, DSS/HRA's Office of Civil Justice (OCJ) provides some low-income tenants facing eviction in Housing Court or NYCHA administrative proceed - ings with access to free legal representation and advice provided 102 HOUSINGby nonprofit legal services organizations from across the five bor - oughs.

Depending on what a person is willing to accept, the teams may offer a range of services, including: Assessment Crisis intervention Supportive counseling Information and referrals, including to community-based mental health services Transport to Psychiatric Emergency Room If a mobile crisis team determines that a person in crisis needs further psychiatric or medical assessment, they can transport that person to a hospital psychiatric emergency room. Mobile crisis teams may direct police to take a person to an emergency room against their will only if they have a mental illness (or the appear - ance of mental illness) and are a danger to themselves or others. This is in accordance with NYS Mental Hygiene Law.147 CONNECTIONS 2023Therapy Resources Therapy can be expensive, but there are options for low-cost therapy or alternatives. When looking for a therapist, find out what type of insurance they accept, for instance private insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare, and ask if they offer sliding scale fees. Check out local colleges and universities with mental health prac - titioner programs as they may provide services that offer reduced rates where graduate students work under the supervision of experienced professionals. Group therapy or support groups can be a more affordable alternative to one-on-one therapy, and many organizations in Connections offer this service at low- or no-cost. The following are some online resources to find therapists. LATINX THERAPY www.latinxtherapy.com An organization working to destigmatize mental health in the Latinx community.

According to The National Harm Reduction Coalition, \"Harm reduc - tion is a set of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing negative consequences associated with drug use. Harm Reduction is also a movement for social justice built on a belief in, and respect for, the rights of people who use drugs.\" Harm reduction encompasses a range of practices including, but not limited to, drug consumption rooms, needle and syringe ser - vices, non-abstinence-based housing and employment initiatives, drug checking, overdose prevention and reversal, and information on safer drug use. Visit the National Harm Reduction Coalition website at www. harmreduction.org for resources to learn more including Harm Reduction 101.

Naloxone is a medication that reverses overdoses from opioids such as heroin, fentanyl, and prescription painkillers. For more information, including where to get a free naloxone kit , call NYC Well at 888.692.9355 or /nycwell.cityofnewyork.us/ en/naloxone . Fentanyl use and testing Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is at least 50 times as potent as heroin and is responsible for more overdoses than any other opioid. Visit www.harmreduction.org/issues/fentanyl for informa - tion on fentanyl use, myths and facts, and overdose prevention tips.163 CONNECTIONS 2023Fentanyl test strips can identify the presence of fentanyl in unregu - lated drugs. They can be used to test injectable drugs, powders, and pills. Being aware if fentanyl is present allows people to imple - ment appropriate harm reduction strategies to reduce the risk of an overdose. DoseTest sells fentanyl test strips for $1 each. The website provides information on how to use the test strips for both solid and liquid samples available at www.dosetest.com . Basic Overdose Prevention Tips Anyone can overdose, especially when using drugs for the first time or using after a period of not using. People who have overdosed previously are much more likely to overdose again. Overdose risk increases for those who use drugs alone. It is recommended that people who use alone let a contact know where they are and that they are using. That contact can check on a person by phone/text and notify emergency services if they don't respond. Fentanyl can be present in any drug and drastically increases one's risk of overdose and the strength of a particular drug can be different every single time. Mixing drugs can increase the risk for overdose, particularly when using benzodiazepines, alcohol, and/or opioids together. Have a safety plan written down that can be referred to before/during use. This can be helpful and decrease the chances of a fatal overdose. The NYS Department of Health has a resource called Build a Safety Plan , available in English and Spanish, at www.oasas.ny.gov/prevent-overdose . The Never Use Alone hotline at 800.484.3731 , is a number that anyone can call when they are about to use a substance. An operator will then stay on the line with the person while they use. If the person does not respond after a set amount of time after use, the operator will notify emergency services of the person's location for response. Overdose Prevention Centers in NYC Overdose Prevention Centers, also called supervised injection sites, are health care facilities that provide a safe environment where people can use previously obtained drugs under super - vision. Trained staff at the centers observe and intervene if someone shows signs of an overdose.

Police Interactions: Know Your Rights The following includes information from the ACLU that can be found at www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police . A note from ACLU: Interactions with police are stressful experi - ences that can go bad quickly. The following information describes what the law requires and also offers strategies for handling police encounters. The burden of de-escalation does not fall on private citizens\u2014it falls on police officers. However, you cannot assume officers will behave in a way that protects your safety or that they will uphold your rights even after you assert them. You may be able to reduce risk to yourself by staying calm and not exhibiting hostil - ity toward the officers. The truth is that there are situations where people have done everything they could to de-escalate a police encounter, yet still were injured or killed. For information on alternatives to calling the police for someone who is experiencing a crisis, see page 145. Be aware that for this service a trained counselor will help to assess the most appropri - ate next steps, which may include calling 911 and involving the police. Your rights You have the right to remain silent. To exercise that right, say so out loud. You have the right to refuse to consent to a search of yourself, your car, your home, or your electronic devices. To exercise that right, say so out loud. If you are not under arrest, you have the right to walk away. You have the right to a lawyer if you are arrested. Ask for one immediately.167 CONNECTIONS 2023How to reduce risk to yourself Try to stay calm. Do not run, resist, or obstruct the officers. Keep your hands where the police can see them. Do not lie or give false documents. If you are stopped for questioning Ask, \"Am I free to leave?\" If the officer says yes, calmly and silently walk away. If you are being detained or under arrest, you have a right to know why. If police say you are not free to leave, then you are being detained, but not necessarily arrested. You may be asked for identification and although you are not legally required to carry an ID in New York City, in many cases it's safer to show an ID. You have the right to remain silent and cannot be punished for refusing to answer questions. If you wish to remain silent, say aloud, \"I am choosing to remain silent.\" Everything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of law. Remember that law enforcement is specially trained to use your words and actions to justify arrest, prosecu - tion, and conviction. You do not have to consent to a search of yourself or your belongings, but police may pat down your outermost clothing if they suspect you have a weapon. You should not physically resist, but you have the right to refuse consent for any further search. If you do consent, it can affect you later in court. Say out loud, \"I do not consent to this search.\" If you are stopped in your car Both drivers and passengers have the right to remain silent. If you are a passenger, you can ask if you are free to leave. If yes, calmly leave if you choose. Stop the car in a safe place as quickly as possible. Turn off the car, turn on the internal light, open the window and place your hands on the wheel. Avoid making sudden movements. Upon request, show police your driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance. If an officer or immigration agent asks to look inside your car, you can refuse to consent to the search and should say so out loud. But if police believe your car contains evidence of a crime, your car can be searched without your consent.168 LEGALIf police officers come to your home You do not have to let them in unless they have certain kinds of warrants, signed by a judge. Ask the officer to slip the warrant under the door or hold it up to the window so you can inspect it. A search warrant allows police to enter the address listed on the warrant, but officers can only search the areas and for the items listed. An arrest warrant allows police to enter the home of the person listed on the warrant if they believe the person is inside. Even if officers have a warrant, you have the right to remain silent. If you choose to speak to the officers, step outside and close the door. If you are arrested For your safety, do not resist arrest, even if you believe the arrest is unfair. Say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately. Do not give any explanations or excuses. If you can't pay for a lawyer, you have the right to a free one. Do not say anything, sign anything, or make any decisions without a lawyer. If you have been arrested contact Good Call at 833.346.6322 (833.3.GOODCALL ) for free legal support. You have the right to make a local phone call. The police cannot listen or record your call if you call a lawyer. Prepare yourself and your family in case you are arrested. Memorize the phone numbers of your family and your lawyer. Make emergency plans if you have children or take medication. If bail is set and you can't afford it, ask your lawyer about con - tacting a bail fund. DNA Collection In New York, the police are required to get a warrant or court order before taking your DNA. Ways to protect against unwarranted DNA collection include: Stating aloud that you do not consent to the police taking your DNA swab without a warrant or court order. Avoiding drinking, smoking, or chewing gum in police custody, as used items have your DNA on them. Keeping your mask and other PPE as you go through the arrest process, as those items have your DNA on them. Parents with a child in custody can tell the police that they do 169 CONNECTIONS 2023not consent to any collection of their child's DNA either through a swab or from something the child ate or drank. If you feel your rights have been violated Remember, it can be dangerous to challenge police misconduct on the street. Do not physically resist officers or threaten to file a complaint. Write down everything you remember, including officers' badge and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information for witnesses. If you are injured, seek medical attention and take photographs of your injuries. File a written complaint with the agency's internal affairs divi - sion and/or the civilian complaint board. In most cases, you can file a complaint anonymously if you wish. Visit www.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/index.page or call 800.341.2272 to file a complaint to the NYC Civilian Complaint Review Board . What you can do if you witness police abuse or brutality You have a right to record or photograph police interactions, as long as you do not interfere with or obstruct their movements. Do not try to hide the fact that you are recording. When they are performing their jobs, police officers do not have the same privacy protections as civilians. However, recording or photo - graphing civilians without their permission can put them at risk for additional surveillance or legal action. Police officers are not allowed to confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, and they may not delete your photographs or video under any circumstances. If an officer orders you to stop recording or orders you to hand over your phone, you should politely but firmly tell the officer that you do not consent to doing so, and remind the officer that taking photographs or video is your right under the First Amendment. Be aware that some officers may arrest you for refusing to comply. The arrest would be unlawful, but you will need to weigh the personal risks of arrest (including the risk that officers may search you and your phone upon arrest) against the value of continuing to record. Whether or not you are able to record everything, write down everything you remember, including officers' badge and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, how many 170 LEGALofficers were present and what their names were, any use of weapons (including less-lethal weapons such as Tasers or batons), and any injuries suffered by the person stopped. If you are able to speak to the person stopped by police after the police leave, they may find your contact information helpful in case they decide to file a complaint or pursue a lawsuit against the officers. In Public Housing You have the same rights as anyone else on the street or in private housing. Police can approach you inside public housing if they think you are violating a NYCHA House Rule, such as hanging out in the lobby. They may ask for ID and ask questions about what you're doing and where you're going. But, unless they have \"reason - able suspicion\" that you have, are, or are about to commit a crime, you have the right to walk away and not answer their questions. You should handle this situation like any other police interaction. If police check to verify whether you are a resident or a resi - dent's guest, they are detaining you in a \"stop.\" They cannot do this unless they have reasonable suspicion that you are tres - passing or committing another crime. If police believe you are trespassing in public housing, they may give you the opportunity to leave before arresting you. If police ask you to leave and you don't, they may arrest you. It is the NYPD's policy that they can arrest anyone, including residents, found on the roof, roof landing (top of the stairs), or other \"restricted areas\" regardless of what you are doing there. Arrests & Policing The Legal Aid Society has information resources on their website available at https:/ /legalaidnyc.org/get-help/arrests-policing . Topics covered include what people need to know about encoun - ters with police, getting help after arrest, criminal court, arrest and prosecution of minors, prison visitation, finding a lawyer, Miranda rights, and what to expect if you're being arrested. They also provide a glossary of legal terms and acronyms available at https:/ /legalaidnyc.org/glossary .171 CONNECTIONS 2023Law Enforcement Lookup (LELU) Part of the Legal Aid Society's Cop Accountability Project (CAP), LELU is an online database that allows people to access law enforcement misconduct in NYC, available at https:/ /legalaidnyc.org/law-enforcement-look-up . Protest Safety & Rights It's important to understand the risks of attending a protest, including the risk of arrest and detention, which have different implications for different people, including legal complications and safety risks for people with previous criminal legal system involvement, undocumented immigrants, people with disabilities, transgender and gender nonconforming people, and others. The following information is compiled from the ACLU , NYCLU , and the Legal Aid Society . For more information on rights to protest visit www.legalaidnyc.org/get-help/arrests-policing/what-you- need-to-know-about-protesting . You Have the Right to Protest New Yorkers have the constitutional right to engage in protest activity on public sidewalks and streets, and in public parks. This includes the right to distribute flyers or leaflets; the right to hold press conferences, demonstrations, and rallies; and the right to march on public sidewalks and in public streets. The City can impose restrictions, and in some instances requires a permit. The police may issue a dispersal order. If they do, they are obliged to provide clear notice and an opportunity for you to leave the area. General Information if You Are Arrested If you are detained, questioned, or arrested, it is your right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you or others. If you are arrested, it is your right to ask for a lawyer immedi - ately. The National Lawyers Guild specializes in representing people arrested during protests. The phone number of the NYC Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild is: 212.679.6018 .172 LEGALProtections Against Surveillance at Protests The police can view photos and video to see who attended a protest, and they can use face recognition tools to match one's identity to existing records. Protesters can wear a face mask, hat, and sunglasses to limit their exposure. Leave your car at home. Police can use automated license plate readers to track protestors. If you can, ride a bicycle or walk to prevent your license plate being tracked. Wear nondescript, solid colors, and cover identifying features such as tattoos. Protect Your Digital Security Every electronic device that you have with you has the potential to be taken by law enforcement if you are arrested. More information on how law enforcement agencies extract data from cellphones, including location data, is on page 177 . You have the right to refuse a search of your devices and you are not required to unlock your device for police. To ensure your refusal is known, you can state it out loud if asked . If your phone is confiscated, attempting to remotely wipe your device can result in criminal charges against you. Ways to protect digital security include: Disabling face/fingerprint unlock on your phone and using strong passcodes of 10 characters or more. Turning off GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi, and all location services on your phone and on individual apps. Reviewing your social media privacy settings to limit who can see your posts and accounts. Do not tag or post identifiable images of people without their permission. Doing so puts people at risk for additional surveil - lance. Encrypted messaging and calling apps are used to send and receive texts and calls privately. Encrypted apps, such as the free app Signal, often have a disappearing messages feature for added security, where texts are automatically deleted after a set period of time and cannot be recovered. Put your phone on airplane mode. Enabling airplane mode when you are not communicating reduces the amount of radio signals 173 CONNECTIONS 2023your device transmits while you are protesting and limits your location from being tracked. For more information about digital surveillance and protesting, visit the guide by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) at https:// ssd.eff.org/en/module/attending-protest . Defend Our Movements is a web-based clearinghouse with useful information about protecting your devices and data. The digital self-defense curriculum is available at www.defendourmovements. org/resource/digital-self-defense-curriculum . Digital Policing & Surveillance New technology has given law enforcement agencies (such as the NYPD, ICE, and the FBI) more tools to use when policing. Digital information is being collected and stored, and law enforcement agencies use this information to watch, investigate, and arrest people. Laws have struggled to keep up when it comes to people's digital privacy rights, meaning that digital surveillance is currently used without many regulations. Advanced technology used by federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies includes predictive policing, automated risk-assessment systems, face and speaker recognition, and other digital surveillance tools. These tools use algorithms and machine learning, and it is not always publicly known how, where, or when they are being used. Collected digital information is used to create files on specific people, or to create databases of groups of people. Law enforce - ment databases can be over-inclusive and racially discriminatory because the data collected reflects existing biases in policing. The gang database created and used by the NYPD does not require any evidence of criminality or suspicion of wrongdoing in order for a person to be added. People are not notified when they are included in the database, and minors may be added to the NYPD gang database without parental notification. There is no official way to challenge inclusion and no criteria or protocol for removal from the gang database.174 LEGALThe NYPD has stated that there are two ways in which a person can be added to the database. One way is if a person admits to police that they are a gang member, if they make an admission on social media, or if they are identified as a gang member by two people who the police consider reliable sources. The second way is if a person meets two or more of the following criteria: being in a location associated with a gang, wearing colors associated with a gang, using hand signs associated with a gang, having tattoos associated with a gang, and association with gang members in person or online, such as connections on social media (\"liking,\" being tagged in pictures, or commenting on posts). Visit the Legal Aid Society's webpage at https:/ /legalaidfoil.backspace.com for more information on the gang database, including information on submitting a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request about being in the gang database. Phone Surveillance in NYC and NYS Facilities Securus Technologies, LLC (also known as JPay) is a prison tech - nologies firm that sells telephone services to New York State Department of Correction and Community Supervision (DOCCS) and New York City Department of Correction (DOC) facilities. Phone calls and conversations made by people who are currently incarcerated in New York are recorded, logged, and analyzed. Speaker recognition technology is used to identify people by their voice. Those who are currently incarcerated are required to record their voice in order to gain access to use the phone system. With each person's voice on file, the technology can identify who is speaking within the first few seconds of each phone call. The people who they speak to on the phone (friends, families, advisers, minor children, etc.) can be identified by their voices and included in a database that can compare voices and identify potential matches. A loved one who accepts a call from a facility may not be able to be identified by name, but the system can record informa - tion such as their phone number, their location (for up to one hour after a call ends), how often they call, who they are in conversa - tion with, and what they say. Additionally, the voices of previously incarcerated people will remain in the database and those people would be identifiable by name if they accepted a call from a facility. 175 CONNECTIONS 2023Background conversations of people not on the call can also be picked up and recorded. In addition to identifying who is speaking on a phone call, JPay is also able to conduct real-time, undetectable monitoring by live investigators. The investigators are automatically alerted when a \"flagged\" person places a phone call, and they are immediately connected to that call. Further, their technology can identify \"suspi - cious\" key words or phrases and suspected criminal activity. JPay's methods of defining suspicious key words, or what constitutes suspected criminal activity, are proprietary and therefore not public knowledge. Some phone calls are considered private, such as those subject to attorney-client privilege, and certain phone numbers can be regis - tered as \"private,\" automatically eliminating them from monitoring or recording, and listing them as \"private\" in call logs. However, JPay does not publicly share information about how it remains accountable for following protocols around private phone calls. Further privacy issues arise regarding data storage and reten - tion. Users with access to the database, such as local police departments or district attorney's offices, can retain recordings indefinitely, with the ability to copy recorded conversations onto any external device. It is important to be aware of these privacy risks and to use the phone system in any facility with caution. For more information visit the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP) 's website at www.stopspying.org/listening-beyond- the-bars . Changes to NYC DOC Family Video Visiting Since 2020, in-person visits at NYC DOC facilities are limited and can be scheduled in advance online. Televisits, which can be done using any electronic device with a camera, an internet connec - tion, and an active email account, are still being offered. Televisits impact visitor privacy and all family visits are recorded . The new protocol to record all family visits does not align with previously established minimum standards of visitor privacy. Incarcerated 176 LEGALpeople and their families should be aware of the privacy implica - tions. According to NYC Board of Corrections Minimum Standards (poli - cies that define the rights of incarcerated people and their families in NYC), family visits should be considered private. The standards that govern surveillance of family visiting are outlined in the NYC Administrative Code, Title 40, section \u00a7 1-09 (g), and read as follows: (5) Supervision shall be provided during visits solely to ensure that the safety or security of the facility is maintained.(6) Visits shall not be listened to or monitored unless a lawful warrant is obtained, although visual supervision should be maintained. The full text of the NYC Board of Corrections Minimum Standards can be found athttps:/ /codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCrules/0-0-0-79126 . While phone calls are regularly recorded, loved ones do not need to pre-register personal information in order to receive a phone call from a DOC facility. (It is still important to be aware that one's voice is recorded, along with the content of their conversation, and the phone number and location being called.) In contrast, televis - its require a visitor's name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address, and a scan or photo of a valid government-issued ID. With a televisit, personal identifiable information about each visitor is recorded and kept indefinitely, along with video and audio of each visit that is retained for 90 days. The DOC states that, \"Any statements made during your visit can be shared with law enforce - ment.\" If a DOC Investigator or legal subpoena from another law enforcement agency requests a copy of a televisit video within 90 days, DOC will share a copy with the requesting unit. The DOC's Visitor Televisit information page can be found at www. nyc.gov/site/doc/inmate-info/televisits.page . Be aware of what you post on social media Law enforcement agencies use social media in many ways includ - ing browsing social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), creating fake profiles and pages (to gain access to both public and non -177 CONNECTIONS 2023public information), and monitoring and tracking search words and hashtags (#s) people use on social media websites. Law enforce - ment agencies also monitor friend connections, people you follow, people who follow you, group page affiliations, and \"likes.\" Be aware that there are ways for law enforcement agencies to access more information (such as location data) on things you post, such as videos or images. It is important to remember that anything you post publicly, either on a public page or in public groups, can be legally used against you or another person. No subpoena is required for accessing public data like this. Even if you use privacy settings, everything you post online is in some way accessible to everyone. While you may be able to delete a post or your profile later, during the time between making the post and deleting it, law enforcement may have already preserved a copy or someone may have saved it or posted it somewhere where you do not have the ability to delete it. Do not post something online if you do not want everyone (includ - ing law enforcement agencies) to see it. Cell phones To search phones, law enforcement agencies use mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs), a powerful technology that allows police to extract a full copy of data from a cell phone. All emails, texts, photos, location, app data, and more can be evaluated. If the police take your phone, you may not get it back easily. Back up your data regularly and store that backup in a safe place. For more information UpTurn has published a comprehensive report called Mass Extraction: The Widespread Power of U.S. Law Enforcement to Search Mobile Phones , available online at www. upturn.org/reports/2020/mass-extraction . Location data and how police use it Law enforcement agencies use location data from cell phones to find and track people. Your cell phone itself, and nearly every individual app on your phone, can track your location. Turning off or disallowing the location tracking in the settings of your phone will limit the ability for your phone to be tracked. When you have location enabled for an app, that information is 178 LEGALstored and law enforcement agencies can issue a warrant to see your cell phone's location. For example, Google keeps location information and the history is detailed enough to describe the street-by-street movements of a person. You can go through the settings on your cell phone and check to see if location services are enabled for the apps on your phone.

Encrypted apps, such as the free app Signal, often have a disappearing messages feature for added security, where texts are automatically deleted after a set period of time and cannot be recovered. More information on Signal is available at www.signal.org . Another way to ensure that law enforcement agencies cannot access the data on your phone is to use strong passwords for the phone itself and for individual apps. Representation & Assistance Discovery Law Created in 2020 and amended in 2022, New York State instituted a discovery law with a statute that requires evidence sharing between the prosecution and defense on an accelerated timeline\u2014emphasizing the right of someone to fully understand their charges and the evidence against them before making a decision about accepting a plea bargain. With some exceptions, evidence must be shared within 20 days of arraignment for defendants held in jail, and within 35 days for defendants not in custody. Prosecutors can request 30 additional days in some instances. More information is available at www.courtinnovation.org/publications/discovery-NYS .

For more information visit nycbailsettlement.com . The following information is compiled from the NYC 311 website. For more information visit https:/ /portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01398 . What is bail? Bail is an amount of money set by a judge at court. The stated purpose is to ensure that a defendant attends future court dates. If a defendant's family or friends are able to provide the cash bail to the court (to post bail), the defendant is released before trial and must attend all court dates. If a defendant does not show up for a court date, the court may keep the bail (the money has been forfeited) and issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest. If a defendant makes all court appearances, the bail will be refunded back, minus a 3% fee if the defendant is found or pleads guilty. If a defendant cannot post bail, they will be held at a Department of Correction (DOC) facility until bail is paid, the case has been disposed of, or they are released for another reason. A judge can set a bond instead of bail. A bond is a legal contract that requires someone to pay money if the defendant does not appear at a court date. When is bail set? Bail is generally set at the first court appearance (arraignment), which must occur within 24 hours of the defendant's arrest. If the defendant pleads not guilty at arraignment, a judge has four release options. They may release the defendant on their own recognizance, meaning the defendant is free to go without paying any money or providing a bond; the judge may set bail in various forms, which the defendant (or friends or family) must post to be released; the judge may release the defendant to a supervised release program, which will require the defendant to check in by phone and in person; and lastly, for certain felonies, bail may be denied and the defendant will be remanded to DOC custody. How to pay bail in person To post bail, you must present personal identification and provide the New York State Identification (NYSID) or Book and Case number of the person to be bailed.193 CONNECTIONS 2023Bail will be accepted in any of the following forms: US cash for the full amount; Cashier's/teller's check, in any amount not exceeding the bail figure; Money order from Federal Express, US Postal Service, Travelers Express Company, Western Union, or a private bank\u2014up to $1,000 Credit or debit card Personal checks are not accepted. Cashier's checks, teller's checks, or money orders must be made payable to the New York City Department of Correction. The amount of each money order must not exceed $1,000. If the total bail amount is more than $1,000, you can pay with multiple money orders or a combination of money orders, checks, and cash. The total amount you pay must exactly match the bail amount. No change will be provided. Call 311 for the most updated list of locations where you can pay bail. At the time of publication, you can pay bail in person 7 days a week at the Criminal Courts listed below and 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at any DOC facility below: Bronx Criminal Court 265 East 161 Street, Lower Level, Room M-05C, Bronx, NY 10451Hours: 8am-1am Brooklyn Criminal Court 120 Schermerhorn Street, Room 101C, 1st Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201Hours: 8:30am -1am Manhattan Detention Complex 125 White Street, New York, NY 10013 Queens Detention Complex 126-01 82nd Avenue, Kew Gardens, NY 11415 Vernon C.

The Juvenile Centers cannot accept payments for individuals detained at other facilities. How to pay bail online You can pay bail online if: A judge has set credit card bail as a form of bail payment for that individual The individual doesn't have any surety conditions, such as a surety interview DOC has logged the individual's bail conditions into their Inmate Lookup Service Online bail payment is not available on any court dates following arraignment. If you want to pay bail on any court date other than arraignment, you should pay directly at the courthouse's cashier window. To pay bail online, you first need to look up the individual using their first and last name, NYSID, or Book and Case Number, using the DOC Inmate Lookup Service online at www.nyc.gov/site/doc/inmate-info/inmate-lookup.page . There may be a short waiting period after arraignment before the individual's information is logged into the system. If bail is eligible to be paid online, clicking on the Pay Bail button on the Inmate Details page will take you to a new page where you can begin the transaction. If the Pay Bail button is grayed out, then the individual isn't eligible for online bail payment yet, or their informa - tion has not yet been entered into the system. The online payment system accepts credit and debit cards and can be used to pay bails of any amount. You will be charged a non-refundable 2% fee per transaction. If you have questions about whether an individual is eligible for bail, contact the individual's attorney. If the person you are paying bail for has a warrant, hold, or addi - tional case, they may not be released until those additional issues are resolved. You will receive a refund from the Department of 195 CONNECTIONS 2023Finance roughly eight weeks after the case has been resolved. Your refund will not include the 2% online bail processing fee. An additional 3% will be taken if the defendant is found guilty. What if the defendant misses a court appearance? If a defendant misses a court appearance, the judge may issue a court order for the Department of Finance to keep the cash bail, called a \"forfeit order.\" You should receive a letter notify - ing you that your cash bail has been forfeited by the court. You should contact the court that ordered the forfeiture or the District Attorney's Office within 45 days of the date of the letter to learn the reason for the forfeiture. There is a procedure called \"remis - sion of forfeiture\" which allows you to apply for the cash bail to be returned once it has been forfeited. You may want to hire a lawyer to help you with this, but you can also do it on your own. You must apply for this remission within one year of the date that the court ordered the bail forfeited. What is a commercial bail bond? Commercial bail bondsmen charge a fee and require collateral from a defendant's friends and family to write a bond and post that bond with the court to secure a defendant's release pretrial. Commercial bail bond providers commonly charge 10% of the total bail, plus collateral. The collateral required is typically property, including real estate and cars, and a judge must sign-off on the bail bond and the amount of collateral. By issuing a bail bond, the bondsman commits to paying the court the full amount of the defendant's bail, should the defendant fail to return to court. If you have the cash for bail available, you may prefer to pay the bail directly, to avoid fees charged by commercial bail bondsmen.

Voting Registration & Rights Voting with a Conviction Record in New York In 2021, legislation to permanently and automatically restore the right of people on parole to vote in all elections was signed into law. Unless currently incarcerated from a felony conviction, New Yorkers with a conviction record are eligible to vote. In New York, you can vote with a conviction record if you: were convicted of a misdemeanor; or are on parole; or are on probation; or198 LEGAL were not sentenced to prison or had your prison sentence sus - pended; or served your maximum prison sentence; or were pardoned. You are eligible to vote while serving a misdemeanor sentence or if you are incarcerated pre-sentence on any charges. You may be eligible to vote while serving a local jail sentence for a felony conviction if you have been granted a Certificate of Relief from Disabilities for that conviction. If you are serving a felony sentence in state prison, you will not be eligible to vote until your release. You must re-register to vote after you have served your maximum sentence or are released on parole. You may still register and vote in New York if you have completed either a federal felony conviction, or a felony conviction in another state. If you plan to vote, you must register to vote if: you have never registered to vote, or you registered to vote before being sentenced to jail or prison for a felony conviction. You can register through the Department of Motor Vehicles website at https://dmv.ny.gov/more-info/electronic-voter-registration-application or by providing a paper form in person or by mail to your county board of elections. If you are in jail awaiting trial or serving time for a misdemeanor or violation you may vote with an absentee ballot. You must complete and mail an absentee ballot request form. To request an absentee ballot application you can call the Board of Elections in New York City at 866.868.3692 . Your Right to Vote The following information is from www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/voting-rights and outlines some scenarios that may come up when trying to exercise the right to vote. If you run into any problems or have questions on Election Day, call the Election Protection Hotline : English: 866.687.8683199 CONNECTIONS 2023 Spanish: 888.839.8682 Arabic: Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog, or Vietnamese: 888.274.8683 General Rights on Election Days Your rights: If the polls close while you're still in line, stay in line\u2014you have the right to vote. If you make a mistake on your ballot, ask for a new one. If the machines are down at your polling place, ask for a paper ballot. Your rights if the poll worker says your name is not on the list of registered voters: Voters are entitled to a provisional ballot, even if they aren't in the poll book. After Election Day, election officials must investigate whether you are qualified to vote and registered. If you are qualified and registered, they will count your provisional ballot. What to do: Ask the poll worker to double-check for your name on the list of registered voters. Make sure to spell your name out for the poll worker. If your name is not on the list, ask if there is a supplemental list of voters. If the poll worker still cannot find your name, confirm that you are at the correct polling place. Request that the poll workers check a statewide system (if one is available) to see if you are registered to vote at a different polling place. If the poll worker does not have access to a statewide system, ask them to call the main election office. If you are registered at a different loca - tion, in most instances you will have to travel to that location to cast a regular ballot. If the poll worker still cannot find your name or if you cannot travel to the correct polling place, ask for a provisional ballot. Voters with a disability Your rights: Under federal law, all polling places for federal elections must 200 LEGALbe fully accessible to older adults and voters with disabili - ties. Simply allowing curbside voting is not enough to meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility requirements. In federal elections, every polling place must have at least one voting system that allows voters with disabilities to vote privately and independently. Usually, this is a machine that can read the ballot to you (for people with vision disabilities or dyslexia), and let you vote by pushing buttons (for people with mobility disabilities). Under federal law, voters with disabilities and voters who have difficulty reading or writing English have the right to receive in-person help at the polls from the person of their choice. This helper cannot be the voter's employer, an agent of the voter's employer, or an agent or officer of the voter's union. The helper must respect the voter's privacy, not looking at the voter's ballot unless the voter asks them to do so. Election officials (including poll workers) must make reasonable accommodations as needed to help you vote. Election officials must provide you with help if it's possible for them to do so. A voter with a mental disability cannot be turned away from the polls because a poll worker thinks they are not 'qualified' to vote. What to do: You can bring a family member, friend, or another person of your choice to assist you at the polls. Do not bring your employer or an agent of your employer or union. If you bring a person to assist you, let the poll workers know when you check-in. They may ask you to swear under oath that you have a disability and that you have asked that person to help you. Your helper may also be required to sign a form swear - ing that they did not tell you how to vote. If there are long lines and you have a physical or mental health condition or disability that makes it difficult for you to stand in line, tell a poll worker. Tell election officials what you need. For example, if it's hard for you to stand, they should provide you with a chair or a place to sit while you wait. If the crowds or noise are hard for you, elec -201 CONNECTIONS 2023tion officials can find a quiet place for you to wait and call you when it's your turn to vote. If you are not able to enter your polling place because the pathway to it is not fully accessible, ask poll workers for curb - side assistance. If you have difficulty using the materials provided to make your ballot selections, review, or cast your ballot, let a poll worker know and ask for the help you need. If you face any challenges in voting privately and independently or are unable to cast your vote, report the problem to the Election Protection Hotline . Trained attorneys can assist you and make sure that other voters do not experience the same problem.

A course on place accessibility requirements is available at https:/ /rockymountainada.talentlms.com/catalog/info/id:133 . For voting information in American Sign Language, visit www.signvote.org . Voters who speak English less than \"very well\" Your rights: Under federal law, voters who have a hard time reading or writing English may receive in-person help at the polls from the person of their choice. This person cannot be the voter's employer, an agent of the voter's employer, or an agent or officer of the voter's union. The federal Voting Rights Act contains a number of protections for voters who require language help. In NYC, depending on where you live, language assistance is available in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Bengali. All registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, and other information relating to voting, 202 LEGALincluding ballots, must be provided in other languages. Visit www.vote.nyc/page/information or call 866.868.3692 for more information, including which polling sites have interpreters available. What to do: You can bring a family member, friend, or another person of your choice to help you at the polls. Do not bring your employer, or an agent of your employer or union. If you live in a county with bilingual voting help for a language you speak, you can request oral help from a bilingual poll worker and ask for voting materials, such as a ballot, in that language. If someone is interfering with your right to vote Examples of voter intimidation: Aggressively questioning voters about their citizenship, convic - tion record, or other qualifications to vote. Falsely representing oneself as an elections official. Displaying false or misleading signs about voter fraud and related criminal penalties. Other forms of harassment, particularly harassment targeting non-English speakers and voters of color. Spreading false information about voter requirements. Your rights: It's illegal to intimidate voters and a federal crime to \"intimidate, threaten, [or] coerce ... any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of [that] other person to vote or to vote as he may choose.\" You do not need to speak English to vote, in any state. You do not need to pass a test to vote, in any state. In New York, only first time voters need to present photo identification if they did not provide valid identification at the time they registered to vote. What to do if you experience voter intimidation: Report intimidation to your local board of elections. Their offices are open on Election Day. In New York, you can give a sworn statement to the poll worker that you satisfy the qualifications to vote in your state, and then proceed to cast a ballot.203 CONNECTIONS 2023Voter Suppression Voter suppression is any effort, either legal or illegal, by way of laws, administrative rules, and/or tactics that prevent citizens from registering to vote or voting. Examples of voter suppression include, but are not limited to, voter ID laws, voter registration restriction, voter intimidation, felony disenfranchisement, voter purges, polling site closures, and gerrymandering.

The following is from www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/Criminal/sexOffenders.shtml . People convicted of a sex offense must register with the NY State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS). Risk Levels for People Convicted of a Sex Offense There are three levels used to designate the risk of re-offense. This is the court's estimation of the likelihood that the person will commit another sex related crime. The level is decided by the court and includes: Level 1 - lowest risk Level 2 - moderate risk Level 3 - highest risk There are also three additional designations that the court can assign: sexual predator, sexually violent offender, and predicate sex offender. These designations and the risk level determine reporting requirements and how much information is open to the public. Obligations People convicted of a sex offense have many reporting responsi - bilities and requirements. Some of these include: Reporting where they live to DCJS annually. Notifying DCJS in writing of a new address no later than 10 days after moving. Reporting in person to a local police agency to have a current picture taken every 3 years (Level 1 and 2) or every year (Level 3 offenders). Notifying DCJS in writing of any school they are attending, enrolled in, living at or employed by. Any changes must be reported to DCJS no later than 10 days after the change.208 LEGAL Providing written information to DCJS about their Internet service providers, Internet screen names and email accounts. People with Level 3 and/or a sexual predator designation must personally verify their addresses every 90 days with law enforcement. Law enforcement may take a picture of a person if their appearance has changed and is Level 3. Level 2 and 3 have to report the address of their employer to the DCJS. Failure to perform any of the registration obligations is a felony. Petition for Relief or Modification Corrections Law \u00a7168-O states that a person convicted of a sex offense can file a motion to be removed from the registry or change their risk level. After filing the motion, the person is entitled to a court appointed attorney if they can't afford one. Removal : After 30 years, a person with a level 2 risk level (who has not been designated a sexual predator, sexually violent offender, or predicate sex offender), can petition the court to be relieved from all registration requirements and be removed from the registry. This petition can be made once every two years starting 30 years after the first registration. Modification : A person on the sex offender registry can petition the sentencing court or the court that made the determination regarding the level, for an order downwardly modifying their risk level. This petition can be made once per year. The petition should say which new level is being requested and the reasons why the change should be granted. For example, a person designated at level 3 might ask the court to change to level 2 because there have been no new sexual offenses for many years, and/or they have been in treatment, and/or the risk level is keeping them from getting a job or housing, and/or they have demonstrated healthy changes in their life. It is suggested to speak to an attorney. The District Attorney can also ask the court to modify the risk level if a person has been convicted of a new crime or has violated a condition that the District Attorney thinks increases the risk of re-offense.

Grievance process while incarcerated According to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), you must \"exhaust\" (use up) all of the available grievance procedures before you can take your complaint to court. If you have an issue that cannot be resolved after you have ver - bally consulted with your Housing Officer, Counselor, or Legal or Grievance Coordinator, you may present a complaint in writing to the Grievance Coordinator in your facility who will guide you through the steps to a formal resolution. You may submit a com - plaint about things that directly affect you such as department policies, how the policies are carried out, or someone else's behav - ior, including an officer. How to write an effective grievance When using the Inmate Grievance Process, you should follow several guidelines to increase your chances of obtaining relief (help). First, if you file a formal grievance with a grievance resolu - tion committee, write out your grievance in detail and list exactly what attempts you made to resolve the problem. If you do not try to resolve the problem on your own, your grievance may be dis - missed and closed at the grievance committee hearing. Second, your complaint must show that you are personally affected by the policy or issue that you are filing a grievance against. If that is not the case, your complaint must show that you will be affected at some point in the future unless relief is granted and changes are made. Third, you should state the problem accurately and precisely. Using inflammatory language (such as curse words) in your complaint will reduce your chances of success. Fourth, the more specific you are about the relief you are seeking, the more likely you are to receive it. You should list in detail every aspect of relief that you seek because the Inmate Grievance Resolution Committee may not consider types of relief that you do not specifi -210 LEGALcally request. For example, explain the conditions or policies you want changed. The Jailhouse Lawyer's Manual (JLM) has an entire chapter on how to file an effective grievance. See the full listing for JLM on page 190.

ADULT SURVIVORS ACT The Adult Survivors Act is a New York State law that creates a one-time, year-long window for adult sexual assault survivors who are outside the statute of limitations to file a civil case. That means that any adult survivor-no matter when they were assaulted 215 CONNECTIONS 2023and even if they are outside the statute of limitations-can file a civil case against their abuser or the institution where the abuse took place, through November 24, 2023. Institutions can include schools, houses of worship, prisons, jails, or a workplace. For more information visit Safe Horizon's website at www.safehorizon.org/adult-survivors-act . Less Is More Act (LIM) On March 1, 2022, the Less Is More: Community Supervision Revocation Reform Act took effect. The law restricts the use of incarceration for breaking noncriminal parole rules (\"technical violations\"), bolsters due process for people accused of violations, and provides \"earned-time\" credits to those who follow the rules. The new law also requires the NYS Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) to provide people on parole access to free community-based drug treatment and mental health services. The following is from https:/ /legalaidnyc.org/get-help/parole/ what-you-need-to-know-about-the-less-is-more-act and transla - tions are available for download in the following languages: Arabic, French, Hindi, Kreyol, Russian, and Spanish. LIM affects anyone who is serving a NYS-imposed sentence of community supervision and is being monitored by DOCCS. People on life parole and those on parole for sex offenses may be impacted differently. LIM creates a pathway to finish parole early through earned time credits: Most people on parole will earn 30 days of time credit for every 30 days in the community. That means if a person on parole has no sustained violations for 30 days, they will have 30 days taken off their parole sentence. People on life parole are not eligible to earn time credits. LIM ends automatic detention and incarceration for certain tech - nical violations:216 LEGAL Instead of being automatically jailed for a technical violation, people accused of these violations will receive a notice of viola - tion to appear in a community court. Technical violations are alleged conduct that doesn't involve the commission of a crime or violation of certain special conditions if on parole for a sex offense. Some examples of technical violations are a missed curfew, missed office report, or a positive drug test. People accused of non-technical violations or those who are accused of absconding and did not appear for their notice of violation will receive a criminal court recognizance hearing within 24 hours of their arrest to determine whether they will stay incarcerated pending the outcome of the violation proceed - ings. A non-technical violation is when a parole officer (PO) accuses a person of committing a new felony or new misde - meanor or conduct by a person on parole for a sex offense that violates a specific condition reasonably related to such offense. LIM improves due process: Establishes the right to counsel at every stage of the parole revocation process and raises the standard of proof at every stage of the violation process. Anyone accused of a parole violation is automatically entitled to a preliminary hearing. For detained individuals, preliminary hear - ings must take place within five days of when they are arrested on the parole warrant. For non-detained individuals, preliminary hearings must take place within ten days of the individual's release on recognizance or when the notice violation was issued. If sufficient proof is found at the preliminary hearing, the indi - vidual will proceed to a final hearing. For detained individuals, the final hearing must take place within 30 days of when suf - ficient proof is found at a preliminary hearing. For non-detained individuals, hearings must be held within 45 days. Hearings must be conducted in the community rather than inside jails. LIM sets limits on periods of incarceration for technical violations: Reincarceration is not permitted for the following technical violations: violation of curfew, alcohol/substance use (unless the conviction is for driving under the influence), failure to notify PO of a change in employment status, failure to pay surcharges 217 CONNECTIONS 2023and fees, obtaining a driver's license or driving a car with a valid license unless explicitly prohibited by the person's conviction, and failure to notify PO of police contact unless intended to hide illegal behavior. For all other technical violations, jail time varies: the 1st and 2nd violations are 0 days, the 3rd violation is 7 days, the 4th violation is 15 days, and the 5th violation or more is 30 days. For absconding, which is defined in LIM as intentionally avoid - ing supervision by failing to maintain contact with the assigned parole office, not notifying parole officer of a change in resi - dence, and that parole officer could not successfully re-engage with reasonable efforts: the 1st violation is 7 days, the 2nd violation is 15 days, and the 3rd violation is 30 days.

HALT Act In 2021, New York passed the The Humane Alternatives to Long- Term (HALT) Solitary Confinement Act and took effect March, 2022. The following information is from www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/ press-releases/senate-passes-halt-solitary-confinement-act . The HALT Act requires jails and prison in NY to: Limit the use of segregated confinement in state prisons and county jails and implement alternative rehabilitative measures, including the creation of Residential Rehabilitation Units (RRU). Limit the use of segregated confinement for all incarcerated persons to 15 days. Expand the definition of segregated confinement to include any form of cell confinement where an individual is held for more than 17 hours a day. Mandate additional out-of-cell time and rehabilitative program -218 LEGALming for individuals diverted to rehabilitative units after the 15-day limit has been reached. Prohibit segregated confinement for special populations for any period of time. Special populations are: individuals age 21 or younger, individuals age 55 and over, individuals with a disability, and individuals who are pregnant, up to eight weeks postpartum, or caring for children in a facility. Prohibit the denial of services, treatment, or basic needs such as clothing, food, and bedding while an individual is held in seg - regated confinement. Mandate that staff must undergo 37 hours and 30 minutes of initial training prior to assignment on segregated confinement units and 21 additional hours, annually, after assignment. Add due process protections by prohibiting placement in seg - regated confinement prior to a disciplinary hearing and by allowing access to counsel. Require DOCCS to publish monthly reports on its website with semi-annual and annual cumulative reports of the total number of people in segregated confinement. Prohibit the use of restraints on RRU residents except when officials make an \"individual assessment\" that not cuffing someone would pose a \"significant and unreasonable\" safety risk.

What is PREA? The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) is a federal law passed by Congress in 2003. The intention of PREA is to address the preven - tion, reduction, and elimination of sexual assault and rape within all jails and prisons, including juvenile facilities and some immigra - tion detention centers. In May 2012, the Department of Justice (DOJ) published a comprehensive set of regulations implementing the Act. These regulations are currently in effect. Do the PREA regulations apply to all prisons and jails? The PREA regulations apply to prisons, jails, police lock-ups, juve - nile detention centers, and community confinement facilities. The regulations apply to the federal government, states, local govern - ments like cities and counties, and private prisons contracted with government agencies. The DOJ PREA regulations do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities or federal Health & Human Services (HHS) facilities. These agencies were directed to promul - gate their own PREA regulations. Safety No one has the right to force you into a sexual act. You do not have to put up with sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or being forced to have unwanted sexual contact with anyone. If you are being pushed, threatened, or blackmailed into a sex act by someone incarcerated with you, by a peer on parole, or by staff, you should report it. You should also report if anyone tries to retaliate against you because you reported such an incident or spoke to an investi - gator about sexual abuse. Because of the sensitive nature of sexual abuse, people in custody always face a risk of retaliation. If you want to make a PREA com - plaint on someone else's behalf make sure that the incarcerated person wants you to report the abuse before you do so. 24-hour support is available for victims of sexual abuse and harassment:220 LEGAL National Sexual Assault Hotline: 800.656.4673 NYS Domestic and Sexual Violence Hotline: 800.942.6906 In NYC: 800.621.4673 Just Detention International (JDI) is an organization dedicated to ending sexual abuse in detention through advocacy, educa - tion, and legal measures.

Information on reporting sexual assault and harassment If you have experienced sexual abuse, voyeurism, or sexual harass - ment: You can file a complaint by telling anyone who works at the facility, including a volunteer, trusted staff member, counselor, medical staff, or PREA Compliance Manager. You can tell them verbally or in writing. It's a good idea to keep a copy of any written reports. You do not have to tell the person who hurt you that you are reporting the abuse or report the abuse to someone you are afraid of. The person you tell is required to tell only those required to begin the investigation, and no one else. They are instructed to keep your complaint confidential, but make sure to tell the individual you trust most. You can report the abuse at any time, but the sooner you report it, the sooner it can be investigated and steps can be taken to protect you. You can also have someone else report the abuse for you. If you think someone else is being sexually abused or sexually harassed, you should report that too. When you tell the facility staff about sexual abuse, they must: Act immediately by telling a supervisor; Begin to investigate promptly; Separate you from the person or people who hurt you; Let you know the results of the investigation. If the person who hurt you is punished, transferred, or fired, the facility staff must tell you.221 CONNECTIONS 2023When you tell the facility staff that you were sexually abused they cannot: Retaliate against you; Put you in solitary confinement as a punishment. The facility staff may put you in solitary based on a claim that it is for your protection, and there is paperwork that must be done to prove it. This is called protective custody. If you have been a victim of sexual abuse: Staff may ask you not to shower or not to brush your teeth. They may ask you to do these things to protect evidence, but it is ultimately your choice. The facility may place you in protective custody (solitary). Medical providers will check you for injuries that you may or may not be able to see right away. They can also provide treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and collect evidence of the sexual abuse. Medical providers will also discuss the possibility of pregnancy. Confidentiality: All records of reports of sexual abuse are confidential under Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-B. The identity of a victim of sexual abuse, the person reporting sexual abuse, any witnesses, and the facts of the report itself are confidential. Information is only shared with the people involved in the reporting, investigation, disci - pline, and treatment process, or as otherwise required by law. Prosecution for a false report: Law enforcement may charge a person with making a false report if, after investigation, it is proven that the person made the statement knowing it was false or baseless, or the person reported an alleged crime or incident knowing it did not occur. A report made in good faith is not falsely reporting an incident or lying, even if the investigation does not substantiate the allega - tion. The following pages list where to report sexual assault and harass - ment.

When you report a sexual abuse or assault incident, the facil - ity and/or an appropriate law enforcement agency will conduct an investigation. You may be asked to participate in an interview to gather information. ICE will inform you of the result of any investigation once it is completed. There is a difference between reporting the incident and choosing to press charges. You may choose not to immediately press charges, but you can always decide to do so later. If criminal charges are filed, they will be pre - sented for possible prosecution. It is important for you to discuss any concerns you have with the prosecutor (or your attorney) or a victim advocate. You do not have to give your name to report sexual abuse or assault. You can choose to report anonymously. It is illegal for any report of sexual abuse or fear of being abused or assaulted to negatively affect your immigration case.

It is important to stay up to date with these changes and to understand your rights. Speak to a lawyer or contact one of the organizations listed in this chapter to find legal support and advice. A criminal court case can have immigration consequences. Talk to your defense lawyer about your immigration status and history. The information you tell your lawyer is confidential, and they have a responsibility to attempt to minimize immigration consequences and advise you about them. The New York Police Department (NYPD) and the NYC Department of Correction (DOC) are not supposed to cooperate with ICE in transferring people from criminal to immigration custody or notify ICE of their release from criminal custody, with very few exceptions. However, fingerprints taken by the NYPD at the time of arrest are automatically shared with ICE, which can put someone at risk of enforcement in their home and community. Law enforcement agencies, including ICE, use social media and digital technologies to surveil people. As surveillance technology continues to grow it is important to be aware of its impact on immi - gration enforcement. Visit https:/ /notechforice.com/resources for reports such as, Who's Behind ICE?

Who is at Risk From ICE The federal government can deport certain immigrants includ - ing Anyone without lawful immigration status. People with status (e.g., lawful permanent residents, refugees, and visa holders) who have certain criminal convictions.228 IMMIGRANTSICE prioritizes certain cases including People who ICE claims pose a \"threat to national security,\" People who unlawfully entered the US on or after November 1, 2020, or People who ICE claims pose a \"current threat to public safety.\" ICE will consider factors such as a person's recent criminal cases and arrests by the police, and any charges involving fire - arms or weapons. Note : These priorities have changed twice under the current administration and may change again. Even if you believe you do not fall into the priorities, ICE could still decide to arrest you if you are vulnerable to deportation. You could still be a target even if Your conviction is from years ago. You didn't serve time in jail or prison. Your case was minor or a misdemeanor. You've been a lawful permanent resident for a long time. All the other members of your family are US citizens. Common ICE tactics ICE agents may pose as police officers and misrepresent themselves to get consent to enter your home. They might say they want to talk to you about identity theft or an ongoing police investigation. They might be wearing plain clothes, or they might wear a vest with the words \"POLICE ICE\" written on the back. ICE agents might present a document that says \"warrant,\" but that may not be a valid warrant signed by a judge. Learn to recognize the difference. A valid warrant will have the name of a state or federal court at the top and will have a judge's signature at the bottom. It will also list your address or name a person who lives at your address. Visit www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/ice-ruses for more information on tactics ICE use.

In any interaction with ICE agents, whether in public, at your home, or in a courthouse, you have the right to remain silent. This means you do not have to answer questions about your immigration status, your country of origin, where you were born, or any ques - tions ICE might have about a person they are looking for. You can affirm this right by saying \"I am choosing to remain silent.\" To reduce risk to yourself, do not lie about your status, do not run, argue, or physically resist. Do not carry any documents from your country of origin or any false documents. (More information on how to obtain a free NYC ID card is on page 206 .) If you are asked about your immigration status by law enforce - ment Remain silent. Do not say anything except \"I am choosing to remain silent.\" Do not answer questions about where you were born, whether you are a US citizen, or how you entered the country. (Separate rules apply at international borders and airports and for indi - viduals on certain nonimmigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers.) If you are not a US citizen and you have valid immigration papers, you should show them if an immigration agent requests to see them. Do not lie or provide fake documents and do not give any foreign documents. If you are approached by ICE in public places Try to stay calm and use your right to remain silent. Do not answer any questions about your immigration status or where you were born. Ask \"Am I free to go?\" If they say \"Yes,\" calmly walk away.230 IMMIGRANTS If the officers answer \"No,\" you are now being detained. Do not run away. If ICE arrests you, ask to speak to a lawyer and affirm your right to remain silent. You have the right to refuse a search. If ICE starts to search inside your pockets or belongings, say \"I do not consent to a search.\" If ICE arrests you when you are in criminal court for a court date, ask to speak to your defense lawyer before they take you away. If ICE comes to your home Do not open the door. ICE is only allowed to enter if they have a valid judicial search warrant or arrest warrant with your correct name and/or address, signed by a judge. A warrant is only valid if it is signed by a judge (not an immigra - tion official), it has the address of the home to be searched, and it describes the area to be searched.

KWAME TURE USED WITH PERMISSION FROM THE ARTIST. ARTWORK BY GABRIEL OLIVARES247 CONNECTIONS 2023Veteran Benefits & Incarceration The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) can pay certain ben - efits to veterans who are incarcerated in a federal, state, or local penal institution; however, the amount paid depends on the type of benefit and reason for incarceration. For more information, visit www.benefits.va.gov/persona/veteran-incarcerated.asp . It is important to speak directly with a VA representative to figure out what specifically applies to your situation. Disability compensation Payments are reduced if a veteran is convicted of a felony and imprisoned for more than 60 days. The VA makes determinations about the severity of a disability based on the evidence submit - ted as part of a claim and rates disability from 0% to 100%, in 10% increments. Veterans rated 20% or more are limited to the 10% disability rate. For a veteran whose disability rating is 10%, the payment is reduced by one-half. Once a veteran is released from prison, compensation payments may be reinstated based upon the severity of the service connected disability(ies) at that time. Payments are not reduced for recipients participating in work release programs, residing in halfway houses (also known as \"residential reentry centers\"), or under community supervision. The amount of any increased compensation awarded to an incarcer - ated veteran that results from other than a statutory rate increase may be subject to reduction due to incarceration. Compensation benefits are not reduced if incarcerated for a misdemeanor. Pension If you are incarcerated as the result of a conviction of a felony or misdemeanor, your pension payment will be discontinued effective on the 61st day of imprisonment following conviction. Payments may be resumed upon release from prison if the Veteran meets VA eligibility requirements. Failure to notify the VA of a veteran's incarceration could result in the loss of all financial benefits until the overpayment is recovered. Education benefits Beneficiaries incarcerated for charges other than a felony can receive full monthly benefits if otherwise entitled. Those convicted 248 VETERANSof felonies residing in halfway houses, or participating in work- release programs also can receive full monthly benefits. Claimants incarcerated for a felony conviction can be paid only the costs of tuition, fees, necessary books, equipment, and supplies. Apportionment to spouse or children All or part of the compensation not paid to an incarcerated veteran may be apportioned to the veteran's spouse, child or children, and dependent parents on the basis of individual need. An appor - tionment of an incarcerated veteran's VA benefits is not granted automatically to the veteran's dependents. The dependent(s) must file a claim for an apportionment. Are you eligible for VA medical care while incarcerated? Incarcerated veterans do not forfeit their eligibility for medical care; however, current regulations restrict the VA from providing hospital and outpatient care to a currently incarcerated veteran. The VA may provide care once the veteran has been uncondition - ally released from the penal institution. When will VA benefits be resumed? Veterans may inform the VA to have their benefits resumed within 30 days or less of their anticipated release date based on evi - dence from a parole board or other official prison source showing the veteran's scheduled release date. Your award for compensa - tion or pension benefits shall be resumed the date of release from incarceration if the VA receives notice of release within one year following release. Depending on the type of disability, the VA may schedule you for a medical examination to see if your disability has improved. You will need to visit or call your local VA regional office for assistance. You are considered to have been released from incarceration if you are paroled or participating in a work-release or halfway housing program.

Rights While Incarcerated The following is from the ADA National Network's fact sheet found online at www.adata.org/factsheet/corrections. The Department of Justice issued revised Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Title II regulations which took effect March 15, 2011. These regulations require adult and juvenile jails and prisons (including private prisons) to make accessible benefits, services, programs, and activities to any incarcerated person with a disability. The law requires that qualified people with disabilities should have access to all programs to which they would other - wise be entitled, including educational, vocational, work release, employment, and religious programs, whether mandatory or volun - tary. People with disabilities must be housed in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individuals. This means there needs to be accessible housing in all security classifications and/or program levels of a facility. Unless it is appropriate to make an exception, jails and prisons shall not place people with disabili - ties: In inappropriate security classifications because no accessible cells or beds are available In medical areas, unless they are actually receiving medical care or treatment In facilities that do not offer the same programs as facilities where they otherwise would be housed258 PEOPLE W ITH DIS ABILITIES In distant facilities where they would otherwise not be housed that would deprive them of visitation with family members Facilities should provide accessible mobility features to cells such as an accessible route to and through the room, an entry door with adequate clear width, maneuvering clearance, and accessible hardware. Altered cells with mobility features shall be provided in each classification level. People should have equal physical access to areas used for visita - tion, dining, recreation, educational programs, medical services, work programs, religious services, and other offered programs. If it is technically infeasible to house someone in an area that meets these standards, a transfer within the same prison system must be provided.

LOU SULLIVAN ARTWORK BY PMJUSED WITH PERMISSION FROM THE ARTIST.288 LGBTQI+ Protections Against Discrimination Under the NYC Human Rights Law, it is illegal to discriminate based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender. Discrimination because of gender includes discrimination based on gender identity or expression, or being intersex. These protections cover discrimination in many places including work, school, housing, and public spaces. The law also protects NYC's LGBTQI+ communities against retaliation, discriminatory harassment, and bias-based profiling by law enforcement. Visit www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/media/pride.page for information on how to identify discrimination; myth, facts, and common miscon - ceptions on gender identity and gender expression protections; brochures on protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression; a resource portal on equal bathroom access; and legal guidance.

You are able to report anonymously and are never asked about immigration status. Rights During Police Interactions The police are not allowed to make transphobic or homophobic remarks or discriminate against you based on actual or per - ceived gender identity or sexual orientation. You have the right to be referred to by names, titles, and pro - nouns that reflect your gender identity, even if it doesn't match the information on your ID.289 CONNECTIONS 2023 It is illegal for police to frisk or search you to determine your gender. If you are in police custody, you should be searched by an officer of the gender you request. You should also be held in sex segregated police facilities according to your gender identity, even if it differs from the sex you were assigned at birth, unless there is a concern for your safety. If you are concerned for your safety, you should ask to be treated as a \"special category prisoner\" and held in a cell by yourself. The police cannot handcuff you to rails, bars, or chairs for unreasonable periods of time because you asked to be treated as a \"special category prisoner.\" For more information on rights during police interactions, see page 166.

Or reach out to:ACLU National Prison Project 915 15th Street NW, 7th FloorWashington, DC 20005Telephone: 212.549.2500 PREA Standards require prisons and jails to make individualized housing and program placements for all transgender and intersex people, including when assigning them to male or female facilities. Many correctional facilities house transgender people in solitary confinement to protect them from violence. PREA says you cannot be segregated against your will for more than 30 days and if you are in protective custody you must have access to programs, 300 LGBTQI+privileges, and education and work opportunities to the extent pos - sible. Staff must evaluate you for gender dysphoria within a reasonable time if you request it. Medical treatment for incarcerated people diagnosed with gender dysphoria should be delivered according to accepted medical standards. Additionally, blanket bans on specific types of treatments, such as a ban on hormone therapy or gender confirmation surgery, are unconstitutional. Staff should generally allow you gender-appropriate clothing and grooming supplies, and allow you to present yourself in a manner consistent with your gender identity, or they may be in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Strip searches must be conducted professionally and respectfully. A strip search conducted in full view of other people and staff may violate your privacy rights. If there is no emergency, male staff should not strip search women (including transgender women) and vice versa. Some jails have policies allowing transgender people to choose the gender of the staff who search them. Staff cannot conduct strip and pat down searches solely to assess your geni - tals. Staff must be trained to conduct searches of transgender and intersex people in a professional and respectful manner, and in the least intrusive manner possible, consistent with security needs. If you request a private shower, PREA requires that officials grant you access. Information on your legal rights Get a copy of your prison's or jail's appeal policy. Always follow the policy exactly. People who want to file a federal lawsuit about events in jail or prison must first complete the internal appeals process. This means that you need to know the rules of any appeals (or \"grievance\") process in your facility, including time limits on filing an appeal after something happens. In most prisons or jails, you will have to file a written complaint on a form that is provided. The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) states that you must fully go through the grievance process at your facility before taking a case to court. For more information on filing a grievance, please see page 209 . The PLRA only applies to cases that are brought by an incarcerated 301 CONNECTIONS 2023person. This means that your case will not be controlled by most of the PLRA provisions if you file it after your release. Because other legal deadlines may apply though, you should always try to get legal advice before you make any decisions about when or how to file a lawsuit about something that happened to you in prison or jail. Keep track of everything that happened to you\u2014the names of offi - cers, other incarcerated people, where and when things happened, which policies are available, and which are not available, etc. Even if you never bring a case to court, having details about what hap - pened can be very important if you reach out to other people for help. If you are afraid that staff might take your paperwork, send copies to people you trust on the outside. Be aware, though, that if you are not sending information by legal mail to an attorney or legal organization, staff will likely read everything you put in letters or envelopes. For organizations that specialize in helping transgender people and other LGBTQI+ people, please consider reaching out to the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), the Transgender Law Center (TLC), and the Sylvia Rivera Law Project listed in this chapter.

The legisla - tion raises the age of adult criminal responsibility in the State of New York to the age of 18 for most charges. The changes went into effect for 16-year-olds on 10/1/18 and for 17-year-olds on 10/1/19. This information can be found at www.ny.gov/programs/raise-age-0 . Parental notification Parents must be notified when their children are arrested. Questioning of youth must take place in age-appropriate set - tings, with parental involvement, and for appropriate lengths of time. Misdemeanors All misdemeanor cases (other than Vehicle and Traffic Law mis - demeanors) will be heard in Family Court pursuant to the Family Court Act. Felonies All felony cases will start in the Youth Part of the adult criminal court. All nonviolent felonies will be transferred from the Youth Part to Family Court unless the District Attorney (DA) files a motion within 30 days showing \"extraordinary circumstances\" as to why the case should remain in the Youth Part. The Judge must decide within five days whether to prevent the transfer of the case to Family Court. Violent felonies can also be transferred from the Youth Part to the Family Court. If the charges do not include the accused displaying a deadly weapon in furtherance of the offense, causing significant physical injury, or engaging in unlawful sexual conduct, the case will transfer to Family Court unless the DA files a motion within 30 days showing \"extraordinary circum - stances.\" If the charge does include an element listed above, removal to Family Court is only possible with the consent of the DA. Vehicle and Traffic Law cases and Class A felonies other than Class A drug offenses cannot be transferred. 16- and 17-year-olds whose cases remain in the Youth Part will 304 YOUTHbe referred to as \"Adolescent Offenders.\" Adult sentencing will apply, but the judge must take the youth's age into account when sentencing. Adolescent Offenders are eligible for Youthful Offender treatment, as is the current law with respect to 16- and 17-year-olds charged as adults. Adolescent Offenders may voluntarily participate in services while their case is pending. Family Court Youth whose cases are heard in the Family Court will be pro - cessed pursuant to existing Juvenile Delinquency (JD) laws, which includes the opportunity for adjustment. They will not have a permanent criminal record. Youth Part of Adult Court The Youth Part is a special branch of the adult criminal court presided over by Family Court judges. All 13-15-year-old Juvenile Offenders and all 16-17-year-old Adolescent Offenders will have their cases in the Youth Part. Facilities No 16- or 17-year-old will be sentenced to or detained in a facil - ity with adults, as of October 1, 2018. Youth whose cases are heard in Family Court may be detained or placed in OCFS-operated, OCFS-licensed, or ACS facilities (including Close to Home), as Juvenile Delinquents currently are.

Custody Rights for Incarcerated Parents The Administration for Children's Services (ACS) is a New York City agency with the stated purpose of protecting children and with the power to remove children from their parents in cases of abuse or neglect.331 CONNECTIONS 2023Incarcerated parents are at a much higher risk of being investi - gated by ACS, so every incarcerated parent should understand how ACS's process for supervising and removing children works, and what they can do to prevent that from happening. Find out if there's an ACS case involving your children Contact a lawyer for help finding out if there is a Family Court case involving your family. If you have a case, contact Family Court and ask to have a lawyer assigned to represent you. Contact ACS directly to find out the status of your case, to propose a family member or friend who could care for your children, to ask for a service plan, or to ask for visits with your children. Be careful what information you provide ACS since anything you say can be used against you. If you can, talk with a lawyer before speaking with ACS. Make a plan with family members or friends who can care for your children Give their names and contact information to your lawyer and the ACS caseworkers. Your lawyer can fight for your children to live with a family member or friend instead of being placed with strangers. This will help keep ACS from getting involved in the first place and will give you better options during the process if ACS does get involved. Maintaining contact with your children is important You have to show you are staying involved in your children's lives to help keep your rights as a parent. You should stay in touch with your children however you can, including visits, phone calls, videos, photos, letters, cards, etc.\u2014as long as there is no court order prohibiting contact with your children. The Children of Incarcerated Parents Program (CHIPP) may be able to help bring your children to see you regularly: 212.341.3322 Osborne Association offers televisiting for some facilities: 718.637.6560332 PARENTS & CAR EGIVERSStay in touch with ACS and keep records of everything Keeping a written record of any visits with your children may help you prove your case in court. Get written proof of any services you attend, communication with ACS or the foster care agency, and any child support payments you make. The foster care agency has to prove they worked with you to set up visits with your children, so make sure you keep a record of any time you contacted the agency or ACS to set up a visit. Be careful about what you say to ACS and the Foster Care Agency Do not discuss any aspect of your legal case with ACS or Foster Care Agency caseworkers without speaking with your lawyer first. Get professional help when dealing with ACS (like a public defender, hired lawyer, or nonprofit agency). Do not say anything regarding your mental health, criminal case, substance use, or domestic violence\u2014these statements are admissions that could be used against you in court. You have the right to make educational and medical decisions for your children Even if your children are in foster care, you have the right to make medical and educational decisions for your children. (As long as your parental rights have not been terminated.) Contact your children's schools and medical offices and ask them to send you updates on educational conferences or medical appointments, and the well-being and performance of your children. You have the right to be present at any court date involving your children This is called \"being produced.\" Contact Family Court and ACS to find out about any upcoming court dates. Send a request to Family Court for an order to be produced. State prisons will usually transport you to court. Federal prisons will usually set you up on a phone or video call. Get help from legal advocates to set this up.

Incarcerated parents may call the collect line. Child Support Anyone who has a child support order is obligated to pay child support, even those who are currently incarcerated. Child support orders are based on the information available at the time of the hearing. Unpaid child support adds up and becomes debt called arrears. Arrears never go away, even after your child turns 21. Either parent has the right to file a petition in Family Court to modify (change) the amount of the child support order if there is a substantial change in circumstances or the needs of the child are not being met. You can find the address for each borough's Family Court on page 335. In New York State, child support orders prior to October 13, 2010 treat incarceration as \"voluntary unemployment\" and typically may not be modified. For orders issued on or after October 13, 2010, incarcerated parents may file a modification petition due to a sub - stantial change in circumstances, as long as their incarceration is not due to non-payment of child support, or an offense against the custodial parent or child. The determination of whether a court will agree to a child support modification during a parent's incarceration is the judge's decision. Only a judge can change or modify a child support order. A court may decide that the child support payments should remain the same during a parent's incarceration.335 CONNECTIONS 2023Family Legal Care created a guide called Family Court Basics for Parents Who Were Previously Incarcerated available at www. familylegalcare.org . The guide answers questions that formerly incarcerated parents may have about paternity, child support, custody, visitation, and more.

You can ask your facility to invite people from community agencies or private companies that do a large amount of hiring. You can start reaching out to organizations that provide services to people to help them prepare for release. If you plan to live in New York City after your release, you may want a copy of this book for yourself. You can receive a free copy of Connections by writing to Jail & Prison Services, The New York Public Library, 40 West 20th Street, New York, NY 10011 . If you are not returning to New York City, please see reentry guide - books for other parts of New York State starting on page 34 and Reentry Task Forces by county starting on page 35 . Gather the documents that you will need To apply for jobs and to be eligible for most private or government programs, you will need certain types of documentation. You can save time if you begin to collect documentation while you are still incarcerated. At the very least, be sure to have a Social Security card (sometimes a number alone is not sufficient) and proof of identification (birth certificate, driver's license, or nondriver photo ID). Each agency or employer has its own requirements for docu - mentation. The following may be useful to have when you are released: Prison discharge papers (given to you upon release) Military discharge papers (DD214), more information found on page 249 Permanent Resident Card (green card, for non-US citizens), more information found on page 234 Proof of education (college transcripts or HSE certificate), more information found on page 59 Working papers (required for people under 18 years of age), more information found on page 318365 CONNECTIONS 2023 Certificate of Relief from Disabilities or Certificate of Good Conduct (apply after release) You can request a copy of your rap sheet to review and make sure there are no errors. See page 368 for more information. If you were vaccinated while incarcerated, make sure you are given your vaccination card upon release. For more information on replacing COVID-19 vaccination cards see page 25 . These documents may not be easy to get while you are incarcer - ated. In some cases, a family member or friend on the outside can help. Ask your contact in the community to visit https://portal.311.nyc.gov/category/?id=311-15 for information on how to obtain important documents including birth certificates, naturalization cards, driver's licenses, and nondriver IDs. Personal and professional references may be required to apply for jobs, to get back into school, and to receive the certificates discussed below. Letters from people who will speak positively on your behalf about your skills, abilities, work history, and motiva - tion can make a difference when applying for jobs. People you can ask include a former supervisor, a teacher, a mentor, or a religious or spiritual advisor. Usually, family and friends do not serve as references. Start a file or folder for these letters and keep them together so you have them all in one place when you need them. What You Can Do Upon Release Restore your rights Depending on the conviction, you may have lost your right to engage in certain types of employment or apply for certain types of licenses. In some cases, you may be disqualified for certain civil service positions that are classified as public office, such as fire - fighters. Visit the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction at https://niccc.csgjusticecenter.org to search for restrictions on professional licenses. John Jay College Institute for Justice and Opportunity has published a guide explaining the process for obtaining licenses in 25 high demand occupations and 366 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCHprofessions called Getting to Work With a Criminal Record: New York State License Guide , available at www.justiceandopportunity. org/research-and-publications . To restore your rights, you need: a Certificate of Relief from Disabilities , for those who have been convicted of any number of misdemeanors and no more than one felony; two or more felony convictions in the same court on the same day are counted as one felony for determin - ing your eligibility a Certificate of Good Conduct , for those who have been con - victed of more than one felony Information about certificates Certificates are an assumption of rehabilitation and evidence that employers and licensing agencies must consider when licensing or hiring. Certificate of Relief from Disabilities is a confusing name. Having a felony conviction and having a disability are in no way the same thing. Your parole officer may simply refer to this certificate as a Certificate of Relief. What certificates can do Certificates have the power to remove any legal bar imposed on you as a result of having been convicted of the crime(s) specified on the certificate. If you have a certificate, not only do you become eligible to apply for positions you might otherwise be barred from, but the certificate informs the employer that the state or a court assumes you are rehabilitated and that the employer should take this into consideration. A certificate is not a pardon, and an employer is still allowed to conduct a background check after offer - ing you a job. Remember that some occupational licenses may be denied to you for certain employment unless you have one of the certificates. To learn about defending yourself against job discrimination, see page 372 . Applying for a certificate For Certificates of Relief from Disabilities , you must apply to the court that sentenced you, unless:367 CONNECTIONS 2023 you were sentenced to a New York State (DOCCS) correctional facility, or you were convicted in a federal court or a court in another state and you are now a resident of New York State. Certificates in these cases are issued by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). After release, there is no waiting time to apply for this certificate. To apply for a Certificate of Good Conduct , which is granted to persons who have multiple felony convictions, you may have to wait three to five years after completing your most recent sen - tence, depending on the severity of your most serious conviction. For example, you may have two felonies, a class-E felony from 1997 and a class-B felony from 2007, and you were discharged from parole in 2019. Since your most serious crime was a B felony, you would have to wait five years from the completion of your most recent sentence (2019). Therefore, you would be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Good Conduct in 2024. To request an application form for a Certificate of Relief from Disabilities if you have served time in a DOCCS facility, or were convicted out of state or in federal court, or to request an applica - tion for a Certificate of Good Conduct, write to: NYS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND COMMUNITY SUPERVISION (DOCCS)Attn: Certificate Review UnitHarriman State Campus\u2014Building 21220 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12226-2050 Application forms are also available on the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision website at https:/ /doccs.ny.gov/certificate-relief-good-conduct-restoration-rights or by calling 518.485.8953 . What to expect Once you submit the completed application, DOCCS will assign a field Parole Officer for an investigation (this does not mean that you are being placed on parole). The Officer will review: Employment history and how you have supported yourself Proof that you have paid income taxes for the last two years368 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCH Proof that you have paid any fines or restitution set by the courts After DOCCS has received all necessary documents and records from you, the field Parole Officer assigned to you will contact you to arrange an interview at your home/residence to answer any remaining questions and confirm your current circumstances and living situation. Even though the application does not say you must include evi - dence of rehabilitation in your application packet, it may be helpful to do so. Things that you may want to provide are: A written personal statement, about the positive changes you have made since your conviction Copies of certificates from programs you've attended such as job training Letters of support from employers, counselors, supervisors, teachers, and others Copies of school transcripts The Legal Action Center's guide, How to Gather Evidence of Rehabilitation provides more examples and can be found in their resources portal at www.lac.org/resources . Remember, even if your convictions took place outside of New York State, or in a federal court, you may apply directly upon release from custody to the Certificate Review Unit. For more information, contact your parole/probation officer, or the Legal Action Center, 225 Varick Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10014 , telephone: 212.243.1313 . You can also visit www.reentry. net/ny and click on Criminal Records for applications and other information. Certificates generally take one year to be processed. Clean up your rap sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution) Often, arrests that should be sealed (arrests not leading to convictions, youthful offender adjudications, or convictions for noncriminal offenses) remain open or unsealed on your record and available for potential employers to see. A study, published in 2013 by the Legal Action Center, found at 369 CONNECTIONS 2023least 30% of arrest and prosecution records contained at least one error, and some contained as many as 10 or more. Employers who can legally fingerprint you and get a copy of your rap sheet from New York State include: civil service employers, banks and financial institutions, bonding agencies, hospitals, museums, childcare agencies, home care agencies, mental health facilities, school bus driving companies, security-guard companies, and law enforcement agencies (who are entitled to see sealed information as well). It is to your advantage to clean up your record, and to have corrected or sealed whatever errors or unnecessary information may appear on it. Reviewing your rap sheet If you are currently serving a sentence in a New York State prison or in a county or city jail, you can receive a copy of your rap sheet free of charge. You must include your name, any aliases, your date of birth, your DIN, and your projected release date. The Division of Criminal Justice Services will not send you your rap sheet if you will be incarcerated for less than 45 days.

The guide is available online at www.lac.org/resource/employment-with-a-criminal-record , or you can request a copy by contacting them by phone at 212.243.1313 or writing to 225 Varick Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10014 . To obtain a federal rap sheet, known as an Identity History Summary, you must fill out an application with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found at https:/ /forms.fbi.gov/identity- history-summary-checks-review and send: (1) the completed 370 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCHapplication; (2) a full set of fingerprints on a standard fingerprint form, FD-258 (available at any police precinct for a fee) with the date, your name, and your date and place of birth; and (3) a money order or certified check for $18 made payable to the Treasury of the United States to: FBI CJIS Division\u2014Summary Request, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, WV 26306 . A complete list of instructions can be found at www.fbi.gov/ services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks . Many employers are not authorized to get a copy of your rap sheet directly from the Department of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS). Prospective employers may conduct a background check using a consumer-reporting agency. Federal and New York State fair credit reporting laws require that an employer get your permission before conducting a background check. You should get a copy of your consumer credit report for yourself as you prepare to look for a job. These reports are often incomplete or inaccurate and you may need to spend some time correcting the information. You can obtain one free credit report per year by calling 877.322.8228 or visit www.annualcreditreport.com . You can also write to Annual Credit Report Request Service, PO Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348 for more information. Know that you will need your Social Security number when filling out the application for the free credit report. An employer or individual may also get a copy of your conviction history from the Office of Court Administration (OCA). This is the agency that keeps all court information on file. An OCA background check costs $95. Visit www.nycourts.gov/apps/chrs for more information. Upgrading a less-than-honorable military discharge can be advan - tageous to your future. Contact the Veterans Affairs New York Regional Office at 800.827.1000 to request an application or visit www.va.gov/discharge-upgrade-instructions for more information. Remember that all of these procedures (obtaining and cleaning up errors on your rap sheet, sealing arrests not leading to convictions, etc.) will take time and cost money. Start the process now, and make sure that prospective employers do not see any unnecessary information or errors when obtaining access to your record.371 CONNECTIONS 2023Sealing conviction records with Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 160.59 Eligible individuals may request to have their records sealed if they have not been convicted of another crime for a period of 10 years from the day they were sentenced or released from jail/prison (whichever is later). People are eligible if they have only two (2) convictions on their record or, in some cases, if more than two convictions are related to the same one or two incidents. All misdemeanor convictions, other than those requiring registration as a sex offender, are eligible, and some felonies are eligible to be sealed. A person can seal, at most, one (1) felony. Sex offenses, violent felonies, and serious felonies are not eligible for sealing. Members of the public (including employers and housing agencies) will not be able to see a conviction that is sealed. All arms of law enforcement, including police, district attorney, the courts, and cor - rections will be able to see the sealed conviction/prosecution. In addition, the Financial Frauds and Consumer Protection Unit of the State Department of Financial Services, the Office of Professional Medical Conduct of the State Department of Health, the Child Protective Services Units of any local departments of social ser - vices, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, and any agency that issues firearm licenses or gun permits will have access to sealed convictions. Under the New York State Human Rights Law (NY Executive Law \u00a7 296.16), employers are not permitted to ask about or act in response to a conviction that has been sealed, except if a person is applying to be a police or peace officer. To apply to have your eligible conviction(s) sealed visit the New York State Courts website at www.nycourts.gov/FORMS/cpl_160.59_ sealing_application/index.shtml to obtain a copy of the required forms, which include the \"Notice of Motion and Affidavit in Support of Sealing Pursuant to CPL \u00a7160.59\" form, and instructions. The instructions also contain a list of crimes that are not eligible for sealing. Read and follow the instructions provided to file a motion for sealing with the court.372 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCH Avoiding Discrimination in Your Job Search Know your rights as a formerly incarcerated person Under New York State law, Article 23A , it is illegal for an employer to deny someone a job based on a conviction, unless the employer can demonstrate it is job-related. The law says that in deciding whether or not a conviction is job-related, the employer must con - sider a number of factors, including evidence of rehabilitation (a Certificate of Good Conduct, for example). With sufficient evidence of rehabilitation, the burden of proof is on the employer to dem - onstrate that hiring you would be a risk to people or property, and that your conviction is directly related to the job for which you are applying. A law called the Fair Chance Act says most New York City employ - ers cannot ask about your conviction history until after offering you a job. What does New York City's Fair Chance Act do? Bans job ads that say things like \"no felonies\" or \"must pass background check\" Bans any questions about conviction history on job applications Bans any questions about conviction history during job inter - views An employer can run a background check only after a condi - tional job offer is made It is important to remember that a person cannot be discriminated against because of arrests, either. \"Have you ever been arrested?\" is an illegal question, both on a job application and during an inter - view. Your prior arrests can not be used against you even after a job offer is made, regardless of the reason for the arrest. If you are denied a job because of your conviction history, the employer must explain why in writing. The employer must also connect your conviction to job duties or show that it creates an unreasonable risk. For example, a person convicted of embezzle - ment at a financial institution, once released, would have difficulty 373 CONNECTIONS 2023getting a job handling cash at a bank. The employer must hold the job offer open for three days to allow you time to discuss the issue or any wrong information. There are laws that require background checks and prevent people with certain serious convictions from working in some jobs with children, older people, or in law enforcement, among other posi - tions. The Fair Chance Act does not affect these limitations or change the background check requirements. These employers are allowed to tell applicants that the jobs are subject to a background check and that they may deny employment to workers with convic - tion histories that may pose a risk. In addition to all employment in New York City, applicants for posi - tions with New York State agencies will not be required to discuss or disclose information about prior convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and has made a conditional job offer. If an employer did not follow the rules described here, call 311 and ask for the Commission on Human Rights. You can leave an anonymous tip or file a complaint about what happened to you. If the employer is found to have broken the law, you could recover lost wages or other damages, and the employer may have to pay a fine. You can also contact the Legal Action Center for help if you expe - rience discrimination by calling 212.243.313 . They can advise you on your rights and give help with how to proceed. Important information relating to employment discrimination can be found on their website at www.lac.org or you can write to them at 225 Varick Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10014 to request informa - tion by mail. It is important to note that the Fair Chance Act is in effect in the five boroughs of New York City. If you are looking for work outside of New York City, you may still be asked about your conviction history on a job application or during an interview. In those cases, it is important to present your history in an accurate and positive light. You can learn more about addressing your conviction in the 374 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCHResume section on page 381 and in the Interview section on page 404. Addressing alcohol or substance use disorder in your past It is illegal for an employer to ask you whether or not you have a history of alcohol or substance use disorder. An employer can only ask if you are currently using illegal drugs. It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against you as someone who is recov - ering from alcohol or substance use disorder. If you have been refused employment and believe it was due to a history of alcohol or substance use disorder, or due to participation in a treatment program, contact the New York State Division of Human Rights at 888.392.3644 or the Legal Action Center at 212.243.1313 . Federal confidentiality laws prohibit most treatment programs from revealing any information about your treatment without your consent. However, an employer can learn of past or current sub - stance use by conducting a background check or due to a medical exam required as part of the hiring process for some jobs. NYC Human Rights Law Employers cannot discriminate against job applicants and employ - ees based on their age, race, color, religion/creed, national origin, gender, gender identity and gender expression, pregnancy, disabil - ity, sexual orientation, marital or partnership status, immigration or citizenship status, natural hair or hairstyles, arrest or conviction record, credit history, salary history, sexual and reproductive health decisions, caregiver status, status as a current or former military service member, unemployment status, or status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, or stalking. More information on the NYC Human Rights Law can be found on page 212 . In New York City, it is illegal for interviewers to ask about your past compensation amounts (salary or hourly wage). As of November 2022, most employers advertising jobs in New York City will be required by law to include a good faith salary range for every job, promotion, and transfer opportunity advertised.

The website also has a PDF called Workers' Bill of Rights in 15 languages. Demonstrate that you are a person who has undergone reha - bilitative change The law in New York City that prohibits questions about conviction records means that it is your decision to discuss your past in an interview. But, if you are offered a job, a background check may reveal your history. Be prepared for questions on whether your con - viction relates to the job position. Certificates can act as an official line of support and a clean rap sheet will benefit you as well. Make sure to maintain supportive and accurate paperwork. In addition, practice answering questions that may be asked in order to feel confident discussing the ways you have changed. Be ready to explain how you've managed the circumstances that led to your time in prison. For example, \"Obstacles that were affecting me five years ago led to bad decision-making. Since then, I have learned to understand the underlying causes of my circum - stances and choices. After release, my family and friends, as well as my educational experience, helped me develop perspective. I am positive that my past will not interfere with my work or my ability to make good decisions.\" When choosing references for your resume and job application, select individuals who can testify to your present-day character and speak about your specific skills. Make sure to keep reference letters and contacts updated. Keep a file of these letters that speak of the meaningful ways you have changed and reflect your current set of skills. What To Do While Unemployed Assess your resources and plan realistically It is important to plan a long-term strategy during your job search. 376 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCHSome questions to ask yourself: Can my family help support me while I seek work? Am I eligible for unemployment insurance, food stamps, or other types of government assistance? If I have savings, how long will they last? Looking for work is never easy. The more time you can spend on looking for a job, the better your chances of finding one. Having people you can share your experiences with can be very important in job searching. Make yourself accountable. If you have family or friends supporting you in your job search, talk to them about how the day went and what your plan will be for upcoming days. Explore volunteer work for the advantages it offers Volunteer work has many advantages. While volunteering, you gain experience and can make contacts that can later help you find a paying job. Any experience you gain should be included on your resume or job application and contacts can serve as references when applying to jobs. Volunteering shows you are a motivated individual, interested in expanding your skill set.377 CONNECTIONS 2023Assessing Your Skills While preparing for the job search it is important to assess your interests and skills. Some people know exactly what work they want to look for, while others may be less certain. Working with a job counselor or career coach can help make you aware of what you have to offer. It can also help to establish some realistic short- and long-term goals. A job counselor will interview you in order to assess your abilities in a certain skill and your pref - erence toward a particular field of work. If you would prefer to begin by assessing your own skills, there are books and online tools that can help such as the CareerOneStop online assessment at www.careeronestop.org/ExploreCareers/Assessments/skills.aspx . You can reach out to the job informa - tion center of your public library and ask for other materials and resources. On the following pages is a Personal Skills Worksheet that you can use to begin a self-assessment. The worksheet can also be helpful in creating the content of your resume.378 PREPARING FOR THE JOB SEARCHPersonal Skills Worksheet Skills Identify your skills from the list below.

A resume is a document that lists your work experience, educa - tion, and skills. It summarizes relevant facts to show a prospective employer that you can do the job you are applying for. Your resume should highlight valuable and relevant skills, in a clear and readable way. It should demonstrate that you have the right qualifi - cations, experience, and skills for the job. Why is a resume important? Most employers require that you have a resume when applying for a job. A well-written resume can help you get an interview. After the interview, it serves as a reminder for the employer, of who you are and what you discussed. Creating or updating a resume helps to organize your work experience and skills, even if you do not need it for every job you apply to. What goes in a resume? Your name, phone number, and email address A professional summary/occupational goal A list of key skills relevant to the job you are applying to Work and volunteer experience, and educational history Not everything must appear on your resume every time, and the order can change depending on the type of resume you need and the job you are applying to. Tailoring your resume You should tailor your resume to show how your work experience specifically meets the needs of the job you're applying for. It is a good idea to make two or more resumes to focus on different aspects of your experience. If you've had many different jobs in your work history, you may wish to emphasize some in applying for one job and others in applying for another. Ways that you can tailor your resume include: Write an opening statement that directly links your experience and education to the requirements of the job382 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCH List the most relevant skills for the job first Include any certificates you have obtained that are needed for the job It is important to include relevant keywords and phrases through - out your resume, specifically words and phrases that are used in the job advertisement and description. This is because larger employers use digital application tracking systems (ATSs) to search and filter high volumes of resumes before they are seen by a person, and resumes that do not include the right keywords may not be seen. Use action verbs to describe your experience Compare the following two examples and the impression they might make upon the employer. Action verbs are underlined. (a) 2014-2017 Smith & Sons, Bronx, NY HVAC Technician heating, ventilation, and cooling inspections and repairs (b) 2014-2017 Smith & Sons, Bronx, NYHVAC Technician Installed , maintained , and repaired heating, ventilation, and cooling units. Maintained good working order of units to ensure compliance with state regulations. Conducted complete equipment inspec - tions of 100 sites. Trained and supervised two apprentices. Performed preventative maintenance so that machines were in working order. Some action verbs to help with your resume: achieved, adapted, addressed, administered, arranged, assessed, assisted, authorized, collaborated, conducted, demonstrated, designed, developed, devised, directed, edited, enforced, evalu - ated, facilitated, fostered, generated, handled, hired, implemented, improved, initiated, launched, maintained, managed, marketed, mastered, motivated, operated, organized, oversaw, performed, planned, programmed, provided, publicized, recommended, reor - ganized, repaired, represented, researched, scheduled, screened, streamlined, supervised, trained, updated383 CONNECTIONS 2023Be sure to include all of the skills you have that are relevant to the job you're applying to, not just the ones that you've gained through formal work experience. Many of us have useful skills that we may not think of when applying for a job. If you can speak a second lan - guage, for example, include it on your resume. If you have excellent computer skills, say so. Have you ever operated any special types of vehicles\u2014forklifts or trailer trucks? Or trained and supervised someone on the job at the facility's library or transitional services center? Have you ever exhibited leadership skills such as working with young people in a neighborhood youth program or coaching a team? Don't neglect to list such things. Employers are interested in your ability to get along with others on the job as much as they are in formal skill training. Show them in as many ways as possible that you possess the attributes they are looking for. Types of resumes Although there is no single format for a resume, generally they fall into one of two categories: the Chronological Resume, and the Skills Resume (also called a Functional Resume). Choose the type of resume best suited to your individual experience. The chronological resume lists the jobs you've had and the schools you've attended, beginning with the most recent and going back in time. It is best suited for those people who have a relatively unbroken work record since leaving school and can offer good explanations for time gaps in their work record (a return to school or service in the military, for example). The skills resume highlights your particular skills and abilities and puts less emphasis on the record of your work and education history. It is best suited for those who have changed jobs fre - quently, have not worked for long periods of time, and/or acquired skills while incarcerated or in non-job-related pursuits. How to account for time incarcerated Employers do not like to see time gaps on resumes. They assume that a person with a strong record of employment or schooling is a more stable and dependable person, and thus less of a risk to hire. However, there are creative and professional ways to account for time gaps. When creating your resume, be sure to explain how you spent 384 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCHyour time in prison to your best advantage. If you finished your high school diploma program or received tutoring or took a corre - spondence course, say so under \"Educational Background.\" If you were trained in asbestos removal, list this under \"Skills\" or \"Work Experience.\" List porter work done in prison, maintenance or land - scaping, and work in a prison office, library, or transitional services center. Help in writing a resume It is a good idea to get some expert help in writing a resume. For example, reach out to your public library's job information center, where you will find resources on how to write a resume, along with sample resumes. Specially trained staff will be able to look over what you have written and help you strengthen any parts of your resume that need improvement. A resume must always look neat, and be typed and saved as a digital file. A digital copy of your resume is essential so that you may edit the content of it to fit each job to which you apply. Public libraries have computers with printers for you to use. When creat - ing your resume you can save a copy of it on a flash drive, save it to cloud storage (such as Google Drive), or email it to yourself and save it in your email inbox to access when needed. There are a number of free resources available online, so do not feel the need to pay for a service to create your resume. If you need assistance with creating a digital copy of your resume, please see the Computer Literacy section of this book on page 65.385 CONNECTIONS 2023Sample Resumes On the following pages are three sample resumes with notes explaining how formerly incarcerated people can present their time in prison.386 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCHSample Resume I: Chronological Resume DAVID COOPER 212.555.1312 | dcooper@qmail.com OCCUPATIONAL GOAL: Automotive Technician EDUCATION Plattsburgh State College, Plattsburgh, NY: current High School Equivalency Diploma, Elmira, NY: 2011 Elmira CF Automotive Shop, 1,500 hours of training: 2008 Henry Hudson High School, New York, NY: 2006 Electrical Shop, Automotive Shop, Mechanical Drawing VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE, 2008-2011 NAACP, Elmira Correctional Facility Treasurer, Merrick Jaycees, Merrick Correctional Facility Transitional Services Assistant, Little Kills Correctional Facility WORK EXPERIENCEStation Attendant , AA Station, Bronx, NY: 2017-2019 Pumped gas and performed light auto-body repair on various types of vehicles Supervised a small team of attendants House Painter , 18 months experience: 2014-2016 Prepared all surfaces for painting for 3,000+ sq ft buildings and utilized rollers, brushes, and sprayers Cleaned and maintained all painting equipment and safely stored all items Electrical & Maintenance Crew , Rehabilitation of Chemung County Fire House: Summer 2011 Responsible for electrical wiring and new window installation Jewelry Vendor , NYC: 2006-2007 Supported owner in selling merchandise at neighborhood events, community centers, and flea markets Assisted customers with questions, adhered to all company policies and procedures1 2 3387 CONNECTIONS 2023Notes to Sample Resume I David Cooper spent three years, from 2008-2011, incarcerated in New York State correctional facilities.

His training as an asbestos remover at the prison has provided him with marketable skills. Hector chooses to name the school upstate that granted him a degree, without mentioning that he received the degree while incarcerated. He lists the facility where he received his asbestos training only as \"Mid-Apple CF,\" not \"Mid-Apple Correctional Facility.\" This assures that informa - tion about his incarceration is not the first thing the employer will notice. After being offered a job, he will have the opportunity to explain his conviction and his personal growth while incarcerated. 1 Be sure to include all of the formal training and education you may have received, including courses in prison. It is to your advantage to show the prospective employer that you spent your time productively while incarcerated. 2 When listing your work experience, always emphasize your responsibilities on the job and the skills that you learned or needed to employ. Hector was sent with fellow asbes - tos workers from his facility to work in nonprofit and local government sites throughout the county. He makes refer - ence to this as well as to the fact that he worked as part of a team. 3 Use action verbs for more effect (managed, supervised, trained, organized, sold, etc.). 4 Highlight the advantages that might be useful to your job (fluent in Spanish, driver's license) or in explaining your flex - ibility (willing to travel).390 PREPARING FO R TH E JOB SEAR CHSample Resume III: Skills Resume Jennifer Blake 718-555-1109 | jenb@xyzmail.com SKILLS SUMMARY Highly Organized Three years experience planning and documenting daily schedules, meetings, and calendars: managed appointments for a team of 16 people; responsible for office supply arrange - ments; and lead organizer for weekly food drives.

Because she has gaps in her work history, Jennifer has decided to construct a skills-type (functional) resume. She focuses on the many skills she acquired through her volunteer experience and office work as a clerk and administrative assistant. 1 In choosing a skills-type resume, emphasize the skills you have learned from both your paid job experience and your unpaid job experience, including volunteer work. List your responsibilities and emphasize their importance in relation to your career objective. 2 Jobs you are applying to might be remote. You may be working from home for all or part of your time. When updat - ing your resume include skills that highlight that you can successfully fulfill work duties at a workplace or indepen - dently from home. 3 Consider furthering your education. Many free or low-cost courses exist throughout the city in a variety of fields, including High School Equivalency and vocational skills. Listed on a resume, they will impress an employer and show that you are a person who wants to learn and has taken the initiative to do so. 4 Be sure to include all information that might be relevant to your job objective. Include certificates that highlight particu - lar expertise and skills that are relevant to the job you are applying to.392 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCHHow to Use a Resume You will likely need to email a copy of your resume to a prospec - tive employer or upload a file directly to an employer's website. If you need help doing so, you can contact your public library. If interviewing in person, bring copies of your resume to leave a copy with the interviewer. Share copies of your resume with any job-placement agency with which you establish contact. Share copies of your resume with professional associates and parole or probation officers who may come across job openings and notify you. Benefits of professional email addresses Creating a professional email address is very important, as it can have an impact on whether a candidate is interviewed or not. Choose an email address format that is simple and professional. Common email formats include using your first and last name in various versions and ordering. It may be difficult to get a profes - sional email of your choice, as millions of people are online, and your first and last name may have been taken by someone else already. If this is the case, you can use a shorter version of your name, initials, or a mixture of the two. You can also use an under - score to separate the names, although a period is more commonly used these days. Generally, it is best to avoid numeric characters in your professional email address, but you can use it if the situa - tion demands it. You also may want to make sure it is easy to share verbally with someone, for instance on the phone. It is best to not use your year of birth, or your city, profession, or skill set in your professional email address as you may move or change jobs. Common email formats include: Full name: nelsonjimenez@emaildomain.com First name with last initial: nelsonj@emaildomain.com First initial with last name: njimenez@emaildomain.com Full name with a period: nelson.jimenez@emaildomain.com First two letters in first name and last name: nejimenez@emaildomain.com Last name and first two letters in first name with a period: jimenez.ne@emaildomain.com393 CONNECTIONS 2023The definition of email domain is the web address that comes after the @ symbol in an email address. For help and support with creat - ing an email address, reach out to your local public library. Ways to Look for a Job There is no one definitive list of companies that hire formerly incar - cerated people. This section outlines some of the ways to look for a job. Reaching out to organizations listed in this book, especially in the Organizations for Job Seekers section, starting on page 343, may be helpful in your job search. Let people know that you are looking for work Sometimes jobs are filled by word of mouth. Let your friends, relatives, and community contacts know that you are looking for work. They can spread the word, and as soon as they hear of a job opening somewhere, they can let you know about it. Many times, jobs are filled when an employer hears about possible applicants through their personal network. This may happen even before new openings are advertised. Consider inquiring about a job at a local business, ie. walk into the store and ask a manager if they are hiring. Find jobs online It is important to know how to look for jobs online. Most compa - nies advertise their job openings online and many companies only advertise their openings online. This is especially true for larger companies. You will need an email address to send your resume to employers, to sign into job search websites, and to complete online applications. You may also need an email address for paper applications. Public libraries and some community organizations can provide help with learning how to use and set up a free email account. Job search websites are the most popular places online for job searching. Most require you to type in the name of a job or skill, and a list of current job openings will show up based on that search. Employers may look at resumes uploaded to job search and 394 PREPARING F OR T HE JOB SEA RCHprofessional networking sites. Creating a jobseeker profile and uploading your resume can increase your chances of finding work. Jobseeker profiles can be created on professional networking sites, or on most of the larger job search websites. Creating a profile on more than one site can increase your chances of being spotted by an employer. It also means you'll get emailed more often about job vacancies. More information about computer literacy is on page 65. Contact the employer directly Another way to learn where job openings are is to contact employers directly. By searching online, you can find the contact information of the businesses that interest you. If you know of a company that you would like to work for, you can check their website to see if they have any vacancies. It is important to look for instructions on how to apply. If a com - pany's website asks all applicants to apply online, follow those directions first. You can always follow up with a call or email later, but you do not want to be passed over for failing to follow the first direction. Employment placement services Employment placement services are similar to for-profit employment agencies in that they both provide job placement. Employment services, however, do not charge fees. They are usually attached to a government or community agency, a school, or a job-training program. Go through the chapters Organizations for Formerly Incarcerated People and Organizations for Job Seekers . Many of the listings, such as the New York State Department of Labor\u2014Job Services Division, are employment services. Others, such as the Center for Employment Opportunities (listed on page 40 ), include place - ment services. Note that some of the employment services listed specialize in job placement for specific groups, such as formerly incarcerated people, veterans, people recovering from substance use disorder, or people with disabilities.Applying for a Job396 APPLYING F OR A JOBWriting a Cover Letter A cover letter is a one-page letter written to the person or organi - zation offering the job you're applying for. A cover letter may not be needed for every job you apply to and certain industries do not generally use them for hiring. However, unless there are clear instructions not to send one, it is good practice to include a cover letter with your resume. A well-written cover letter lets you introduce yourself, expand on topics covered in your resume, and showcase your writing skills. It is also a way to stand out from other people applying for the same job. When writing a cover letter you should: Include the date of the letter Mention the job you are applying for and where or how you became aware of the opening Show that your skills and experience match the skills and expe - rience needed to do the job Explain why you want the position and why you would be a good fit Request an interview and include a phone number and email address where you can be reached When possible, address the cover letter to the director or head of a department by using the person's full name. To find this infor - mation you can search the company's website. Otherwise, \"Dear Hiring Manager or Dear Human Resource Staff\" is the best greet - ing. Avoid using a gendered greeting such as \"Dear Sir or Madam\".

Thank you in advance for your time, Nelson Jimenez399 CONNECTIONS 2023Filling Out a Job Application Most companies require a person to fill out a job application. To fill one out you will need to know a lot of detailed information about yourself, including your work and education history. It is a good idea to start gathering this information in advance, so you can have it ready and organized by the time you start looking for a job. You can use the Personal Fact Sheet on page 418 to record your information in order to save time and have important names, dates, and addresses all in one place. Many job application forms are now available online and most large companies only use an online application process. To apply online you will usually need to create an account, which will require an email address and choosing a username and password. Some online job applications must be completed in a set amount of time and some have lengthy questionnaires. The staff at most public libraries can help you with setting up a free email account and applying to jobs online. When filling out an application on paper, take your time. Make sure your writing is clear and neat. It is helpful to look over the entire application before you start writing anything down. Try to answer all of the questions asked on the job application. If any do not pertain to you, it is still recommended you put some - thing in the space provided, such as \"N/A\" (Not Applicable). For example, if you have never served time in the military, you may write \"N/A\" where asked about military experience. Review the guidelines detailed on page 372 to learn more about answering questions related to your conviction and avoiding dis - crimination.Job applications are usually divided into four major categories: Personal Information Educational Background Work Experience/Employment History References400 APPLYING F OR A JOBPersonal information You will need to have available: Your current address A phone number where you can be reached An email address You are also likely to be asked if you are 18 or older, if you are legally allowed to work in the US, and whether you have served in the military. Educational background You will need to know information for every school you have attended. This includes a school's address, the years that you attended, and the type of degree, diploma, or certificate you received. Include any other type of classes or school you have attended. For example, if you have taken a professional development class or went to any special type of trade or vocational school, include that information. If you've taken college classes, but have not received a degree, write the number of credits that you have earned, and in which major you were working. Work experience/employment history For this section, you will have to know and list your work experience and employment history starting with the most recent and going back. For each, be prepared to give the name of the company or employer, its address, the dates when you were employed, the type of work you performed, your title, and the reason for leaving. You can also list unpaid work in this section. For example, if you have ever tutored, helped someone renovate their house, or volun - teered for a community group. For suggestions on how to account for time incarcerated in your work history, see the Resume section on page 381 . References References are people your potential employer can contact to find out more about you. They are people who are familiar with your work or your character in a professional or educational setting. They can be current or former employers, supervisors, or teach -401 CONNECTIONS 2023ers. It is best not to use friends or family members as references. Make sure you know their full name, job title, and current contact details and let them know you are listing them as a reference. This prepares them for the possibility that they will be contacted and asked to say or write a few words in your support. They will be most prepared to support you if they know what type of work you are looking for and if they have a current copy of your resume. On the following page is a sample of a job application. Other infor - mation that may be asked includes salary expectations, hours you are available to work, and previous supervisor's name and contact information.402 APPLYING FO R A JOBEmployment Application Please complete all information.

Signature: 404 APPLYING F OR A JOBInterviewing for a Job The job interview Interviews are a chance for an employer to learn more about you and determine how well you are qualified to fulfill the require - ments of the job. At the same time, the interview allows you the opportunity to assess whether or not the job is right for you, and to demonstrate how your skills or qualifications can be a positive asset to the employer. If you make a good impression during the interview, you may get the job\u2014even if you don't have all the qualifications. On the other hand, if you make a bad impression, chances are you will not be offered the position, no matter how good your qualifications. Preparing for the job interview Job interviews can be stressful, but practicing and being well pre - pared can help you feel more confident. The following tips and techniques can help you perform well in an interview: Prepare for interview questions Learn about the company For in-person interviews: bring the materials you will need, and arrive early and be patient For remote interviews: test the technology, and set up the space and environment Wear professional clothing Prepare for interview questions One way to prepare for an interview is to think about how you will answer questions you might be asked. Practice answering common interview questions, individually and with other people. You can write down answers to hypothetical questions as well. Take your time with your answers; it is okay to pause and think. Remember, every answer you give should reflect how you are qualified for the job. The answer you provide should describe important and rel - evant highlights from your work background that shows you are qualified for the job. Avoid answering questions with your personal history. When an interviewer says, \"Tell me about yourself,\" what 405 CONNECTIONS 2023they are really looking for is how your past work experience and skill set make you qualified for the job in question. Remember to practice what you will say before your interview, by writing down your answers to a variety of interview questions. Some common interview questions are: Why do you want to work here? Tell me about a challenge or conflict you faced at work, and how you dealt with it? How do you work with others? There are many websites that provide lists of common interview questions, such as www.glassdoor.com/blog/common-interview-questions. Indeed's Career Guide, found online at www.indeed.com/ career-advice , is a website for jobseekers that includes a section dedicated to common interview questions with examples of how best to answer them. Be prepared to talk about what you see as your major strengths and weaknesses. Avoid personal factors that have no relevance to performing the job in question. When discussing a weakness, show not only that you are aware of the problem, but the mea - sures you have taken to help solve it. For example, \"In my last job, because we relied on paper and used the old software for years, I had limited experience using Microsoft Office. Because I always want to keep my technology skills up to date, I took it upon myself to learn Microsoft Office products in free classes I found in my community. Overall, I took 100 hours of training in Excel, Word, and Outlook, in order to feel confident and comfortable using the software.\" Review the guidelines detailed on page 372 to learn more about answering questions related to your conviction and avoiding dis - crimination.It is important to know what information is illegal to ask about during an interview. Questions about your home life, about parenting or caretaking duties, or health needs may be phrased in ways that seem rel - evant to the job and appropriate to ask, but in fact any questions about your personal life are illegal to ask in an interview. You do 406 APPLYING F OR A JOBnot have to disclose information such as marriage status, room - mate situation, whether or not you have children or are a caretaker, information about your physical or mental health, or your home life. If you are asked personal questions, it is best to decline to answer in a polite and professional way such as, \"Whether I am working remotely or in person, I have organized my schedule so that it won't interfere with my work responsibilities.\" Even if an interviewer asks a question such as, \"How are you holding up this year?\" be sure to focus on work and not disclose personal informa - tion in your answer. Learn about the company Before the interview, it is very helpful to learn about the company and the job for which you are applying. Employers like it when you show them you understand what they do, how they do it, and what their challenges are. It will help you to better explain why you want to work for that particular company or employer and what attracted you to the job. This information can usually be found on the com - pany's website, sometimes on the About Us page or History page. It is also helpful to find and know a company's Mission Statement, often located on the About Us page. The mission of The New York Public Library, for example, is \"to inspire learning, advance knowl - edge, and strengthen communities.\" The Mission Statement will give you an idea of the personality and purpose of the company and give you a chance to explain how you fit into the company's culture. Make a list of all the important questions you would like to have answered at the job interview. They might include: What are the work hours? What are the opportunities for advancement? What benefits does the company offer? What are the challenges asso - ciated with the job? Don't be afraid to ask questions, but keep them relevant. It reflects interest on your part. For In-person Interviews What you need to bring: Be sure to bring a pen, paper, and extra copies of your resume. You may also want to bring your Personal Fact Sheet from page 418 , in case you are asked to complete a paper application form at your interview. Also, you may want to write down the name and phone number of the person who will 407 CONNECTIONS 2023interview you and have it ready. Bring any special documents you think you may need. Arrive early and be patient: Being late for a job interview creates a very bad impression. Double-check the right date and time of the interview. It is best to go into the interview about 10 minutes ahead of the scheduled time, but plan to get to the location 30 minutes early to account for any delays. Make sure you know any COVID-19 safety precautions that have been put in place by the organization or company you are applying to. This can be mask requirements, vaccination requirements, or getting your temperature taken. Plan out how you will get to the interview location the day before. If you are taking public transportation, you may want to call the Transit Authority at 718.330.1234 for information on the best route to take or for schedules. You can also visit the trip planner at https://new.mta.info . When you arrive, be polite. Avoid any lengthy exchanges with the receptionist or others who may be waiting. Be patient if you are not called in for the interview at the exact time agreed upon. Use the time to review and compose your thoughts. It is impossible to tell how long an interview will take. If you need to plan two interviews on the same day, make sure you have left enough time in between them, so you will not be late to the second one. For Remote Interviews Test the Technology: Be sure to familiarize yourself with whatever technology is being used. If you are using a video-conferencing platform, be sure to check your video and audio settings well before the interview. You may want to conduct a practice run. Every platform has different setting options and you will want to make sure you are familiar with them before the interview. Set up: Try to face the brightest source of light available. Do not place the source of light behind you. Make sure that the camera angle is head-on and at eye level. Limit Distractions: Find the quietest space you have available 408 APPLYING F OR A JOBfor your interview. If you have earphones, use them to limit back - ground noises. If you are using a video-conferencing platform, try to find a space where the background is not distracting or over - crowded, so that you are the focus of the interview. Be aware of what is visible on camera because your surroundings can reveal personal information about you or your family. Wear professional clothing Whether in-person or remote, part of presenting yourself well for a job interview involves dressing neatly in clean and unwrinkled clothes. Dressing professionally shows the employer that you are taking the interview seriously and makes a good impression. This is important even if clothes are not important for the job (for instance if you will be supplied a uniform or if it is a job where people get dirty). Think about what you would wear on a typical work day in the job you are applying to and then come to the interview dressed one step more conservatively than that. For example, a nice pair of slacks, and a shirt or sweater would be appropriate for interview - ing for an auto technician\u2014where jeans and a shirt would be the typical daily attire. A suit or dressy shirt and pants are appropriate attire for most office position interviews. Look up Clothing in the index of this book for organizations that provide free professional clothing to job seekers. Helpful points for interviews Be professional Listen attentively Be clear, complete, and brief Be positive in your approach Avoid the negative Be professional Show the interviewer professional respect. Don't chew gum or stare at the clock or your watch. Turn your phone on silent and do not use it during the interview. Never debate with the interviewer, even if they seem aggressive in their approach. Listen attentively During the interview, try to be relaxed and listen carefully to what 409 CONNECTIONS 2023the interviewer has to say. If you are nervous (and it's perfectly normal to be nervous during an interview), try not to fidget. Be engaged and practice active listening by hearing out full state - ments before formulating your answer. It is okay to take your time. Be clear, complete, and brief Be professional with the language you use. Always answer with more than just \"yes\" or \"no.\" Think before answering to give suc - cinct and specific information about yourself. Be positive in your approach It is important that you highlight your qualifications during the interview. Appear confident but never exaggerate your experience or skills. If the interviewer fails to ask you something you feel is important, fill in the gap. If asked to tell about yourself generally, mention only those things that pertain to the job for which you are applying. Avoid the negative Keep personal problems to yourself. Do not talk about your home or financial problems. The interviewer is only interested in finding a dependable and qualified person to fill the position. Emphasize what you can do, not what you can't. Never apologize for lack of education or experience. There are many skills and talents you have developed that you can discuss in a professional way. If you've been fired from a job, be prepared to explain what hap - pened if you are asked about it. Recognize the mistakes that were made, but show how you have learned from them. Never speak negatively about your former employers, even when asked about challenges you faced in previous jobs. If you stayed on jobs for only short periods of time, perhaps you quit to go back to school, or to look for a better-paying job with more responsibilities. If you didn't finish school, explain the decision in a positive way. You can explain, \"I left school because I accepted a job to earn money to support my family.\" Mention any classes or training pro - grams you have attended since leaving school, or any that you may have planned for the near future. Discussing a conviction in an interview In New York City, it is illegal for an employer to ask you about 410 APPLYING F OR A JOByour conviction history. A background check can be conducted only after a job offer is made. Learn more about this law, the Fair Chance Act, on page 372 . If you interview for a job outside of the five boroughs of New York City, you must be prepared to discuss your conviction with confi - dence and positivity. Do not mention the details of the conviction or try to convince the employer of innocence. If the employer asks for specifics, state the charges for which you were convicted but do not elaborate or try to explain it away\u2014it can sound false and will keep the focus on the negative. Be as brief as possible. For example, \"I was convicted of felony sales of a controlled sub - stance.\" Special consideration should be paid to the discussion of drug- related convictions. It is illegal for an employer to ask you whether or not you have a history of alcohol or substance use disorder. Current illegal drug use is not protected under employment dis - crimination law, and employers can ask if an applicant is currently using illegal drugs. Employers like to see that a person can take responsibility for choices made in the past because it shows personal reflection, growth, and a desire for change. State that you've changed. It can be as simple as saying, \"I'm a different person today.\" Explain how you've changed by listing the concrete positive steps you've made in your life. This can cover a wide variety of areas\u2014educa - tion, military service, work history, volunteer activities, and/or skills obtained inside or outside of prison. Ending the interview Remember, the interview is also an opportunity for you to find out more information about the potential job and employer. At the end of the interview, you can ask any thoughtful questions you have already prepared (during your research) or any clarifications you may need about something that was brought up in the interview. For example, you may want to ask the interviewer what they think is the main challenge of the job or if they offer opportunities for training. Usually, it is not a good idea to ask about details like lunch hours or vacations, unless the interviewer brings them up. If you are asked to discuss salary expectations, be prepared and be real -411 CONNECTIONS 2023istic. To see the average salary for a particular type of job, you can check the Occupational Outlook Handbook website at www.bls. gov/ooh , but remember it is illegal to be asked about your salary history in NYC. In most instances, the decision on whether or not to hire you will not happen at the interview. If no indication is given about when you can expect to hear from the company, ask about the notifica - tion process. At the end of the interview thank the interviewer for the opportunity to be interviewed. Remember to remain professional until you've left the building. Follow-up thank you email Within 24 hours after the interview, send the employer a brief and professionally written email to thank them again for the opportunity to be interviewed. This shows the employer that you are serious about the job. It will help you stand out amongst your competitors, and many hiring managers/interviewers pay close attention to how well, and how rapidly, you write a thank you email after the interview. In addition you can include any important information that you forgot to mention during the interview, as well as clear up anything that you feel you did not explain or present effectively during the interview. Be sure to proofread your letter before sending for gram - matical and spelling errors. At your local library, a staff member can help you write and edit your email. A thank you email should: Include information that reminds the interviewer of your conver - sation. For example, mention something you discussed that you found interesting, or highlight what the interviewer liked about you. Share you are fit for the position by highlighting your skills and expertise that make you the right candidate for the job. Show enthusiasm. Make sure you convey your enthusiasm for the position. Be concise. Keep your message to one or two paragraphs (3-4 sentences for each).412 APPLYING F OR A JOB Address any issues you feel need resolution, or any concerns expressed by the interviewer. Identify next steps. End your email with another \"thank you,\" and summarize any next steps discussed during your interview. The following is an example thank you email. Hi Deanna,Thank you so much for meeting with me today. I really enjoyed learning more about the job at AAA Plumbing, and hearing about your experience working for the company. I am very excited about the opportunity to join your team, as a Warehouse Agent. I believe that I have the skills and experience to ensure that the organiza - tion continues to do great work, since I have spent three years working in a similar role. I can tell AAA Plumbing is a special place to work, and I would be thrilled to join such an innovative, hardworking, and passionate team of individuals. Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide to make your hiring decision easier. I can be reached at 555-0911. Best regards, Nelson JimenezAfter the Interview414 AFTER T HE INT ERVIEWBeing Offered a Job There are several factors to take into consideration before accept - ing a job offer. But remember, it is much easier to find a job when you already have one. If the job you have been offered isn't exactly what you wanted, it may still be worthwhile to accept the offer and learn as much as you can and make money while you continue to look for another job. Job potential Ask yourself whether the job will challenge you. Will you be given the opportunity to work your way up to positions of more responsi - bility and higher pay? Will you be in a good place financially, even if you are looking for other opportunities? Try not to lose sight of your long-term goals and continue to work toward them, even if you find yourself at a job that does not live up to your expectations. Salary or hourly wage How much you are getting paid is an important factor when con - sidering a job offer. Find out about your hourly wage, whether you will be receiving a fixed salary each pay period, or whether you will be dependent on commissions or tips. Also, find out if there will be opportunities for earning extra money on the job by working overtime. When choosing between two jobs, a person will not always decide to take the one offering the highest pay. Other important factors include working conditions, benefits, better hours, an easier commute, and more opportunities for training or job advancement. Benefits Benefits are what you receive from an employer in addition to your wages. They may include medical insurance, paid sick leave, paid holidays and vacation, parental leave, a wellness plan, uniforms and special equipment needed on the job, unemployment insur - ance, workers' compensation, or tuition assistance for continuing education. It is important to find out what benefits are offered at the job you are considering. Other factors worth your consideration Commuting time and costs to and from the job415 CONNECTIONS 2023 Working conditions, such as hours, weather, noise levels, light - ing, and dust Safety factors, such as risks of injury and COVID-19 precautions Social environment, workplace culture, and coworkers Helpful Hints in Adjusting to a New Job Be dependable and responsible Do not be late for work or be absent without having a good reason and giving advance notice. If commuting, get to know exactly how long your commute is and allow for extra time. Always expect transportation delays. If you are going to be late, or can't make it to work, call in immediately. If you offer to do a task or are asked to do one, make sure it gets done. Don't promise to do more than you can reasonably handle. Be patient When you first begin a new job, there is a lot to be learned, no matter what the job is. It's normal to be nervous during the first week or two. Your employer wants you to do well and communicat - ing with them could help you adjust to a new role. Follow directions If you need to understand something better, don't be afraid to ask questions. Your success as an employee will be judged to a very large extent on your ability to listen and follow directions. There are usually valid reasons why you are told to perform tasks the way that you are. Get along well with your coworkers Performing your job assignment is only one aspect of job adjust - ment. Equally important is your ability to get along with your coworkers and/or the public you serve. If a problem occurs at work, practice professional communication and discuss the issue with your boss. If your workplace has a Human Resources department, that is where you would report serious issues like abuse, discrimi - nation, or harassment.416 AFTER T HE INT ERVIEWLearn from constructive criticism Constructive criticism and performance reviews are a part of every job. Do not take criticism personally. Although it takes practice, listening to feedback is an important part of the workplace. Create boundaries between personal life and work Work often offers you the opportunity to socialize with coworkers, and socializing is an important feature of the work experience. Still, it is important to remember that your main reason for being at work is to perform your job. Don't let personal issues interfere with work. It is unfair to take a lot of time talking with coworkers about your personal affairs when it can end up jeopardizing both of your jobs. Leaving a Job If you decide your current job is not the right fit, it is a good idea to secure another job before leaving. The job market is competitive in NYC and securing a new job will take time. Employers generally prefer choosing new job applicants from those who are already employed. If you quit a job, be sure to give your current employer at least two weeks' notice. It is important to be professional when leaving a job so that they will be more likely to give you a good recommendation for your next job. Some things to think about Is your job covered by unemployment insurance? If so, will you be eligible to receive unemployment insurance benefits? If you were laid off or fired, do you have any recourse? Can you appeal the decision to anyone in the HR department or union? If you were laid off or fired, is there any severance pay that you can collect? What will happen when you leave the job in terms of your pension, your health insurance coverage, and your unused vaca - tion and sick time?417 CONNECTIONS 2023Being Unemployed Unemployment Insurance (UI) provides temporary financial help to workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own. If you suddenly find yourself unemployed, you may be eligible to receive unemployment insurance benefits. If you are eligible, you must declare yourself willing and able to work and actively looking for new work while receiving unemployment benefits. Visit https:/ /dol.ny.gov/unemployment/unemployment-insurance- assistance for more information or to apply online. You can also call 888.209.8124 (Spanish spoken) for recorded information on unemployment insurance. If applying in-person, you will be asked by the local unemployment office to begin by bringing in your Social Security card and one or two other pieces of identification. (A pay stub from your former job is also helpful.) If you are eligible for benefits, there is a 2- or 3-week processing period, after which you will receive cash benefits (an amount proportionate to the salary you received and the amount of time you worked) for at least 26 weeks. While unemployed, you may also be eligible to receive other types of benefits. These can include food stamps or Medicaid (see the Financial Assistance chapter starting on page 106 ), or union ben - efits if you were a dues-paying member of a union where you last worked. You may also be eligible for programs made to help people find work or further their education and training.418 AFTER T HE INT ERVIEWPersonal Fact Sheet Name: Email: Education Name and Address Area of Study Degree Received High School: Vocational: College:Other Training: Employment/Work Experience Company Name & AddressName of Supervisor From/To Reason For Leaving References Name Company/Job Title Phone Number Additional Information (volunteer work, certificates, languages spoken)419 CONNECTIONS 2023Record of Job Contacts Made Name of Company AddressPhone/EmailName of Contact PersonDate & Time of AppointmentTravel Directions Comments Name of Company AddressPhone/EmailName of Contact PersonDate & Time of AppointmentTravel Directions Comments 420 INDEXIndex Numbers 30th Street Intake for Men 85 311 212 A A Beautiful HEART Ministries 270Abraham House 93Acacia Network\u2014Greenhope Services for Women, Inc. 93, 270 Access-A-Ride 266 ACCESS NYC 110Access to Benefits (A2B) Helpline 108ACCES-VR 260ACE Programs for the Homeless 95 ACLU National Prison Project 299 ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project 269 ACS ConnectMe 338 ActionNYC 235ADA National Network 257 ADA National Network\u2014Northeast ADA Center 258 Addiction Care Interventions 150 Adoption Options 322 Adult Family Intake Center 88Adult Survivors Act 214 Advance Care Planning 125Advocates for Children 305Affordable Rental Lotteries 100 Al-Anon\u2014NYC 158Albert Einstein College of Medicine\u2014Montefiore-Einstein Division of Substance Abuse 152 Alcoholics Anonymous 158Ali Forney Center 290 , 314 Alliance for Positive Change 122 Alliance of Families for Justice 38 American Cancer Society 126 , 277 American Heart Association 160 American Indian College Fund 74 American Liver Foundation 135America Works 352 Animation Project 305 Anti-Violence Project 142, 290 Anxiety and Depression Association of America 144421 INDEXArgus Community, Inc. 129 , 153 Arms Acres\u2014Outpatient Services 153 Article 23A 372Asian & Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund 74 Avenues for Justice\u2014Andrew Glover Youth Program 306 B Background Checks 373Bail 191Bailey House 95Bard Prison Initiative 75 Bard Microcolleges 67 Bedford Hills College Program 79 Bedford-Stuyvesant Family Health Center 122 Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator 150 Bennington College 76 Birth Certificate 205Black & Pink NYC 291Black Veterans for Social Justice, Inc. 252Board of Elections in New York City 198 , 203 Body Politic\u2014Covid-19 Support Group 27BOOM!Health 130Bowery Mission 96 154 , 273 Bowery Residents' Committee 38Breaking Ground 96Breast and Cervical Cancer Detection 273Brennan Center for Justice 178 Bridging Access to Care 130Bronx Community College\u2014Adult Basic Education & Training Program 62 Bronx Community College\u2014Future Now 67 BronxConnect 306 Bronx Defenders 179 Bronx Independent Living Services, Inc. 264 Bronx Supreme Court Law Library 191BronxWorks 96, 236 , 344 Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled 265 Brooklyn Defender Services 180, 236 Brooklyn District Attorney's Office\u2014Re-entry Bureau 39 Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) 5 Adult Learning Centers 60Bard Microcollege 67Business & 348Community Health 121Computer Pass 325422 INDEXFinancial Services 115 Immigrant Services 233Services for Older Adults 280 Youth & Family Services 313 Brooklyn Workforce Innovations 352 Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2014The Occupational Outlook Handbook 358 Burial Assistance 30Business Outreach 361 C Immigrant Service 236Call BlackLine 143Callen-Lorde Health 352 CareerZone 358Cathedral Community Cares 111Catholic Charities 237Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services 39, 136 , 306 Center for Anti-Violence Education 292 Center for Community Alternatives 40, 151 , 307 Center for Court Innovation 40, 321 Center for Employment Opportunities 40, 344 Center for Family Representation 333Center for Hearing and Communication 262 Center for Independence of the Disabled in New York 264 Center for Urban Community Services 97 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 126, 135 , 206 Centers Health Care 285Center, The 293Certificate of Good Conduct 183 , 366 Certificate of Relief from Disabilities 366Charles B.
