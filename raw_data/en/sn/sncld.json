Hence, the present study proposes to screen/identify the possible mechanisms and to study the effect of the flavonoid-enriched fraction of Selaginella bryopteris extract against human keratinocyte cell lines (HaCaT) and streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic wounds in a male Wistar rat model. Chemical profiling was performed by an MTT assay. The obtained GC-MS analysis results showed the presence of amentoflavone, gallic acid, imidazole, palmitic acid, catechine, L-fucitol, lupeol, and myo-inositol as the major bioactive phytoconstituents. S. bryopteris induces the generation of ROS, the condensation of chromatin in the nucleus, and changes in the membrane potential of mitochondria in HaCaT cell lines. An S. bryopteris-dependent induction of apoptosis-mediated cell death in HaCaT cell lines was confirmed by an AO/PI analysis. Mitochondrial depolarization was reflected in JC-1 staining of cells. The wound size was reduced and epithelialization was enhanced. Keratinocyte migration decreased interleukins, TNF-, IL-2, and IL-6 and the expression of pro-apoptotic (p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) genes in a dose-dependent manner. Keratinocyte migration increased antioxidant enzyme levels (CAT, SOD, MDA, and GSH). Wound healing is facilitated through the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway, revealing a new area of diabetic wound therapy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-28", "cleaned_text": "Wound Healing Activity of the Flavonoid-Enriched Fraction of Selaginella bryopteris Linn. against Streptozocin-Induced Diabetes in Rats [https://doi.org/10.3390/separations10030166](https://doi.org/10.3390/separations10030166) [Exclusive Papers Collection of Scholars Invited by Editorial total of 175 million people with diabetes are undiagnosed and 15% of people have chronic wounds related to diabetes. Wounds impact 7-9% of the population globally, drastically lowering their quality of life. The profits of advanced wound care products are expected to reach around USD 9.4 billion by 2022. Delayed wound healing in diabetic patients arises through several factors, such as poor vascular supply in the hemostasis phase, slow recruitment of neutrophils in the inflammation phase, reduced tensile strength, reduced collagen deposition, and reduced fibroblast activity in the proliferation phase. As we know, several pharmacological models have been reported to understand the mechanism of poor wound healing. Streptozocin is a naturally occurring alkylating antineoplastic agent used in medical research and in high doses is responsible for inducing hyperglycemia in animal models, which leads to elevated blood sugar levels, aggravates the diabetic condition, and extends the expression of TNF-, all leading to impaired wound healing. A wound analysis in diabetic rats has shown that the level of TNF- is three times higher compared to normal rats. Cellular apoptosis and the least expression of the wound healing process is deregulated by the Bcl-2 protein [ [2](#B2-separations-10-00166)]. Reactive oxygen species increase the expression of proapoptotic proteins such as BAX, FAS, and caspases, while decreasing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as B cell lymphoma 2 genes (Bcl-2) [ [3](#B3-separations-10-00166)]. Diabetic wound complications are even more poorly addressed. There is an urgent need to develop alternatives to treat diabetic wounds which are aimed at specific targets or a follow a mechanism-based wound healing approach. As we know, several pharmacological models have been reported to understand the mechanism of poor wound healing in diabetic models of Wistar rats with excision and incision wounds. By using the antibiotic streptozocin, a naturally occurring alkylating antineoplastic agent used in medical research, hyperglycemia was induced in animal models, which led to elevated blood sugar levels. [4](#B4-separations-10-00166), [5](#B5-separations-10-00166), [6](#B6-separations-10-00166), [7](#B7-separations-10-00166)]. S. bryopteris a a treditional magical herb used for several health care isshue like diabetes inflammation but there no scientific data reported regarding its activity on wound healing \". [7](#B7-separations-10-00166), [8](#B8-separations-10-00166)]. S. bryopteris is rich in flavonoid compounds. We draw particular attention to amentoflavone and 8-aryl flavonoid because of their valuable, potent antioxidant activities. S. bryopteris' reported biological anti-plasmodial, leishmanicidal, and anti-depressant properties, and it also used for heat stroke [ [11](#B11-separations-10-00166), [12](#B12-separations-10-00166), [13](#B13-separations-10-00166)]. Some previous studies have also revealed its role against skin inflammatory diseases [ [14](#B14-separations-10-00166)]. Traditionally, S. bryopteris has been used as an aqueous leachate for treating a number of health complications such as hot flushes, a burning sensation during micturition, jaundice, etc. It is also given orally to pregnant women for relieving pain during delivery [ [9](#B9-separations-10-00166), [15](#B15-separations-10-00166)]. The current strategy incorporates the approaches of conventional systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda, with the present knowledge of medicines, tools, and techniques to verify the claimed therapeutic benefits of S. bryopteris. We also quantify the effects of S. bryopteris in stimulating several factors which are responsible in wound healing using in vitro and in vivo models. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Reagents 2.2. Extract Preparation and Phytochemical Profiling [11](#B11-separations-10-00166), [16](#B16-separations-10-00166)]. The TPC and TFC were expressed as gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/gram and as mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/gram [ [16](#B16-separations-10-00166), [17](#B17-separations-10-00166)], correspondingly. A GC-MS analysis was used to characterize the phytochemical properties of the bioactive fraction of S. bryopteris trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) as derivatizing agent. material was investigated using GC-MS (Thermo Trace GC Ultra) and a mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA, DSQ II). The data were recorded using a mass selective detector. The detector was set to operate in electron impact mode (ionization energy: 70 eV, ionization m/z). The resulting chromatographic and mass data were collected using the Xcalibur program. The m/z ratio for each metabolite fragment was investigated using GC-MS spectral library databases such as WILLY and NIST. For the discovered metabolites, the relative concentration was represented as a percentage of peak area [ [18](#B18-separations-10-00166)]. 2.3. In Vitro Wound Healing Studies 2.3.1. Cell Culture 2.3.2. MTT Assay [19](#B19-separations-10-00166)]. For 24 h, different quantities of S. bryopteris, ranging from 0 to 80 \u00b5g/mL, were tested in 96-well sterile plates. Control cells and cells treated with the standard were placed in opposition (betadine). After 24 h, the medium was replaced in each well with 20 \u00b5L sample and MTT was done after 2 h. The liquid for dissolving formazan crystals was then dissolved in 1% DMSO. This was followed by a 30 min incubation period with an IC 50 value of 17.5 g/mL. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Model 680 XR Bio-Rad laboratories Inc.). 2.3.3. Assessment of Nitric Oxide (NO) 2.3.4. Assessment of Cell Organelles Health Parameters Nuclear Morphology Analysis Using DAPI for Apoptosis [20](#B20-separations-10-00166)]. For this analysis, cells were incubated overnight in a cover slip placed in six-well plates. Cells (3 \u00d7 105) were then treated with different concentrations (0-60 g/mL) and kept for 24 h under physiological conditions. Cells were stained for 15 min with a freshly produced combination of AO/PI at a final concentration of 10 g/mL. Staining was followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess dye. Under a fluorescence microscope, UV filters were used to observe the marked cells. 2.4.

Phytochemical Profiling Selaginella bryopteris [Figure 1](#separations-10-00166-f001)shows the peak areas for gallic (1.1 0.68), and myo-inositol (6.7 S. bryopteris extract is a specialized natural remedy for treating diabetic wounds). In the GC-MS study of S. bryopteris, several pharmacologically active substances, L-fucitol, myo-inositol, and scyllo-inositol, have been identified. Anticancer been reported for imidazole (an alkaloid) and amentoflavone (flavonoid); wound healing properties have been found in lupeol (triterpenoid), gallic acid (flavonoid compound), and palmitic acid (naturally occurring fatty acid); and gallic acid also possess antioxidant properties [ [14](#B14-separations-10-00166)]. 3.2. In Vitro Wound Healing Study [Figure 2](#separations-10-00166-f002)A. The MTT assay was used to examine the anti-proliferative activity of S. bryopteris initially and the results were justified using AO/PI staining by employing a flow-cytometric analysis in a dose-dependent manner. In the PI region, PI staining shows that 45.02% of HaCaT cells are present. In comparison, only 6.14% of control cells exhibit a strong anti-proliferative effect from S. bryopteris. 3.2.1. in HaCaT Cells [Figure 2](#separations-10-00166-f002)B. In the ROS analysis, the fold change of the fluorescence intensity of cells was gradually increased when the concentration of PLE was increased, [Figure 2](#separations-10-00166-f002)C. JC-1 staining was used to examine mitochondrial fluoresces red in the case of normal mitochondria and green in the case of damaged mitochondria (depolarized). A flow cytometric investigation reflected a shift in cell density towards the green channel after S. bryopteris treatment, [Figure 2](#separations-10-00166-f002)D. Through AO/PI staining apoptosis were evaluated. The lipophilic cationic dye JC-1 was employed to measure the potential of the mitochondrial membrane. A loss in membrane potential, a hallmark of apoptosis, prevents JC-1 from accumulating as red fluorescent J-aggregates in 3](#separations-10-00166-f003)b. Microscopic images from DAPI staining depicted a strong relation with flow cytometric analysis, confirming the fact that S. bryopteris causes mitochondrial [Figure 3](#separations-10-00166-f003)c, in a concentration-dependent manner. Eventually, cell DAPI labeling and flow cytometry were used to investigate the cell cycle phase distribution. 3.3. In Vivo Study 3.3.1. Antioxidant Markers [Figure 4](#separations-10-00166-f004)a, and the analysis of wound area were given in [Figure 4](#separations-10-00166-f004)b. The levels of TBAR (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) (0.26 \u00b1 0.02 nM of protein) decreased by S. bryopteris ( [Figure The GSH and then non-significantly reduced following STZ treatment (1.04 \u00b1 0.07 mg%), in the case of the control. In contrast, GSH levels were augmented (1.4 \u00b1 0.04 mg%) after treatment with S. bryopteris ( [Figure 5](#separations-10-00166-f005)B). The STZ-treated group showed levels of SOD (0.023 \u00b1 0.002 units of SOD/mg (14.40 \u00b1 0.97 nM of H2O2/min/mg of protein), which were regained after treatment with S. BRYOPTERIS (i.e., 0.031 \u00b1 0.007 units of nM of H2O2/mg of protein), [Figure 5](#separations-10-00166-f005)C-D. Additionally, in an STZ-induced diabetic rat model system, we assessed the effect of topical administration of S. bryopteris on promoting wound healing and compared it to betadine, a positive control. Betadine has been touted as a promising drug for the avoidance of side effects in treating and preventing diabetic wounds. The development of chronic problems of diabetes mellitus caused by STZ is mostly attributed to the elevated level of oxidative stress that is linked with the disease. Cells are shielded from oxidative damage by antioxidants such as reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase. In our own publication, we demonstrated that type 2 diabetes mellitus patients experience increased levels of oxidative stress. 6](#separations-10-00166-f006)C. study, there was a higher level of TNF- expression in the STZ-induced negative control group as compared to the S. bryopteris-treated groups. The anti-inflammatory effects of interleukin-6 and interleukin-2 on wound healing were diminished in the blood serum of the negative control group compared to the treatment groups. 3.3.3.
