They work by training the immune system to recognize and fight specific viruses or bacteria. However, despite their proven effectiveness and safety, there are still many myths and misconceptions about vaccines that circulate in society. During the COVID-19 lockdown, a lot of misconceptions arose about the [vaccine](http://bit.ly/3KC8QBv), and some people even chose not to get immunized. People were worried about there being a microchip in the vaccine to track and collect private data. Of course, that's not why a vaccine is used. In this edition, we will debunk some myths about vaccinations. Myth 1: Vaccines can actually spread the disease that they were designed to prevent. This is not true. Vaccines contain inactivated or weakened forms of the virus or bacteria that they protect against. The weakened microbe is not strong enough to cause the disease, but it is enough to push the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the disease. The immune system's response may induce mild symptoms such as a low-grade fever or discomfort at the injection site, but it is not the same as the disease itself. Myth 2: Vaccines are not necessary because some diseases have disappeared. Thanks to widespread vaccination programs, some diseases have been eliminated or have been significantly reduced in certain parts of the world. But that does not mean that vaccinations are not required anymore. The microbes that cause infectious diseases still exist and can easily come back if the vaccination rates drop. In fact, there have already been outbreaks of diseases like measles in areas where vaccination rates have fallen. Myth 3: Vaccines are not safe. There is no proof of the unsafe nature of vaccines. Before they are given to the general public, vaccines go through testing and clinical trials to make sure that they are effective and safe to use. After approval, the vaccine is constantly monitored for any potential side effects. Some people may experience mild side effects after getting vaccinated, like soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever; these are usually short-lived and not serious. The benefits of vaccination are far greater than the risks. Myth 4: Vaccines can cause autism in children. Absolutely not! The belief that vaccines can cause autism comes from now-debunked research released in 1997 by Andrew Wakefield, who claimed that the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine increased the chance of autism in children. Numerous studies since then have found no such link. The cause of autism is not fully understood; however, it is definitely not linked to vaccines. Myth 5: Vaccines are not necessary if you are healthy. Vaccines are not just for protecting yourself but also for protecting those around you. If more people get vaccinated, the spread of disease is reduced. The entire community benefits from it, especially those who cannot get vaccinated, like young children or people with weak or compromised immune systems (people taking immunosuppressants can also get affected). Even healthy individuals can fall sick and spread diseases to others, so it is important that everyone gets vaccinated. Myth 6: Vaccines contain harmful ingredients. People believe that vaccines contain harmful substances like mercury, aluminum, or formaldehyde. While these substances are used in some vaccines, they are present in very small amounts that have been proven to be safe. The benefits of any vaccine, whether it contains mercury or not, far outweigh any potential risks from these ingredients. Myth 7: Natural immunity is better than vaccine-induced immunity. There is no doubt that natural immunity can provide protection against some diseases, but it comes at a cost. To develop natural immunity, a person must first contract the disease, which can be dangerous or even deadly. Natural immunity might not even provide lifelong protection against the disease. But vaccines can fill that gap and provide long-lasting immunity. Vaccines also offer the benefit of herd immunity, meaning that when enough people in a community or ecosystem are vaccinated, the spread of the disease gets reduced, making it less likely for vulnerable individuals to contract the disease. Myth 8: You only need vaccination once in your lifetime. Some vaccines provide lifelong immunity, while others require booster shots to maintain protection. For example, the tetanus vaccine requires a booster shot every 10 years. To make sure that you are completely protected against infectious diseases, it is essential to follow a suitable [vaccination](http://bit.ly/3GqCl6T) schedule. Myth 9: Vaccines are only for children. That is not true! It is true that many vaccines are given during childhood, but they are important for people of all ages. [Adults](http://bit.ly/3Ka3JXU), for example, should receive the flu vaccine every year, and the shingles vaccine is recommended for adults over 50 years of age. Vaccines are also important for travelers, healthcare workers, and people with certain health conditions. Myth 10: Vaccines are a conspiracy by the government or pharmaceutical companies. There is no proof that would support this conspiracy theory. Throughout history, infectious disease transmission has been significantly reduced because of vaccinations, which have been found to be both safe and effective. The research bodies and regulatory agencies develop and approve the vaccine, and then they monitor its safety and efficacy after its use. It is necessary to rely on accurate information from trusted sources when it comes to making decisions about your health and the health of your community.
