This is our top question, as winter approaches. We know pollution sources do not change through the year; what changes in winter is the fact that cold air settles close to the ground, trapping toxins, and making us ill. The onset of winter also comes when farmers burn stubble in their fields, after the harvest of rice and before they can sow the next wheat crop. It's a deadly game of wind, ventilation and moisture. Delhi and its surrounding cities choke, not necessarily when stubble burning is at its peak, but when weather conditions are opportune to do so. This year, covid -19 will make it even worse as the virus attacks our airways and so does air pollution. We are doubly at risk. This is also the season for politics\u2014our concerns for our health and the health of our children has made air pollution an issue for leaders to respond to. But sadly, they are doing this in the worst possible way by scoring points; playing blame-game; and then, by finding a seasonal gimmicky gizmo that will distract us to believe that all is well. Last year, it was building smog towers and this year, it is a campaign to switch off your vehicle engines while waiting at traffic signals. What we need to understand is that the scale of the crisis requires us to not just switch off engines on red light, but to stop all vehicular traffic and stop all fuel combustion. This is what we saw during the lockdown: clean air, blue skies. Because everything was shut. It will take this much to get us healthy air in winter, when the weather works against us. So, let's get real. We know that permanent lockdown is not feasible. So, what we need to understand is what can be done. But I digress. I want to answer your question if this year will be better or not. In my assessment, there are things working for us this year but some factors are against us; so, it will be better, but marginally so. You should expect incremen - tal improvements in air quality; days of severe- and emergency-level pollution should be less over the three months of winter 2020-21. This is the result of actions governments took till last year. Vehicular pollution remains the top contributor to toxic pollutants in the air. The Union government introduced BS-VI fuel, which is somewhat cleaner than the BS-IV petrol and diesel. But the real game changer is that it has also ramrodded industry to leapfrog to BS-VI compliant technology for vehicles. However, in a country like India where vehicle fleets change slowly, the real impact of this is still not visible. Yet, it is a big gain. Then, it completed the two expressways that would divert heavy vehicle traffic away from the already polluted city. In addition, under the Supreme Court's mandate, the Radio Frequency Identification Device ( rfid) at key entry points into the city is being implemented to enforce payment of congestion tax by heavy-duty vehicles. This is a deterrent so that only those vehicles that need to enter the city do so. As a result of these two measures, traffic entering the city has reduced from 40,000 daily vehicles to some 4,000. Then the Delhi government has taken the bold step to ban all polluting fuels, including coal in furnaces, across the city. It has incentivised the transition to piped natural gas. In the neighbouring states\u2014part of the same airshed\u2014the key action has been to crack down on brick-kilns, which were not using zigzag technology for improved combustion and reduced emissions. In addition, city and municipal governments across the region have somewhat stepped up vigilance over dust sources like roads, construction sites and burning of garbage. But this work is never done here as they have found to their horror (but not surprise) that as they clean up a site, garbage and construction material get dumped again. But as I see it, the gains are not good enough\u2014we need a time in winter when the air is clean; our skies are blue; and, our lungs are clear. And this year, the pandemic is working against us. Already the public transport is abysmally inadequate in our city and region. But with the fear of the virus, we are not taking the bus or the metro railway; we are jumping into private transport\u2014vehicle sales are defying all economic slowdown indicators. This rush of traffic is a key cause of air pollution\u2014let's not lose sight of this. Dust exacerbates the problem, but vehicles create it. So, this will work against us during the winter months. That's why we must realise that the region needs transformational action proportionate to the scale of the crisis. When we moved to compressed natural gas ( cng), it was absolute; quick; and, big. We cannot attain clean air by tinkering around with small ideas and small execution. I will discuss, once again, the actions that need to be done, now and not tomorrow, for us to secure our right to clean air. Till then, hold your breath. It's unsafe out there.

Coal is, indeed, a dirty fuel with toxic elements. Fluoride content in coal ranges between 20 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg. The environments in areas where coal is burnt are severely contaminated with fluoride and other toxicants. The Korba Coalfield in Chhattisgarh is a classic example. Millions of tonnes of coal are burnt here to generate electricity. This has made the coal basin one of the most polluted areas in India. Air, water and food are so polluted with fluoride that humans and the other animals living around the coal basin are affected by chronic endemic fluorosis due to excessive intake of the toxic element. JAYDEV JANA KOLKATAAgro reforms we need This is with reference to the article \"India's agrarian distress: A paradigm shift\", published online on September 25, 2020. As a farmer, I get free electricity from the Tamil Nadu government for my pump sets. But I feel guilty every time I switch them on. No doubt that farmers need to be supported through various infrastructure facilities and that support schemes should be devised without losing focus on the long-term interest of farmers and the long-term sustainability of farming. Free electricity must be provided up to a certain limit, and a fine must be levied for every unit consumed above that limit, after due consultation with farmers and other stakeholders. As a constructive and proactive measure, free electricity should be phased out. This, of course, requires political will. The government needs to generate awareness about the potential of drip irrigation, besides providing incentives for the same. Rainwater harvesting should be made mandatory for farmers who enjoy free electricity. Incentives should be provided for growing alterna - tive but essential crops like pulses and oilseeds, which consume only a 10th of the water needed for water-guzzling crops like rice. We import huge quantities of pulses and edible oils, which are a drain on our foreign exchange reserve. Before announcing such proposals, awareness needs to be created through electronic, print and social media about the long-term implications of overuse of groundwater. Without such proactive preparatory work, any reform would be difficult to implement.

The writer has probably never visited a village located deep inside a forest. The notion that we should let the tribal people remain part of the forest ecosystem stems from \"post-colonial guilt syndrome\" that organisations suffer from. Given an option, most tribal people would prefer to live in a proper village, with access to all amenities, and not in a far away forest hamlet that feels like heaven only if your belly is full.

BRAD VIA EMAIL Farming under new laws Tractor trolleys full of paddy have been arriving at the grain market in Hodal city of Haryana's Palwal district for about 20 days, but procurement at minimum support price (MSP) has not yet started. The government recently enacted new agricultural laws under which farmers are allowed to sell their produce anywhere in the country. But at the six-decade-old Hodal mandi , neither wheat from Uttar Pradesh, nor paddy from Haryana is being purchased, forcing farmers to sell the grains to arhatiya s (commission agents) at 30 per cent below MSP .

Government agencies have deployed anti-smog guns, like this one at a construction site on the Delhi-Haryana border, across the city to curb heavy pollutants like dust. Anti-smog guns spray tiny water droplets that mix with air-borne pollutants and bring them to the ground.WHAT'S INSIDE capitalists one of the oldest tribal communities of Assam, are a rare popula - tion group that escaped the stifling eco - nomic impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. \"We didn't feel the economic pressures, \" says Pabitra Mili, a member of the Mish - ing community from Baligaon Miri village in Sonitpur district. What came to the community's res - cue is the revival of an ancient food forest practice just a few months before the pandemic's outbreak. Generally known as agroforestry, this is a form of farming where trees, shrubs, herbs, and vegeta - bles are grown together in a group mim - icking a forest and each plant provides the others benefits like shade, protection from predators, life-giving humidity and nutrients. In 2019, Pabitra set about to revive this forestry practice in his village to augment residents' income. A non- profit Balipara Foundation with expertise on income-generation programmes for tribal communities helped him. \"The non-profit helped us identify the crops ideal for our soil. I started promot - ing the concept among the 350 families in my village, \" he says. By November last year, over 150 families were practising agroforestry. Though the initiative was to ensure a steady flow of income for the families, it eventually became the reason the village survived the economic onslaught of the pandemic. Earlier, the community, known for their exquisite weaving skills, grew a single crop in a season. But agroforestry is meant to diverse one's food options thus ensur - ing food security round the year. \"When the country was under complete lockdown, we harvested sweet potatoes, chillies, brinjal, turmeric and ginger, \" says he. The lockdown dis - rupted supply chain across the country. But with diverse and locally harvested foods, the village didn't feel the pinch. By June, some 200 residents work - ing outside returned to the village as businesses shut down. \"We took it as an opportunity to involve them in expand - ing our agroforestry, \" says Pabitra. He initiated a plantation drive of commer - cially lucrative species like bamboo and amla on June 27 on village lands. Since then, over 100,000 saplings have been planted. Around this, the master weavers Mishings have already a plan to manage the economic benefits. The village's youth club has been assigned to collect forest produce, fruits and bamboo to sell and use the fund for local developments. Residents' income has nearly doubled. Success breeds success. On August 19, they set up a community seed nursery. \"We are also trying to grow a local wild variety of mushroom. It is a part of our diet but finding it has always been difficult, \" says Pabitra. That will be the future money-spinner. The most definitive indicator of this experiment's economic sustainability is that those who returned to village being jobless now don't want to migrate again. \"By 2021, we expect that all the 350 families in the village would be join agroforestry, \" says Pabitra. \"Baligaon Miri experiment is a successful example of natural capital regeneration, \" says Saurav Malhotra, the brain behind the Balipara Founda - tion's Rural Futures programme. Natural capital indeed is the biggest income generator for rural Indians. A village in Assam escapes unemployment and food scarcity by reviving an ancient food forestry practice RAJIT SENGUPTA LATEST report of the United Nations says that gender equality in the world remains a far-fetched goal. No country has achieved it so far, ac - cording to the UN's report titled World's Women: Trends and Statistics on the State of Global Gender Equality . The attitudes of discrimina - tion have slowly changed in the last two decades, Liu Zhenmin, chief of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA ), said in a statement. But there are plenty of chal - lenges: Gender gap in the labour market, for example, has not changed a bit since 1995. While the status of women has improved with regard to education, early marriage, childbearing and maternal mortality, the prog - ress has stagnated in other areas, the DESA chief said. The report provides a reality-check on the global status of women 25 years since the world adopted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. It also shows how the novel coro -navirus disease ( COVID -19) pandemic impacted the lives of women and deepened underlying inequalities in societies around the world. It presents the global state of gender equality in six critical areas: population and families, health, education, economic empowerment and asset ownership, power and decision-making, and violence against women and the girl child as well as the impact of COVID -19.RECENTLY, THE Ministry of Finance recommended that the Union environment ministry should \"disengage\" from five autonomous institutions under it including the Wildlife Institute of India ( wii). It proposed wii's funding to be reduced by 25 per cent each year and turn the institute into a deemed university. On October 15, the Director of wii sent a sos message to the environment ministry. \"The functioning of wii will not be viable without the support of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change ( moefcc),\" wrote Dhananjai Mohan, wii's director. The letter, accessed by Down To Earth , was against the proposed disengagement of wii\u2014an autonomous institution under moefcc. The proposal is part of the finance ministry's pathways to rationalise functioning of autonomous bodies under moefcc. The report was submitted on September 30. Mohan addressed the letter to moefcc Joint Director, Wildlife Division, R Gopinath. It said the institute has 112 serving employees and 65 pensioners, and that it gets annual expenditure of R34 crore in grant-in- aid from the ministry. The institute raises a meagre R3.5 crore a year on account of its consultancy and advisory services to various departments. This amount is used to cover pension liabilities of its employees appointed before April 1, 2004 , but it is currently insufficient. The letter added that raising funds from the institute's two Masters' programmes\u2014 one in Wildlife Science and another in Heritage Management and Conservation\u2014with a maximum intake of 20 students each every alternate year would not be possible without the ministry's support. The institute had approached the University Grants Commission to seek the \"deemed university \" status, but was refused on various grounds. A call against the wild ISHAN KUKRETI AFTER / CSEIndia has two- thirds of world basmati export market share, while the rest is with Pakistan PAKISTAN HAS decided to contest India's application for an exclusive Geographical Indications (GI) tag to Indian- origin basmati rice with the EU's Council on Quality Schemes for Agricultural and Foodstuffs. If India's application is accepted, Pakistan would be effectively kept out of the European market for basmati rice even though it is a major producer. Pakistani farmers earn up to $1 billion a year from exporting basmati , a significant part of it from the EU markets. India has two-thirds of the world basmati export market share, while the rest is with Pakistan. GI is a special trademark that recognises a product's origin, uni- que qualities and thus, reputation. This tagging fetches exclusive mar- ket globally, thus revenue. basmati is cultivated widely in the Indo- Gangetic plains shared by India and Pakistan. India's Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (apeda ) has given GI for basmati in Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. On October 5, Razak Dawood, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's top advisor on commerce, met a delegation of the secretary of commerce, chairperson of Intellec- tual Property Organisation, a horde of top lawyers and representatives of Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan. Media reports said that As India-Pakistan enter into an intense battle over Basmati's geographical exclusivity, the producers are abandoning this crop. Why? BHAGIRATH, RAJU SAJWAN and VIVEK MISHRA in HARYANA PM27/10/20 meeting ended with a decision to contest India's exclusive claim over basmati in the EU. Down To Earth spoke to Abdul Qayyum Parcha, chairperson of the Pakistan Rice Export Association. He refused to comment saying, \"The matter is very sensitive. We are not speaking to Pakistani media as well.\" The Dawn magazine quoted Dawood saying, \"Pakistan will vehemently oppose India's application in the EU and restrain New Delhi from obtaining an exclusive GI tag of basmati rice.\" Pakistan has till December 10 to contest this application. How- ever, it seems to be a difficult task given the preparation needed for pursuing such a case. As a prere- quisite, EU regulations require third-party countries to have their own GI laws in place that protect the product in question. Pakistan is yet to implement its intellectual property laws enacted in March this year. In a conversation with Down to Earth , Som Parkash, Union minister for commerce and industry, said he was unaware of the Indo-Pak fight over the GI tag for basmati . He hails from Punjab, a major basmati Rao Telangana Uni- versity, says India has a strong dna- based foundation for claiming the GIs and thus the scientific evidence to claim so in EU. UNTIMELY BRAWL India's application for the exclusive tag for basmati in the European market comes at a time when its export has been badly hit. In 2017- 18, EU changed its regulations on chemical residues in agricultural products. In India's basmati rice EU agencies found higher levels of tricylazole, a pesticide used for controlling fungal pests. India lost substantial market for its basmati . Pakistan took over this space, almost doubling its export of basmati in just two years since 2017. India wants to regain the market by exercising exclusive GI for basmati for the EU market. Basmati is an export-oriented product. basmati production in India has doubled in the last two decades with the help of improved seeds. Last year, India earned the highest foreign exchange from basmati export among all agricultural products. In 2019-20 India produced 7.5 million tonnes of basmati , of which 61 per cent was exported. According to the Directorate General of Commercial Information and Statistics, Mini- stry of Commerce and Industry, it fetched R31,025 crore. In April- June this year, India earned R8,698 crore from exporting 1.28 million tonnes of basmati . In Pakistan also it is a major export item. According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data, Pakistan exported 0.89 million tonnes of basmati in 2019- 20. In the international market, Pakistan is a direct competitor for India. However, Indian basmati is sold at double the rate of those of Pakistan-origin. OUT OF FAVOUR But this lucrative crop doesn't excite farmers in India anymore. Nawab Singh, a basmati farmer in Haryana's Panipat district doesn't ANAND CHAUDHARY is a happy basmati resident of Gadwa village in Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich, Chaudhary has taken up basmati crops in 60 bighas . He seems to be assured of a good price for his crops, unlike farmers in other states. He is part of an informal market system called \"Private MSP (minimum support price)\", prevalent in this region. Under this system, private companies dealing with basmati rice assure farmers a minimum rate under which they would not procure. This is called informally the \"Private MSP\". This year, the private MSP has been kept at R2,850/100 kg of basmati . It all began in 2018 when a Gurugram-based company selling basmati and non- basmati rice under the brand name, Daawat, spoke to farmers in eight villages who were concerned about the price fluctuations and wanted to quit basmati cultivation. The company gave a written assurance of the minimum support price. However, it doesn't mean that the company would not pay above the private MSP. In the last two years, farmers here have been paid above R3,000/100 kg. Farmers find this pricing mechanism assuring because in neighbouring states like Haryana they are at the mercy of the market. In case the price goes below the assured level, they still they have a decent earning. \"I am assured of a price; they take my produce from my field; and I continue to cultivate basmati assuring the company,\" says Anand. Anand was the first farmer who tied up with a private company in 2008. Later 39 more farmers joined the company. Now the number of farmers joining the company in the village has come to around 100. Gadwa village takes up basmati cultivation in one-fourth of its total cultivable land. It expects to harvest about 300 tonnes of basmati this year. Out of this, the company has assured to procure 250 tonnes. Most of the basmati rice from this village is exported by the company. To retain the group of farmers with it, the company has also created a corpus fund jointly managed by the farmers. The money from this corpus fund is used by farmers for land development, and to buy other implements.A case for private MSP DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 13 27/10/20 4:02 PM27/10/20 4:02 PMAGRICULTURE /BASMATI RICE know his produce carries the GI tag. He is not aware of the fight between India and Pakistan over the billion dollar international market. But he is sure: \"I have decided to quit basmati farming.\" For generations his family has been cultivating basmati . This year he took up cultivation in 4.4 hectares (ha). In the first week of October, he had already harvested 3,100 kg of basmati . But when he went to sell his produce in the nearby Samalkha Mandi (grain market), the price for basmati rice was near to general paddy. \"I had to sell at R2,151/100 kg.\" At this rate, for every acre of basmati cultivation he lost R12,000. This is the fifth consecutive year the market price has been dipping. And the current market rate is the lowest in his living memory. \"How can I sustain this loss?\" he asks. Irrespective of the tag of excellence attached to it outside his village Haldana, here is a farmer who has quit farming this crop. Like in Haryana, basmati culti- vators in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi are unable to cope with the mounting losses from the crops. In Delhi's Najafgarh Mandi, bas- mati is being at R1,800- R1,500-1,600. In 2014, basmati sold above R4,500/100 kg in all these states (see \"Harvesting losses\"). Shamsher Singh, a basmati cultivator of Dindwadi village in Haryana, has decided to switch over to general paddy. He has a reason. For his basmati crops, he was offered R1,700/100 kg. Govern- ment's Minimum Support Price (msp) for general rice is R1,888/100 kg this year. Dayanand, a farmer from Ghummanahera village in Delhi, says, \"The cost of cultivation is increasing year after year, while the price is continuously dipping.\" LOSS IN EXPORT MARKET The price dip is directly attributed to shrinking global market. This also explains the tough fight between India and Pakistan over the European basmati market. Ritesh Sharma, scientist at the Basmati Export Development Foundation ( bedf), says export to Iran, one of the biggest buyers of Indian Basmati, has come down by 63 per cent in comparison to last year. This is due to the US sanctions on trade with Iran. Iran imported 34 per cent of India's total basmati production. apeda in its May 2020 market intelligence report also hinted at reduction in export to Saudi Arabia, the second largest importer of Indian basmati . Loss in export means rice mills in India are buying less from farmers. Maha Singh, founder of Aadhati and Malik Enterprises in Panipat Grain Mandi, says, \"Expor- ters have not paid mill owners. So, they have reduced purchase of basmati from local cultivators.\" So, low demands have led to a crash in Harvesting losses In just seven years, the price of basmati has almost halved 2020 2018 2015 2019 2017 2016 2014Based on sale records of Dayanand, a Delhi-based basmati farmer `2,400`3,100`3,400 `3,600`3,800`3,900`4,600Rate/100 kg \"THE COST TO CULTIVATE IS RISING YEAR AFTER YEAR, WHILE THE PRICE IS CONTINUOUSLY DECREASING\" \u2014 Dayanand A farmer from Ghummanahera village near Delhi \"I HAVE QUIT BASMATI FARMING.

The pandemic impacted the local demands also as hotels and restaurants remained closed for months and are yet to come back to normal operations. NEW ENTRANTS There is another threat looming over basmati cultivators in the states covered under the GI tag. Madhya Pradesh (MP) with over 80,000 basmati farmers has been demanding 13 of its districts to be brought under the GI tag zones. Farmers in MP started cultivating the Pusa 1121 variety\u2014considered a prime one among the basmati varieties\u2014only in 2006. The state applied for the GI tag in 2017-18. However, the Registrar of Geogra- phical Indications rejected it. After that, the state appealed for the same in the a Madras court but was unable to get a favourable order. In May this year, MP filed a petition in the Supreme Court for the same. The state argues that its farmers are not getting the right price for basmati for not having the GI tag. Both apeda and Indian Council of Agricultural Research opposed this citing the GI tag comes with specified and unique climatic and geographical features that are not found in MP. Agriculture scientist Krishna Murthy says that the famed aromatic feature of basmati is due to the specific climatic condit- ions of the zones earmarked under the GI tag. \"Madhya Pradesh or any other state does not have such climate, there may be a decrease in basmati properties and this will have a great impact in branding,\" he says. Rice exporters also protes- ted against giving the GI tag to MP as they found the basmati from this state inferior in quality compared to produce of Haryana and Punjab. Also in MP basmati rice is sold much cheaper than in other states. This would distort the market and will lead to loss for farmers. It turned into a full-blown inter- state fight. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August: \"GI tagging of basmati (from affect the state's agriculture and India's basmati exports.\" He even said that bestowing GI tag to MP would benefit Pakistan. Vijay Setia, former president of the All India Rice Exporters Association says there are two reasons for this. First, when the European Union ( eu) asked India to identify the GI areas growing basmati in 2006, India said it was surveying its areas and ultimately identified seven states. Similarly, Pakistan had to also identify areas and informed eu, but it didn't have the laws at that point of time. Now if India adds another state to its list, Pakistan would add more areas; now that it has laws as per the requirements. Farmer leader Leeladhar of Hoshangabad in MP says quality of basmati in the state is better than Punjab and Haryana, but due to lack of GI tag, farmers don't get fair price. He alleges that farmers from Punjab and Haryana buy basmati rice from MP and sell it in international markets using the GI tag advantage. On the other hand, Harendra Lakhowal, leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in Punjab, says if MP basmati gets the GI tag, then farmers of Punjab will suffer. It is apparent basmati in Punjab will be soon be sold at R1,200-1,300 per 100 kg, and farmers will have be bear heavy losses. DTE @down2earthindiaSTUDIES SHOW that basmati cultivation has less adversarial impacts on the environment than other rice varieties. A study by researchers Sukhpal Singh, Parminder Kaur, Jatinder Sachdev and Sumit University, published in the January- March 2017 in the Indian Journal of Economic and Development , suggests that it uses less chemical fertilisers than other crops. Their study shows that 194.99 kg of fertiliser is used in 0.4 hectare (ha) of basmati cultivation, while 282.93 kg per 0.4 ha of wheat cultivation, 249.48 kg per 0.4 ha of coarse rice cultivation and 550.32 kg of fertiliser for 0.4 ha of potato is consumed. Water use in basmati cultivation is also less than that of coarse rice. According to the study, cultivation of coarse rice in 0.4 ha consumes 11,000- 13,000 cubic metres of water, while in basmati it consumes 8,000-9,000 cubic metres. From this perspective, basmati is an environmental-friendly crop compared to coarse rice. Navtej Sing Bains, Director of Research, Punjab Agricultural University, told Down to Earth that basmati rice has many properties. For example, this can be the first in the direction of crop diversification, and 15-20 per cent of water can be saved compared to normal paddy. At the same time, consumption of urea can also be halved. Its residue is used in dry fodder kaafai which is very helpful in paddy residue management. At present, basmati grows in 20 per cent of rice area in Punjab. The most important thing is that most of the straw stems from basmati are used as fodder. So, stubble burning is absent. Dayanand explains that he harvests by hand instead of machine. This leaves very little starch and the remaining ones are easily sold. He says that the stubble produced in a 0.4 ha farmland is sold for around R5,000. This reduces the cost of harvesting.Less impact on environment DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 DOWN TO 15 TO EARTH 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INIndia's first-ever Time Use Survey throws light on how women's hard work goes unrecognised.

These, along with other unfit vehic- les, will cause huge pollution and environmental damage, while the number of new vehicles continues to explode. Since 2016 the Union govern- ment is debating a scrappage policy to weed out old and polluting vehicles and to set up formal systems for safe disposal and recovery of reusable material from the clunker. This fleet moder- nisation strategy is expected to create a market for new vehicles and work for emissions gains. But the draft scrappage policy of the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (morth) awaits approval from the Cabinet. While the fine print of the policy is not known yet, there is a strong interest in levera- ging this policy for green recovery. Fleet renewal is an opportunity today because the Bharat Stage VI ( bs-vi) emissions standards and electric vehicle incentives are in place, and polluted cities have planned a phase-out of old vehicles as part of their clean air action plans under the National Clean Air Programme. The extent of the environmental and emissions benefit will depend on the design of this programme. WHAT IS AT STAKE? It is not easy to estimate the number of old/end-of-life vehicles, and their pollution load in India because vehicle registration data- base is cumulative and not corrected for retirement, change of ownership and scrappage. A 2016 joint study by the Central Pollution Control Board ( cpcb) and giz, a German government enter- prise for international cooperation, estimated that as of 2015, there were more than 8.7 million end-of- life vehicles, and this number would increase to 21.8 million by 2025. Fortunately, India does not depend on import of used vehicles because local laws do not permit vehicles that do not comply with the local standards. But vehicles in the domestic market often change hands and are used more intensely. Several studies have, there- fore, relied on parking lot and fuel retail outlet surveys to assess the age profile of vehicles. cpcb carried out such surveys in 2015 in six cities and found that 13 per cent of trucks, 8 per cent of buses, 5 per cent of three-wheelers, 3 per cent of cars and 7 per cent of two- wheelers were above the 15-year age (see 'Ageing fleet' on p20). Moreover, if a broad retirement curve of 20 years for vehicles is considered, then, as of 2018, about 69 per cent of the registered vehicles are likely to have survived. Delhi's transport dep- artment, based on the vahan database of morth, estimates that there ought to be about 4 million junk vehicles. But these are not easily traceable. GROSSLY POLLUTING The cause of worry is that the old and legacy vehicles, though small in number, contribute dispropor- tionately high to the vehicular pollution load. In its consultation note of 2018, morth stated that although commercial vehicles (such as trucks, buses, taxies and three- wheelers) constitute just about 5 per cent of the total fleet, they contribute 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the vehicular pollution. Of these, the older commercial vehicles, typi- cally manufactured before 2000, account for 15 per cent of the total vehicular pollution. They pollute 10 to 25 times more than a modern vehicle. A 2013 study by US- based non-profit International Council on Clean Transpo- rtation estimated that in 2011, pre-2003 vehicles were about 23 per cent of the fleet but were responsible for about half of the particulate emi- ssions. A multi-city study by the Indian Institute of Technology ( iit) Bombay in 2014 estimated that pre-2005 vehicles were responsible for 70 per cent of the total pollution load from vehicles. Old heavy-duty diesel vehicles meeting bs-i emissions are design- ed to emit 36 times higher particul- ate matter compared to modern bs-vi vehicle (see 'Out of times' on p20). If these vehicles are not properly disposed off and are junked only in a few cities, they will crowd in other areas and transfer the pollution load. Scrappage programme, therefore, requires a national framework AWAITING SCRAP POLICY The original draft of the scrappage policy in 2018 is reported to have focused on fleet renewal for SINCE 2016, THE UNION GOVERNMENT IS DEBATING A SCRAPPAGE POLICY TO WEED OUT OLD AND POLLUTING VEHICLES AND SET UP FORMAL SYSTEMS FOR SAFE DISPOSAL AND RECOVERY OF REUSABLE MATERIAL FROM THE CLUNKER DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 19 27/10/20 4:02 PM27/10/20 /SCRAPPAGE POLICY commercial vehicles, especially old heavy-duty vehicles, with a propo- sed age cap of 20 years. Reportedly, about 0.28 million vehicles were to be scrapped with monetary incenti- ves to reduce the cost of new vehicles by about 15 per cent. The scheme is expected to combine voluntary incentives from the industry. The fiscal stimulus programme needs to prioritise old trucks, diesel buses, light commercial vehicles and three-wheelers, especially diesel three-wheelers, for fleet renewal (pre- bs-iii) because these are the most polluting segments. Specifically for trucks, it needs to adopt a combined strategy of mandatory age limit of 20 years and a voluntary retirement pro- gramme for trucks older than 10 years\u2014with the incentives tied to the age of the vehicle being scrapped or prioritised for vehicles registered in polluted cities. Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and several other cities have included old vehicle phase-out in their clean air plans. There is also a need to consider options to phase out other category of vehicles and to replace these with electric-vehicles for a bigger trans- formation of the fleet. Electric vehicle policy of Delhi government has strategically linked scrappage incentives with electric vehicle programme to enable 25 per cent electrification of the vehicle fleet by 2024, says Manisha Saxena, secretary-cum-commissioner of the Delhi- nct transport department. However, Sohinder Gill, direc- tor general, Society of Manufactu- rers of Electric Vehicles, holds that, \"It might be premature to link scrappage policy with electric vehicles now and, therefore, incen- tivising only scrapping of old vehicles should be preferred over replacement with new vehicles.\" NEED SCRAPPAGE INFRA In the meantime, growing num- bers of ageing vehicles and their unsafe dismantling is causing huge wastage of material and contaminating water, soil and air, thereby increasing public health risk. Estimates by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( ficci) show steel content in end-of-life vehicles can be as high as 65 to 70 per cent, and there is a strong potential for indu- stry to upscale its waste recycling. The ferrous metal scrap market is growing at 7 to 9 per cent annually, says Vijay Arora, director, buses and trucks are over 15 years old Old vehicle were built to meet the prevalent emission norms, which were laxer PM emission limits for heavy-duty engines (trucks/buses)36 times higher than BS-VI 15 times higher than BS-VI 10 times higher 2 times higherTwo-wheelers India 2000 BS-II BS-III (2010) BS-IV (2017) BS-VI (2020)Car Bus Truck Three-wheelers100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0.40 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 0In % PM in g/kWh 0-5 Y O* 5-10 Y O 10-15 Y O 15-20 Y O More than 20 Y O * Years old Note: Vehicle Status of Pollution Generated from Road Transport in Six Mega Cities (2015) by Central Pollution Control Board Source: Automotive Research Association of India Emissions Booklet 20 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN Pvt Ltd, which is authorised by the government to dismantle and recycle vehicles. But safe disposal and metal recovery from junk vehicles will require extensive network of well- equipped scrappage facilities. Curr- ently, informal recyclers serve this sector and do an efficient job but often without adequate environmen- tal safeguards. This made recycling areas, like Mayapuri in Delhi, target of local protest and judicial action. As the informal sector is an important source of livelihood and is cost-effective, it needs support to meet cpcb's Guidelines for Environ- mentally Sound Facilities for Hand- ling, Processing and Recycling of End-of-Life Vehi-cles, 2019. Only recently, the formal scrappage industry has started to take shape, with Mahindra, Toyota and Tata coming forward. But without a legal mandate for scrappage these expensive facilities do not get critical mass of business and are grossly underutilised. Additionally, trade in used spare parts needs to gain legitimacy to encourage this business, says P K Banerjee, executive director (technical) Society of Indian Autom- obile Manufacturers, a body repre- senting all vehicle manufacturers in India. As the organised scrappage business grows, there is also a need to integrate informal dismantlers to protect livelihoods by providing support for pollution control infra- structure and hazard management. LEGAL TANGLE The legal definition of end-of-life vehicles is still not well laid out. Section 59 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, provides for \"power to fix the age limit of motor vehicles\". The Union government is also empowered to restrict plying of vehicles considering the safety and life of motor vehicles. cpcb's 2019 guidelines define end-of-life vehi- cles as those that are abandoned or impounded, are without valid regi- stration, or flout age cap enforced by the authorities. These provisions are expected to guide state-level policies. Anil Srivastava, principal consultant and mission director, National Mission on Transformative Mobil- ity and Battery Storage, niti Aayog, recommends age should not be the only criteria, and fitness and road- worthiness of vehicles (tested at inspection centres) should also be considered. Already, judicial interventions in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai, and several other cities have fixed the age of commercial vehicles at 15 years. Their permit conditions are linked to age, re-registration and taxes that vary across states. Some states, like Maharashtra and Karnataka, have imposed higher green taxes on older vehicles. MAKERS' RESPONSIBILITY Vehicle manufacturers have to play a crucial role to ensure that the maximum material they use to make vehicles is recyclable at the end of its life. India has already drafted the Automotive Industrial Standard-129 ( ais-129) on reuse, recycling and material recovery from vehicles in 2015. This requires 80 to 85 per cent of material used in vehicle manufacturing by mass to be recoverable/recyclable/reus- DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 DOWN TO 21 27/10/20 4:02 PM27/10/20 4:02 PMAIR /SCRAPPAGE POLICY able at the end of the vehicle's life. ais-129 has also restricted the use of heavy metals, including lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, and asked that plastics be coded (for grade, quality) to help dismantlers reuse and recycle it effectively. But these rules are still voluntary and there is no information on the compliance with this standard to prevent more waste finding way to landfills. ais-129 should be made manda- tory for vehicle manufacturers for it work effectively. The manufacturers must maximise recyclability and adopt alternative design, says Neelkanth Marathe, officiating director, Automotive Research Association of India, an autonomous research body affiliated to the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises. Stronger requir- ements may increase metal use and reduce plastics. The big omission in ais- 129 is of the mandate for Extended Producer Responsibility ( epr). epr regulations are essential to ensure that manufacturers are responsible for safe disposal of the waste from their products. ais-129 says it has excluded this provision as \"unviable\" in an emerging market such as India. But European regulations include erp in addition to the 85 to 95 per cent recoverability by mass that includes energy reco- very (through incineration) as well. Indian regulations have also kept goods vehicles outside the scope of these rules. GLOBAL LEARNING CURVE Globally, scrappage incentives aim for the cleanest, most fuel- efficient and latest emissions standards while stimulating the market. A 2020 World Bank policy brief states that the 2009 US programme \"Cash for Clunkers\", which provided incentives for rep- lacing old gas-guzzling vehicles with new and fuel efficient models, created or saved 42,000 auto- industry-related jobs in the second half of 2009. It also resulted in a fuel-efficiency improvement of 61 per cent. It is notable that despite the current economic slowdown, Euro- pean countries\u2014Germany, Italy, France and Spain\u2014have linked stimulus packages with electric mobility programmes for a green recovery. The design of the programme matters for real emissions benefits. Peter Mock, EU managing director of Interna- tional Council on Clean Transpo- rtation, an international non- profit, demonstrates this in the case of carbon dioxide emissions. If older cars are replaced with standard 2020 Euro VI cars, reduction is a mere 1 per cent; if replaced with vehicles meeting targeted carbon dioxide emissions, reduction is about 28 per cent. (European Union regulates the car market through two emission reduction regime. One is reduction in pollutants such as particulate matter, NOx which are governed by Euro IV, V, IV. Second is carbon dioxide emission targets). But maximum emissions reduction is possible\u2014as much as 62 per cent\u2014if the older fleet is replaced with electric cars. Globally, governments are also adopting supportive strategies of labelling and restraining older vehicles in low emissions zones and phasing out diesel cars. Japan requires vehicle owners to pay recycling fee at the time of vehicle purchase and inspection. California's programme considers equity and provides highest ince- ntive to lower income groups to upgrade vehicles to cleanest tech- nologies, or gives the option of public transit passes based on scrappage to encourage use of public transport. A big lesson for India is that the EU Commission is evaluating and revising the End-of-Life Vehicles Direct- ive 2000/53/EC in 2020 to track the \"unknown where- of end-of-life vehicles\" that often get traded ille- gally. The EU Commission is creating a legal framework to effectively track and steer all end-of-life vehicles into authorised treatment facilities and through national vehicle registration systems so that the vehicles can be tracked and those meant for safe disposal through end of life centres are not sold as second hand vehicles. India too needs a clear legal mandate and incentives for rapid fleet renewal based on bs-vi stand- ards and zero emissions require- ments to maximise public health benefits and material recovery. This is needed for green recovery and to provide a long-term policy framework for environmentally sound end-of-life management practices.

Environmental risks now top the risks agenda. Himalaya has always worked towards preventing the loss of biodiversity and has been committed to preserving nature. We have rolled out many initiatives in this direction, and our tree plantation drives are the most crucial part of this endeavor. Till date, we have planted 7,90,000 saplings across the Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, and Khasi Hills. We work at the grassroots level by collaborating with partner organizations like Society for Environment and Biodiversity Conservation (SEBC), SYNJUK, and the local communities and other stakeholders to help us understand the terrain better to plant indigenous species and ensure the survival of 75% of the saplings. Forest reforestation is vital to mitigate the current threat of rising greenhouse gases, climate change, and the loss of biodiversity. Through these efforts, Himalaya is focusing on creating a sustainable future.TREE PLANTATION a glimmer Epidemic of chronic diseases, social inequalities and covid -19 will worsen the future of global health VIBHA VARSHNEY NEW DELHI AS IF the covid -19 pandemic was not enough, there is more bad news on the health front. The latest Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, prepared by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a US-based research centre, shows that people are now living in poorer health for more years than ever before. Between 1990 and 2019, disability due to poor health has risen from 21 per cent of total disease burden to about 34 per cent. The researchers link this to the fact that though life exp- ectancy has increased by 10 years across the world, the increase in healthy life expectancy\u2014the num- ber of years a person can expect to have good health\u2014has risen by only 6.5 years during this period. The group analysed 286 causes of death, 369 diseases and injuries, and 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories, and found that increasing incidences of chronic diseases is behind the rise in years lived with disability. In 11 countries, more than half of all health loss (measured by disability- adjusted life-years or dalys that combines the years lost due to disability, illnesses and early death) is due to non-communicable dise- ases ( ncds) and injuries. Only six countries have seen the numbers of years spent in poor health decrease between 1990 and 2019. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in exposure to risks like obesity, high blood sugar, consumption of alcohol and use of drugs. For instance, metabolic risks (high body mass index or bmi, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol) have risen by 1.5 per cent a year since 2010. Metabolic risks accounted for nearly 20 per cent of total health loss worldwide in 2019\u201450 per cent higher than in 1990. They are also responsible for a huge number of deaths globally\u2014high blood press- 24 DOWN TO EARTH NOVEMBER 27/10/20 4:02 PM27/10/20 4:02 PMure contributed to one in five deaths (almost 11 million) in 2019; high blood sugar to 6.5 million; high bmi to 5 million; and high cholesterol to 4.4 million deaths. \"Most of the risk factors are preventable and treatable, and tackling them will bring huge social and economic benefits. We are failing to change unhealthy beha- viours, particularly those related to diet quality, calorie intake and physical activity, in part due to inadequate policy attention and funding for public health and beha- vioural research,\" says Christopher Murray, director, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (ihme), University of Washington, usa, who led the research. Unfortunately, there is often a bitter opposition by industry if efforts to control risk factors such as high sugar foods or red meat are taken. The industry suggests that as the food per se is not bad, the decision of consumption and the amounts consumed should be left to people. However, providing inform- ation has not been found enough. \"Given that individual choices are influenced by financial considerat- ions, education and the availability of alternatives, governments should collaborate globally on initiatives to make healthier behaviour possible for everyone. At a time when there is a major risk to population health from factors such as obesity, government should draw lessons from the decades of tobacco control programmes and take action through regulation, taxation and, maybe, subsidies,\" says Emmanuela Gakidou of ihme. Another major aspect revealed by the report is that most of the improvement in health indicators in recent years has occurred in children. The top 10 contributors to disease burden over the past 30 years include six causes that largely affect older adults\u2014ischaemic heart disease (with numbers of related dalys increasing by 50 per cent between 1990 and 2019), diabetes (up by 148 per cent), stroke (32 per cent), chronic kidney disease (93 per cent), lung cancer (69 per cent) and age-related hearing loss (83 per cent). The fact that elderly have poor health indicators has fuelled covid -19 deaths. SOCIAL INEQUALITIES The report points out that social and economic development is impor- tant to overall health and there is a need for a much broader approach that pays more attention to all the drivers of population health. \"Given the overwhelming impact of social and economic development on health progress, doubling down on policies and strategies that stimulate economic growth, expand access to schooling, and improve the status of women, should be our collective priority,\" says Murray. The report suggests that urgent action is needed to address the global syndemic of chronic diseases, social inequalities, and covid -19 to ensure more robust health systems and healthier people, making countries more resilient to future pandemic threats. \" covid -19 is an acute-on-chronic health emergency. And the chronicity of the present crisis is being ignored at our future peril. ncds have played a critical role in driving more than 1 million deaths caused by covid -19 to date, and will continue to shape health in every country after the pandemic subsides. As we address how to regenerate our health systems in the wake of covid -19, this Global Burden of Disease study offers a means of targeting where the need is greatest, and how it differs between countries,\" says Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet , which published the report. No country would benefit more from urgent action than India where 58 per cent of the total disease burden now is due to ncds, up from 29 per cent in 1990. Premature deaths due to ncds have more than doubled from 22 per cent to 50 per cent. This is despite the fact that India has been active in trying to reduce the burden of ncds for a long time now. In 2010, the Union government launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke. In line with who's Global Action Plan (2013- 2020) to prevent and control ncds, India was the first country to develop specific national targets and indicators aimed to reduce the number of premature deaths from ncds by 25 per cent by 2025. Then the National Multi-sectoral Action Plan for Prevention and Control of common ncds (2017-2022) provides a clear blueprint to tackle ncds. POOR IMPLEMENTATION On the ground, implementation has been poor and the current pandemic has worsened the situation now and for the future. \"In Haryana, there is a huge shortfall in targets of opportunistic screening for ncds, a NCDs HAVE LED TO MORE THAN 1 MILLION DEATHS CAUSED BY COVID-19 AND WILL CONTINUE TO SHAPE HEALTH IN EVERY COUNTRY EVEN AFTER THE PANDEMIC EBBSDISEASE BURDEN \\HEALTH DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 DOWN TO Global diseases.indd 25 27/10/20 4:02 PM27/10/20 PMHEALTH /DISEASE BURDEN key strategy of the National Progra- mme for Prevention and Control of Cancer that has been affected by the ongoing covid -19 crisis,\" says Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson, the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. The current situation has compromised primary healthcare and we need \"catch-up rounds\" of screening for both diagnosis and recognition of complications that may have ensued in the past six months. \"We also need focused analysis of long-term public health effects, including worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health. All these can lead to greater excess mortality in the months and years ahead,\" he adds. One of the biggest weaknesses in dealing with chronic diseases is India's failure to invest adequately on ncds. As per a commentary in Nature Asia on May 14, 2019, though India has been the largest recipient of overseas development assistance for health, little of it has been spent on ncd prevention and control. As a result, ncd care slipped into the domain of the profit-driven private healthcare industry, it says. There is also a paucity of estima- tes on the government spending on ncds and injury ( ncdi). Researchers Indrani Gupta and Avantika Ran- jan with the Institute of Economic Growth, New Delhi, have analysed budget documents of the Centre, states and Union Territories for the expenditure on chronic diseases and injuries. They report in plos one in September 2019 that the total spending on ncdi by the government is less than 0.5 per cent of gdp. Though ncds contribute more than 50 per cent of the disease burden, spending on the diseases is a little more than one-fourth of the total healthcare budget. Recent trends in ncdi expenditure by the Union ministry of health and family welfare ( mohfw ) show that the share of ncdi in total health spending has increased steadily over the past four years, from 14 to 20 per cent between 2012-13 and 2016-17. \"To combat any disease, including ncds, it is not sufficient to be merely aware about it; every intervention would require mat- ching funds, be it promotion, prevention or treatment,\" says Gupta. Cost-effective and low-cost interventions are available, but scaling them up requires more funds. With such meagre public financing of the health sector, it is not surprising that not much has been achieved for ncds, adds Gupta. \"ncds are the rising public health challenge all across the diverse landscape of India where wide disparities in life expectancy, disease profiles and health system capacity account for variations in the speed and scale in health transition,\" says K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, a non-profit in based Delhi. We need to strengthen our healthcare systems to respond to the full range of health challenges. In particular, both rural and urban primary healthcare systems must be invigorated with adequate investments in skilled and technologically enabled health workforce, infrastructure and medical supplies. This, he says, will help in prevention, early detection, timely care and rehabilitative services which can reduce disease burden.

The country is reeling under record breaking wildfires, especially in California, Washington, Oregon, and most recently Colorado. Yet Trump, the world's foremost climate denier, told the officials, \"It will start getting cooler. You just watch.\" Trump and his administration blame poor management by local leadership for the wildfires. A similar apathy can be seen in Brazil where president Jair Bolsonaro has time and again denied the existence of wildfires in the Amazon rainforest, despite data by his own government suggesting otherwise. \"This story that the Amazon is going up in flames is a lie and we must combat it with true numbers... They won't find any spot of fire, nor a quarter of a hectare deforested,\" he said in August. The fires for that month hit a nine-year high in 2019 and the destruction in 2020 is Multiple wildfires have been burning their way through the US West Coast since August comparable, suggests data from the country's national space research agency Inpe. Climate change is causing wild fires in the most unlikely places. In Siberia, the peat bogs (a kind of frozen wetland) are on fire this year. The fire is moving up north of the Arctic Circle to the formerly fire tolerant Tundra. The underlying reason is that the Arctic has warmed, with Verkhoyansk, a town in Siberia, recording 38oC, which is 18oC above the normal. In June, Siberia lost nine million hectares of forest, an area the size of Portugal. According to a study published in Nature Geoscience, the region is drying up and becoming more arid, exposing the moss, grass, dwarf shrubs which are catching fire. This is worrying as the permafrost soils contain 1,600 billion tonnes of organic carbon, about twice the amount currently contained in the atmosphere. The situation is alarming even in India. In the past three years (2017-19), the country on an average recorded nearly 35,000 forest fire incidents. This year, close to 21,000 forest fire incidents have been reported so far, as per the government's Forest Fire Alert System. In 2014, the country lost an area larger than the size of Haryana to forest fires. A 1\u00b0C increase in mean monthly temperature can raise the odds of fire by 12 per cent, suggests a district-level analysis conducted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the World Bank for 2003-2016. The analysis also shows that a marginal increase in precipitation or wet days in previous months without HEATING TROUBLES The regions worst hit by global warming are the most vulnerable to forest fires 4 to 5.6 oCForest fires during March 15-April 15, 2020Countries with major forest fires in 2020 2 to 4 oC 1 to 2 oC *compared to during the current month also increases the chances of a fire. This happens because light rainfall stimulates the growth of grasses and other vegetation, increasing the availability of fuels during hotter and drier months. Yet little research has been done on the direct impact of climate change on forest fires in India, suggests Rajeev Semwal, an ecologist with the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. Instead the focus has been on identifying how socio-economic activities lead to forest fires, says Vineet Dubey of Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. The erosion of tradi- tional community institutions for managing forestland aggravates the problem, says Semwal, as most fires are triggered by humans. VICIOUS CYCLE \"Climate change by warming the atmosphere increases the ability of the atmosphere to extract moisture from the forest making it more flammable,\" says Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, US. In many locations extreme droughts are predicted to increase the number, intensity, length and severity of forest fires, suggests a report released by non-profit International Union of Forest Research Organi- zations in October. This triggers a vicious cycle. Nearly a third\u201431 per cent\u2014of the carbon dioxide (CO2) in forests globally is sequestrated in biomass above the ground, while the remaining is underground. Forest fires release carbon stored in vegetation and soil, and as the severity increases, they begin to damage deeper layers of soil, releasing centuries-old legacy carbon. Further, forests that regrow after a fire are smaller and drier than before, and, in some ecosystems, their carbon storage capacity is reduced. This results in a net increase in carbon emissions. Globally, forest fires add CO2 emissions equivalent to the emissions by the European Union every year. They also have severe consequences on biodiversity, and economies around the world, which often goes unnoticed due to the relatively low human casualty. The wildfires in Australia in 2019-20 killed or displaced over three billion animals. It also pushed 26 species closer to extinction. In fact, the world saw a 13 per cent increase in forest fire events this year over 2019, claims World Wide Fund For Nature ( wwf) in its report Fires, Forests and the Future . The science linking climate change to the increase in global forest fires is clear. World leaders need to put aside their self-serving, science- denying politics and spearhead climate smart policies. Their leadership is required to build a low-carbon world.

Companies and even governments now sell or make recommendations about such products. The reality is that it has taken a pandemic for us to realise how little we know of immunity. An analysis by DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INCOVER STORY /IMMUNITY IMMUNITY . Never before has this word been so bandied about as it is being now. It is said to have played a key role for most of the 28 million people worldwide who have made it through the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) over the past 10 months. Even governments are pinning their hopes on this magic word as their economies limp back to action. But this belief in \"immunity\" has also made it the most abused word in recent months. In July, just after the lockdown eased in India, Emami Agrotech launched its Healthy & Tasty Smart Balance Oil, with a tag line \" Ab banega har nivala, immunity wala \". The company based its claim on the fact that the oil contains vitamins A, C, D, E and omega 3 which can strengthen the immune system. In September, the Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers launched eight immunity-boosting produ- to provide medicines at affordable prices to the masses. Fortified with several vitamins and micronutrients, these produ- cts are now available for sale through pmbjp stores across the country. Speaking on the occasion, Minister of Chemicals & Fertilizers D V Sadananda Gowda said, \"The launch of new nutraceuticals is significant in view of the covid -19 pandemic. These products will help in boosting immunity of the people.\" Since 2016, consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever has also been selling a immunity boosting hand sanitiser under its soap brand, Lifebuoy. The company claims that the product, prepared using a patented technology, not only kills germs and viruses instantly but also enhances the innate immunity of the skin by boosting its \"antimicrobial peptides\" (small proteins that act against a wide variety of microorganisms, from bacteria to fungi). The Drug Controller General of India has recently pulled up Hindustan Unilever for its claims calling it \"misleading\". The market, however, remains flooded with everything from pills and ayurvedic formulations to super- foods and wellness products that claim to boost one's immunity during the pandemic. In June, barely four months after the first case of covid -19 was diagnosed in India, Mumbai-based Pronto Consult analysed medical bills in eight cities and found that 92 per cent of the bills were against immunity-boosting products. The number historically has been below 40 per cent, says Pronto. Industry estimates show global market of immunity boosting food products is set to grow from US $16.31 billion in 2019 to $24.02 billion in 2023. The trend exasperates immunologists. \"There is no one thing called 'immunity' and it is hard to even envisage being 'able to improve' it,\" says immunologist Satyajit Rath, visiting professor at the Indian Inst- itutes of Science Education and Research, Pune. Even vaccine, that works by chang- ing the immune response, acts only again- st one particular infection and cannot \"improve immunity\" in any general sense. \"I am yet to see any consistent body of evi- dence that any nutritional supplementation in an ordinarily healthy individual can 'improve' the immune response,\" he says. It is irresponsible to make such claims and these should be monitored by law, says Shashank Tripathi, assistant profes- sor at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. His fear is people might get overconfident because of such claims and expose themselves to the virus, believing that they are immune. These supplements can at best oil your engine, he says. Their concerns stem from the fact that immune system is an extremely complex biological system and continues to confou- nd scientists even over a century after scientists explained its workings; in 1908, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov and Paul Ehrlich for their contribution to explaining immune response. Just like a country's military forces, the immune system's task is to distinguish Immunity is not one thing. That's why it is hard to envisage being able to improve it. Even vaccine acts only against one particular infection and cannot improve immunity in any general sense 30-40Cover DOWN TO EARTH 33 between \"self\" and \"non-self\" and defend the body by eliminating organisms that can cause infection. For this, it depends on a variety of organs, tissues, cells and proteins spread throughout the body and is continually in action. Broadly, it operates through its two arms: innate and adaptive. Innate immune system is the first line of defence against any incoming threat and consists of physical barriers like skin, airways and mucous layer of the digestive tract, and a cavalry of white blood cells that keeps circulating the body like a vigilant force. They are constantly on the lookout for foreign antigens, which are typically proteins on the surface of the invading bacteria or viruses. Some of its fierce personnel include phagocytes that simply swallow up the pathogens within minutes of getting alerted about an intrusion. Fever is the most common symptom of this war. But most of the pathogens that cause serious infections in humans, particularly the ever mutating, microscopic viruses, have evolved strategies to circumvent or suppress the innate immune responses. Besides, a weak innate response is often observed in old people and those who have underlying health problems. For all such occasions, the innate immune system sends messengers to summon the adaptive immune system, which joins the war with its specialised forces\u2014B cells and T cells. Over the next few days B cells tailor-make immunoglobulins (Ig), or antibodies speci- fic for the antigen. These antibodies neutr- alise the pathogen by binding to its antigen and thus preventing it from attaching to host cell and entering it. For those patho- gens that have already invaded the host cells, it calls upon T cells. The cytotoxic T cells\u2014CD8+\u2014neutralise the pathogen by directly destroying infected cells where the pathogen is multiplying, while helper T cells\u2014CD4+\u2014coordinate further attacks on the pathogen. The war ends. But the cells do not drop their guard. Some of the B and T cells develop memory\u2014which can persist for decades or even for a lifetime\u2014and settle inside the lymphatic organs and tissues, such as spleen and thymus. These do not prevent reinfection but remember every pathogen they have ever overcome. The next time a familiar pathogen attacks the body, they act swiftly, without the days- long delay, and in more numbers, NOVEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN COVER STORY /IMMUNITY University, US. No amount of supplements can also train the cells how to fight off a pathogen. Rather, excessive consumption of supplements can make you sick, very sick. More on this later . Now, let's analyse what happens to a person who survives an encounter with a pathogen. Does it guarantee him the much aspired long-term immunity? Not necessa- rily, say scientists. First, because pathog- ens, such as viruses that cause common cold, do not elicit a strong immune respon- se, and thus do not leave behind much of a memory. This makes us vulnerable to reinfection. Even vaccines against such viruses require regular booster shots to maintain immunity. Viruses are also quick to mutate and this makes immune memory against them useless. Even antibodies, which are mere proteins and thus degrade over time, do not guarantee long-term immunity. This is the reason serosurveys, or surveys to assess the presence of antibodies in a population during the current pandemic, should be used to understand only the epidemiology of the disease and not to ascertain immunity developed by a person, to issue immunity passport or to assess herd immunity. This is also the reason the use of antibodies as therapy makes them unreliable. The Indian Council of Medical Research ( icmr) has recently said that its plasma therapy study on covid -19 patients\u2014which essentially works by harvesting antibodies from recovered patients and then administering it on those with acute symptoms to help them fight off the infection\u2014did not really help. THEN WHAT HELPS? COVID-19 has innovated research projects on immune response like never before. Contradictory results are still confusing our understanding Hope is mostly pinned on B and T cells that provide long-term immunity. First, some good news. In August this year, researchers from the Karolinska covid -19 Study Group, Sweden, published a study it from spreading throughout the body. Antibodies, like IgG, which becomes detectable in the blood once the immune response gains an upper hand, also continues to circulate in the bloodstream for a couple of weeks or months after the pathogen is cleared. A healthy individual naturally possess- es all cells of the immune system. But they proliferate and get trained only upon encountering a pathogen. This is how vaccination works. It exposes an individual to a pathogen or an antigen in a controlled manner, without making them sick, and creates memory cells against it that fight the disease. \"One can measure blood levels of various immune cells to determine if immunodeficiency issues exist, but a clinician cannot tell who will have a better response to an infection based on baseline measurements before a person is sick,\" says Adrian Gombart, professor, Depart- ment of Biochemistry NOVEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 35 in journal Cell that maps sars-cov-2-speci- fic T cell responses in unexposed individu- als, exposed family members and those sick with covid -19. They found that T cells even in the seronegative exposed family members and those with asymptomatic or mild covid -19. The researchers say these sars-cov-2 memory T cells can provide long-term immune protection against covid -19. This is unexpected considering that immunity against other coronaviruses is short-lived; as per some estimates it is just about a year. Another study, published in Nature Reviews Immunology on July 29, 2020, has also found a significant level of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells in hospitalised covid -19 patients. But this does not seem to be universal, and overdependence on T cells is not advised. Observations suggest that a bout of the disease leads to T cell exhaustion where the surviving T cells in covid -19 patients are not able to function at full capacity and leave the patients more vulnerable to secondary infection. A study published on May 5 in journal Frontiers in Immunology reports that covid -19 patients with severe symptoms had lower T cell counts. Nonetheless, this understanding is important as it suggests that instead of focusing on respiratory function, it would be better to base treatment on T cell counts and their function\u2014patients with low T cell counts should receive care urgently. The researchers also proposed that covid -19 virus may not be attacking T cells directly but trigger a cytokine storm, which then drives down T cell numbers. This finding is supported by research by Shiv Pillai, professor of medicine and health sciences and technology at Harvard Medical School, US, and his team who have found that covid -19 patients with high levels of cytokines are less likely to develop long-term immunity against sars- cov-2. Pillai's team found that the spleen and lymph nodes of deceased covid -19 patients showed a distinct lack of germinal centres, which are integral in developing long-term immune response. These germ- inal centres are activated upon infection or vaccination and encourage B cells to mature into memory cells. The paper, published in Cell on August 19, also shows that helper T cells needed by germinal centres to develop are absent in severely ill covid -19 patients. \"The immune response we saw was likely because of a virus that could not be controlled in early stages. We suspect similar things happen with any severe viral infection (like Ebola or a novel flu virus like swine flu) but these other diseases have not been studied properly before,\" says Pillai. \"What we have learnt could be applied to make vaccines produce better long-lived antibodies and we are working on that,\" he adds. But the fact is every research appears to have only deepened the mystery surrou- nding immune response. \"We know a lot about the cells and system of our immunity but know very little about how they respo- nd to a stimulus. Our immune system is one of the most complex biological systems on this planet. Millions of cells work toge- ther to counter a pathogen. Just imagine how much coordination is required. A small break in their coordination may result in disaster,\" says Rakesh Singh, associate professor at biochemistry depart- ment of the Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. \"The probabi- lity of a non-specific response cannot be overruled as there is no accuracy even in a perfectly designed natural system.\" What Singh means is that an immune cell primed for a specific pathogen or an antigen may provide partial protection against the second pathogen. When our immune cells are constantly exposed to various pathogens, they may acquire significant capability to cross protect. Take the example of bcg (Bacille Calmette- Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine used against tuberculosis. In this case, the immune cells are primed for specific bacterial antigens but they may have potential to protect from other pathogenic antigens. There are some indications that bcg vaccine protects against covid -19. \"Protection depends on We know a lot about cells and the system of our immunity but know very little about how they respond to a stimulus. Our immune system is one of the most complex biological systems on this planet of immune responses that have been developed in one's body against a pathogen,\" says Singh. Although, with the current level of knowledge it is difficult to quantify the quality of an effective immu- ne response required for cross protection, measuring the numbers of antigen-specific memory B or T cells may help, he explains. This is substantiated by the fact that sars-cov-2 reactive CD4+ T cells were found in 20 to 50 per cent of the blood samples, collected before the virus was discovered in 2019. The researchers report in journal Science on August 4, 2020, that a range of pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells that can react to sars-cov-2 and the four other common cold coronaviruses were present in the samples. NATURE V NURTURE The unknowns surrounding immune response do not end here. Have you ever tried to understand why cases of COVID-19 are low in African countries that have weak healthcare systems, crowding, lack of sanitation facilities and are poor? Researchers from the Netherlands recen- tly tried to find an answer for this. They analysed the impact of early and extensive testing, lockdown stringency, demography and environmental exposure to pathogens on the incidence of the disease. They narrowed down the reason for fewer than expected cases in Africa to be constant exposures to pathogens. Unlike the much talked about link between non-commu- nicable diseases and covid -19, there is little research on how infectious diseases such as hiv/aids, tuberculosis, and other respiratory infections or those caused by helminths affect covid -19, they said in the August 7, 2020 issue of Science . The authors say such an exposure to microbes and parasites educates the immune system to guard against invading pathog- ens not only specifically but also non- specifically through \"trained immunity\", which involves reprogramming of innate cells. These cells on secondary encounter with a pathogen can show a stronger resp- onse or \"virtual memory\" in which virtual T cells expand in response to cytokines, rather than through antigens. This could well be happening in India too. \"Challenging day-to-day life with tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, chikungun- ya and many more pathogens likely made Indians more immune compared to several other nations. Hot weather and spicy, plant-based food habits might add Indians some degree of resistance to infection,\" says Rajalingam Raja, director, Immuno- genetics and Transplantation Laboratory, University of California San Francisco. But not everyone agrees with the theory. According to Rath, the low number of cases seen in India may simply be an accident of a late onset and inadequate diagnosis. Speculating about possible explanations for a phenomenon that may or may not be real is somewhat premature, he says. Tripathi elaborates further. \"The logic that Indians have a better immune response because we live in an environment that has a lot of microbes is flawed. We are the number one country in infectious disease. We have the highest load of dengue, malaria and tuberculosis. It does not seem that living with a lot of microbes is protecting us from infections,\" he says. This suggests that the \"hygiene hypothesis\", which postulates that early and chronic exposure to pathogens can activate immune cells and induce a strong immune response to counteract inflamm- ation, fails to fully explain why some have better immune response than others. As the world tries to understand this, the answer could be in their genetic makeup, the lifestyle they lead or the environment they live in. Studies show that Asian Indians have gained more genes that protect them from viral infections during evolution. \"Two families of genes play in this protective function\u2014 one is kir (killer Ig-like receptor) genes and the other is hla (human leukocyte antigen) genes. Indians have more kir genes compared to the Chinese and Individual specifics Age Sex Genetics Co-morbidies Exposure to microbes Infection Parasites Antibiotics Probotics & prebiotics Microbiota Preexisting immunityKnow thy immunity From gestational age to gene and lifestyle, all regulate one's immunity response Perinatal life Gestational age Birth weight Breastfeeding Maternal antibodies Maternal infection during pregnancy Other maternal factors 36 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 NOVEMBER NOVEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 37 Caucasians. These genes enable Natural Killer cells (usually classified as part of the innate immunity but also displays memory, just like the cells of adaptive immunity) and in case of covid -19 pandemic, the Indian-specific immune genes are clearly playing a role in low spread of sars-cov-2,\" says Raja. He explains that as humans migrated from Africa to India, they gained newer genes to help them adapt to the changing environment. People who reached the coastal areas, retained these genes as the environment there was variable too. On the other hand, those who reached the plains of China, where the environment is stable, lost the genes. A similar advantage is also seen in people of African descent. In September 2014, the ImmVar Project published their initial findings in the Science on how ancestry affected T cell responses. The scientists analysed blood samples from 348 healthy volunteers representing Afri- can, Asian or European ancestry, isolated the CD4+ T cells and activated them in a cell culture to model their response to antigens. They then used computational analysis to measure which genes were turned on or off in the cells from each person. They found that there is stronger activation of some genes in people of African ancestry. They observed this specifically for a type of response in T \"helper 17\" cells that protect from microbes that enter airways or the intestinal tract. But observations on incidence of covid -19 in Africa and usa negate the poss- ibility of genes providing protection against the disease. African in America have been found susceptible to the disease unlike those in Africa. Armed with such results, the covid Human Genetic Effort, an international consortium that aims to discover inborn errors of immunity, plans to study hundreds of covid -19 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN from around the globe to understand the role of genes in the disease. This is likely to be difficult as environ- mental factors and diet also play important roles in manifestation of a disease by leading to the expression of certain genes. Factors such as diet, exposure to toxins, lack of sleep, stress, lack of physical activity can regulate such expression. It has been observed that consumption of junk food over long periods of time reprograms the genetic makeup of immune cells and their precursors in mice, as per a study published in Cell in January 2018. The mice fed with the Western diet\u2014high in salt, sugar and fat\u2014had higher number of immune cells like granulocytes and monocytes (part of the innate immune system). When the mice went back to low- fat diets, their inflammation levels went down, but the genetic reprogramming of their immune cells continued. This is called trained innate immunity. It has been postulated that the Western diet changes the way in which genetic informa- tion is packaged. The genetic material is typically wrapped around proteins and many genes are inaccessible under natural circumstances. But bad food causes some of these hidden pieces of the genetic material to unwind and be expressed\u2014 called epigenetic changes. \"In general, too much refined and processed carbohydrates and certain unsaturated fats are pro- inflammatory and can drive obesity. Individuals who make higher levels of certain inflammatory cytokines early in disease have a worse outcome. It is likely that diet linked to pre-existing conditions contribute to eventual cytokine storms when the virus hits hard,\" says Pillai. Several lifestyle diseases are believed to be the result of a deranged immune system. In his recent book The 21-day Immunity Plan , Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist in UK, writes excess body fat in the abdomen that surrounds the liver, pancreas and even fat underneath the skin release too much of pro-inflammatory cytokines. He says metabolic disorders can be treated by improving immunity through consumption of good food. A diet rich in fibre can improve immun- ity by improving the gut microbiota. A high-fibre diet improves gut microbiota which in turn increases the production of short-chain fatty acids which can then dampen the innate immune response that is typically associated with tissue damage, at that time. But impact of food on immunity too is not linear. \"Balanced use of some vitamin supple- ments help the immune system,\" says Adrian Gombart, professor, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, US. For example, vitamin C is important for both innate and adaptive immune systems. It accumulates in phagocytic cells like neutrophils and enhances chemotaxis (the movement of cells toward chemical signals), phagocytosis (the eating of bacterial cells), generation of oxygen- based pathogen killing activity, and ultimately killing of pathogens. It also helps macrophages clear debris from the immune response to reduce tissue damage. It enhances differentiation and prolifera- tion of B and T cells. Vitamin D is impor- tant for the expression of genes by macro- phages, involved in killing pathogens through phagocytosis. It induces the expression of antimicrobial peptides that kill bacteria. It is important for regulating T cell responses and reducing inflammation. \"Junk food does not have adequate levels of the micronutrients that we are discussing,\" says Gombart. Just like food, exposure to toxins in the environment too affect the immune response. For instance, exposure to pesticide can reduce proliferation of T cells and increase cell death which in turn reduces adaptive immunity. Pesticides can also affect innate immunity by reducing the binding capacity of N K cells. In macro- phages, pesticides can reduce cytokine production and phagocytosis. Triggers like pesticides and heavy metals are not very easy to manage. The impact of toxins on the immune system can also be gauged from a study published in International journal of Environmental Research and Public Health in August 2019. It says children with blood lead concentrations between 1 and 5 \u00b5g/dL (micrograms per decilitre) had 11 per cent lower anti- measles and a 6 per cent lower anti-mumps antibody level compared to children with Nutrition Body mass index Nutritional status Micronutrients (vitamin A,D,E & Zn) Enteropathy Environment Rural or urban Geographic location Season Family size ToxinsLifestyle Smoking Alcohol consumption Exercise Acute psychological stress Chronic psychological stress Vaccine Vaccine type Vaccine product Vaccine strain Adjuvants Vaccine doseand also enhance the adaptive immune response that is charged with eliminating pathogens in mice. The study was publis- hed in journal Immunity in 2019. In vitro studies show processed, simple sugars reduce white blood cell phagocytosis and possibly increase inflammatory cytokine markers in the blood. Meanwhile, complex carbohydrate fibre, such as that found in fruits and vegetables, appear to reduce inflammation in both humans and mice. But good food does not involve supple- ments, which are being promoted as immunity boosters. Studies suggest over consumption of vitamins can be detrimen- tal. A study published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology in 2015 says although vitamin A supplementation can have health benefits when someone is deficient, too much it shuts down the body's adaptive immunity and makes the person more vulnerable to infections. \"Vitamin A supplementation should only be done with clear biological and clinical arguments,\" writes Mihai G Netea, Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who was part of the study. \"The interface of nutrition and immunity is an area of considerable importance, especially in an age when dietary supple- ments and vitamins are quite common,\" notes John Wherry, deputy editor of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology in a press 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH NOVEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INblood lead concentrations less than 1 \u00b5g/ dL after vaccination. Ubiquitous air pollutants are also detrimental to immunity as they stimulate pro-inflammatory responses across multiple classes of immune cell and can enhance certain T helper cells, leading to allergy and asthma which further damage the organs. Air pollutants can also dysregulate anti-viral immune responses, notes a paper published in Free Radical Biology and Medicine in May 2020. The adverse impact of toxins persist for a long time, even through generations. There seems to be a strong association between prenatal arsenic exposure and subsequent childhood respiratory infec- tions, as well as morbidity from respiratory diseases in adulthood through changes in innate immunity. This adverse effect would persist even if the person shifts to cleaner environment, suggests an experiment on mice that were exposed to 100 ppb (parts per billion) sodium arsenite in the uterus, and infected with H1N1 upon reaching adulthood. Assessment of lung tissue and fluid after infection showed there was more lung damage and inflammation in arsenic-exposed mice. Similarly, maternal exposure to dioxin, a common industrial pollutant, can harm the immune system of child by altering the cellular machinery by which genes are expressed. This alterations are then passed along to subsequent generations. Researchers exposed pregnant mice to dioxin and observed that the production and function of cytotoxic T cells was impaired when the mice were infected with influenza A virus. TIME TO CRACK THE CODE Our understanding of the immune system is still in a nascent stage. There is a need to speed up the pace if we want to benefit from it New science keeps emerging every day. For example, it has been observed that vaccinated children are more resistant to covid -19. But the impact was more pronounced in children who received adjuvants (pharmacological agent added to a vaccine to boost the immune response to produce more antibodies and longer- lasting immunity). Researchers are now trying to find if a similar effect can be seen in elderly who have received flu vaccines with or without adjuvants. Similarly, Adam Cunningham, profes- sor of functional immunity at the Univer- sity of Birmingham, UK, and his team found that mothers exposed to a disease before pregnancy can transfer long lasting immunity to their children through breast milk. The study, published in Science Advances on May 29, 2019, may help design maternal vaccine strategies that provide longer-term protection to children. The understanding will also help harness immunotherapies. They have already been found useful in treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. In case of cancer, the immune system is ramped up to attack the cancer cells while in case of rheumatoid arthritis, it is ramped down to ensure that immune cells do not attack joint tissue and lead to chronic pain and joint damage. Basic understanding of immune cells has been found useful for treating covid -19 too. In September, the Infectious Disease Research Institute in Seattle, US, used placenta-derived Natural Killer (NK) cells on 14 patients hospitalised with moderate covid -19 symptoms over one week at eight testing sites followed by a second phase to measure results against a control group receiving care. The treatment differs from covid -19 vaccines\u2014while vaccines are preventive treatment, NK-cells would be used for treating those who have covid -19. What's clear is that there are too many unknowns around immune response. Till we have better understanding, we can support the immune system by eating balanced healthy food and by exercising. It will provide multiple benefits. As Tripathi explains, balanced diet and regular exer- cise help improve the immune response not just against covid -19 but against all kinds of communicable and non-commun- icable diseases.

By October 8, the number of children affected by the disease had nearly doubled to 926.9 per 100,000 population, shows data compiled by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The move triggered a debate on the safety of the decision for children, and whether it could lead to another wave of covid -19 in the country. Data across the world shows that the rate of incidence of covid -19 is low in children and the symptoms are milder, too. But this does not mean that children are immune or cannot act as carriers of the virus, spreading the disease. The issue is in focus in India after the Centre issued a notification on October 5, allowing state governments to reopen schools from October 19. After the notification, three states\u2014Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Sikkim\u2014have reopened schools. Children are just 1 to 4 per cent of the total covid -19 cases, estimated a paper published in Indian Pediatrics in April 2020. \"The case load remained low because children were not mingling. Now that the schools are reopening, it COVID-19 /UPDATE 42 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 India will need aggressive health measures\" This is an opportunity for India to exert itself on the world stage as one of the largest vaccine manufacturers, says PETER HOTEZ , founding editor-in-chief of PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases and professor at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, USA What challenges would India face in vaccinating its large population? There are at least four major COVID-19 vaccines being accelerated for development in India. Serum Institute of India is scaling up AstraZenea- Oxford Vaccine, Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad is developing an inactivated virus vaccine and Biological E is accelerating two COVID-19 vaccines, including one of the US. So they all have the capacity, as they are some largest vaccine manufacturers in the world. I think one tough part is going to be the ability to disseminate vaccines quickly among the people. Secondly, there is a growing movement against vaccines with anti- vaccine activists claiming that vaccines are not safe and are not tested adequately. A lot of misinformation has been put on the Internet. So a way is to be figured out to counter that. We have to remember that vaccines vary in their ability to protect (against the virus). Some can only partially protect. And in that case we still have to do mass-contact tracing (for infected people). So sending that message that even when vaccines are deployed, we still need additional public health measures to ensure safety of the population, I think, is the one of the toughest things to do. Would India be able to vaccinate its large population? India is a nation that has done overall, very well, with vaccination, working hand-in- hand with global bodies such as GAVI alliance, Gates Foundation, World Health Organization and Unicef . India does very well considering the depth and breadth of poverty. So yes, I think they will be able to build on that infrastructure. I think the bigger question is that this is an opportunity for India to exert itself on the world stage as one of the largest vaccine manufacturers and whether these big Indian biotech pharma companies can help vaccinating the world. I think this is a chance for India to show some national pride. Do you think we are pinning too much hope on the vaccine? As I indicated before, there is difference in the ability of vaccines to offer protection. And if that is the case and the virus is still circulating among the populations, India will have to continue with public health measures as aggressively as it is being done at the moment. I think, vaccines are, at times, advertised as some kind of miracle and magic solution. They are important but remember that vaccines are only our companion technologies that help in public health. They are not going to replace public health.

Parekh also offers another criticism of the way states reopened the schools. Schools should be opened only if the positivity rate is not more than 5 per cent in the general population of the district, he says. (If the number of samples tested is 100 and the positive cases are five, the positivity rate is 5 per cent.) Since this rate could be different in different districts, decision must be taken at the local level. There is another cause of concern. In India, as in other parts of the world, covid - infected children have been found to suffer from two serious ailments after recovery\u2014Kawasaki disease and paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome. In the former, the blood vessels are impacted (become thicker, narrower and weaker), restricting blood flow and causing tissue damage. In the latter, multiple body organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and kidney, are inflammed. Jitendra Oswal, a Pune-based paediatrician, says that as per one of his sample studies, over 25 per cent of covid -recovered children suffer from these problems, and that such cases are being reported from across India. \"Diagnosed early, these can be treated, else they have a serious impact,\" Parekh says. Both Oswal and Parekh do not prescribe complete closure of schools. All the children of a class should never be called on any given day, while children with comorbidities should not be called at all, they suggest. Social distancing norms and innovative ways to enable learning will have to be learnt.

Mind you, remdesivir is still an experimental, unproven drug even if several panicked governments from the US to Japan have authorised its emergency use to reduce the hospital stay of covid -19 patients. No one turned a hair when Gilead raised its profit outlook for 2020 by this whopping figure based on its prospects from a single drug. Such profiteering by large drug companies has come to be generally accepted because almost everyone has bought the argument that the industry needs to recoup its heavy outlays on R&D through high prices. High prices are facilitated by the market monopolies that drug firms enjoy through their patent rights on their drug discoveries. However, the brazen profiteering by the industry has in the past decade provoked strong reactions from lawmakers, health organisations, activists and patient groups who have proposed alternative methods of funding drug R&D. The initiatives being discussed in various forums such as the World Health Assembly ( wha) and the US Congress include state funding for drug discovery and a patents pool. The latter would free up the technology for making critical drugs and allow these to be produced more cheaply by generic companies. But there is a catch. Although more reasonably priced than the original innovator drug, generics, too, are governed by the market, which means that these medications are not always affordable since they are not priced close to the actual cost of the drug. One reason is that drug giants have placed a firm footprint in the generics segment also. What is the way out? One suggestion that has found traction among economists like Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and US policymakers disgusted by the absurdly high prices of life-saving medicines is to delink R&D costs from drug prices to ensure access to new drugs through a Medical Innovation Prize Fund. The fund was first introduced in the US House of Representatives in 2005, and later promoted strongly in the Senate by former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The fund would eliminate market exclusivity for all prescription drugs since drug firms investing in R&D would no longer be eligible for patents. Instead, successful drug developers would be rewarded with monetary prizes\u2014and it was not peanuts. In 2007, the fund was envisaged to be $80 billion a year. India has supported the delinking proposal. At the wto Council for Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( trips ), India asked wto to organise a conference on Innovation Inducement Prizes and Open Development Models. The UN, too, has backed the idea with the Human Rights Council adopting a resolution calling upon member-states to support the principle of delinking as has the wha in order to meet the critical public health needs of developing countries. The underlying principle is to thoroughly reform incentives for drug R&D so that these are not predicated on high prices and to progressively move closer to affordable generic prices. Patent pools and the like are not really workable and tend to distract from the main issue of drug accessibility.

It shifted its position in time and space from northern hemisphere to the southern and back to the northern, ultimately colliding with the Eurasian plate and resulting in the mighty Himalayas during the various geological periods. The country has a mosaic of the world's oldest geological terrain in the south and the west. The Deccan Plateau, the great Vindhyan basin, coal-bearing Gondwana basins, foreland basins of the Himalayas, the Siwaliks and the Indo-Gangetic plains are testimony to the geological diversity of the vast landmass. We are a great repository of fossils, too. These include the oldest life forms, stromatolites, unearthed in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh; marine fossils found in Kutch and Spiti; vertebrate fossils of Siwaliks and dinosaur remains in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. We also have the world's earliest metallurgical records of gold, lead and zinc mining in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. All of these attract scientists from every part of the globe. Despite its extremely diverse geological terrain and markings of some of the world's most fabulous geological events, India does not have a single geopark recognised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( unesco ). unesco defines geoparks as \"single, unified geographical areas where sites and landscapes of international geological A dinosaur egg clutch at Raiyoli in Mahisagar district, Gujarat 165 MILLION YEARS OLD 65 MILLION YEARS OLDPHOTO COURTESY: GOOGLE EARTH; DR.

Such sites are important for reconstructing the evolutionary history of life and the planet through the various geological times. In 2004, a total of 17 European and eight Chinese geoparks formed the Global Geopark Network ( ggn) under the aegis of unesco \"to develop models of best practice and set quality- standards\". In 2015, the 195 member states of unesco ratified the new label \" unesco Global Geoparks\". ggn is the official partner of unesco for their operation. As of July 2020, there are 161 unesco Global Geoparks in 44 countries. China has the maximum (41); even geographic- ally smaller countries, Thailand and Vietnam, have a few. A geoheritage site has to fulfil certain conditions to be recognised as a unesco Global Geopark. It must be managed by a body having legal existence recognised under national legislation, there should be a devoted website, a corporate identity, an all-inclusive management plan for protection and conservation and financial sustainability models, among others. The Geological Survey of India ( gsi) has designated 32 sites in the country as National Geological Monuments, but none has been recognised as a unesco Global Geopark because there is no legislation to empower gsi to manage these sites. Things, however, are changing. The Society of Earth Scientists ( ses), a registered society based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, submitted a draft legislation on protection of geoheritage sites to the Union government last year, which is under consideration. As of now, the Dinosaur Fossil Park at Raiyoli, Gujarat; Ramgarh crater in Baran district of Rajasthan; and Zawar, the world's oldest mining and metallurgical site, also in Rajasthan, are best candidates to become unesco Global Geoparks. ses has also approached the governments of Gujarat and Rajasthan to declare these sites as geoparks. In the current post- covid scenario, when state governments are facing the enormous challenge of providing employment to returning workers, developing geoparks can have dual benefits. While they will help in conservation of the environment through sustainable development, they will also provide jobs and business opportunities to the local people, which is the crux of the concept of geoparks.COMMUNITY IS KEY \"unesco Global Geoparks should actively involve local communities and indigenous people as key stakeholders in the Geopark,\" state unesco 's operational guidelines for geoparks. \"In partnership with local communities, a co-management plan needs to be drafted and implemented that provides for the social and economic needs of local populations, protects the landscape in which they live and conserves their cultural identity,\" the guidelines state. By raising awareness of the importance of the area's geological heritage in history and society, geoparks give people a sense of pride in their region and strengthen their identification with the area.

At the same time, the geological resources of the area are protected. An important question here is how to fund the development of geoparks. Remarkably, not too much money is required to develop the infrastructure; this is a venture where the return is more than the investment. The only requirement is a well- defined legislation to protect the identified area and intelligent control by the local administration. Countries, such as Japan and China, have developed domestic networks to create collaborations among geoparks, schools, universities, business houses and the tourism sector. The money that tourists spend goes directly to local producers\u2014from farmers to labourers to artisans. Involving people in tourism marketing, such as tour operators, homestay owners and chefs for local cuisines promotes the area's economy. Innovative ideas of artisans and business people, for example, geo-bakeries and mementos depicting the site's geological or cultural features, attract tourists. Leisure activities like boating, cycling, bird-watching and climbing, and the development of museums also help in economic regeneration. There is no reason India cannot replicate such initiatives. It has all the more reason to do so, because its great geological diversity is under threat of destruction. Many important sites have been, and are being, damaged or destroyed because we still lack an understanding of geodiversity and geoheritage. There have been several cases of sites being vandalised and fossils being sold to, or pilfered by, visitors. Many critical geological sections of global significance have also been sacrificed on the pretext of development. Though we also have several geosites\u2014caves, fossil and geomorphological locations\u2014that are developed, there is a lack of holistic approach in their projection and a failure to impart scientific knowledge. As such, they are converted into amusement sites and not knowledge hubs. Time has come to formulate a law to conserve our geoheritage and convert them into knowledge destination on a par with global standards.

Around 810 million people get highly subsidised 5 kg of foodgrain per head per month under nfsa. Since fci has no income stream of its own, it depends on budgetary allocations of the Union government to meet its PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY: FOOD CORPORATION OF INDIA Appraisal /FCI 52 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 Economic Cost\u2014procurement, storage and transportation expenditure of fci\u2014and the Central Issue Price ( cip)\u2014the price at which the Centre provides grain to states under nfsa\u2014is the food subsidy. The food subsidy expenses\u2014of fci and states that follow the decentralised procurement planning method\u2014are met through provisioning in the Union budget. But allocations have been dwindling. Take for instance the budgetary allocation for financial year of 2019-20. The food subsidy allocation of R1.84 lakh crore\u2014 R1.51 lakh crore for fci those states following decentralised procurement system\u2014was reduced by R75,000 crore for fci. To address the mounting food subsidy arrears, fci has been taking loans to finance its operations. In fact, the government itself has made provisions for fci to raise loans from various sources like National Small Savings Fund (nssf), Short Term Loans, Bonds and Cash Credit Limits ( cci). DEBT TRAP It is an insurmountable debt trap. Of the nssf loans which fci had been availing since 2016-17, R46,400 crore will go towards repayment of earlier loans availed from nssf (see ''Mounting debt'', p54). As a result, outstanding dues to fci continues to rise\u2014 estimated at R2.49 lakh crore and cumulative loans at R3.33 lakh crore at the end of 2019-20. Though the 2020-21 Union budget has allocated R1,15,319 crore for food subsidy\u2014 R77, 982 crore for fci and R37,337 crore for those states who follow decentralised procurement system\u2014the actual expenses have risen sharply as the government had been providing free foodgrains of 5 kg per head per month for all the beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana ( pmgkay ), deal with crisis arising out of covid -19 spread since April (till November 2020), in addition to grains entitlement under nfsa. Food ministry officials say that the estimated food subsidy expenses would go up to R2.33 lakh crore in the current fiscal against the budget estimate of R1.15 lakh crore because of expenses incurred under pmgkay . The expenditure towards food subsidy has been rising because of factors including the annual rise in Minimum Support Price (msp) for paddy and wheat given to farmers for procurement and the ''open ended'' purchase operations leading to excess grains stocks held by fci. Another factor contributing to the rise in food subsidy bill is because of the Union government's reluctance to increase the price of highly subsidised foodgrains supplied under nfsa, 2013. The 2019-20 Economic Survey states that cip of R3/2/1 for a kg of rice, wheat and coarse grains has not been revised since 2013. ''This has resulted in widening of the gap between the economic cost and cip, and the food subsidy incurred by the Government has risen substantially over the years,\" the survey had stated. The Economic Survey also notes that \"while the interests of the vulnerable sections of the population need to be safeguarded, the economic rationale of increasing the cips under nfsa also cannot be undermined. For sustainability of food security operations, the issue of burgeoning food subsidy bill needs to be addressed\". The grain stocks held with fci far exceed buffer stocks norms, and thus add up to the rising food subsidy expenses. On October 1, 2020, fci had grain (rice and wheat) stock of 67.5 million tonnes (MT) against buffer stocks norms of 30.7 MT. Moreover, the key factor behind rising grains stock is the open-ended msp operations\u2014foodgrains offered by farmers in a stipulated states such as Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Telangana which end up with fci buying more grain from farmers through msp operations than the offtake by the states. The offtake of foodgrains by states under nfsa in the last decade had been in the range of 51-59 MT while procurement of grains during the same period had been around 60 MT.

SOLUTIONS ON THE TABLE In 2014, the Union government had appointed a High-Level Committee ( hlc), chaired by former food minister Shanta Kumar, on the restructuring of fci. hlc in its report submitted in January 2015, had recommended that fci should help those states where farmers suffer from distress sale at prices much below msp, and which are dominated by small holdings, like eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. To discourage farmers, especially in Punjab and Haryana, from growing paddy, hlc has recommended that pulses and oilseeds deserve priority and the government must provide innovative marketing and procurement mechanisms, and align their msp policy with trade policy so that their imported costs of the commodities are not below their msp. But due to the open-ended msp operations, fci and its affiliates buy all the rice and wheat brought by farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Thus the farmers in these states are not encouraged to grow alternate crops such as oilseeds and pulses. Meanwhile, the fiscal crisis faced by fci is only deepening. The situation has reached to such a level that the government needs to take drastic steps to ensure provisioning of food subsidy expenses incurred by fci. Mere postponement is no longer viable.

My parents had bought the blinds to hang on the doors. They were made of roots and stems of khus , a perennial bunchgrass known for its water holding capacity. Every afternoon my siblings would sprinkle water over the mats and soon, the cool and calming fra - grance would lull us all to sleep. But it was a messy affair. Water dripping from the blinds would often flow into the room. Sleeping with the doors and windows open to catch the breeze was also not particularly safe. So, the khus - blinds were soon discarded, and we found solace in the bright green khus sharbat , which is prepared from the same roots and is equally aromatic and refreshing as the blinds. Khus or Vetiveria zizanioides is native to India. It belongs to Poaceae family which includes India's staple food grain, wheat, and grows wild in the northern states. In southern states, farmers cultivate it as a commercially traded grass\u2014its scientific name, in fact, comes from the Tamil name for the grass, vettivar . Though every part of the grass is useful, khus is most valued for Khus sharbat is aromatic and 27/10/20 4:05 PM27/10/20 4:05 PMits roots, which are used to extract one of the most complex oils known. It contains some 150 aromatic molecules, many of which are yet to be identified. Extraction of the oil is, however, fairly simple. First chop the roots and leave the pieces in water for about 24 hours. Then distil the extract to separate the oil from water. It is viscous and has low volatility which makes it useful as a perfume. The recovery of oil ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 per cent among north Indian cultivars and between 0.6 and 1.0 per cent among south Indian cultivars. One can follow the process to prepare khus sharbat at home as most sharbats available in the market have artificial dye added to it (see recipe). The food industry has a huge demand for khus essential oil. Apart from sharbat s, the flavour and fragrance industry uses it to produce chewing tobacco, paan masala , soaps, perfumes and cosmetics. It is part of pharmaceu - ticals used to treat skin diseases and prevent stretch marks. The oil is also useful to strengthen the central nervous system and treat depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia. Traditional healers prescribe the extract of its roots for its properties related to cooling, digestive and regulation of im - mune system. Diluted vetiver oil is good for cleaning and dressing infected wounds. When inhaled with steam, vetiver oil is good for curing fever and respiratory diseases. The oil also purifies blood and is used in ayurvedic medicines like nishakathakadi kashayam that strengthen the urinary system. It is also useful to treat diabetes, and rasnadi churnam applied to scalp can treat head - aches. Beds made of khus root are good for patients suffering from rheumatism and back pain. Hair oil infused with its roots have a cooling effect and prevents hair fall. The roots are often kept along with clothes to repel insects. However, these are not the only benefits of khus . The grass has a root system, which can go in as deep as 4 metres. This root system not only promotes water conserva - tion through groundwater recharge but also prevents soil erosion during extreme rainfall and flash floods. They are thus used for stabilising soil along the river - banks, canals, drainage channels, around ponds and also along the steep contour lines of hills. In Kerala, the grass is extensively grown in the littoral sandy soil to protect the coastal areas from sea level rise. In Karnataka, it is common to find clumps of this grass in and around the field in areas with heavy clay soil. These soils are usually difficult to work with as they get waterlogged during the rains and crack in the dry season. Khus grass ensures that pools of standing water do not form on the land. By ensuring even distribution of water, it helps maximise its use. Of late, scientists are realising some more powers of khus . One such is sequestration of atmospher - ic carbon. A comparison of khus with several others plants like teak, poplar and eucalyptus by the Centre for Mathematical Modelling and Computer Simulation, Benga - luru, demonstrated that vetiver is more efficient at sucking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The comparison was published in 2011. Its deep roots are useful for soil and water remediation as it can tolerate high levels of nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals and agricultural chemicals. Farmers can use the leaves for mulching and preparing organic manure. Even the roots, after extraction of oil, are useful as it can be turned to cardboard and paper. Small wonder, khus is now being promot - ed globally as a crop that can help adapt and mitigate climate change. Communities also see business opportunity in this. Its strong and long roots are the perfect choice of artisans for making crafts like mats, fans, screens, pillows, baskets and chappals. But digging out the roots is not an easy task. To help farmers extract the entire root system, the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow, has recently developed an efficient, low-cost khus root digging implement, which it says can reduce the digging cost by 80 per cent. Let's hope it helps prom- ote the propagation of this truly green grass.

Clean the roots well to remove dirt. Chop them into small pieces. Soak in water overnight. Next day, boil the roots along with the water for five minutes for extraction of flavour and fragrance. Sieve to remove the roots. Transfer the extract to a thick bottom vessel and add sugar to it. Boil for 15 to 20 minutes to prepare a thick syrup. Cool and store it in a glass bottle. While serving, take of small amount of syrup and add water to it to get the sweetness you desire. The syrup can be stored in refrigerator for at least 15 days.RECIPEkhus ka sharbat\\ DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 NOVEMBER 2020 4:05 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INCIVIL LINES / RICHARD MAHAPATRA BIHAR ASSEMBLY election 2020 is the first polls to be conducted during a pandemic in India. While all the focus was on safety measures to prevent the spread of contagious covid -19, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( bjp) turned it into an ultimate electoral issue by promising free vaccination for all in the state if voted back to power. The party must have calculated the promise as an electoral cure. But the promise marks the formal emergence of vaccine as a major manifesto item and a poll issue. Such promises are expected when the planet is under the severest and widest pandemic. But for a vaccine to force its way into an election manifesto, which is usually scripted with the traditional roti-kapda- makaan orientation, is an indicator of the pandemic's impact on India's polity. With over 8 million cases of infection, we all desperately await a shield against the virus sars-cov-2. A promise regarding this would appeal to all, and most probably wipe out all other relevant issues that could hamper a party's political fortunes. Small wonder, soon after bjp's declaration, parties in poll-bound Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh followed suit. We didn't witness such brouhaha when India suffered from chickenpox, polio or even cholera. India's health campaigns to eradicate or control these infections are globally celebrated as successes. They remain notable mentions for the Government of India at various international fora. An emergency situation like covid -19 pandemic always impacts parties and their politics. History has many examples of how disasters and emergency developments shaped electoral pitching of political parties. Democracies across the world adopted universal public healthcare regimes as a response to the Spanish Flu pandemic (1918- 20). The pandemic demonstrated that both rich and poor were vulnerable and had to be protected. The result was that political parties in Western countries evolved public health systems that appealed to all. In India, the 1943 Bengal famine shaped political priorities. India's first food and agriculture minister in the interim national government hoisted the flag at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research office on August 15, 1947, to acknowledge hunger as the new country's biggest development and political challenge. Hunger and food insecurity continued to haunt India with periodic droughts and famine. In 1966, Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh suffered from one of the worst droughts and crop failures, fuelling demands for food security programmes. In the general elections next year, Indira Gandhi minted the now-popular slogan: \" Roti (indicating food), kapda (clothing or dignity) aur makaan (housing)\". The promise of cheap food and implementation of food-for-work schemes for the first time appeared in election manifestos. Her Congress party returned to power. There are questions over bjp's promise of free vaccine to Bihar alone, and whether it will help the party hold onto power there. Just a few days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured vaccines for all in his short address to the nation. It seems this assurance would soon metamorphose into an intra- country fight over who accesses vaccine against covid -19 when and how fast. At the global level, we have been wary of vaccine- nationalism: countries using power and might to stock up vaccines for their population, leaving those out who cannot deploy such resources. Now, with vaccine becoming an electoral priority, will India witness vaccine sub-nationalism? DTE @richiemahaRoti, kapda, makaan, and vaccine COVID-vaccine is now an electoral dole.
