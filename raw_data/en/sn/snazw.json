Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are a common cause of upper respiratory tract disease in young children. They spreadfrom contact with respiratory secretions on contaminated surfaces or close contact with infected persons. No curative treatment or vaccines are currently available toprotect against infection caused by any of these viruses. RSV can cause substantial morbidity in older adults. Although RSV and influenza cause considerable individual morbidity, the burden of disease from rhinovirus infec-tions and infections of unknown etiology seems greater. The interval between onset of illness and consultation together with diagnostic difficulties raises concern regarding the role of antiviral drugs in treating influenza. Asthma is also common. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (www.cdc.gov ) indicate that 16.2 million adults and 6.7 million chil- dren currently have asthma, resulting in 10.6 million visits to office-based physiciansand a minimum of 444,000 hospital stays. COPD (a group of diseases characterized by airflow obstruction associated with breathing-related symptoms) was the underlying cause of death for 718,077 personsaged 25 years and older in the United States between 2000 and 2005. From 2000 to2005, the annual number of deaths from COPD increased 5% among men and 11% among women.

COMMON COLD Viral upper respiratory infection (URI) accounts for a high number of people missingwork or school, and represents the leading acute diagnosis in the office setting each year in the United States alone. 4The common cold is caused by several viral organisms such as adenoviruses, myxoviruses, coronaviruses, picornaviruses. The most common viral cause is the Rhinovirus (10%-25%). Usually, patients recover in 7 to 10 days. Complications are usually related to extension of infection to the lowerrespiratory tract (eg, sinusitis, otitis media). Usual care is mainly symptomatic and supportive. The most commonly known or marketed natural supplements are described in this article. However, health professionals should know that herbalists and natural health careproviders most often use a combination of herbs, supplement, aromatherapy, andso forth. to treat symptoms or for their antimicrobial properties. Discussion of such formulas is beyond the scope of this article. A summary is presented in Table 1 . Andrographis (Andrographis paniculata) Andrographis paniculata is an annual herb. The leaves are used traditionally in Asian traditional medicine and particularly Ayurveda to treat fever associated with infections.Approximately 28 species of Andrographis are known and indigenous to Asia. A pan- iculata is the most commonly used. Andrographis is also used for other medical condi- tions; for example, digestive problems, blood cleanser, fever, sore throat, and URIs. In a systematic review by Coon and Ernst 5in 2004, 7 double-blind controlled trials (N5896) met the criteria for evaluation of efficacy. All trials scored at least 3 out of 5 in methodological qualities. The dose of Andrographis used ranged from 48 to 360 mg. A paniculata alone or in combination with E senticosus seem promising in the treatment of uncomplicated URI symptoms. In the highest quality study6a fixed combination of standardized extract of the leaves of A paniculata 60 mg/d and the roots of E sentico- sus120 mg/d given to patients with uncomplicated URIs within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms. Outcome measures were patient and physician evaluation of severity of symptoms based on predefined criteria. Significant improvement was noted inpatient-measured symptoms (P 5.0006) and physician-measured assessments (P5.003). Improvement was noted in symptoms such as muscle ache, cough frequency, presence of productive cough, fever, and sore throat. Another meta-analysis published in the same year identified 4 qualifying studies (N5433) and reported similar improvements in symptom severity in favor of the combination A paniculata andE senticosus . 7A large (N 5200) nonrandomized study, using the same fixed combination of standardized extract (leaves of A paniculata 60 mg/d and the roots of E senticosus 120 mg/d) given for 5 days, found a significant difference between the mean symptom scores between groups at the end of the treat-ment (P <.001). 8Headaches, nasal and throat symptoms, and general malaise showed the most improvement. In another 2 randomized controlled trials, subjects received 60 mg/d of A paniculata with 48 to 72 hours of the onset of URI symptoms; statistically significant improvement in symptoms was reported within 4 to 5 days.9,10In a study comparing 180 or 360 mg/d of A paniculata with paracetamol (3.9 g/d), subjects paracetamol and high-dose A paniculata reported statistically signifi- cant improvement in symptoms by day 3.Kilgore & Najm 298The safety profile of A paniculata is very favorable with a few reports of allergic reac- tion and 1 report of anaphylactic shock and 2 reports of anaphylactic reaction in the early 1990s from Sweden. Data are lacking about the safety of A paniculata for preg- nant or breastfeeding women and should be avoided. In addition, some experimental reports indicate that A paniculata might have a contraceptive effect; therefore, its use should be avoided in men or women attempting to conceive. Overall, the evidence suggests that A paniculata alone or in combination with E sen- ticosus could be effective in the treatment of uncomplicated acute upper respiratory tract infection. Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) Ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin necessary to form collagen, cartilage, absorp- tion of iron, and formation of blood vessels. It is found naturally in fruits (eg, citrus) and vegetables.Table 1 Summary of natural supplements used for the treatment of the common cold NameSuggested Dose Drug Interactions Side EffectsScientific Evidenceof Efficacy Andrographis paniculata48-360 mg/d No specific interactionsnoted. vitro inhibit the activity ofCYP2C9 andCYP3A4Allergic reaction; 3 reports ofanaphylacticshock (1) or reaction (2) Avoid if attempting to conceiveGood evidence of effectiveness Vitamin C (ascorbicacid)2-8 ifallergic todaisiesSupportive gluconate4.5-23.7 Respiratory Diseases 299Interest in the use of vitamin C for the treatment and prevention of the common cold was heightened following the publication in 1970 of Nobel Prize winning scientist Linus Pauling's book Vitamin C and the common cold . He followed that by conducting several meta-analyses demonstrating a decrease in the incidence and in the numberof days of illness following the use of vitamin C. Since then, controversy has arisen withseveral trials reporting a benefit (mainly in populations who had low vitamin C intake or < physical stress) and others reporting no benefit. Initial reviews indicated that despite the heterogeneity of the studies, supplementation with vitamin C at doses of 1 g/d ormore consistently decreased the duration or alleviated the symptoms of the common cold. 11,12In 2007, a meta-analysis by the Cochrane review group13attempted to answer the question: does vitamin C in doses of 0.2 g daily or more, reduce the inci- dence, duration, or severity of the common cold when used either as continuousprophylaxis or at the onset of cold symptoms. Data from 11 different trials involving 3294 cold episodes where participants initi- ated supplementation at the onset of cold symptoms were included. The data fromthe therapeutic trials do not provide convincing evidence of reduced duration of colds when treatment commenced after common cold symptoms began. Eight trial arms, which included 2753 separate respiratory episodes for which cold severity wasassessed, were also reviewed. Analysis of these results similarly found no meaningful difference between vitamin C and placebo groups in the severity of cold episodes when treatment commenced after common cold symptoms began. Questions remain about the overall efficacy of vitamin C in the treatment of common cold symptoms. Although no firm conclusions can be drawn, some evidence suggeststhe following strategies could be helpful: (1) vitamin C is more effective in reducingcold symptoms and duration if the initiation of treatment is within 24 hours of the onsetof symptoms; (2) vitamin C may be more effective in subjects with a low level of vitamin C or who are undergoing high physical or mental stress; (c) higher doses of vitamin C (4 g or higher) are more effective than lower doses. None of the vitamin C commoncold trials reported evidence that vitamin C is harmful in doses that were tested. Echinacea (Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpura, Echinacea pallida) Echinacea species is widely used and marketed to improve the immune system response during colds and flu. The exact mechanism of action for the immune-stim-ulating effects of Echinacea preparations remains unclear. Four compounds are believed to contribute to the immunomodulatory activity of Echinacea extracts: alka- acid derivatives. These seem toactivate the alternate complement pathway components, and increased levels of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. 14In addition, Echinacea extracts increase the macrophage proliferation and phagocytosis, as well as secretion of interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1 (in vitro and in vivo).15-17A Cochrane Review iden- tified 9 trials (N 51126) with a total of 10 Echinacea groups diagnosed with common cold symptoms, randomized and treated with Echinacea .18Pressed juices (stabilized with alcohol), alcohol tinctures, or tablets made from dried extracts were the forms ofEchinacea used. Outcome measurements were heterogeneous. Treatment groups often used different instruments, timing of measurements, type of analysis, anddescriptive statistics. Among the 2 trials with no comparison groups, 1 study amongchildren receiving pressed juice of E purpure a herb reported positive results. 19 When Echinacea preparations were compared with placebo as treatment, a significant effect was reported in 9 comparisons, a trend in 1, and no difference in 6. Overall, theclinical evidence for the efficacy of Echinacea for treating common cold symptoms remains unclear.Kilgore & Najm 300Goldenseal (Hydrastis Canadensis) Goldenseal is native to eastern North America and is traditionally used by Native Americans for the treatment of inflammation of the respiratory, digestive, and urinarytracts. The 2 primary alkaloids found in goldenseal are berberine and hydrastatine. Goldenseal has a strong astringent property, which is traditionally used to help ease the discomfort of sore throat. Herbalists often recommend goldenseal in combinationwithEchinacea for the treatment of colds and flu. However, there are currently no well- designed studies evaluating goldenseal either alone or in combination with Echinacea . Glodenseal is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Zinc Zinc is an essential mineral that is naturally present in some foods (mollusks, oysters,meat, poultry, beans, nuts, whole grains, cereals, and so forth), and available as a -dietary supplement. Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES III) indicate that 35% to 45% of adults aged 60 years or older had zinc intakes less than the estimated average requirement of 6.8 mg/d for elderly women and 9.4 mg/d for elderly men. 20Mild to moderate degrees of zinc deficiency can impair the function and activity of the immune system, particular T lymphocytes.21,22Zinc is commonly used for a variety of conditions such as wound healing, skin ulcers, andsmell and taste disorders. It is also marketed in a variety of forms for treatment of viralinfections such as herpes simplex and URI. Initial evidence from rigorous scientific trials of zinc and its effects on cold symp- toms came from inoculation studies. 23,24Neither trial found a direct effect on viral shedding, in either magnitude or duration. A more recent randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 100 employees of the Cleveland Clinic using zinc gluconate (13.3 mg) every 2 hours reported significant reduction in the duration of symptoms of thecommon cold. 25A 7-month placebo-controlled trial26(15 mg zinc sulfate daily as a prophylactic, 15 mg twice daily after onset of cold and until symptoms resolved) reported a drop in the mean number of colds (1.2 vs 1.7; P5.003), the mean number of cold-related absences (0.9 days vs 1.3 days; P5.04), and shorter duration of cold symptoms in the zinc group versus placebo (P<.0001). A meta-analysis27identified 8 trials using zinc gluconate on patients in whom colds were developing de novo in the community. Doses of zinc gluconate used ranged from 4.5 to 23.7 mg. The odds ratio for the presence of any cold symptoms at 7 days was 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.25-1.2) indicating that the evidence for effectiveness of zinc lozenges in reducing the duration of common colds is still lacking. Overall, thecurrent evidence is weak for the efficacy of zinc gluconate lozenges in reducing cold duration. Zinc is considered relatively safe when taken at recommended doses. Few studies report side effects such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. High-dose zinc has also been associated with a potential reduction in (1) serum copper level, (2) lymphocyte stimulation, and (3) high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and a higher incidence of urinary problems among men, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and renal lithiasis.Recent warnings regarding intranasal gel/spray have been posted by the US Food and Drug Administration for possible loss of smell. Other Therapies Chinese herbs and formulas have also been evaluated for their potential benefit in treating the common cold. A Cochrane meta-analysis28identified 14 studies involving 2440 patients. All studies were rated of low or poor quality. There was high probabilityCommon Respiratory Diseases 301of biases in all of the studies included. Different Chinese herbal preparations were tested in nearly all trials. In 6 studies, 5 herbal preparations were found to be moreeffective at enhancing recovery than the control; in the other 8 studies, 5 herbal prep- arations were shown to be equal to the control. Based on this review, the investigators concluded that they were unable to recommend any kind of Chinese herbal prepara-tion for the common cold. Recently, over-the-counter products (such as Airborne) marketed for the treatment and prevention of the common cold have gained particular notoriety and popularity. Areview of this product reveals that contains several ingredients such as zinc (8 mg), Echinacea (350 mg), and vitamins A, C, E, riboflavin, minerals (sodium, magnesium, selenium, potassium) as well as other herbs such as ginger, Chinese vitex, forsythia, and so forth. A review of the literature and the manufacturer's Web site highlightseveral testimonials but no scientific evidence of efficacy. RHINOSINUSITIS/ALLERGIC RHINITIS The CDC defines rhinosinusitis (previously referred to as sinusitis) as an inflammationof the mucosa of the sinuses and paranasal structures. It affects 31 million individualsin the United States each year with an estimated annual cost of $5.8 billion. 29Patients with bacterial sinusitis often report symptoms for more than 7 days, facial and/or teethtenderness and purulent nasal discharge. Viruses account for most cases of rhinosi-nusitis and most cases resolve spontaneously. Rhinosinusitis remains the fifth leading reason for which antibiotics are prescribed. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with bacterial symptoms. Surveys indicate that 24% to 32% of subjects with chronicrhinosinusitis use herbal therapy either alone or in combination with other treatments. 30 Allergic rhinitis is a common condition. Current estimates indicate that more than 50 million people in the United States suffer from allergic rhinitis. It is the most prevalent chronic condition in patients less than 18 years of age. People affected by the condi- tion often report fatigue and upper respiratory symptoms. Allergic rhinitis also leads to 40% to 80% of cases of chronic rhinosinusitis.31 In this section, the most common natural supplements marketed for the treatment of rhinosinusitis are reviewed. Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) and Other Vitamins Vitamin C is reported to inhibit histamine secretion by white blood cells.32There seems to be an inverse relationship between the ascorbic acid levels in the plasma and hista- mine levels. Initial studies show that oral supplementation of vitamin C can reliably lower blood histamine levels.33In a prospective trial, blood levels of several vitamins and minerals were evaluated in children (n 524, mean age 9.2 years) with chronic rhi- nosinusitis and compared with healthy controls (n 520). Vitamin C, vitamin E, copper, and zinc levels were significantly lower in the chronic sinusitis group compared withcontrols. 34Vitamin C might hold promise in the management of rhinosinusitis; however, evidence at this time does not allow for a definite conclusion. Urtica dioica (Stinging Nettle) Urtica dioica, also known as stinging nettle, has been traditionally used to treat allergicrhinitis. The exact mechanism of action is not known; however, studies do indicate thatthe plant is nutrient dense and that histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine are present in the plant's hairs. 35The authors could not identify any clinical studies on the use of stinging nettle for sinusitis; however, in 1 randomized, double-blind clinical trial,Kilgore & Najm 302subjects (n 569) who took freeze-dried (300 mg twice daily) Urtica dioica for the treat- ment of allergic rhinitis achieved positive results. All treated subjects reported improved global assessments, with 58% noting symptom abatement and 48% recording equivalent or increased response with Urtica dioica compared with previous medicine.36The safety of stinging nettle for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding has not been established. Caution is advised for patients with diabetes, bleedingdisorders, and those on diuretics. Bromelain Bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme obtained from pineapple, has usedto treat rhinosinusitis as an antiinflammatory and mucolytic. 37Bromelain seems to thin nasal secretions38in addition to its proteolytic activity at inflammatory sites, which is believed to promote the inhibition of proinflammatory prostaglandin biosynthesis.39 A study of children with acute sinusitis reported faster symptom recovery in children on bromelain compared with standard treatment.40This confirmed findings from an earlier double-blind study in which 85% of patients with acute and chronic sinusitis receiving bromelain had complete resolution of inflammation of the nasal mucosa (P<.05) compared with 40% in the placebo group.41Initial studies on bromelain seem to be encouraging but more evidence is needed. Bromelain oral dosage is typically 500 to 1000 mg/d. Side effects include allergic reaction to bromelain, indigestion, nausea, and diarrhea. The safety of bromelain for pregnant or nursing women, children, or people with liver or kidney disease is notknown. Quercetin Quercetin is found in many foods such as onions and apples. Its antiinflammatoryactivity seems to be a result of its antioxidant and inhibitory effects on inflamma-tion-producing enzymes. 42,43Quercetin is also found to stabilize mast cells, which inhibit release of histamine.44,45Clinically, quercetin seems to be helpful in the management of allergic rhinitis and seems to be therapeutically similar to cromolynsodium and oral antihistamine. In a small study (n 512) a nasal spray formulation con- taining an extract of quercetin was given immediately after the appearance of charac-teristic allergic nasal symptoms. All patients experienced a rapid and significantsymptom relief of nasal symptoms, comparable with the effect of antihistamine and chromoglicate preparations. The effect was felt within minutes after the administration and lasted for several hours. 46Despite the positive initial evidence, no additional studies have been published to confirm these findings. The common oral dose of 400 to 500 mg 3 times per day is typically used. Quercetin is generally safe. At large doses, there are some anecdotal reports of joint pain andgastric discomfort. Butterbur (Petasites hybridus) Butterbur is a plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). Butterbur is a robust plant with thick rhizomes and large rhubarb-like leaves that contain active compounds believed to be petasins, a group of sesquiterpenes. Butterbur was used traditionally as a remedy forheadache and inflammation. Clinical studies suggests that butterbur (standardizedextract Ze 339; 1 tablet 3 times daily) may effectively prevent allergicrhinitis similar to fex- ofenadine (Allegra) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) in susceptible individuals. 47,48However a study focusing on intermittent rhinitis is conflicting and suggest that it is no better than placebo.49The evidence is encouraging that butterburr may prevent allergic rhinitisCommon Respiratory Diseases 303but additional studies are needed to confirm this. Patients with liver disease or dysfunc- tion should avoid raw butterbur extract because of the potential for hepatotoxicity. Avoidif pregnant, breastfeeding, or allergic to butterbur. Other Therapies Acupuncture The World Health Organization identifies acupuncture as an effective treatment of allergic rhinitis, including hay fever. Several small trials report beneficial effect for allergic rhinitis and allergies. For example a 2004 randomized clinical study comparedactive versus sham acupuncture for 12 months in 40 consecutive patients with allergicrhinitis and a positive skin test. For 1 allergen, mugwort, a greater reduction in levels of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) (P 5.019, 0.039) and skin test reaction ( P5.004) was seen in the group receiving active acupuncture compared with the group receiving sham acupuncture. 50However, a recent systematic review identified 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), generally of poor quality, with the exception of 2 high-qualitystudies, as assessed by Jadad scale. 51A wide variety of outcomes were measured but most assessed symptom severity on a visual analog scale. A meta-analysis failed to show any benefits of acupuncture treatment on symptom severity scores or serum IgE measures that could not have been accounted for by chance alone. Acupuncturestudies looking at the treatment of sinusitis did not show an advantage over conven- tional treatments. 52,53These findings were confirmed by a recent systematic review of 7 high-quality RCTs.54Two RCTs compared acupuncture with oral pharmacologic medications and reported positive results in favor of acupuncture. One study reported favorable effects of acupuncture on a rhinitis symptom score and 1 found positive results for a nasal symptom score compared with placebo acupuncture. Three RCTs failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of acupuncture in treating or preventingsymptoms of allergic rhinitis. Overall the evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture for the symptomatic treat- ment or prevention of allergic rhinitis remains mixed. Studies fail to show beneficialresults for seasonal allergic rhinitis although some suggest evidence of effectiveness in the management of perennial allergic rhinitis. ASTHMA Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by reversibleairflow restrictions and associated symptoms of wheezing, chest tightness, and short- ness of breath. 55,56In the United States, it affects 22 million people of all ages, races, and ethnic groups, and is 1 of the most common chronic diseases of childhood.56,57 There are clear allopathic guidelines for treatment according to disease severity,57but the use of CAM for asthma is widespread. A survey by the National Asthma Campaignin the United Kingdom found that 60% of people with moderate asthma and 70% withsevere asthma had used CAM to treat their condition, and of the minority who had not yet used CAM, 67% indicated they would consider using CAM for their asthma in the future. 55A survey of CAM use in by people with asthma or rhinosinusitis in the United States found that 42% of the study population had used some form of CAM for their condition in the 12 months before the study.58 The most popular forms of CAM for asthma include herbs, breathing techniques (including mind-body relaxation techniques), homeopathy, and acupuncture.55,59 Studies on why patients turn to CAM treatments reveal a desire for personal control over treatment, the perception of effectiveness, safety, being more natural or holistic,Kilgore & Najm 304as well as dissatisfaction with side effects, costs, provider interaction, and approaches of conventional methods (Tables 2 and3).60-64 Given the prevalence of CAM use for asthma, and because most patients (>80%) who use CAM are simultaneously using allopathic treatments,58,65it is important for allopathic physicians to be aware of the common types CAM treatments beingused, and be able to counsel patients on current evidence for efficacy, risks, and potential interactions between therapies, especially involving herbs and pharmaceuticals. Herbals Herbal therapy is 1 of the most popular forms of CAM treatments for asthma.55,58,59 Four of the 5 classes of drugs currently used to treat asthma (b 2agonists, anticholiner- gics, methylxanthines, and cromones) have origins in herbal treatments going back atleast 5000 years. 66For example, ephedrine was developed from the traditional Chinese herbal remedy ma huang, tea leaves are the herbal origin of theophylline, and caffeine,found in tea and coffee, is a member of the same family as theophylline, and has beenused for centuries as a treatment of asthma. 65,67Like many CAM treatments, scientific evidence evaluating the effectiveness of herbal therapy for asthma has been marred bypoor study quality and flawed study design. Three systematic reviews of herbal thera-pies for asthma were conducted in the last decade, and although they used slightlydifferent methodologies, they all came to similar conclusions. In the most recent and most comprehensive review, 65the investigators found 27 studies assessing 21 herbal preparations involving 1925 participants that met the entry criteria of the review. Small sample sizes, disparate outcome measurements, and relatively short-term follow-up prevented any overall clear conclusion as to efficacy and long-term safety of herbal therapy for asthma. Mean duration of therapy was only 8 weeks. There were large vari-ations in the types of pulmonary function measurements, symptom scores, and types of subjective assessments, greatly limiting the ability of the review to perform combined outcome data assessments or subgroup analysis. With these limitations in mind, theresults of a few herbs merit comment. Boswellia serrata Boswellia is a branching tree found in India, North Africa, and the Middle East, and a close relative of the Biblical incense frankincense. The gummy oleoresin found underthe bark has been used for years in Ayurvedic medicine in India and in African coun-tries for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including arthritis and asthma. Its mech- anism of action in asthma is believed to be a result of its antiinflammatory properties, because resin extracts inhibit leukotriene synthesis and release. 68One 6-week randomized controlled trial of 80 adults with asthma reported improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), number of asthma exacerbations, and wheezing69but subsequent reviewers expressed concerns with significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups, raising questionsabout appropriate randomization, and about whether the groups were comparable. The Cochrane Review identified another small, double-blind RCT of 40 patients thatreported improvements in FEV 1as a percentage of predicted, but translated into only modest changes in actual FEV 1, and had no improvements in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or FVC%. Boswellia seems to be generally safe, although extensive studies of safety and toler- ability are lacking and there have been some references to gastrointestinal side effects in humans (epigastric pain, heartburn, nausea, and diarrhea) and findings of hepato- toxicity in 1 study of mice.

Boswellia powdered gum resin capsules 300 mg 3 times daily were used in the original trial. 70 Tylophora indica Tylophora is a climbing perennial plant that grows in India. Its mechanism of action seems to a result of the effects of tylophorine, a major alkaloid of Tylophora , on adrenal hormone stimulation, depressing cell-mediated immunity and suppression of IgE mediator release. In the Cochrane Systematic Review, Tylophora showed impressive short-term improvements in clinical outcomes of attack frequency and symptomseverity, and moderate improvements in lung function measurements but positiveeffects were not evident after 12 weeks, and investigators noted that this herb may not be suitable for chronic use because it is also associated with severe gastrointes- tinal side effects, sufficient to lead 1 of the investigators to include an antiemetic agentin the placebo comparator to mask treatment group assignment. In an earlier system- atic review 63identifying 5 randomized clinical trials, 3 demonstrated moderate improvement of symptoms, 1 with improved FEV 1, and 2 studies showed no signifi- cant improvement compared with placebo for the 2-week trials. Different formulationsand dosing regimens have been reported from various studies, but doses of 250 mg 1 to 3 times daily, 0.1% of tylophorine per dose, have been standardized. Safety dataonly exist for 6- to 14-day exposures, and adverse effects mainly seem to be gastro-intestinal, including nausea and vomiting, and these seem to be reduced if the leaves are taken in capsule form instead of chewing. Propolis Propolis is a natural flavonoid-rich resin produced from the buds of conifer and poplar trees then incorporated by bees into beeswax in combination with other bee secre- tions. There is preliminary in vitro and in vivo evidence that propolis suppresses the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and decreases the synthesisof prostaglandins and leukotrienes involved in inflammation. Propolis has also demon- strated antiiflammatory properties through its free radical-scavenging properties, as well as antimicrobial effects from several flavonoids.Table 3 Summary of alternative therapies used for treatment of asthma and their effectiveness Name Details Side EffectsScientific Evidence of Efficacy Acupuncture Variable points chosen dependingon studyRare; generally well toleratedNot effective but poor qualitystudies Homeopathy Variable agents used Not reported Not effective by good evidence Osteopathic manipulationVarious techniques usedNot reported Najm 308A small clinical trial71reported some improvement in lung parameters (FEV 1, PEFR, and forced expiratory flow 25%-75%), as well as a reduction in nocturnal attacks compared with placebo. Numerous case reports have demonstrated that propolis may be a potent allergen and sensitizing agent, and therefore it should be used cautiously in hypersensitive indi-viduals. There are no standard dosing recommendations, and preparations have been found to have highly variable compositions. Purple Passion Fruit Peel Extract A recent short-term Iranian study72of 42 patients involving a double-blind, random- ized, placebo-controlled trial of 150 mg/d of purple passion fruit peel (PFP) extract, a novel mixture of bioflavonoids, on asthma symptoms showed some promising results. The prevalence of wheeze, cough, and shortness of breath was reduced and FVC improved significantly in the group treated with PFP extract (P<.05)compared with placebo; however, the absolute improvement was relatively small, with unclear clinical significance and no significant improvement was observed in FEV 1. The investigators point to several possible intriguing mechanisms supporting a beneficial effect of PFP on asthma, citing effects of flavonoids in reducing asthmaticinflammation through their known antioxidant, antiallergic, and antiinflammatory prop- erties, as well as an observed effect on lowering nitrous oxide production. There was no adverse effect reported by any of the study participants, making this a compellingcompound for further study in larger and longer trials. Other Herbal Preparations Several other herbs demonstrated improvements in subjective asthma symptoms (eucalyptol, ginger, pulmoflex, Tj-96, Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan, Shen-Ling-Bia-Shu- San, and Jai-Wei-Si-Jun-Zi-Tang) or short-term steroid reduction in severe asthmatics(eucalyptol), but the validity of the study results were significantly undermined by poorstudy design and reporting quality. Studies of herbal therapies as a part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) also had frequent limitations; none of the trials used a placebo control, there were variable or unspecified ingredients, and after direct query by theCochrane reviewers, it turned out that more than 95% of the study investigators did not understand the concept of randomization, preventing any meaningful conclusion as to their efficacy. Summary Herbal Treatments for Asthma Boswellia ,Tylophora and purple passion fruit peel extract show some promise in asthma treatment, but further studies of efficacy and side effects that are larger andbetter designed are needed before these can be recommended for general use. Supplements Interest in treating asthma through dietary supplements is often based on concepts related to potential antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects as well as the idea that modern western diets are deficient in elements necessary or beneficial to normallung function. Elements that have been reputed to play potential roles include sele- nium, vitamins C and E, and omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil. Selenium Selenium gained interest in treating asthma based on studies that observed asthmapatients with lowered selenium status and lowered activity of the selenium-dependentCommon Respiratory Diseases 309enzyme glutathione peroxidase in asthma patients along with observational reports that selenium supplementation might be beneficial to patients with intrinsic asthmabecause of its important role in the cellular elimination of hydroperoxides. A Cochrane Systematic Review of the effects of selenium in asthma from 2004 73was only able to locate a single, small, double-blind RCT of 24 patients who were receiving standard asthma therapy. Those receiving a daily supplement of 100 mg sodium selenite for 14 weeks showed significant increases in serum selenium level and platelet gluta-thione peroxidase activity, and improvement in subjective asthma symptoms butfailed to demonstrate improvements in objective spirometry measurements. The investigators speculated that although it is possible that the supplemental dose given was too low and that a dose of 200 to 250 mg might be more beneficial based on other observational studies, they concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess theuse of selenium in clinical practice. A subsequent double-blind RCT in 2007 74using 100 mg for 24 weeks in 97 patients, documented significant increases in selenium serum levels, but showed nonsignificantimprovements in quality of life and no significant changes in lung function testing, leading the investigators to conclude that selenium supplementation offered no clin- ical benefit in chronic asthma. Vitamin C As 1 of the key antioxidant vitamins that is abundant in the extracellular fluid, vitamin C has been a supplement of interest in asthma, especially because adults and children with asthma have been found to have lower concentrations of vitamin C comparedwith normal subjects, and prior observational studies have showing that low vitamin C intake is associated with pulmonary dysfunction. It has been speculated that patients with asthma may have low supplies of vitamin C or an increased demandfor vitamin C in the face of an oxidant load resulting in depletion. A 2009 Cochrane Review 75of vitamin C use in seasonal, exercise-induced, and chronic asthma located a 9 studies meeting review criteria, with varying study protocols ranging from single dosing between 500 and 2000 mg, to daily supplementation between 500 and 1500 mg for time ranges of 1 week to 6 months. Because of poor data reporting and variable methodology, the investigators were only able to combine data for FEV 1measure- ments in 4 of the studies, and commented that the method of randomization, alloca-tion concealment, and blinding was not always clear, leaving the results open to bias. They found essentially no change in any of the study parameters, including lung func- tion, need for steroids, and subjective symptom scores, and concluded that furtherstudy with better trial design and larger-scale studies are needed. Vitamin E In a small double-blind RCT of another well know antioxidant, vitamin E, in daily dosesof 500 mg for 6 weeks failed to show any demonstrable benefit in lung function,symptom scores, bronchodilator use, or serum IgE levels in atopic adults with mild to moderate asthma. 76 Magnesium Magnesium has been recognized as useful intravenously for treating acute asthma exacerbations,77but data on its oral use for treating chronic asthma in outpatient settings have mostly shown no benefit. A small double-blind RCT study of 17 patients given 400 mg of magnesium a day for 3 weeks after previous exposure to a low magnesium diet showed improvement in asthma symptom scores, but no change inairflow parameters, airflow reactivity patients who received supplementation with magnesium (450 mg/d) for 16 weeks showed no beneficialeffect in any outcome measurement of asthma control, including airflow or reactivity measurements, symptom scores, or bronchodilator use. 79A recent double-blind RCT study of 37 children and adolescents using 300 mg of magnesium a day for 2 months demonstrated fewer asthma exacerbations, less salbutamol use, and decreased responsiveness to methacholine challenges and skin test responses to antigens, but had no change in spirometry values.80 Fish Oil and Omega-3 Fatty Acids Given the known influence of inflammatory mediators on asthma, fish oil supplemen-tation has naturally been a topic of significant interest for treatment and prevention of asthma, because of the known antiinflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids present in fish oil. Epidemiology studies have shown that populations (such as Eskimocommunities) with diets high in fish have low rates of asthma, and as diets in other communities have become higher in saturated fats, asthma incidence has increased. 81Two very small double-blind RCTs of only 10 and 16 patients with exer- cise-induced asthma using fish oil capsules containing 3.2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid and 2.0 g of docohexaenoic acid daily for 3 weeks demonstrated clinical improvement in pulmonary function response to exercise, decreased bronchodilator use, anddecreased sputum inflammatory mediators. 82,83However, a Cochrane Systematic Review in 200281failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit of the use of n-3 marine fatty acids supplementation for asthma. In the comprehensive review, the investiga-tors identified 9 studies that met study inclusion criteria, and found no convincingevidence that supplementation of diet with marine n-3 fatty acids leads to an improve- ment in asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, bronchial hyper-reactivity or FEV 1, nor was there evidence of risk or adverse effects identified. They concluded with 2 interesting caveats: first, that the studies concentrated mainly on supplementa- tion of marine n-3 fatty acids rather than eating more fish per se, and that perhaps there are other elements in the original food source that could have beneficial effectsfor asthma; second, that much of the interest in n-3 fatty acid supplementation for asthma began in the era when the neutrophil was considered to possibly have an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma, because the most profound antiinflam-matory effects of n-3 fatty acids are on neutrophil function and mediator generation.However, eosinophils and mast cells are now believed to be more important effector cells in asthma, and therefore this may explain their relative lack of efficacy, given that n-3 fatty acids lack significant antiinflammatory effect on eosinophils and mast cells invitro. In an extremely detailed and comprehensive review of omega-3 fatty acids in asthma by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2004, 84the investiga- tors were unable to derive any definite conclusion about benefit because of the paucity of evidence from well-designed, well-conducted, and adequately powered studies, citing limitations caused by missing data, flawed designs, and noncomparable studyparameters, but again found no significant evidence of harm. They made reference toan ongoing prospective study at that time looking at the use of omega-3 fatty acids for asthma prevention in children (Childhood Asthma Prevention Study), which was at its conclusion in 2007, that also failed to identify any beneficial protective effect. 85 Another more recent British systematic review in 2006 came to the same conclusions, and recommended a large, randomized, controlled study to effectively answer the question about omega-3 effects on asthma.86Common Respiratory Diseases 311Summary of Supplements for Asthma Other than some mild improvement in asthma symptom scores for magnesium supplementation that was not confirmed in a well-designed double-blind RCT, noneof the supplements demonstrated any benefit for use in chronic asthma. Other Complementary Therapies Acupuncture Acupuncture is a form of therapy derived from TCM involving the stimulation of points on the body with the use of needles for therapeutic or preventative purposes. The pointsare derived from TCM theory and relate to the meridians, a system that purportedly allows the flow of Qi through the body, blockages of which are believed to cause health problems. 87Three comprehensive systematic reviews in 2002, 2003, and 2006 evalu- ated the effect of acupuncture in asthma, each approaching the literature with slightly different criteria and review techniques. Martin and colleagues88searched for all RCTs since 1970 that compared acupuncture at real and placebo points and used at least 1 objective measurement of pulmonary function. They took estimates from the 11 trialsthat met inclusion criteria, and combined estimated standardized mean differences between acupuncture and placebo to estimate the overall effect. The Cochrane Systematic Review 87was only able to pool data for 2 outcomes (PEFR and global assessment of well-being) in the 12 RCTs involving 350 patients that met their criteria. The systematic review by Passalacqua and colleagues64looked at a variety of CAM modalities in asthma, including acupuncture, without doing meta-analysis. Despite the differences in approach, all 3 reviews arrived at similar conclusions. (1) With minor exceptions, the reviews basically found no significant evidence of efficacy for acupuncture in asthma, whether in lung function parameters, subjective symptommeasurements, or with medication usage. (2) As with herbal medications, study quality, sample size, missing information, and heterogeneity in measurements limited data pooling and the ability to draw useful, statistically significant conclusions. (3)Reviewers commented in particular about the challenge unique to acupunctureresearch in choosing appropriate placebo acupuncture points, noting that studies varied in choosing nonmeridian points versus nonindicated but legitimate acupunc- ture points for placebo control. The points used in the sham arm of some studieswere used for the treatment of asthma in others (according to TCM). Further hetero- geneity occurs with needle depth, duration of insertion, choice of laser versus needle, and the choice of either standardized points versus allowing treating providers to indi-vidualize and customize points depending on diagnoses made using a TCM nosology quite foreign to western physicians and research methods. They concluded with clear recommendations for larger studies with particular attention to the nature of sham/control points and including a no-treatment control arm in addition to sham groups,as well as the need for studies to include patients with more severe asthma. Homeopathy Homeopathy, founded by Hahnemann at the beginning of the 1800s, relies on the prin-ciple that symptoms of a disease can be cured by the same substances that provokethem when they are ultra diluted. Homeopathic remedies are selected according to symptoms and prepared with a special technique involving repeated dilutions. A recent systematic review 64identified 3 studies in asthmatic patients conducted with good methodology that showed no or marginal effects. Another well-done, random- ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial over 12 months in pediatric patients89 also failed to demonstrate any benefit in terms of peak flow rates, use of medication,Kilgore & Najm 312symptom scores, days off school, asthma events, or global assessment of change for homeopathic remedies as prescribed by experienced homeopathic practitioners. The 2004 Cochrane review90identified 6 trials with a total of 556 people. The inves- tigators noted significant methodological flaws with many studies, precluding poolingof results, but were not able to find evidence of benefit. Manual therapy Evidence for various forms of manual therapy (chiropractic, osteopathic manipulation,various physical therapy techniques) in asthma is mixed. Recent CochraneReviews 91,92found no significant benefit for chiropractic manipulation or the Alex- ander physical therapy technique, and noted methodological flaws in many studieslimiting informed conclusions. A randomized, single-blind, controlled trial of osteo-pathic manipulation therapy in 140 pediatric asthma patients showed a statistically significant improvement in PEFRs from 7 L per minute to 9 L per minute. However, the validity of the conclusions are potentially hampered by the nonblinded evaluator,and the different osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) techniques of different providers. Further study addressing these shortfalls was recommended. Mind-body (relaxation) therapies Three comprehensive review studies93came to mixed conclusions about the role for mind-body, relaxation, or breathing technique in asthma, with methodological flaws in study design once again posing challenges to deriving valid conclusions. Progressivemuscle relaxation, breathing retraining, and yoga appeared to have potential benefitsfor lung function, self-perceived well-being, and quality of life measurements, with further better designed studies recommended to derive more valid conclusions. A recent British RCT 94demonstrated improvements in quality of life measurements but there seemed to be no effect on asthma pathophysiology and therefore no change in the need for antiinflammatory medication. Small studies on the use of mental imagery, hypnosis, and biofeedback showed some promising results for theseapproaches that although clearly safe, also need further research to validate their effectiveness. 95-97 Summary of Other Complementary Therapies in Asthma Mind-body techniques seem to have some benefit for quality of life indicators in asthma; homeopathy seems to have no evidence of benefit and poor quality studieshamper conclusions about acupuncture and manual therapies. COPD COPD is a preventable and treatable disease that is frequently associated withsmoking, and characterized by chronic airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, is usually progressive, and is associated with abnormal inflammatory response to noxious particles or gases. 98Common symptoms are chronic and progressive dysp- nea and sputum production. In the United States, COPD affects more than 5% of theadult population and is the fourth leading cause of death and the twelfth leading cause of morbidity. 99Although there is no cure for COPD, smoking cessation is the only ther- apeutic intervention shown to reduce disease progression. Unsatisfactory treatment outcomes and side effects from conventional drugs, such as steroids and theophyl- line, contribute to the increasing popularity of CAM and, in particular, herbal medi- cine.100Studies show that between 33% and 41% of COPD patients admit to using some form of CAM101,102; the most common types include herbal and nutritional supplements, as well as garlic, acupuncture, and homeopathy. As with asthma, themain source of information on CAM practices are most often relatives, friends, andCommon Respiratory Diseases 313advertisements, with only a small number of the patients consulting with their physi- cians about CAM. This makes it important for physicians to be knowledgeable aboutthe scientific evidence for efficacy and safety of these practices (Table 4 ). Herbals There is a long history of using herbal remedies to treat COPD, particularly in China,India, and other Asian countries. Herbal expectorants, based on extracts from Hedera helix (ivy) or Thymus vulgaris (thyme) also enjoy considerable popularity in many Euro- pean countries. 100However, even more so than with asthma, quality evidenced-based studies on the use of herbal treatments in COPD are lacking. In the first and only comprehensive systematic review of the topic, done in 2006,100the investigators reviewed English, Chinese, and German literature, finally identifying 14 eligible RCTs, with placebo-controlled comparisons in 6. As with the asthma literature, themethodological quality was generally low, with problems caused by small sample size, lack of double blinding, use of a placebo control, unclear herbal content, and nonstandardized evaluation tools. Panax ginseng The roots of slow-growing perennial Panax plants have been used in China for more than 2000 years for various ailments. The major active components ofginseng are a diverse group of steroidal saponins, labeled ginsenosides, whichmay have a variety of actions, including potential antiinflammatory effects that may play a role in asthma. A well-designed double-blind RCT of 92 moderately severe (FEV 150%-65%) COPD patients in Israel demonstrated that 100 mg of ginseng extract capsules twice daily for 3 months resulted in significant improve- ment in all parameters of pulmonary function testing, including maximum voluntary ventilation, maximum inspiratory volume and V O2max with no observed side effects.103The improvement in airflow in major and peripheral airways as well as improvement in exercise capacity parallels previous studies on athletes. This was interpreted by the investigators as indications of positive effects on respira- tory muscle strength possibly caused by postulated neurotransmitter-like actions.Another very small Chinese study of 20 patients using a daily intravenous formu- lation of 3 herbs with Panax ginseng as the main ingredient for 14 days also showed improvements in pulmonary function (FEV 1and vital capacity) as well as 6-minute walk time and Borg symptom scores.104 In general, animal studies indicate that ginseng has very few toxic effects for either acute or chronic (up to 2 years) use, but some in vitro studies show that Panax ginseng may inhibit the aggregation of platelets, reduce platelet adhesiveness, reduce interna-tionalized normalized ratio (INR), and reduce warfarin increase its clearance. DCBT1234-Lung KR A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was done in India on 105 patients comparing 6 months of a plant-based formulation of 3 combination of oral salmeterol, theophylline, and bromhexineand both against placebo. 105Patients treated with DCBT 1234-Lung KR showed statistically significant O2compared with sal- butamol1 theophylline 1bromhexine, and control of symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, cough, expectoration, disability, and sleep disturbances, bothKilgore & Najm 314Table 4 Summary of alternative treatments for COPD NameSuggested Dose or Treatment Details Drug Interactions Side EffectsScientific Evidenceof Efficacy Panax ginseng 200-400 mg/d or components (Bryonia alba and ipecac ) have potentially serious adverse effects, bothrated as unsafeEquivocal Nutritional supplementationVariable Not noted Not effective by good evidence Acupuncture Variable points chosen depending on studyN/A Rare; generally well tolerated Possibly effective for dyspnea symptoms Osteopathic manipulation Various techniques used N/A One study report worsened air trapping and expiratory flowNot effective by limited evidence;may ratio; N/A, not applicable.Common Respiratory Diseases 315better than placebo. No mention was made in the article about adverse effects in any of the study arms. Concerns expressed by subsequent letter responses challengedthe use of nonstandard allopathic medications as control, pointing out that the combi- nation of oral salmeterol and theophylline poses known cardiovascular risks to COPD patients, and expressed concern about the issue of heavy metal poisoning associatedwith plant-based Ayurvedic medicines. Drosera species have been used for hundreds of years for respiratory tract prob- lems, and it is a fairly commonly used medicine as a solitary ingredient or as part ofcombination medications in roughly 200 to 300 registered medications. Testing of indi- vidual Drosera constituents reveals antiinflammatory, antispasmodic, and antibacte- rial effects, with minimal adverse effects although safety data are limited. Although purported to have some evidence of antitumor and antiinflammatory effects, Bryonia has been rated as unsafe with serious gastrointestinal, renal, and neurologic adverse effects reported. Ipecac is well known in the United States from its previously recom- mended role as an emetic in cases of suspected pediatric poisoning. That recommen- dation was rescinded several years ago, and there have been reports of myopathies and death with chronic use. 68,70Although this is a promising and interesting study done with reasonable methodology, further study is clearly needed regarding the effi- cacy, safety, and adverse effects of the individual herbal ingredients. Other Herbals Improvement in at least 1 measure of pulmonary function have been shown with Salvia miltiorrhiza ,Echinacea andHedera helix leaf extract, but the studies were small, failed to use placebo controls, or had other methodological flaws. A small Japanese RCT106 using 2.5 mg of the traditional Japanese herbal medicine Hochuekkito (a mixture of 10raw Japanese herbs, mixed in set proportions) given orally 3 times a day for 6 monthsshowed improvements in several markers of systemic inflammation and serum preal-bumin levels in older patients with COPD, but did not address pulmonary function. Most small studies of various TCM herbal preparations for COPD have significant methodological flaws that limit useful interpretation or recommendations. Nutritional Supplementation Although up to one-third of patients with COPD have some degree of malnutrition, often becoming severe in advanced or end-stage disease, it has been unclear whether malnutrition plays a causative role in clinical deterioration or whether it is merelya marker of other processes intrinsic to the disease. 107,108In a 2005 Cochrane Systematic Review of the topic,109the investigators identified 14 studies involving 487 patients meeting review criteria, the majority pertaining to outpatient-based oralsupplementation for at least 2 weeks to undernourished patients with COPD. Usingmeta-analysis, they found no evidence that simple nutritional supplementation confers benefit to patients with COPD in terms of clinical outcomes including measuring effects on anthropometric, functional exercise, pulmonary mechanics, peripheralmuscle function, and health-related quality of life derived from validated scales. Triceps skinfold thickness was marginally higher with supplementation than control, but was not associated with any other meaningful health improvements, suggestingthat some fat was deposited in the patients receiving nutritional supplementation but this change does not constitute a worthwhile response to therapy. However, it is worth noting that 2 weeks may be a short period of supplementation. The investigators note that explanations for a poor response to nutritional support have included increased metabolism, diet-induced thermogenesis, tissue hypoxia,the influence of increased levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors,Kilgore & Najm 316and medications such as corticosteroids, and that further research into combinations of nutrition with anabolic substances may prove worthwhile. However, 3 recent well-done, adequately powered, double-blind, randomized, creatine combined with exercise training111,112showed no difference in pulmonary function or functional exercise capacity. A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of meges-terol acetate of 128 patients did show a 4-mm decrease in Pa CO2, as a result of its known stimulatory effect on ventilation, and increased appetite associated with a 3.2-kg weight gain; but the weight was mainly fat and again, there was no benefit on respiratory muscle function or functional exercise tolerance.113 Other single placebo-controlled studies showed similar negative results for pome- granate juice, N-acetylcysteine, and vitamin E. Manual Medicine The osteopathic medical profession has developed a variety of techniques purported toimprove pulmonary function by targeting various aspects of the musculoskeletal, neuronal, and lymphatic components of the pulmonary system. 114,115Previous litera- ture consisting of small, nonrandomized studies has failed to provide a clear picture as to the efficacy and role of OMT in the treatment of COPD. Researchers at the Kirks- ville College of Osteopathic Medicine performed a well-designed, double-blind, RCT ofa single session of multitechnique OMT versus sham therapy in 35 patients more than 65 years of age, looking for evidence of immediate measurable changes in pulmonary function. They did find statistically significant evidence of pulmonary function change,but in the wrong direction: OMT-treated patients had worsening of residual volume, indicating more air trapping, and a decrease in forced expiratory flow. The investigators concluded that further study looking at the effect of individual techniques and studyinglonger-term pulmonary function responses to OMT will be important to understand ifCOPD should be a contraindication to the use of this therapy. Acupuncture Several small single-blind RCTs of between 4 and 10 weeks of acupressure andacupuncture have been done in patients with COPD, some with, some withoutplacebo/sham controls. 116-118Taking into account significant variations in technique, choice of outcome measurements, and methodological flaws in randomization andblinding of evaluators, all studies showed improvement in subjective symptoms ofdyspnea, with 2 studies showing improvements in either FEV 1or 6-minute walk distance. No report of adverse effects was made, and acupuncture was generallywell tolerated. Acupuncture shows promise at least in improving subjective symptomsof dyspnea in COPD, but better designed, larger trials are clearly needed before solidrecommendations can be made. Summary of CAM Therapies for COPD Acupuncture may play a role in improving walking distance and subjective symptoms ofdyspnea, although better studies are needed. Otherwise there is little evidence tosupportherbal therapy, and fairly good evidence that nutritional supplements are ineffective and osteopathic manipulation is potentially harmful until more extensive research is available. SUMMARY The self-medication phenomenon in upper respiratory tract infections, rhinosinusitis, asthma, and COPD are significant and will continue to increase. Current level ofCommon Respiratory Diseases 317evidence is poor because of the small number of good quality studies, small sample size, short duration, and variation in the composition of the herbal interventions ortherapies. The current review points to several potential therapies that could be effec- tive either alone, or as adjunct to conventional therapies. Caveats and Cautions One of the positive motivations for using CAM is perceived safety. However, there are risks with the use of herbal remedies including drug interactions, inconsistent dosing, contamination, and natural toxicity.119These risks are compounded by the tendency of patients to report neither their use of herbal treatments nor suspected adverse reactions of the herbal therapies to their physicians, compared with conventional over-the-counter medications, and because herbal therapy users tend to self-medicate or take the advice of a friend or relative, they are unlikelyto consult any practitioner at all on the use of herbal products. 120,121Blanc and colleagues122raise the concern that patients' use of alternative treatments may delay appropriate use of conventional medicines and thus, increase the risk forlife-threatening complications.
