This study reviews intergovernmentalreform in the region, distills key messages, high-lights positive experiences, and points out areaswhere policy makers will need to take priorityaction to avoid going down the wrong path. Whererelevant, the study draws on international experi-ence while recognizing the economic, political, andcultural factors unique to East Asia. The report has been written primarily for policy makers who are currently making decisions onthese issues, but academics, business people, anddevelopment practitioners should also find it use-ful. It does not attempt to provide an exhaustiveanalysis or a detailed practical manual on decen-tralization in East Asia. Space limitations do notpermit coverage of all facets of decentralizationthat may be important. Nor is every country in theregion included. Instead, the volume focuses on sixEast Asian countries where decentralization is amajor issue: Cambodia, China, Indonesia, thePhilippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The report isintended to be helpful in tracking progress ondecentralization in East Asia today and in guidingreforms as they go forward.

Book design, editing, and production were coor- dinated by the World Bank's Office of the Publisher.A fundamental transformation in the structure of government has been taking place across East Asia.Before 1990 most East Asian countries were highlycentralized; today subnational governments haveemerged as the fulcrum for much of the region'sdevelopment. They deliver many critical servicesand account for a significant fraction of total publicexpenditures (see figure 1.1). Though East Asia'sdecentralization has come later than in some otherparts of the world, it is now here to stay. From China to Cambodia to Thailand, countries of varying sizes, income levels, and political systemsare moving government down this path. Reformprocesses are under way in almost every country.Demands for accountable government whose serv-ices reach the grassroots effectively are on the rise.Thus, a wholesale recentralization of government isunlikely. With all that is invested in successfuldevelopment of these decentralized public sectors,the key question is no longer whether to decentral-ize. It is how best to design intergovernmentalstructures and manage the implementation processto achieve optimal results. In many countries initial progress is encourag- ing. Where decentralization \"leaps\" have beenattempted, as in Indonesia and the Philippines,they have gone fairly smoothly. Intergovernmentalfiscal systems have been institutionalized. Workershave been transferred from central ministries tolocal governments without significant disruptions.And local authorities have taken up their service- 11 EAST ASIA DECENTRALIZES Roland White and Paul Smoke delivery functions reasonably effectively. Where decentralization has proceeded more gradually, asin Cambodia and Vietnam, it has produced somegains in service delivery and public participation atthe local level. Decentralization has also unleashedlocal initiative and energy. New service-deliverymodels have begun to emerge, and the potentialfor continued improvement and innovation hasbecome tangible. But there have also been problems, and there is a real danger that programs could stall. While EastAsian decentralization does not pose the macro-economic risks confronted in other regions, it doesface three distinctive challenges, which play outdifferently in each country setting. The first chal-lenge relates to the design of sound intergovern-mental organizational arrangements. For example,unclear assignments of functions among levels ofgovernments threaten to sidetrack decentralizationreforms in some countries. The second challengeconcerns the development of robust financialmechanisms for channeling money to subnationalgovernments. In some countries, the failure toallocate sufficient own-source revenues to localgovernments could hamper their ability to deliverservices, for example. The third challenge relatesto the accountability of local governments andthe capacity of their management systems. Attenu-ated accountability and weak management\u2014ofboth financial and human resources\u2014could con-strain effective implementation of decentralized2 East Asia Decentralizes functions by subnational entities. In sum, the potential benefits of harnessing the power of sub-national government in East Asia are substantial.But national leadership across the region will becritical in responding consistently and systemati-cally to these three broad challenges if decentraliza-tion is to live up to its promise. This Study Clearly, governments in East Asia have an impor- tant stake in getting decentralization right. Theywill need to develop strategic approaches that fitcountry conditions but that also benefit fromregional and global lessons of decentralization.This study seeks to provide guidance to countryreformers by reviewing the East Asian experienceso far, and by furnishing an analytic perspective onthe design and implementation challenges that facepolicy makers in the region. This chapter sets the stage for more detailed dis- cussions in subsequent chapters. It provides anoverview of East Asian decentralization. First, itshows why decentralization is an important issuein the East Asian context by highlighting itsbroad implications for economic, governance, andservice delivery outcomes. The discussion thenexamines the origins of decentralization in EastAsia, pointing to structural and political factorsthat have driven the process. The approaches takenby East Asian governments are discussed, and anearly view of the record provided. The chapter proceeds to examine the three main intergovern-mental challenges outlined above, looking at theorganizational structures, financial mechanisms,and subnational government management andaccountability systems that have emerged in EastAsian countries engaged in the decentralizationprocess. This discussion touches on themes thatwill be taken up again in later chapters. Finally, thechapter distills some key messages for East Asianpolicy makers grappling with decentralizationissues. The ensuing chapters are organized as follows. Chapter 2 delves into greater detail on the frame-works, structures, and processes of decentralizationacross East Asian countries. Chapters 3 and 4 dis-cuss the macro-fiscal issues of maintaining fiscalsustainability and ensuring interregional equity.Chapters 5 through 7 explore the nuts and bolts ofdecentralizing public management systems, includ-ing public expenditures, revenues, and humanresources. Chapters 8 through 10 examine thenexus between decentralization and service deliv-ery in key sectors: health, education, and infra-structure. Chapters 11 and 12 cover governanceand citizen empowerment. Why Does Decentralization Matter for East Asia? Intergovernmental reforms adopted in the process of decentralization are important because theyinevitably affect broader country performancein three critical, interrelated areas: the economy,service delivery, and governance. The Economy East Asia's remarkable achievements in economic growth and poverty reduction over the past 30years can be attributed largely to significant publicinvestment in human capital formation and infra-structure, and to the establishment of a regulatoryenvironment conducive to private enterprise. 1With decentralization, subnational governments are nowat the heart of a range of investment, fiscal, and reg-ulatory activities that affect both the pace and qual-ity of economic growth. For example, they are nowresponsible for planning and financing economicFIGURE 1.1 Subnational Expenditures as a Share of Total Public Spending percent 020 1030 1769 32 26 1048 406080 to chapter 5, table 5.1.infrastructure, such as local roads and irrigation schemes, and for regulating and taxing businesses.In some East Asian countries, such as Cambodia,the role of local and regional authorities in theseareas is still limited. But in most, including Chinaand Indonesia, it has become crucial. There are fiscal dangers associated with decen- tralization. T o the extent that newly empoweredsubnational governments can transfer significantfinancial liabilities to the center, the expansion ofsubnational activities could generate macroeco-nomic risks for national governments. With thepossible exception of China, this has yet to emergeas a problem in East Asia. But local off-budget fiscalactivity, subnational borrowing, and inadequatelocal control of contingent liabilities are commonthroughout the region. These weaknesses, com-bined with deepening autonomy and expandingaccess to domestic and international capital mar-kets, could aggravate longer-term risk unless insti-tutional, regulatory, and monitoring systemsimprove. Service Delivery While many East Asian countries have strength- ened the delivery of public services in recent years(chapters 8, 9, and 10), profound problemsremain. It is precisely in the areas where these dif-ficulties are concentrated\u2014such as primaryhealth, education, and potable water supply\u2014that subnational governments in East Asia haveassumed most of their responsibilities. As dis-cussed in later chapters, performance in thesesectors has been mixed. In addition, subnationalgovernments have been required to assume regu-latory roles in areas (such as environmental pro-tection) for which they are poorly structured andhave little technical capacity. The concern is thatif local and intergovernmental systems do notfunction well, countries are unlikely to sustainpositive service-delivery trends, or to reverse neg-ative ones. The equity of service delivery is also a concern. Wide divergences in natural resource endowmentsand economic concentration, combined with thedesign of frameworks for own-source revenues atthe subnational level in most countries, have pro-duced pronounced horizontal fiscal inequalities inEast Asia. In China, the per capita own-revenue ofthe richest province is 16 times that of the poorest region. In Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam,own-source revenues are even more skewed. Suchdisparities can be mitigated by fairly designed sys-tems of intergovernmental transfers. In the absenceof such mechanisms, decentralization may rein-force inequitable distribution of services acrossjurisdictions, potentially posing serious concern forboth subnational and national political leaders inthe region. Governance While the successes that came to be known as the Asian Miracle were partly attributed to well-performing public sectors, serious deficiencies inpublic sector governance were evident in manycountries by the time the 1997 financial crisis hitEast Asia (World Bank 2000). Low levels of gov-ernment accountability, transparency, and probitycontributed to the calamity. Despite postcrisisefforts to reform these governance weaknesses,problems persist. In particular, institutions ofpublic financial accountability often divergestrongly from internationally accepted standards,especially with respect to procurement, account-ing and auditing, and performance managementand information systems in government (Mount-field 2001). Perception surveys suggesting that corruption runs deep and wide across East Asia are particu-larly vexing. Transparency International's 2003Corruption Perceptions Index ranks the six coun-tries covered in this report in the bottom half ofthe 133 countries surveyed, ranging from China at66 to Vietnam at 100 (Transparency International2003). The World Bank's Governance ResearchIndicators for 2002 show East Asia's control of cor-ruption in a steady decline since 1996 (Kaufmannet al. 2003). Country-specific diagnostic surveys inCambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand also point tothe high costs of corruption for households andenterprises alike. 2Recent Investment Climate Assessments in Cambodia and the Philippines pro-vide further evidence that graft\u2014pervasive in thejustice sector and revenue administration\u2014is amajor obstacle to doing business. 3 Decentralization magnifies these governance challenges for subnational governments. Opportu-nities to strengthen grassroots accountability areEast Asia Decentralizes 3paired with risks that, absent tight central controls, corrupt practices could proliferate (Bardhan andMookherjee 2000). Chapter 11 discusses theseissues at length, emphasizing the importance ofintergovernmental reform design to ensuring goodgovernance in decentralized contexts. What's Driving Decentralization? Decentralization is a process, not an event, and stipu- lating a starting point in any country is a difficult andsometimes controversial exercise. But there is broadconsensus that, for most countries in East Asia, inter-governmental reform gained significant momentumin the 1990s. The evolution of intergovernmentalreform has been distinctive for each country, butcommon dynamics can be identified. For the mostpart, long-run structural transformations\u2014mainlyeconomic and demographic\u2014have created an envi-ronment conducive to decentralization, while pow-erful political imperatives have precipitated andshaped it. Structural factors. In most East Asian countries, decentralization has been preceded by significantand continuous periods of economic growth andurbanization, broadly suggesting a relationshipamong these three phenomena (see table 1.1). As nations develop and urbanize, there is growing pressure to provide services to rapidlyexpanding and increasingly concentrated popula-tions (World Bank 2000). The challenges facingnational governments in effectively administeringservices create demands to empower subnationalgovernments to meet the burgeoning needs.Indeed, for developing and developed countriesalike, evidence shows that growth in per capitaincome is associated with a declining centralgovernment share in public investment (WorldBank 2000). Urbanization rates in the region are particularly informative. With the exception of Thailand inrecent years, urban growth rates over the lastquarter-century have been high for the six coun-tries under consideration here, particularly duringearlier periods in China, Indonesia, the Philippines,and Thailand. Although Cambodia and Vietnambegan urbanizing later, their urbanization rateshave accelerated and are projected to be substantialup to 2015. The interplay between economic growth, urbanization, and intergovernmentalreform in East Asia is not clearly understood. But,as in other parts of the world, the basic economicand demographic transformations in East Asiaseem to have created an environment conducive todecentralization, raising the stakes for intergovern-mental systems to function effectively (World Bank2000). Political factors. While these structural changes have generated pressures for decentralization,political factors appear to have been the more prox-imate and powerful drivers of the process. 4Demo- cratization appears sometimes to have been an im-portant trigger. In the Philippines and Indonesia,decentralization was adopted after the suddencollapse of authoritarian regimes (Marcos in 1986and Soeharto in 1997, respectively) fueled demandfor legitimate, local representation. Thailand'sprodemocracy movement in the 1990s pairedprotests against the inordinate role of the militaryin politics with the development of an initial decen-tralization framework. Explicit moves toward plu-ralism have not figured in China and Vietnam. Butin both cases, more audible demand for citizen par-ticipation and good government at the local levelhas driven decentralization. Certainly, the impedi-ments that China's sheer physical size poses toeffective central control has reinforced these ten-dencies through the refinement of an intergovern-mental framework that has long had quasi-federalfeatures (World Bank 2002a). Political dynamics have also shaped the nature of decentralization arrangements. In Indonesia, theneed to minimize the probability of provincial sep-aratism in the fragile post-Soeharto era produced asystem that favored subprovincial governments.Central political elites have also sought to preventthe emergence of regional provincial rivals bypushing authority and resources down to less pow-erful city and district levels of government. Facedwith calls for grassroots \"People's Power,\" post-Marcos regimes in the Philippines created multilay-ered systems that diffused subnational poweramong different jurisdictions, for example. In con-trast, low levels of party competition in China andVietnam may explain the relative administrativepower of the provinces, as these don't act as plat-forms for rival political interests.4 East Asia Decentralizes5TABLE 1.1 Economic and Demographic Trends in East Asia, 1975-2002 GDP per capita, PPP, Population 2001 2002 (in 1995 (millions) US$) 1975-1983 1984-1994 2.72 2.22 Cambodia 12 1,747 \u2014 \u2014 5.4/\u2014 Sources: Nations 2004, tables A.2 and A.6.

In response to these structural and political drivers, East Asian governments have taken differentapproaches to decentralization, combining standardelements of delegation, deconcentration, and devo-lution found in many intergovernmental reformsaround the world (see box 1.1). Country approachescan be divided into three broad categories: faststarters, incrementalists, and cautious movers. The fast starters (the Philippines and Indonesia) have rapidly introduced major structural, institu-tional, and fiscal reforms in response to a suddenand far-reaching political stimulus. Sweepingdecentralization reforms were introduced in thelate 1980s after the fall of Marcos in the Philippines,and through a \"Big Bang\" decentralization in the aftermath of Soeharto's fall and the 1997 financialcrisis in Indonesia. These fast starters introduced the basic elements of a decentralization framework,subnational democratic elections, and substantialresource sharing swiftly. Considerable follow-uppolicy and legislative work to create a fully coherentand functional system remains. The incrementalists (China and Vietnam) have taken a more piecemeal approach to decentraliza-tion. In China, the government made ad hoc policydecisions and passed legislation directly affectingsubnational governments (some decentralizing,some recentralizing), but decentralization is not anofficially documented policy. Instead, it is anchoredin historical realities and broader political and6 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 1.1 Variants of Decentralization: Pros and Cons Deconcentration refers to decentralization of cen- tral government ministries and arrangementswhereby subnational governments act as agentsof the center. Sometimes regional branches ofcentral offices and agent governments havesome authority to make independent decisions,usually within central guidelines. Often, though,deconcentrated local government lacks author-ity over the scope or quality of local services andhow they are provided. Under delegation , subnational governments rather than branches of central government areresponsible for delivering certain services, sub-ject to some supervision by the central govern-ment. Delegation may improve efficiency whensubnational governments can better administerprograms of national interest\u2014including certainaspects of education, water, and health\u2014inways that better reflect local circumstances. Thecenter, or sometimes intermediate government,determines what should be spent, and may alsoset minimum service standards, while subna-tional governments define the details. Thedesign of intergovernmental fiscal transfers, andthe degree and nature of central monitoring,influence the balance between central and localdecision making under delegation. Devolution is the most complete form of decentralization. Independent or semi-independent and, typically, elected subnationalgovernments are responsible for delivering a set of public services and for imposing fees andtaxes to finance those services. Subnationalgovernments have considerable flexibility inselecting the mix and level of services they pro-vide. Other levels of government may provideintergovernmental transfers. For devolutionto work, the central and local governmentsmust act as partners, with the former keeping itscommitment to devolve functions, and local offi-cials agreeing to make difficult choices anddevelop the capacity to exercise their powerseffectively. a Intergovernmental systems usually have some elements of each of these variants. In prin-ciple, devolution should improve efficiency bygiving citizens more influence over the mix andlevel of services, and by giving local govern-ments greater incentives to mobilize resources.The associated efficiency gains\u2014combined withthe ability to mobilize untapped revenues at thesubnational level (from the formal and informalsectors)\u2014may prove particularly significant incountries with diverse economies, cultures,geography, or tastes for services. Indeed, assign-ing some local control over expenditure and taxdecisions can be key to nation building. a. Bahl 1999.economic reforms. In Vietnam, decentralization policy has been more formal than in China, involv-ing a sequence of specific legislative measures. Butwith the exception of a few bolder, asymmetricexperiments in some of the major cities, decentral-ization in Vietnam has been limited and incremen-tal. In both cases, decentralization has focused onadministrative and fiscal reform, with modestpolitical change and the retention of considerablecentral control over subnational governments (inlaw and policy if not always in practice). Cautious movers (Cambodia and Thailand) have established significant elements of decentralizationat the formal policy and legislative levels, but therehas been limited progress with implementation. InThailand, the ambitious decentralization frameworkdeveloped in the wake of the 1997 Constitution hasbeen only partly implemented. In Cambodia, electedcommune councils have limited functions andreceive only modest resources. The provincial sys-tem is stronger but heavily managed by national line ministries and centrally appointed governors. Onlyrecently has the government undertaken furtherwork on devolution policy. In both countries, thecommitment to extensive decentralization appearsto be limited. Cross-Country Trends The broad categories outlined above describe a cluster of characteristics related to the pace andtiming with which different countries have intro-duced decentralization. Other features of decen-tralization in the region defy straightforward classi-fication. There is an ongoing unevenness in the wayin which decentralization is being planned andimplemented across countries. For example, the degree to which countries uti- lize consistent and intentional policy frameworks toguide reform varies considerably and appears unre-lated to the pace or appetite for reform. Indonesiadecentralized faster than any other country in theregion, but the Big Bang took place in the absenceof a comprehensive policy framework. While recentrevisions of the key Indonesian framework laws(Laws 22 and 25 of 1999, now Laws 32 and 33 of2004) have clarified outstanding issues in the gov-ernmental transfer system, many other policyelements\u2014such as the regulatory frameworks forsubnational borrowing\u2014have yet to be defined.China lacks even the incomplete policy framework of the Indonesian case but has gradually developedone of the most decentralized intergovernmentalstructures in the region (World Bank 2002a). Incontrast, countries with well-developed, more com-prehensive policy frameworks have yet to imple-ment decentralization reforms. Thailand's decen-tralization framework is elaborated in great detailin the Constitution, in law, and through parliamen-tary and cabinet decisions, but the country has beenslow in carrying out reforms. 5 Decentralization in East Asia is a complex blend of characteristics in other respects as well. Decentral-ized subnational governments have, for the mostpart, been assigned substantial functional mandatesand responsibility over large fractions of total publicspending. And even where limited recentralizationhas taken place (such as in China in 1994), this was atemporary move to improve system performance. Sothe trend has been mainly toward greater localautonomy\u2014albeit at varying rates. The difficulty,however,isthatthistrendcoexistswithweakintergov-ernmentalinstitutionalenvironmentsandarecordofgenerally poor (while in some instances improving)performance of core mandates by most subna-tional governments. In some countries (Indonesia,the Philippines) centralized, top-down systems foreconomic investment and service delivery haveweakened. Oversight and regulation of the emergingintergovernmental arrangements are undeveloped.And local systems\u2014lacking appropriate bottom-up incentives and human resource capacity\u2014are not inplace to take up the slack. The result is a kind of \"institutional limbo\" which typifies decentralizing environments internation-ally. In East Asia, it has two main features. First,whether by design or as a result of slippages in theimplementation process, intergovernmental struc-tures have substantial internal inconsistency. Thefunctions of different levels of government overlap.Bottom-up accountability of locally elected bodies isdampened by top-down methods for appointing keyofficials. And the discretion given to local authoritiesin spending unconditional fiscal transfers is effec-tively curtailed by central government control overhuman resources. The aforementioned substantialcapacity constraints\u2014both local and central\u2014compound these policy and design deficiencies. Second, the decentralization process itself has slowed, even among countries that had been on theEast Asia Decentralizes 7more accelerated, \"fast starter\" path described above. For example, repeated attempts to reviseaspects of the Local Government Code in thePhilippines have borne little fruit, and there are fewsigns of significant advances in implementing otherkey policy initiatives (e.g., the reform of the InternalRevenue Allotment grant system). In China, recentintergovernmental reform has become more mod-est, restricting its focus to introducing equalizingadjustments to the existing central-provincial fiscaltransfer system. Reforms that would address morefundamental problems, such as those of subna-tional debt, do not seem to be on the immediatehorizon. In Indonesia, aspects of Law 32 of 2004represent a tightening of central control over localbudgeting and own-source revenue decisions, alter-ing the more deliberate move toward subnationalautonomy present in the initial phases of the BigBang reforms. Of course, policy and design inconsistencies, along with stop-and-start progress, characterizeinstitutional reform processes in developing coun-tries around the world. Progress is rarely monoto-nic, and policy reconsideration and reformulationcan even be sensible and salutary. T o the extentthat such fits and starts reflect problematic aspectsof the decentralization process in East Asia, how-ever, they are mainly explained by political andbureaucratic conflicts, which break down intothree broad types. First, conflicts between national agencies and subnational governments\u2014usually over the pace ofdecentralization and resource questions (such asrevenue allocations)\u2014have been gaining impor- tance. Some conflicts are explicit and formal, such aspublic disputes between central and local govern-ment officials over jurisdictional issues. Some areinformal and implicit, such as disputes betweenlocal and central authorities over local tax bases andthe regulatory powers of subnational governments.The latter are particularly prevalent in countrieswhere the law remains unclear. In Indonesia, localauthorities have increasingly begun to assert them-selves in competition with central and provincialgovernment in local business regulation. In China,local governments have disputed centrally imposedfiscal constraints and raised local revenues outsidethe regular budget in response. Second, in most East Asian countries, con- flicts among central agencies themselves over theleadership and direction of decentralization are widespread: In Indonesia, the recently completed modifica- tion of Laws 22 and 25 (now Laws 32 and 33 of2004) was complicated, and hence delayed, bypolicy disagreements between the ministries ofFinance and Home Affairs. In fact, these lawsnow provide for simultaneous regulatory juris-diction of both ministries over a number ofsubnational fiscal and financial matters. In Cambodia, responsibility for policy develop- ment and implementation of decentralization isdivided across a number of key interministerialagencies, and coordinated progress has provendifficult. Only recently has the central govern-ment attempted to institute a single process ofpolicy development on issues related to decon-centration and decentralization, backed by aprogram of joint donor support. In the Philippines, it appears that opposition from major government banks has played a rolein ensuring that the legal and regulatory envi-ronment for local borrowing continues to placeprivate investors at a competitive disadvantage(World Bank and Asian Development Bank2003; Pellegrini and Ma 2002). In contrast to other regions, finance ministries in East Asia are less active in managing decen-tralization than are ministries of Interior, HomeAffairs, or Planning, which have strong incen-tives to limit local autonomy. These central min-istries often prevail, as those who would cham-pion decentralization tend to be less powerful. Third, in some countries, conflicts over the scope of decentralization have become an issuebetween elected political leaders and administra-tive bureaucracies. For example, the IndonesianParliament developed its own bill to reform Law 22,as an alternative to the legislative drafting efforts ofthe ministries of Finance and Home Affairs. Similardynamics appear to have slowed attempts to reformaspects of the intergovernmental transfer system inthe Philippines. While these conflicts may be no more pro- nounced in East Asia than in other decentralizingregions, it does appear that they have seriouslyimpeded progress on key reforms in some coun-tries (Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines). 8 East Asia DecentralizesEven where agreement has been reached among central agencies on intergovernmental frameworks,the arrangements that have been struck tend to fixin place confusion over functional mandates thatperpetuate interagency squabbles which, in turn,slow implementation. Moreover, in a number ofcountries, the absence of clear intergovernmentalreform policies, combined with weak managementcapacity at the center, has generated incentives andopportunities for local authorities to work outsidethe formal system. Indeed, almost half of Chinesesubnational government revenue is, by someestimates, not captured in formal local budgets(Ahmad et al. 2000). With decentralization, localpayrolls for temporary workers have expandedin the Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, andVietnam. Indonesian businesses are increasinglysubject to regulation and taxation imposed by localordinances that have not been harmonized withexisting central government legislation. These prac-tices are largely the unintended result of inade-quately designed reform programs, and illustratethe difficulties countries face in trying to system-atize decentralization policies. Early Impacts Despite initial anxiety in many countries, the effects of decentralization in East Asia appear to have beenlargely benign so far. In particular, there seems notto have been a systematic deterioration in the deliv-ery of key services, a major preoccupation in manycountries. Indeed, while subnational governmentshave had difficulties with service delivery, so havesome central governments. These are still earlyimpressions. Comprehensive assessment of theeffects of decentralization is yet to be done. But ini-tial trends can be detected in three broad areas:resources (particularly fiscal resources), outputsand outcomes, and propoor service delivery. 6 Spending Envelopes Overall, decentralization seems to have had a posi- tive effect on aggregate fiscal spending. In health,average annual expenditure in Indonesia andVietnam remained constant as a proportion ofgross domestic product (GDP) during the mostintense decentralization reforms, from 1997 to2001. In the Philippines, health spending at thelocal level exceeded that at the national level by2001, while total health spending remained in line with other East Asian countries. In education, thepositive trend is more pronounced. In China, edu-cation spending nearly tripled as a share of totalexpenditure from 1978 to 2001 (from 6.7 to 18 per-cent). In the Philippines, total government spend-ing on education grew from just over 2.5 percent towell over 4 percent of GDP between 1991 and 1998.In Indonesia, the share of spending on education has risen to 4 percent of GNP from only 1.4 percentbefore decentralization. The subnational shareof education resources has also increased, partlybecause funds and functions have been transferredto the local level, and partly because local govern-ments are expected to mobilize additional resourcesto perform these functions. The record on infrastructure is mixed. Local infrastructure investment in China has recentlybeen sustained at high levels, but an initial postde-centralization spending surge in the Philippines hasgiven way to a slow but steady decrease in spendingsince 1995. There are some indications that hori-zontal disparities in spending in some sectors havewidened during decentralization (education inChina). But this has not been widely found andis not entirely consistent with the evidence onservice-delivery outcomes. Outputs and Outcomes The positive trends in health outcomes in East Asia that began in the 1980s have been broadly sus-tained through the period of decentralizationreform. During the period of intensive intergovern-mental reform in Indonesia, the Philippines, andVietnam, infant mortality rates (IMRs) fell and lifeexpectancy grew steadily, albeit slowly. In somecountries, gaps in health status between rich andpoor local governments have narrowed markedly.In the Philippines, the difference in IMRs betweenthe richest and poorest regions was further reducedin the 1990s, and by 2000 the IMR of the poorestarea was lower (Eastern Visayas, at 10.7 per 1,000live births) than that of the richest (Manila, 19.4per 1,000) (chapter 8). This favorable trend wasdue, in part, to improved health outputs and serv-ice coverage that extended its subnational reach:the proportion of births attended by trained healthpersonnel, and the share of the population withaccess to water or sanitation, rose discernibly overEast Asia Decentralizes 9the postreform period. Similar trends were evident in education during periods of intergovernmentalreform. As China decentralized, literacy rates rosefrom 1982 to 1999, most dramatically in the poorerregions. (Further examples of service-delivery trendscan be found in chapters 8, 9, and 10.) Service Delivery to the Poor The impact of decentralization on the poor is not well understood. National decisions related todecentralization (fiscal equalization, nationallymandated service levels) affect the poor. So do localprocesses (budgetary allocations, planning deci-sions, and service mix and quality). In 2001, prede-centralization survey data on perceptions amongIndonesian households of service delivery sug-gested that the poor knew less about programs andpolicies affecting them than did other groups. Apostdecentralization follow-on survey is under wayto understand these issues more deeply. Bettermonitoring and evaluation\u2014and more data\u2014areneeded to get a fuller picture of service deliveryperformance in poor communities throughout theregion. Intergovernmental Systems: What Challenges Do East AsianCountries Face? As countries in the region continue to decentralize, they will need to design and implement reforms oftheir intergovernmental systems in the three broadareas touched upon earlier in this chapter. These include the organizational arrangements that con-stitute a country's basic intergovernmental struc-ture; the financial resources that subnationalgovernments can mobilize and the way they aredistributed; and the management and accountabil-ity systems that govern resource allocation andcontrol at the subnational level. The following dis-cussion highlights the key characteristics of thesechallenges. It draws on international experience tostimulate thinking about pitfalls to avert and inno-vative approaches that might be adapted to eachcountry's circumstances. Organizing the Intergovernmental System The first broad challenge faced by decentralizing East Asian governments is how to design theorganizational structures of the intergovernmentalsystem. This section examines how functions andexpenditure responsibilities are assigned, exploresissues related to coordination among intergovern-mental structures and subnational entities, andexamines questions of special configuration andsubnational boundaries. Functional and Expenditure Assignments .S u b - stantial functions have been assigned to subna-tional governments in East Asia (see table 1.2). Butin most countries, specific responsibilities areunclear, and overlaps among the different levels ofgovernment are common. In Indonesia, despiterecent legal revisions (Law 32 of 2004), a lack ofclarity regarding central and subnational functions 10 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 1.2 Expenditure Shares and Functional Allocations in East Asia Subnational expenditureFunctional allocationsb Country (% of total)aEducation Health Social welfare Cambodia 17 Provincial Provincial Provincial China 69 Local Local LocalIndonesia 32 Local Local LocalPhilippines 26 Central, Central, Central, provincial, local provincial, local provincial, local Thailand 10 Central, provincial Central, provincial Central, provincialVietnam 48 Provincial, local Provincial, local Provincial, local Sources: Various country case studies prepared for this report and World Bank statistics. a. 2001, except for China, Indonesia, and Vietnam (2002). b. \"Provincial\" refers to the level immediately below the central or national level; \"local\" refers to all levelsbelow the provincial level. Classifications vary across countries; municipalities, for example, can be at eitherthe intermediate level (as in Cambodia and Vietnam) or the local level (as in the Philippines and Thailand).remains, as do a number of inconsistencies between Law 32 and various sectoral laws (such as Law 31 of2004, which assigns all fisheries functions to thecentral government). In the Philippines, someclauses in the 1991 Local Government Code appearto distribute functions unambiguously across levelsof government, but this clarity is diluted by otherclauses allowing both national government agen-cies and local government units to initiate devolvedactivities. In China, there is no national law thatclarifies the functions of each level of local govern-ment; expenditure assignments are decided by theprovinces and thus differ across regions (WorldBank 2002a). Achieving greater de jure clarity on functional mandates will not entirely eliminate vertical intera-gency conflict, and even mature intergovernmentalsystems are characterized by some dynamic tensionover jurisdictional issues. But East Asia may be ableto learn from countries that have faced these ques- tions in other parts of the world. As with manyother issues, solving these problems is usuallyabout overcoming political obstacles more thantechnical challenges, and an ongoing dialogueinvolving various stakeholders will be necessary toresolve these challenges in most countries. Organization of Intergovernmental Structures and Coordination among Subnational Entities .T h e character of decentralization varies considerablyacross East Asian countries, ranging from decon-centration to devolution, and encompassing dif-ferent levels of subnational government. The inter-governmental structures in turn have varyingimplications for the scope of intergovernmentalcoordination, both among subnational govern- ments and between subnational governments andthe center. All East Asian countries have multiple levels of subnational administration or government, but thestructures vary widely (table 1.3 and chapter 2).These variations make simple cross-country com-parisons difficult, but a rough pattern of verticalorganization is evident. Intergovernmental struc-tures in Indonesia and the Philippines are orientedtoward the subprovincial level, though interprovin-cial variations in size, wealth, and influence arewide. In both, however, countries now have limitedpowers and functions relative to subprovincialgovernments\u2014perhaps to the point that beingprecluded from oversight, coordination, and regula-tion of city and district governments has becomedysfunctional for the intergovernmental systemas a whole. Subnational structures in China andVietnam focus more on the intermediate level.These are \"nested hierarchies,\" in which central gov-ernment determines the overall character of the sys-tem and deals directly only with provincial adminis-trations; provinces oversee subprovincial levels; andso on (World Bank 2002). This has allowed thedevelopment of significant variation in fiscal andinstitutional arrangements below the provinces. Cambodia and Thailand are at the other end of the spectrum, with the most centralized structuresin the region. In both, there are elected subprovin-cial governments, but they have not been assignedsignificant resources, authority, or functional man-dates. In Cambodia, provinces operate fully underthe control of the center. In Thailand, provincesEast Asia Decentralizes 11 TABLE 1.3 Vertical Organization of Intergovernmental Systems in East Asia Average population of Levels of Number of first-tier first-tier subnational subnational subnational governments Country governmentagovernments (millions, 2002) Cambodia 2 24 0.5 China 4 32 40.0Indonesia 3 32 7.0Philippines 4 149 0.5Thailand 3 76 0.8Vietnam 3 61 1.3 Sources: Various country case studies prepared for this report and World Bank statistics. a. \"Level\" refers to an organ of government with some degree of formal budget (expenditure) authority.In some cases (such as Indonesia), this can be highly circumscribed, particularly at the lowest levels.have some independent functions in principle, but their realization in practice has been limited. When planning and budgetary authority is dis- persed laterally and devolved downward, there is aneed for horizontal coordination across subna-tional entities and vertical coordination amonglevels of government. As the responsibilities of localauthorities expand, the effects of their activities canspill over into neighboring jurisdictions, intensify-ing the need for horizontal cooperation acrossboundaries. This area has not yet been well studied,but initial indications are that horizontal coopera-tion has generally been weak in the region. Thereare some examples of progress in some sectors,such as the Joint Health Councils in Y ogyakarta,Indonesia (chapter 8), but these tend to be excep-tions. Some donor projects are attempting to intro-duce incentives to stimulate such cooperation\u2014inChina, for example\u2014but systematic initiatives arenot common in the region. Vertical coordination between central and sub- national governments is also critical for majorplanning and investment activities. In Indonesia,provinces are reportedly encountering difficultiesin facilitating cooperation across local govern-ments, leading to underperformance in tasks withlarge spillover effects and significant economies ofscale, such as ocean management. An ongoingtug-of-war between the center and the regions oninvestment approval and land has cooled localinvestment (World Bank 2003b). These difficultiesare related in part to the underlying lack of clarityin the division of functions and powers among thedifferent levels of government\u2014and in part to thechanging scope and diminishing authority ofnational planning agencies under decentralization.T o maintain efficient planning, budgeting, andregulation of infrastructure investment, govern-ments need to make conscious efforts to developmodels of vertical and horizontal cooperation thatcan function in a more complex institutionallandscape. There are many international examples of suc- cessful intergovernmental cooperation. A numberof these lie in the area of tax administration. In theUnited States, the sovereignty accorded the statesby the constitution has created a highly independ-ent system of tax administration and generated theneed for cooperative arrangements between stateand federal tax authorities. These arrangementsaim primarily to improve tax compliance and enforcement, including the exchange of personaland corporate information between federal andstate levels and across states. This exchange may beaccomplished either through a voluntary uniformexchange of information or through separate bilat-eral exchange agreements. At present, 45 states usethe uniform exchange of information agreement asa framework for exchanging this kind of taxpayerinformation\u2014and for cooperative activities tocombat tax avoidance (Duncan and McLure 2005;Ebel and Taliercio 2004). 7 In Estonia, localities have the authority to levy local gross receipts taxes and then verify taxpayerreports by checking reported gross receipts againstthe central government's V AT declarations. T o en-force the tax payment, localities may choose todeny operating licenses to businesses that have notpaid the tax and/or they may choose to contractwith the National Tax Board for collection of thetax (Sootla et al. 2000). Mexico presents a specialcase of cooperative administration whereby thecentral government may enter into agreement withstates to audit and otherwise verify compliancewith federal laws in exchange for a portion of thefederal revenues. States thus reduce costs of admin-istration by using their knowledge of the localeconomic activity, which the central governmentmight not possess (Mikesell 2003). Spatial configuration and boundaries of subna- tional entities . The wide variation in the structure of subnational governments across East Asia isconsistent with the political and geographic diver-sity in the region. As decentralization has pro-gressed, two important concerns have emerged forthe spatial organization of local authorities. First,there is the question of the administrative effi-ciency and capacities of subnational units. InCambodia, studies have raised issues about the abil-ity of communes to operate effectively given theirvery small sizes (1,600 communes serve 12 millionpeople) (Rusten et al. 2004). In Indonesia, wherearound 400 kabupaten /kota 8governments serve well over 200 million people, the limited politicalconnectivity between decision makers and con-stituents in large districts is often consideredproblematic. Second, there is more fragmentation of subna- tional jurisdictions. In Indonesia, the number ofkabupaten and kota increased from 292 to 43412 East Asia Decentralizesbetween 1998 and 2003; in Vietnam, the number of provinces expanded from 61 to 64 during 2003.This fragmentation raises questions about whetherthe process for creating new subnational units cre-ates incentives for increasingly inefficient local gov-ernment structures. Recent research on Indonesia,for example, indicates that \"perverse fiscal andbureaucratic rent-seeking initiatives also may be atwork in the creation of new regions\" (Filtrani et al.2004, p. 3). Proliferation often introduces substan-tial instability in local institutional frameworks,discouraging economic investment and possiblyundermining the institutional consolidation neededfor effective government administration. East Asia has much in common with other regions here. Decentralization in a number ofAfrican, Central European, and Latin Americancountries has been characterized by a proliferationof local governments, sometimes to the pointwhere the average unit has become inefficientlysmall (Bird et al. 1995). In some of these instances,fragmentation has been followed by a later phase ofconsolidation, in others not. These dynamics are tosome extent intrinsic to decentralization. But inter-national experience provides examples of transpar-ent processes that force a more objective examina-tion of technical factors\u2014such as the impact ofboundary changes on the fiscal position andadministrative capacities of local authorities\u2014andthat appear to lead to more rational outcomes.South Africa is worth examining in this regard. In2000 it rationalized a wasteful and dysfunctionalsystem of more than 800 local authorities into 284 municipalities and districts by introducing legisla-tion and establishing an independent, nonpoliticalbody to scrutinize local government boundaries onthe basis of detailed, technical criteria. While thefinal boundary determinations were not withoutcontroversy, the overall streamlining of the systemis widely regarded as having laid the platform for amajor improvement in local government efficiencyand operations (Glasser and White 2004). Accessing and Distributing Financial Resources The second common challenge in East Asia's inter- governmental reform relates to access by subna-tional governments to financial resources. Thisdiscussion covers fiscal resources such as own-source revenues and intergovernmental transfers,as well as local government borrowing activitiesand the extent to which they are subject to hardbudget constraints. Own-source revenues. East Asian decentraliza- tion has been characterized by a relative lack ofown-source revenue autonomy, in both the rangeof local revenue sources assigned to subnationalgovernments and their authority to determine thetax base and rate. As in other areas, comprehensivedata on fiscal arrangements are not available formost countries in the region, but table 1.4 presentsan informed impressionistic overview of key fea-tures of the intergovernmental fiscal structure,including own-source revenues (see chapter 6). East Asia Decentralizes 13 TABLE 1.4 Subnational Fiscal Structure of Selected East Asian Countries Own-source Unconditional Conditional Informal Country revenues Shared taxes transfers transfers revenues Cambodia Low Low Highan.a.bHigh China Moderate High Low High HighIndonesia Low Moderate High Low ModeratePhilippines Moderate Moderate High Low ModerateThailand Low High Moderate Moderate LowVietnam None High Low High Moderate Sources: Subsequent chapters and unpublished country case studies prepared by World Bank staff for this report.Note: \"Low,\" \"moderate,\" and \"high\" refer to the rough proportions of total subnational revenues attributable to each revenue source relative to international experience. a. Refers only to the commune level.b. Most \"provincial\" agencies are deconcentrated arms of central ministries, so the term \"transfer\" doesnot apply.A brief survey of typical own-source revenues in East Asia demonstrates the overall lack of subna-tional autonomy. Among the six countries consid-ered in this study, none permits personal incometaxes or general sales taxes at the subnational level.The real property tax on land or on land and build-ing improvements is effectively a national tax inIndonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand. Real estate(property) taxes are a potentially robust source oflocal revenue, but they are either permitted onlyon a very narrow base, as with unused land inCambodia, or subject to maximum rates set by thecenter, as in China and the Philippines. Businessreceipts taxes are also underused, except in thePhilippines and China, where they constitute abouta third and a fifth of local revenues, respectively.Some decentralization laws allow the imposition ofmodest excises and fees, including those on motorfuel in Indonesia, vehicle and vessel use in China,markets in Cambodia and Indonesia, and publictransportation in Thailand. One result of this limited authority over subna- tional tax policy is increasing informality, throughwhich subnational governments seek \"unofficial\"sources of revenue. Allowing subnational govern-ments to enact new taxes and fees has generatedsome productive entrepreneurial behavior in sev-eral countries, but it has simultaneously createdproblems. Chinese subnational governments havedeveloped an abundance of \"illegal\" extrabudgetaryfees, with distortionary effects. In Indonesia, aproliferation of \"nuisance\" taxes yields limitedrevenues, imposes high administrative costs onsubnational governments and compliance costs ontaxpayers, and, in some cases, impedes inter-regional trade. Subnational governments in thePhilippines have created a complex variety of taxes,fees, and charges, many of which are uncollected orundercollected. Weak local revenue authority creates depen- dency on higher levels of government, restrictssubnational autonomy, and undermines the linkbetween services and finance needed for stronglocal accountability\u2014a key factor in successfuldecentralization. Combined with the incentives forpoor collection of allowable taxes and fees and theproliferation of \"illegal\" taxes, this contributes to aculture of noncompliance and undermines theintegrity of the fiscal system. Although politicaldynamics pose serious challenges in this area, thereis significant scope\u2014and an imperative\u2014for most East Asian countries to empower and encouragesubnational governments to generate revenues. Intergovernmental transfers. Subnational gov- ernments are invariably in a better position tospend resources than to raise them, so intergovern-mental transfers form a substantial part of the pub-lic sector fiscal structure in most countries. InOECD countries, subnational governments dependon transfers to finance about 40 percent of theirexpenditures, on average, with the numbers forEastern Europe and Central Asia, and for LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, slightly lower, andthose for Africa closer to 60 percent (Ebel andYilmaz 2002). 9 East Asia follows this pattern, with transfers accounting for significant but widely varyingproportions of total local revenue, ranging fromnearly 100 percent in Cambodia to about 34 percentin Thailand. Local fiscal dependence on transfers isabout 70 to 80 percent in Indonesia and the Philip-pines and 50 percent in Vietnam. In addition, incountries such as China, Thailand, and Vietnam,subnational governments obtain much of theirincome from shared taxes, a form of intergovern-mental transfer. These vary widely across the region,and have important additional implications for thedependence of local governments on non-own-revenue sources of funding (see chapter 2). Many East Asian countries have recently been moving toward internationally accepted \"best prac-tice\" norms by simplifying complex intergovern-mental transfer systems, improving the trans-parency and predictability of allocations, andincreasing subnational government discretion overthe use of these resources (Schroeder and Smoke2003). This is particularly true in Cambodia,Indonesia, and the Philippines, where transfersare formula-driven and largely not earmarked.Thailand and Vietnam have also begun to move inthis direction, though central control over the useof transferred resources remains tighter than inother countries. China's transfer system is lesstransparent, having developed piecemeal over theyears; recent efforts have focused on improvinghorizontal equalization. These trends are positive, but the increase in local discretion over how transfers are spent oftenmasks important constraints in local decisionmaking. There is a degree of internal inconsistency14 East Asia Decentralizesin the design of intergovernmental transfer systems. While transfer policies seem to favor localexpenditure discretion, human resource policytightly restricts it. For example, the InternalRevenue Allotment in the Philippines and the dana alokasi umum in Indonesia are not earmarked transfers. But because they are used primarily tocover local wage costs, and because the central gov-ernment retains significant control over local civilservice staffing and employment conditions, localdiscretion over the use of these grants is limited.The actual amount of intergovernmental transferfunds that can be spent on truly local priorities inthe region is much smaller than first appears. Subnational borrowing and hard budget con- straints . Subnational borrowing varies widely across East Asia (see chapter 3). Such borrowing is virtuallynonexistent in Cambodia, highly restricted inIndonesia, moderate in the Philippines and Vietnam,and extensive but indirect in China. The frameworksthat regulate local borrowing and the actual practicesof subnational governments are complex. In China,for example, subnational borrowing is illegal exceptwhen financed by higher levels of government. How-ever, local authorities effectively raise credit (andhence incur liabilities) through special-purposevehicles created for investment and financing.Therefore, while local borrowing is legally more con-strained in China than in many other countries, it isin reality both widespread and unregulated. The emergence of sustainable subnational bor- rowing in East Asia is hampered by a number ofserious problems. First, while the economic anddemographic growth of cities is propelling signifi-cant latent demand for financing for subnationalloans, policy and regulatory frameworks are poorlydeveloped. Thus, while the larger cities and townsin East Asia are in need of increased financing flows(primarily to fund infrastructure investment) andare expanding their capacity to service debt, thelack of reliable financial data, constrained borrow-ing authority, and the absence of rules in the eventof default interact to undermine the de facto credit-worthiness of subnational governments and make them unattractive investment propositions. Second, private lending to subnational govern- ments remains low throughout the region, evenwhere central governments have attempted tostimulate it. This situation arises from the weakcreditworthiness of subnational governments, aswell as the public sector-dominated character of the banking industry and the regulatory advantagestypically conferred on state-owned banks. As aresult, lending to subnational authorities, and theassociated credit risk, tends to concentrate in thepublic sector even in countries such as the Philip-pines where greater private participation in thesubnational debt market is an explicit policy goal. 10 Third, there are questions about the extent to which subnational governments are subject to hardbudget constraints (see box 1.2). China is the onlyEast Asian country in which soft local budget con-straints may pose a major problem at the macro-economic level, largely because of the significantoff-budget expenditures of local governments andtheir widespread\u2014albeit indirect\u2014borrowing.Cambodia is at the other extreme, as communes areresponsible for only about 2 percent of total publicspending and cannot borrow. While Cambodianprovinces account for more spending (17 percent),80 percent of that is under the direct control of thecentral government. Provincial off-budget activitiesare minor, and provinces may not borrow, leavinglittle scope for accumulating contingent liabilities.The other countries lie between these two extremes,although data weaknesses, the complexity of regu-latory frameworks, and the opacity of localaccounting systems make the situation unclear. InIndonesia, where subnational governments are usu-ally entitled to borrow, but where these powers arecurrently restricted, 11regulatory weaknesses and a poor record of loan repayment indicate potentialconcern in the medium and long term. Whetherlocal borrowing will become a problem will dependon whether these restrictions are relaxed, as well ason reform of the subnational borrowing frameworkand the evolution of the intergovernmental transfersystem, among other factors. The degree to which subnational governments are subject to hard budget constraints depends onseveral aspects of the intergovernmental system,especially the regulatory environment surroundingsubnational borrowing. Ultimately, if East Asiancountries wish to expand sustainable private invest-ment at the subnational level without misalign-ing incentives and risking undesirable macroeco-nomic impacts, they need to develop much morethorough policies and regulations and devotesignificant efforts to implementing them. Thiswill require a fundamental reassessment of theEast Asia Decentralizes 15objectives of subnational borrowing, close study of the local borrowing environment, a broadframework conducive to disciplined subnationalcredit activity, and the central capacity to monitorlocal credit activities, including collection anddissemination of better credit data. East Asia could draw on the experiences of other countries thathave begun\u2014and in some cases successfullycompleted\u2014such exercises, including Hungary,Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa.16 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 1.2 Hard Budget Constraints The ability of subnational entities to borrow funds is fundamental to the concept and prac-tice of fiscal decentralization and local fiscalautonomy. Subnational borrowing can be aneffective tool for local development, if limited tofinancing capital investment expenditure. Whenstructured well, it can improve both economicefficiency, in which the cost of debt repaymentmatches the flow of benefits over time, andintergenerational equity, so that future genera-tions who benefit from investments also sharethe responsibility for payment. The key to making subnational borrowing work is the presence of hard budget constraints.These ensure that subnational governments can-not transfer the liabilities they accrue to higherlevels of government, either by shifting debtservice obligations upward or other means suchas expenditure deferrals or the accumulation ofcontingent or implicit liabilities. The best way toenforce a hard budget constraint is to establishprocedures that clearly signal that local govern-ments will bear the costs (and accrue the bene-fits) of their fiscal decisions. When this message is conveyed to creditors, asset owners, and voters, the market mechanismcomes into play. First, creditors will demandsound fiscal decisions by withholding credit.Second, knowing that local fiscal decisions candirectly affect property values and rents, assetowners will have a strong incentive to lobbyagainst imprudent borrowing and debt buildup.Third, political factors may also be important incountries with local elections, where voters canoust underperforming local officials. In well-established intergovernmental sys- tems, the fiscal discipline of the capital marketsuffices. Yet markets work only when good infor-mation is available on local fiscal performanceand risk, when the central government makes acredible commitment that it will not providebailouts, and when accountability systems arerobust. Where these conditions are not in place,as in many developing countries, two reinforcingstrategies can help. First, it is important to ensurethat subnational entities do not \"pay down\"debts by borrowing from their own banks, or from a central financial authority that providesadditional funding, without accompanying\u2014andsevere\u2014consequences for default. The problem with a subnational entity bor- rowing from itself is clear. A pattern of centralgovernment bailouts may also be costly. Not onlywill this undermine the center's own credit stand-ing, but it can also lead to selective allocation ofcredit across subnational governments accordingto political, ethnic, or religious favoritism. Capitalinvestment can become inefficient, and nationalcohesiveness may be jeopardized. The second strategy is to establish a fiscal framework that ensures subnational budget dis-cipline. Central or higher-level governmentsmay limit local borrowing to capital expendi-tures only, as in Argentina, Latvia, and Poland.They may place statutory limitations on localdebt, as in Italy, Portugal, and Canadianprovinces. And they may provide for a municipalbankruptcy law, as have Hungary, South Africa,and many member countries of the Organisa-tion for Economic Co-operation and Develop-ment. Other rule-based approaches include pro-hibitions on foreign borrowing in Ethiopia andIreland, and the establishment of intergovern-mental coordinating committees. For example,the Australian Loan Council provides informa-tion to the financial markets on local govern-ment fiscal positions, and the French RegionalChambers of Accounts may establish remedialfiscal measures if a deficit appears. A range of sanctions may also be established. In Austria, an explicit Domestic Stability Pact setsoverall fiscal targets for municipalities as agroup, and allows the transfer of surplus/deficitobligations and rights across subnational gov-ernments if the group target is not met. In Brazil,partly in reaction to sharp increases in subna-tional debt levels (up to 17 percent of GDP in1996), the central government not only restrictsdebt service levels but also penalizes governorsand mayors for irresponsible performancethrough impeachment or imprisonment.Some East Asian governments are beginning to tackle at least some aspects of this agenda. Forexample, the Department of Finance in the Philip-pines has recently begun developing mechanismsto measure and monitor subnational liabilities, andthe department intends to create an early warningsystem to identify impending local debt defaults. Inthe rest of the region, however, efforts appear toaddress much narrower concerns. Indonesia hasfocused on developing a regulatory system for theonlending of donor-sourced investment fundswithin the public sector (KMK 35). Notwithstandingthe positive steps mentioned above, the Philippineshas invested significant effort in restructuring theMunicipal Development Fund Office into a nonbankfinancial institution that\u2014like two governmentbanks (the Land Bank and the DevelopmentBank)\u2014will cater to the subnational market. Gov-ernments have devoted much less attention tobroader policy and regulatory issues surroundingsubnational borrowing. Creating Sound Management and Accountability Systems Management and accountability systems often determine the performance of intergovernmentalmechanisms. Designing and implementing systemsthat work on the ground are not easy tasks. This iswhere decentralization often falters. The followingsection examines three key elements of this thirdcommon challenge: human resource management;planning, financial management, and informationat local and national levels; and local accountabilitysystems. Human resources . East Asian countries have started down the path of decentralizing humanresources (see chapter 7). In most cases, subna-tional governments have the authority to hire andassign junior staff, but the central governmentretains control over the aggregate number and paylevels of local staff. 12Under these arrangements, the overall management of the civil service effectivelyremains largely centralized. T o compensate for this limited local formal autonomy, subnational practices in some countrieshave tended to circumvent formal systems. In thePhilippines and Thailand, local managers haveavoided central guidelines by hiring contractualworkers. In Indonesia and the Philippines, localgovernments have often relied on nontransparent allowances to boost civil service pay. In China,where subnational governments return budget sur-pluses to the central government, local civil serviceemployment has swelled in the absence of incen-tives to local managers to keep staffs lean. The design of decentralization has also had important impacts on the accountability, incen-tives, and capacity of local civil servants. Unclearpolicies have sometimes created confusion con-cerning accountability relationships. In Indonesia,for example, conflicting laws have produced ineffi-cient overlaps in authority. In China, the Philip-pines, and Vietnam, \"double subordination\" to cen-tral authorities and local assemblies conflates theaccountability of local staff. Though some East Asian countries have estab- lished formal mechanisms for merit-based recruit-ment and performance management, these tend tolack teeth in reality, and civil servants are rarelyheld accountable for their behavior. Seniority andparty loyalty have frequently trumped performancein promotion decisions. In China, the awarding ofacross-the-board performance bonuses has under-cut their ability to leverage civil service quality. Inthe Philippines, where staff performance has not,until recently, been rigorously evaluated, patronageand nepotism have figured prominently in recruit-ment and promotion. In countries where wages arelow and absenteeism is endemic, service deliveryquality cannot be maintained. Throughout EastAsia, less well-resourced local governments areoften unable to attract enough staff to fill therequired number of spots or to fund centrally setwages. For local governments that manage to stafftheir civil services despite poor incentives, the lackof strong systems for career management alsodampens the incentives of local functionaries toperform. International experience shows that countries often neglect the details of administrative decen-tralization. In Central and Eastern Europe, confu-sion about the role of the postcommunist stateprompted many governments to decentralize taskswithout providing adequate resources (Verheijen2002). In Latin America, local authority to controlpersonnel costs was critical in enhancing macro-economic management under decentralization(Burki et al. 1999). Y et even when far-reachingon paper, decentralization of human resourceEast Asia Decentralizes 17management has usually been quite limited in practice. Governments tend to decentralize the civilservice in similar ways, giving local governmentsautonomy to hire and fire staff and supplementcentrally set salaries, while the center retains con-trol over wage rates and interregional mobility(Evans and Manning 2004). Concerns about localcapacity, interregional equity, and national unitycan spur recentralization of the civil service andthreaten the decentralization agenda. Despite the relative inattention to administrative decentralization, a few interesting experiences inlocal civil service management provide lessonsfor East Asian countries. In Uganda, independentDistrict Service Commissions manage the recruit-ment of local civil servants. The commissions haveexperienced some growing pains, such as limitedability to discipline and dismiss staff, but they canstill serve as a useful model. In Pakistan, reformsenvision organizing lower-echelon staff into cadresto facilitate their mobility across districts, whileprovinces will officially employ more senior staff toallow vertical movement into central governmentservice. In this case, the challenge has been to ensurethat district governments rather than provinceshold civil servants accountable for performance.Personnel exchange programs in Japan enhance thecareer prospects of local civil servants by transfer-ring them between subnational governments andthe center. Broadly, international experience sug-gests that some central controls on wages and civilservice mobility, combined with local autonomyover hiring and promotion of more junior staff,have been the preferred policies for most countriesmoving from centralized to decentralized humanresource management systems. These experiencesshow how important human resource arrangementscan be to making intergovernmental systems work. Planning and financial mangement . As is com- mon in newly decentralizing environments, localplanning in East Asia is fairly weak (see chapter 5).Though the Local Government Code of the Philip-pines prescribes a participatory approach to plan-ning, less than a third of subnational governmentsaccounted for external inputs in creating develop-ment plans, according to one survey (Azfar et al.2000). Indonesia has also begun to introduce a par-ticipatory planning process at the kabupaten level, but project affordability is not a factor in expendi-ture choices, so this process creates \"wish lists\" thatdo not inform the budget in a meaningful way. In China and Vietnam, insufficient coordinationbetween planning and budgeting means that planstypically far outstrip resources. The budgeting process is often inefficient and only loosely scheduled. In China, the budgetprocess often starts only two months before the fis-cal year begins, creating delays throughout the sys-tem as each level of government must wait forinformation from the previous tier before creatingits own expenditure and transfer plans. In Indone-sia and the Philippines, poor estimates and unpre-dictable release of transfers over the budget yeardistort budget execution. Difficulties with local financial management systems are also common. In China, Indonesia, thePhilippines, and Vietnam, programs to modernizefinancial management systems are in their infancy,particularly at the subnational level. Thoughmanagement information systems in the Philip-pines and Vietnam produce general reports, theycannot do so in a timely or accurate way. Y ear-endaccounts are thus not available in Vietnam until18 months after the end of the fiscal year. In thePhilippines, local financial management is stillbased mainly on manual systems. Internal and external auditing of expenditures at the subnational level are of extremely low quality,suffering from low capacity and confused man-dates. In Indonesia, the legal framework is unclearwith regard to the authority of various auditors inexamining local budgets. In the Philippines, inter-nal auditing is nonexistent among most local gov-ernments, and the regional offices of the Commis-sion on Audit, which have the power to audit localgovernments, are overstretched. In Thailand, only afew large-scale local authorities have internal audi-tors, and two external auditing units\u2014the Officeof the Auditor General and provincial auditingteams\u2014have considerable credibility but limitedcapacity to provide services to all local authorities. Decentralization implies a shift rather than a weakening of systems and capacity at the center. Infact, as the intergovernmental structure becomesmore complex, central ministries need to developnew systems to monitor and manage it effectively.Two challenges are typical of East Asian countries.First, development of the systems connecting dif-ferent layers of government often lags far behindthe policy decisions and institutional arrangements 18 East Asia Decentralizesthey are meant to support. Cambodia is an extreme case: grant disbursements to provinces are soconsistently late and so divergent from initiallybudgeted amounts that budgets themselves havebecome virtually meaningless. But similar difficul-ties with the timely release of intergovernmentaltransfers are fairly widespread in the region. Second, central governments face growing prob- lems in monitoring the activities of local govern-ments. China's deficiencies in managing subna-tional liabilities have already been mentioned. ThePhilippines and Vietnam have a limited ability tomonitor and control the addition of \"temporary\"or \"informal\" workers to local establishments. InIndonesia, decentralization has undermined datasystems in sectors such as education, for whichlocal authorities are now responsible. As a result,the central government is less able to measure ser-vice delivery in these sectors than before decentral-ization (see chapter 9). Accountability systems . A number of interlocking factors constrain local accountability in East Asia.Upward accountability\u2014or central oversight oflocal administrations\u2014tends to be stronger thanother forms of accountability but suffers from alack of clarity in functional allocations, incompleteflow of information, and inadequate monitoring.Horizontal accountability\u2014the monitoring of localbureaucrats by local politicians, and of local gov-ernment by local legislatures and courts\u2014is dilutedby clientelist politics and a serious lack of capacityamong local countervailing powers. Downwardaccountability, or responsiveness to citizens, isoften interrupted by a tendency to focus on compli-ance rather than performance. East Asian countries have historically empha- sized top-down, ex ante control of subnationalexpenditures. As decentralization evolves and localgovernments gain greater financial autonomy, bothex post review processes (such as external audits)and horizontal and bottom-up systems inevitablybecome more important in deepening accountabil-ity. For any of these to work, local data must be pro-duced, shared, and maintained. In Vietnamesecommunes, poor record keeping makes monitoringthe use of funds extremely difficult. In China, localreliance on extrabudgetary funds has reducedtransparency, and thus accountability, in publicspending. Thailand and Vietnam have experi-mented with mechanisms to shift from central con-trol of expenditures to performance-based account- ability, but these are in the early stages. Low capacity within oversight bodies challenges horizontal accountability at the subnational level.Local legislatures and judicial institutions oftenlack the financial and human resources to holdlocal administrations accountable. In some cases,political corruption prevents local politicians fromexercising oversight of local bureaucrats. In May2004, 43 of 55 members of Indonesia's West Suma-tra legislative council were found guilty of corrup-tion. Though this experience highlights widespreadcorruption in local administrations in Indonesia, italso provides a successful example of judicial over-sight and prosecutorial effectiveness. Civil society groups, including the media, can also raise awareness of the extent and costs of weak gover-nance, in terms of monitoring government per-formance and giving citizens a voice to demandaccountability from their leaders (see chapter 12).The importance of civil society grows as decentral-ization expands citizens' access to governmentactors. In the Philippines,the Social Weather Stationsproduced a Report Card of Pro-Poor Services to share citizen feedback on public services. Vietnam islaunching a similar initiative. In China, some locali-ties have introduced Citizens' Charters throughwhich service users rate how government agenciesand public utilities perform against their stated com-mitments. However, although civil society organiza-tions are growing rapidly in most East Asian coun-tries, they tend to concentrate in national capitalsand are therefore less influential at subnational lev-els. Where they do exist, local civil society groups areconstrained by insufficient financial and humanresources, political interference, and weak links tocentral organizations. International experience shows that accountabil- ity stems from numerous processes and relation-ships, including those outside the formal publicsector. Enhancing access to information is a criticalstep in bringing external pressure to bear on govern-ments. In Mexico, the government has established aSystem of Evaluation of Municipality Transparencyto measure how much information municipalgovernments are offering their citizens and toencourage greater transparency. In Uganda, after aPublic Expenditure Tracking Survey revealed thatschools had received only 13 percent of per-studentgrants, the central government launched a massive East Asia Decentralizes 19information campaign, spreading the word through the media and on notice boards outside schools anddistrict offices. Four years later, a repeat surveyshowed that over 90 percent of resources werereaching schools. Community report cards haveproduced similar successes, notably in Bangalore,India, where citizens rated public services and themedia widely disseminated results. Workshopsallowed providers and clients to interact, and someagencies took steps to improve their service deliverysystems. Finally, citizens need opportunities to hold local governments accountable. In the Brazilian city ofPorto Alegre, an experiment in participatory bud- geting improved public service delivery considerablyand has since expanded to over 80 cities. The gram sabha public forum in Indian local governments and community oversight committees in Bolivia allowcitizens to monitor government expenditures andhelp make decisions regarding future activities.Across the spectrum, the most successful mecha-nisms tend to be those that link information, capac-ity, and opportunities for participation. Conclusion: Key Messages and Challenges As the preceding discussion has shown, East Asia's decentralization process\u2014like the region itself\u2014ischaracterized by heterogeneity as well as a set ofshared features, many of which are common to thedecentralization experience of other countriesaround the world. As elsewhere, the thrust ofdecentralization in the region has been determinedlargely by structural and political factors. These fac-tors suggest that decentralization is likely to be apivotal fact of East Asian life for the foreseeablefuture. It is already affecting prospects for eco-nomic development, possibilities for \"good gover-nance\" in country institutions, and the quality ofservice delivery, especially for the poor. Some earlyindicators give reason to hope that outcomes inthese areas are trending in the right direction\u2014thatis, that the benefits of decentralization in improv-ing access and voice for local constituencies willoutweigh the costs of disruption and inefficiencythat overhauling formerly centralized institutionsinevitably bring. But the decentralization processhas been uneven and, in some countries, mayactually have stalled. International experience sug-gests that progress in moving decentralization for- ward is rarely monotonic; programs proceed in fitsand starts. But there is cause for concern in EastAsia that a low-level equilibrium has set in, withonly minimal reforms proceeding at a glacial pace. Recognizing the importance of national require- ments in developing decentralization approaches,this report does not offer specific recommen-dations on the way forward. These must be devel-oped at the country level. But the paramount needto make decentralization work broadly acrossthe region may warrant general guidance topolicymakers as they think about the strategiesneeded to advance the range of intergovernmentalreforms appropriate to their particular contexts.Drawing on the earlier sections of this chapter,and previewing the themes that will recur in laterchapters of this report, the following three broadsubstantive imperatives merit priority attention indecentralization: Improving the organization of the intergov- ernmental system will usually require focused attention on policy and, often, legislative develop-ment in three core areas: Clarifying the expenditure assignments and func- tional roles of the various levels of government with a view to eliminating (or greatly narrow-ing) jurisdictional overlaps and reducing thegaps between mandates and funding. Rationalizing the vertical and horizontal organi- zation of the intergovernmental system to ensure an appropriate balance in the roles of central,intermediate, and local authorities, and to injectgreater transparency and objectivity into theprocesses that determine the size and geographicboundaries of subnational entities. Developing systems to facilitate lateral and verti- cal cooperation between subnational govern- ments and central government agencies, partic-ularly in the areas of planning and investment. Strengthening local fiscal and financial struc- tures involves expanding the financial resources available to subnational governments while improv-ing their incentives to use these resources efficiently.Three focus areas are evident: own-source revenues, subnational borrowing, and intergovernmental trans-fers. Substantial progress has been made in East Asia with respect to intergovernmental transfer policy 20 East Asia Decentralizesand systems, but this dynamic area will require ongoing attention. In the other two instances, thepicture is more problematic. Throughout the region,policy environments are not conducive to the emer-gence of enhanced own-source revenue or vibrantand disciplined borrowing systems. Little seriouspolicy work is under way, and current solutions tendto be at odds with emerging international best prac-tice. The problems that arise in these areas, includingthe lack of hard budget constraints at the local level,often stem more from enforcement failures thanfrom poor policy. Rules need to be well designed andeffectively enforced. And local authorities need tohave incentives to raise revenues and control expen-ditures. Serious efforts are needed in this area. Developing the functional systems that under- pin the effectiveness of intergovernmental struc-tures has three important dimensions: Deepening and enhancing accountability . Effective accountability systems required to reap thepotential developmental benefits of decentralizedgovernment are consistently weak across theregion. Substantial improvements are needed informal and informal bottom-up processes ofaccountability at the local level, and in top-downsystems for generating information and effec-tively monitoring local performance by the center.National and local governments alike need betterdata on all aspects of the local and intergovern-mental system, particularly subnational financeand local government performance in deliveringservices. Systems must therefore be developed toensure regular and accurate production and dis-tribution of basic local government data. Improving the performance of intergovernmental functional and management systems . As intergov- ernmental structures evolve,systemic\"plumbing\"needs to be built to allow these structures to func-tion properly. Intergovernmental transfers needto be disbursed, local financial statements need tobe produced and audited, and budgets need to beproduced in a timely manner. In many East Asiancountries, these systems have not kept pace withthe evolution of the intergovernmental structure,and local performance has suffered. Building capacity . The best-designed intergov- ernmental system in the world will not func-tion effectively without sufficient capacity,particularly in the area of human resources.While capacity limitations have surfaced as an important issue in decentralization processesthroughout the developing world, two aspectsrequire particular attention in the East Asianenvironment. First, insufficient capacity at thelocal level is not the only issue; central govern-ments also require improvements in their abilityto administer the intergovernmental system anddrive the decentralization process effectively.Second, capacity-building efforts that focuspurely\u2014or even predominantly\u2014on the supplyside are likely to bring limited success. Forcapacity to expand and endure, reform effortsneed to generate effective and ongoing demandfor enhanced capacity at the local level, and tocreate systems for responding to that demand.Reforming subnational human resource systemswill be critical to this endeavor. Finally, in addition to these substantive chal- lenges, three messages on the nature of the decen-tralization process are important: Given varying conditions within countries, inter- governmental frameworks will need to be craftedwith enough flexibility to allow for appropriateasymmetries in the design and implementationof decentralization structures and processes. The inevitably uneven pace of reforms and the need to capitalize on political opportunities asthey arise call for a reform process that is morepiecemeal than comprehensive. Internationalexperience suggests that focusing on a few keyareas where change is possible and getting theseright is likely to yield greater success than tryingto accomplish too much simultaneously on toomany reform fronts. While the inevitably long-term nature of the decentralization process must be understood,each country's policymakers should take stock ofprogress on intergovernmental reforms andassess whether the pace and energy of reforms aresufficient to meet the important challenges dis-cussed in this report. Mindful of the magnitudeof problems that are likely to accumulate if localand intergovernmental structures remain weakand incentives are not in place, governments needto combine political capital, strategic focus, andtechnical effort to ensure consistent progress ondecentralization in the region. East Asia Decentralizes 21Endnotes 1. In 2001, central government spending on capital in East Asia and the Pacific was 3.6 percent of GDP , comparedwith 3 percent in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and1.6 percent in South Asia. (Figures are derived from theWorld Bank's World Development Indicators and World Bank 2004b.) 2. In Indonesia, households perceived corruption as the top national problem. In Cambodia, urban citizens and foreignfirms called corruption the leading problem, while rural citi-zens called it the second most serious problem (after the highcost of living), as did domestic firms (after street crime). InThailand, respondents called it the third most seriousnational problem, after the poor economy and high cost ofliving. See World Bank, Partnership for Governance Reformin Indonesia 2002b; World Bank 2000; and Phongpaichitet al. 2000. 3. For example, in Cambodia, 82 percent of firms reported some level of bribe payments, and 71 percent of large firms sug-gested that such payments are frequent (World Bank 2004a). 4. This view is consistent with earlier regional analyses of decentralization by the World Bank in Latin America andEast and Central Europe (Burki al. 1999; World Bank 2001). 5. T o date, only 172 of the 245 functions specified for devolu- tion in the Master Plan have been or are in the process ofbeing devolved, and the rate of devolution has declined overthe past two years. The Nine Policy Measures to improvelocal revenue mobilization, approved by the Cabinet in1994, have made slow progress toward legal enactment(chapter 2). 6. These assessments are based on initial data that will need to be reviewed over time. Attributing impact to intergovern-mental reform is also problematic, as decentralization hasoccurred in parallel with other policy changes. 7. A review of intergovernmental tax administration in E. Asia is provided in Ebel and Taliercio 2004. 8.Kabupaten are districts; kota (orkotamadya ) are cities. 9. These figures are based on a limited sample of countries in each region. 10. Borrowing from private sector sources typically constitutes less than 1.5 percent of total annual subnational revenuesin the Philippines, despite the 1996 Local Government UnitFinancing Framework, which stresses private lending tolocal governments as a core objective. 11. The Finance Ministry has imposed a temporary freeze on subnational borrowing, but indications are that this willexpire in 2005. 12. There are many legitimate reasons for the center to retain some authority over civil service management, such as tomaintain minimum standards for the working conditionsand professional qualifications of public servants, tobroaden their career paths, and to unify a fragmentednation. On the other hand, as shown by Vietnam's experi-ment with block grants to districts and departments in HoChi Minh City, service delivery and operational efficiencycan be improved by extending autonomy over budget allo-cations to civil service managers and allowing them to keepthe savings.

Countries haveadopted different intergovernmental structures,proceeded at uneven paces, and adopted a widerange of implementation strategies. This diversity isnot surprising, as East Asian countries vary greatlyin geographical size, population, history, economicstructure, and political and institutional dynamics,all of which influence the form that decentraliza-tion can and should take. This chapter provides expanded context for the analysis presented in chapter 1 and lays a foundationfor later chapters. After reviewing the origins ofdecentralization, it compares the basic intergov-ernmental frameworks, structures, and processesevolving in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, thePhilippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. 1The chapter focuses, in turn, on enabling frameworks, the gover-nance environment, fiscal decentralization, and themanagement and implementation of decentraliza-tion reforms. 252 The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes Paul Smoke The Basics of Decentralization in East Asia This section briefly examines the origins and paths of decentralization in the region. It also outlines thelevels and structures of government, compares thethrust of decentralization policy in various coun-tries, and describes the enabling frameworks. The Origins and Evolution of Decentralization Reforms Some East Asian countries,such as China,have a long tradition of limited decentralization, while the con-cept is more recent in countries such as Cambodia.Crisis sparked decentralization in Indonesia and thePhilippines, while in China and Vietnam it is partof a gradual process of market and public sectorreform. In a few cases, decentralization is essentiallycomplete (in structure if not in practice), such as inthe Philippines, or heavily in process, such as inIndonesia. In other cases reforms are less advanced,either with limited policy development, as in26 East Asia Decentralizes Cambodia, or a substantial but only modestly implemented framework, as in Thailand. The Philippines has the strongest history of democratic decentralization in the region. Thecountry's colonial heritage established limited dem-ocratic roots, and a series of presidential decreesenacted under the autocratic Marcos government\u2014including the Local Tax Code, the Real Property TaxCode, and the Local Fiscal Administration Code\u2014laid the institutional foundation for decentraliza-tion. The country reestablished democracy after thefall of Marcos in 1986, and decentralization andlocal autonomy were among the fundamental prin-ciples embodied in the 1987 Constitution. TheAquino administration launched a pilot decentral-ization project and established autonomous regionsin Muslim Mindanao and the Cordilleras. But notuntil 1991 did constitutional provisions begin totake robust shape through the Local GovernmentCode, which mandated significant devolution tolocal governments. T oday a formal decentralizationframework is essentially complete, but much effortremains to realize full implementation. Although China's lack of democratic institutions may be seen as an impediment to decentralization,the country has some history of subnational author-ity because its size has made central control difficult.The provinces, in particular, have long enjoyeda degree of administrative and fiscal autonomy.The market transition that began in the late 1970senhanced the subnational role. As economic reformprogressed, changes in the composition of expendi-tures and relative prices moved the burden of publicspending to subnational governments. These adjust-ments led to further modifications of governmentoperations, but the country never adopted a formaldecentralization policy. Still, by 1993, the centralgovernment was collecting only 20 percent of publicrevenues. This prompted the substantially recentral-izing Tax Sharing System reforms in 1994. Publicdemand for more responsive government and greaterentrepreneurial freedom has also shaped central-subnational relations, but formal intergovernmentalpolitical reforms have been limited. Indonesia\u2014also a large country and spread over thousands of islands\u2014had elements of decentral-ization during its Dutch colonial period. As in manyethnically diverse countries colonized by Europeanpowers, building national unity through greatercentralization was the goal after independence.Weak attempts to decentralize in the 1970s and 1980s did not gain political momentum. The EastAsian economic crisis in 1997 hastened the fall ofthe Soeharto regime. Around that time, a successfulindependence referendum in the former province ofEast Timor and growing complaints from resource-rich provinces about insufficient revenue autonomyincreased pressure for reform. The 1999 decentral-ization legislation was a direct response to this polit-ical crisis and a perceived need to hold the diverseand tenuously unified country together. The reformdevolved power primarily to subprovincial govern-ments, largely because of fear among national lead-ers that empowered provinces could fuel regionalethnic and political conflicts, leading to further sep-aratism or federalism. The government revised theinitial decentralization framework legislation in2004. This increased higher-level control but leftunresolved important aspects of the intergovern-mental system. Local capacity is deficient in manyareas, and citizens and government officials, bothelected and appointed, are still learning to functionin the evolving democratic environment. Vietnam, which became a centrally planned communist state after the Vietnam War, has increas-ingly formalized the subnational governmentframework since the mid-1990s. As in China, eco-nomic reforms ( doi moi ) spurred initial progress on intergovernmental reform. The center still exertssubstantial control, but subnational governmentshave some discretion. Provinces have greater pow-ers, including considerable authority over lower lev-els. Popular participation and grassroots demandfor political voice have grown, but Vietnam remainsa one-party state and a fairly centrally driven sys-tem. The country has moved forward with itsdecentralization framework and conducted somesuccessful policy experiments, but implementationis uneven and additional reforms are required. Thailand has been modestly enhancing the role of subnational entities for some time, but decentral-ization has been a priority only since the SeventhNational Economic and Social Development Plan(1991-96). The plan emphasized developing localinfrastructure, providing credit to expand andimprove local services, and helping local authoritiesmobilize capital and pursue development projects.The May Five democracy movement emerged in themid-1990s to demand stronger democratic institu-tions more insulated from the military, which haslong played a pivotal role in Thai politics. The Eighth Plan (1997-2002) advocated stronger local institu-tions, the 1997 Constitution formally enshrineddecentralization, and later legislation detailed it. Thecountry has formally adopted many reforms butimplemented few of them, and political consensuson further progress remains unclear. Cambodia's decentralization is relatively unique. Following elections brokered by the United Nations(UN) in 1993, the center reclaimed power fromprovincial governors\u2014who had previously ruledwith a free hand\u2014in order to impose discipline onthe intergovernmental system. The UN-fundedCambodia Resettlement and Reintegration(CARERE) Project of the early 1990s, particularly itssecond stage known as Seila, experimented withsweeping local institutional and governance reformsin many areas. Seila's success in delivering develop-ment projects made its formal integration into thegovernment system attractive to the ruling party.Reforms adopted in 2001 led to the election of com- mune councils and provided them small intergov-ernmental transfers without formal service respon-sibilities or own-source revenues. This approachfocuses on meeting immediate community needsand developing trust between citizens and the gov-ernment as a first step in decentralization. Provincialreforms have been limited, except for the adaptationof Seila mechanisms to provide provincial supportto communes and a few ad hoc reforms by individ-ual sectoral ministries. A program to build capacityis under way and the country is planning furtherreforms, but it is unclear how the system will evolve. Structures of Subnational Government The structure of subnational governments in the region varies considerably (see table 2.1). Mostcountries have three or four levels of administra-tion. In China, the Philippines, and Vietnam, each The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 27 TABLE 2.1 Levels of Government Administration Country Subnational levels of government Cambodia Two levels in two parallel systems: Provincial administrations (20) and municipalities (4) with provincial status divided into districts and khans Elected commune and sangkat (urban commune) governments (1,621) divided into villages China Four levels: Provinces (22), autonomous regions (5), and large cities (4) Prefectures and cities (300) Counties (2,100) Townships (44,000 /H11001) Indonesia Three levels ( de jure ): Provinces (33), special regions (2), and capital city (1) Local governments: kotamadya (cities) and kabupaten (districts) (440) Desa (villages) Philippines Four levels: Provinces (79) Cities (112) Municipalities (1,496)Barangays /villages (41,944) Thailand Four levels with top three formally empowered: Provinces (75) Districts and municipalities (811)Tambons (subdistricts) (6,744) Villages (67,000 /H11001) Vietnam Three levels: Provinces (58) and municipalities (3) Districts (600) Communes (10,000 /H11001) Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources.level is an active player. In Thailand, all but the low- est level have formal authority. In Cambodia andIndonesia, two levels have independent powers,while other levels perform mostly subsidiaryadministrative and political functions. In Indonesia,the lower tiers have no formal functions or inde-pendent budgets, but centrally managed\u2014oftendonor-funded\u2014community development schemeshave channeled substantial resources to them (seechapter 12). In Cambodia, the provinces (with dis-trict subdivisions) and communes (with villagesubdivisions) have functional mandates, althoughwith a different relationship to the center. A few countries also have ad hoc subnational institutional arrangements such as special status forthe capital and other major cities. These includeJakarta in Indonesia and the Bangkok MetropolitanAdministration and Pattaya City in Thailand.China, Indonesia, and the Philippines have createda number of autonomous regions, often in areas ofspecial political, historical, or ethnic significance. Afew countries have interjurisdictional structuresdesigned to meet specific needs. The Philippines,for example, has designated 16 planning regions,each with a Regional Development CoordinatingCouncil composed of provincial governors, citymayors, and representatives from national agenciesand the private sector.Decentralization Policy East Asian countries also vary in the extent to which their decentralization policy emphasizesdeconcentration, delegation, or devolution offunctions and revenue authority (see box 1.1).Some countries such as China and Vietnam haveseen legal or de facto deconcentration of functionsto subnational entities that remain substantiallyaccountable to the center, though elements of dele-gation and devolution have emerged. Thailand isgradually shifting its focus from deconcentrationto devolution, but reform remains at a relativelyearly stage. Indonesia, the Philippines, and, to acertain extent, Cambodia have emphasized devo-lution of responsibilities to more autonomoussubprovincial entities, but specific approaches dif-fer (see table 2.2). China's decentralization is unusual in that eco- nomic reform rather than specific deconcentrationor devolution policies has shaped its evolution.During the last two decades China has transitionedfrom a largely deconcentrated system to onethat incorporates elements of delegation anddevolution. Subnational governments have becomemore responsible for financing their expandingfunctions from their own revenue, both formal andinformal, giving them more autonomy except in 28 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 2.2 Decentralization Policy Country Policy orientation Cambodia Hybrid case, with deconcentration to provinces and devolution to communes; commune system new and given greater emphasis, but provinces are more significant in terms ofpublic expenditures. China Main focus on deconcentration to provinces and larger cities, although lower levels have larger public expenditure role and elements of de facto devolution have emerged in some areas; provinces have considerable regulatory control over lower levels. Indonesia Focus on substantial devolution to cities and districts, which replaced earlier emphasis on deconcentration to provinces; limited formal role at lowest levels; 2004 reforms increased the role of higher levels. Philippines Focus on devolution to subprovincial units, but provinces still play a significant role. Thailand Historical focus on deconcentration to provinces and districts, but 1997 framework shifts toward devolution to municipalities, districts, and subdistricts; implementation has been limited. Vietnam Focus mainly on deconcentration with stronger role for provinces, including regulatory control over subprovincial levels; subnational governments have been allocated rights over specific functions, approaching devolution. Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources.sectors with mandated service standards (see chap- ters 1, 6, and 10). In Vietnam, decentralization policy blends a deconcentration of service responsibilities with anallocation of rights that resembles devolution. Thelatter, however, is much less developed than the for-mer, although provinces have considerably morepower and autonomy than subprovincial entities.Even provinces are subject to minimum expendi-ture requirements in some sectors, and the centralgovernment still sets rates on major sources ofrevenue. Thailand has long-established deconcentration policies but enacted a decentralization law in 1999.The country has drafted action plans for devolvingspecific functions to subnational governments, buthas assigned relatively few functions thus far. Themost significant devolution has occurred in infra-structure, quality of life, and natural resources andthe environment. Decentralization of health andeducation has not yet occurred, though the min-istries of Public Health and Education have pro-posed deconcentrating some responsibilities to areahealth boards and local education authorities untillocal governments can meet \"readiness\" criteria forfull devolution. The country plans to enhancedecentralization of revenues, which are now undersubstantial central control. Decentralization reforms in Indonesia include both devolution of authority and, to a lesserextent, deconcentration of functions. Deconcen-tration to provincial authorities was the dominantform of decentralization before 1999, when theemphasis shifted to devolution to city and districtgovernments. Local governments have broad func-tions and receive substantial intergovernmentaltransfers, but have limited revenue authority. Thecountry has increasingly developed the legalframework (most recently through Laws 32 and33 of 2004), but functional responsibilities andsubnational revenues require further elaborationand regulation. In the Philippines, deconcentration was histori- cally important. The Integrated ReorganizationPlan of 1972 divided the country into 11 (later 16)regions, each with administrative authority. In 1991the center devolved many responsibilities, person-nel, and resources to local governments. These gov-ernments have some revenue authority, but mostresources are subject to central control. Provincial departments continue to be major providers ofnational services, though the country has notemphasized formally deconcentrating more respon-sibilities to them. Both devolution and deconcentration reforms are occurring in Cambodia. The decentralization toelected commune councils is a limited form of devo-lution, while the central government is planning todeconcentrate responsibilities to provinces andmunicipalities. Progress with devolution\u2014albeitmodest\u2014has been more rapid than with deconcen-tration, owing largely to the Seila Program's signifi-cant influence over institutional reform since themid-1990s. Deconcentration reform is at an earlierstage and more fragmented, although a few centralministries, such as Agriculture, Education, andHealth, have experimented with limited functionaldeconcentration. Communes have relative auton-omy in pursuing small-scale local priorities with themodest resources they receive, but their fiscal rolesare limited. The Formal Basis for Decentralization The formal basis for decentralization varies widely throughout East Asia (see table 2.3). A few coun-tries have a constitutional basis for subnationalgovernments, and most have at least a law or set oflaws that defines the decentralization framework.The formal basis and extent of this framework donot seem to be closely associated with decentraliza-tion performance, as highlighted in chapter 1. Still,the nature and depth of enabling provisions couldbecome more important as challenges to decentral-ization arise. Thailand and the Philippines have both a con- stitutional and a legal basis for decentralization.Thailand's 1997 Constitution clearly specifies prin-ciples of local autonomy and elected representa-tion, and establishes specific intergovernmentalreform objectives. A National Commission onPublic Sector Reform includes a subcommittee toimplement decentralization policy. The cabinetapproved a Local Fiscal Master Plan in 1997, whichdefined the framework for Decentralization Act of1999 reforms. Y et the country needs further legaland regulatory instruments to define the sub-national system more fully. The constitutional and The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 29legal basis for local government is stronger and more specific in the Philippines. Articles II and X ofthe 1987 Constitution establish the autonomy oflocal governments and give them the power to cre-ate their own sources of revenue. The Local Govern-ment Code of 1991 codifies existing laws on localgovernment, provides for substantial devolution ofservices, and creates local institutions, such asschool boards, development councils, health boards,and peace and order councils. Most other East Asian countries have a legal but not a constitutional basis for decentralization.Cambodia does not have a unified decentralizationframework. However, the Provincial Budget Law of1997 provides for modest provincial fiscal powers,and the Commune/ Sangkat Administrative Man- agement Law and the Commune Election Law of2001 broadly define the functions and structuresof commune councils and procedures for electingthem. No legislation deconcentrates powers toprovincial and district governments, but the coun-try is developing such a law within the framework ofthe National Program for Administration Reform.Two main laws established decentralization in Indonesia. Law 22 on Regional Government of 1999eliminated hierarchical relationships between citiesand districts and higher levels of government,granting the former autonomy and broad responsi-bilities. This legislation has been revised as Law 32of 2004, which allows for the direct election of sub-national leaders beginning in 2005, reestablishescentral control over the hiring and firing of civil ser-vants, and requires ex ante approval of subnationalbudgets. Law 25 on Fiscal Balance of 1999 modifiedthe intergovernmental transfer system and providedfor limited local revenue authority. This law hasbeen updated as Law 33 of 2004, which furtherdefines aspects of the intergovernmental fiscal sys-tem. Law 34 on Regional Taxes and Levies of 2000modestly enhances local revenue authority and thegovernment has plans to expand these powers infuture legislation. Constitutional amendmentspassed in 2000 consolidated certain decentraliza-tion reforms and make it more difficult for theNational Assembly and the president to substan-tially reverse them.30 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 2.3 Decentralization Frameworks Country Formal basis for decentralization Cambodia Legal and administrative basis: Provincial Budget Law (1997) gives limited functions to provinces; Law on Commune/ Sangkat Administrative Management (2001) and Election Law (2001) establish commune system; all legislation clarified in numerous administrative decrees. China No constitutional or dedicated legal basis: Comprehensive Fiscal Reform (1994), Budget Law (1995), and Tax Sharing System (1994) relevant for roles of subnational governments. Indonesia Legal basis and constitutional amendment: Law 22 on Regional Government (1999) amended as Law 32 (2004), Law 25 on Fiscal Balance between Central Government and Regions (1999) amended as Law 33 (2004), and Law 34 on Regional Taxes/Levies (2000) (to be amended) provide a framework for decentralization; constitutional amendment (2000) strengthens basis for decentralization. Philippines Constitutional and legal basis: Constitution (1987) provides for local government autonomy; Local Government Code (1991) and various Marcos-era and post-Marcos laws define aspects of the intergovernmental system. Thailand Constitutional and legal basis: Constitution (1997) specifies principles of local autonomy and elected local government; Provincial Administration Act (1997) codifies deconcentration policies; Decentralization Act (1999) defines functions and decentralization process. Vietnam Legal and administrative basis: Law on Organization (1994), Ordinance on Concrete Tasks (1996), Budget Law (1998), and revised Budget Law (2002) assign functions and resources to subnational governments. Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources.Vietnam has no constitutional basis for decen- tralization, but a 1994 Law on Organization and a1996 Ordinance on Concrete Tasks assign functionsto provinces and districts. Decentralization is animportant part of the Public AdministrationReform Program launched in 1995. Budget laws in1996 and 1998 also formalized fiscal arrangementsamong levels and assigned budgeting responsibili-ties to subnational governments, particularlyprovinces. More recent legislation, including therevised Budget Law of 2002, provides more detailson subnational functions and revenue sources. China has the weakest formal basis for decen- tralization. Because intergovernmental changes inChina have occurred mostly through economicreform, they have no constitutional or dedicatedlegal framework. Intergovernmental fiscal relationsrest largely on a complex system of bargainingbetween higher-level and lower-level authorities.Since 1994 a number of reforms and legislativechanges have clarified the fiscal responsibilities ofdifferent levels of government somewhat, althoughimportant areas remain undefined. The most rele-vant reforms include the 1994 Tax Sharing System,the 1994 Comprehensive Fiscal Reform, and the1995 Budget Law. The Governance Environment This section reviews key aspects of the governance environment in East Asian countries; subnationalelections, autonomy, and transparency; and the roleof civic participation mechanisms and civil societyorganizations. These factors, among others, helpdetermine governance quality in a decentralizingenvironment (chapters 5 and 11). The National Political Environment East Asian countries exhibit a broad spectrum of political environments. China and Vietnam aresingle-party states. In Cambodia a single partydominates, while Indonesia, the Philippines, andThailand have multiple competitive parties. All ofthese countries have some type of national andsubnational assemblies. Table 2.4 summarizes keyfeatures of their political systems. China is a popular republic with a single official political party, the Chinese Communist Party.Minority parties are extremely small and play norole in the political process. The executive branch encompasses a state council, which includes theprime minister. The president serves as head ofstate. The legislative body\u2014the National People'sCongress\u2014is elected by representatives of lower-level legislatures and designates the president andprime minister. The Chinese Communist Partyplays a pivotal role through its power to designatesenior officials throughout the governmentalsystem. Vietnam is also a one-party state, with theCommunist Party the leading force. Party organiza-tions at all levels must operate within the constitu-tional and legal framework, but they have greatpower in determining who can run for electedoffice. The main legislative body is the NationalAssembly, which localities elect directly. As inChina, National Assembly delegates elect the presi-dent and prime minister. Cambodia is a constitutional monarchy under a democratic regime established in the 1991 peaceaccord. The executive branch includes the king, ashead of state, and the prime minister, who holds thereal power as head of government. The legislativebranch includes a National Assembly and a Senate.The Cambodia People's Party has dominated recentelections, but other parties have won national andsubnational seats. Opposition parties did wellenough in July 2003 elections that negotiationsto form a new government took a full year. LikeCambodia, Thailand is a constitutional monarchywith a unitary democratic government. A directlyelected Parliament selects a prime minister. Thecountry has a multiparty system with a history ofunstable coalition governments and military inter-vention. Under the 1997 Constitution, however, thecountry is evolving into a two-party system domi-nated by the incumbent Thai Rak Thai Party and theopposition Democrat Party, with the latter advocat-ing decentralization. Indonesia and the Philippines are both demo- cratic republics. Indonesia's governmental structureis particularly complex. The main legislative body isthe largely elected People's Assembly (DPR). In 1999the electoral system included hybrid proportionaland district elements based on closed party lists(voters could not vote for individuals). Most of the500 DPR members were elected, but 38 were ap-pointed by military and police factions. The People'sConsultative Assembly (MPR), which includedthe DPR plus 135 members selected by provincial The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 31legislatures and 65 members representing other groups, met only as needed to elect the presi-dent and reform the Constitution. The countryadopted major changes for 2004 elections. Politicalrepresentation by the military, police, and specialinterest groups ceased, and Indonesians directlyelected the president. A new, territorially based, andlargely consultative body, the Regional Representa-tive Council (DPD), was also elected, and the DPRand the DPD now together constitute the MPR,which retains only its as-needed constitutionalreform function. Until the 1998 collapse of theSuharto regime, Indonesia was effectively a one-party state run by the Golkar Party. Golkar still playsa major role and did well in the 2004 elections,but other parties, particularly the nationalist Demo- cratic Party and the United Development Party, anIslamic party, have become more powerful. Theresounding defeat of former President MegawatiSukarnoputri by former army chief Susilo BambangYudhoyono in the 2004 direct elections signals anew era in Indonesia's democratization, and hasraised expectations of the national leadership. The Philippines also has a multiparty system, and competition typically requires parties to form acoalition government. The country relies on directelections to fill all elective offices, including the pres-ident and members of the House of Representativesand the Senate. The exception is the provision for alimited number of special party-list representatives32 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 2.4 Basic Features of Political Systems Governmental Political Country system competition Legislative branch Executive branch Cambodia Constitutional monarchyMultiparty; CambodiaPeople's PartydominatesNational Assembly and Senate with direct electionsKing (head of state); prime minister (head of government) designatedby National Assembly China Popular republicSingle party: Chinese CommunistPartyNational People's Congress elected by lower-level congressesPresident, vice president, and state council (15 members, including prime minister) all designated by National People's Congress Indonesia Democratic republicCompetitive multipartysystemPeople's Assembly (DPR) directly elected; largely consultative Regional Representative Council (DPD) created in 2004; People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) composed of DPR and DPD manages constitutional reformPresident elected by the People's Consultative Assembly until direct election in 2004 Philippines Democratic republicCompetitive multipartysystemHouse of Representatives and Senate largely directly electedPresident elected directly by the people Thailand Constitutional monarchyMultiparty: twodominateParliament with direct electionsKing (head of state); prime minister (head of government) designated by Parliament Vietnam Popular republicSingle party: VietnameseCommunistPartyNational Assembly elected by lower-level assembliesPresident and state council (including prime minister) designated by National Assembly Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources. of marginalized sectors, where people vote for par- ties rather than individuals. Subnational Elections All East Asian countries reviewed here have subna- tional government assemblies, but they vary consid-erably in whether and how they elect those assem-blies (see table 2.5). The number of levels, the size ofjurisdictions, whether the elections are direct orindirect, the degree of political competition, and therelationship between elected councils and subna-tional executives all influence the degree of genuinesubnational representation and accountability. At one extreme are China and Vietnam, where the Communist Party heavily influences subnationalelections, reinforcing upward accountability. InChina, People's Congresses exist at all levels of gov-ernment, but voters elect delegates only at the villagelevel, which is not a formal unit of local government.Subordinate congresses elect delegates to higher-level congresses from party lists. In Vietnam, People'sCouncils are elected through universal suffrage at alllevels, but leaders are elected by council membersand ratified by the People's Council at the next level. Other countries hold more freely contested elec- tions, but not at all levels. Cambodia holds subna-tional elections with universal suffrage only for com-mune councils. These are elected with a five-yearmandate on a proportional basis, such that thecouncils can include representatives of more thanone political party. The council chief is the individ-ual receiving the most votes on the majority-partylist. The Cambodia People's Party dominated thefirst local elections in 2002, but other parties alsowon seats on many councils. Indonesia directly elects the Regional People's Assemblies (DPRD) atlocal and provincial levels. Under Law 32 of 2004,subnational leaders (governors and mayors) will bedirectly elected and can be removed with cause bythe DPRD, subject to higher-level approval. Thailand holds subnational elections every four years at all but the lowest (village) tier. The LocalElection Act of 2002 shifted responsibility for con-ducting local elections from the Ministry of the Inte-rior to the Election Commission, a new independentconstitutional agency. Various levels of subnationalgovernment have councils of differing sizes that aredirectly elected. Council members have elected thechair of subnational councils, except in the BangkokMetropolitan Administration, where the governor is popularly elected. Broader direct election of subna-tional executives (although not provincial gover-nors) is intended for the future. Among countrieswith multiple political parties, only the Philippinesconducts elections at all levels. Per the 1991 LocalGovernment Code, the country holds subnationalelections every three years, except at the barangay level, where they occur every five years. The LocalGovernment Code also created special-purpose rep-resentative bodies such as Local Development Coun-cils, which formulate and ratify development plans. Subnational Autonomy in Budgetary and Personnel Decisions The autonomy of subnational governments varies considerably across East Asian countries (seetable 2.6). This section characterizes their indepen-dence in making budgeting and personnel decisionsThe Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 33 TABLE 2.5 Subnational Assemblies and Elections Country Subnational assemblies and elections Cambodia Subnational representative bodies elected through universal suffrage only at the commune level. China People's Congresses in China exist at all levels of government, but only the village level is directly elected. Indonesia Regional People's Assemblies elected at local and provincial levels. Philippines Directly elected bodies exist at all subnational levels of government. Thailand Different types of subnational governments have directly elected councils of different sizes. Vietnam People's councils at all levels of government are directly elected and ratified by the immediately superior council. Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources. (see also chapters 1, 5, and 7). Subnational govern- ments in some countries are subject to significantcontrol by higher levels, although such control isnot always exercised effectively. In other cases, sub-national governments are more independent. Official autonomy is generally weak at the sub- national level in China and Vietnam. In China, sub-national budgets are approved by People's Con-gresses at the same level, but hierarchical linking ofbudgets, a lack of local tax autonomy, higher-leveldirectives, and earmarked funding offset this dis-cretion somewhat. Most subnational officials arealso appointed by People's Congresses at the samelevel, but higher levels appoint top officials. Thesesenior officials increasingly come from lower-levelranks rather than the central bureaucracy, whichmay improve local accountability. Management ofthe subnational civil service closely follows nationalregulations, although local leaders exercise somediscretion. Although subnational People's Councils in Vietnam have their own budgets, they are integratedinto a hierarchical system that requires higher-levelapproval. Provinces have more expenditure auton-omy than subprovincial levels. As of January 2004,provincial budgets no longer require approval fromthe National Assembly, and Provincial People'sCouncils have some authority to assign expenditureand revenue functions among subordinate levels ofgovernment. Central rules and regulations governstaffing of the People's Councils, but each level of subnational government now has limited discretionin managing local personnel. Pilot schemes inHanoi and Ho Chi Minh City allow even more localdiscretion in managing budgets and personnel. The Philippines has established fairly strong local autonomy, in principle. Local governmentsprepare their own budgets, which are reviewed atthe national level in the case of provinces and cities,and by provinces in the case of municipalities andbarangays . This review is intended to ensure that budgets meet regulatory requirements, not to inter-fere in composing the budgets. Civil service regula-tions, particularly regarding salary, are national, butlocal chief executives exercise some discretion.Salaries of local officials may vary widely, as somelocal governments lack the funds to meet nationalstandards. Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia fall in the middle of the autonomy spectrum. Indonesia'sLaws 22 and 25 of 1999 originally provided forstrong regional autonomy in principle. Local gov-ernments had authority over their budgets, subjectto national legality review, and technically con-trolled their staff subject to national regulations.On the other hand, local governments did notselect many of their staff, who were transferredunder the 1999 decentralization, along with sub-stantial intergovernmental transfers to supportthem. As noted, recent revisions to Law 22 (Law 3234 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 2.6 Subnational Budgetary and Personnel Autonomy Country Degree of subnational autonomy Cambodia Commune governments have their own budgets, whereas provincial budgets are linked to the national budget; strong central civil service control. China Subnational governments have their own budgets but are hierarchically integrated with higher levels and subject to central civil service regulations; control is weaker in practice and off-budget activity is considerable. Indonesia Subnational governments initially had complete budget autonomy, with next-higher level having legality review, and national civil service regulations allowed a reasonable degree of subnational discretion; Law 32 of 2004 significantly expanded higher-level control over budgeting and the civil service. Philippines Subnational governments prepare budgets with legality review by next-higher level; national civil service regulations allow subnational discretion. Thailand Local governments prepare budgets subject to certain central mandates and follow civil service regulations; major reforms planned. Vietnam Subnational governments have their own budgets, but these are hierarchically integrated and approved by higher levels; this is being phased out, and major cities have been permitted to experiment with greater autonomy. Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources. of 2004) expanded central control over budget and civil service decisions. Subnational budgets requireformal approval rather than legality review, andauthority to hire and fire subnational civil servantshas been significantly recentralized. In Thailand, local governments prepare and exe- cute their own budgets, but they are subject to cen-tral direction. A significant share of local expendi-tures is centrally mandated, with the largest portiondevoted to personnel expenses (representing 30 per-cent of local budgets, on average). Central directivesgovern staff numbers, salaries, and benefits. Majorreforms, however, are intended to eventually movethis highly centralized civil service to one wherelocal governments have considerable authority overpersonnel management. Cambodia is a more unusual case, as its system is new and the gap between provincial and local pro-cedures is significant. Centrally appointed provin-cial governors have some power and influence incoordinating budgets, but provincial line depart-ments are primarily accountable to parent min-istries. Commune councils have greater autonomy,in principle: they have some discretion in preparingplans and budgets if they follow basic guidelines.Under nascent decentralization, however, centrallyappointed key staff limit local autonomy. Forexample, the Ministry of Interior appoints thecommune clerk (though council members canrequest a replacement if they show cause), and thecommune treasurer is a member of the ProvincialTreasury (though officially required to follow theinstructions of the commune council).Subnational Transparency East Asian countries have all made some attempts to improve transparency and expand access to infor-mation at the subnational level, but intent has oftenbeen more substantial than practice (see table 2.7).Some countries, such as the Philippines, provideextensive public documentation of and access tosubnational government budgets and other infor-mation, while other countries, including China, donot. Audits do generally occur\u2014internally in somecases, both internally and externally in others\u2014butcountries usually do not monitor subnational budgetperformance comprehensively. Transparency in China and Cambodia is low. In China, a finance director for each subnational gov-ernment provides an annual report to the People'sCongress on budget implementation and the mainfeatures of the current budget. This is the only docu-ment on subnational budgets and includes onlyhighly aggregated data. Substantial off-budget fund-ing also limits transparency. Internal audits are rela-tively strong in the Chinese system. Local auditbureaus conduct external audits, but these fall underthe direct authority of the subnational government.External auditing by higher levels is infrequent.There is no system for evaluating budgets, althoughthe central government does focus on meeting tar-gets in priority areas such as family planning and taxcollection. Cambodia has a legal framework forbudget review, including the 2000 Audit Law. How-ever, the capacity to implement this system is not inplace, and public access to documentation is limited. The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 35 TABLE 2.7 Subnational Transparency Country Mechanisms for subnational transparency Cambodia Evolving commune reporting requirements provide public information in some areas; National Audit Authority weak.

In thePhilippines, budget documents\u2014including reportson implementing the previous budget and anannual financial report\u2014are made public. TheDepartment of Budget and Management and theCommission on Audit require regular accountabil-ity reports, and the financial transactions of localgovernments are subject to ex post review by theCommission on Audit. In Indonesia, budget docu-ments are supposed to be public and externalaudits are conducted, although not always onschedule because of capacity constraints in higher-level departments. The revised Constitution guar-antees freedom of information, and a new anti-corruption law requires access to information.However, bureaucratic barriers make exercisingthese civic rights difficult. Thailand has been improving transparency. The 1997 Constitution guarantees freedom of informa-tion, although the country has not yet passed lawsimplementing that freedom. Local governmentsmust submit budget plans, financial reports, andprocurement reports to the Department of LocalAuthority Promotion, the Bureau of the Budget,and the Auditor General. All are publicly disclosed,and some local authorities prepare publicationsand Web sites. Internal auditing is weak except in large cities. The auditor general and provincialaudit units are credible but do not have the capacityto audit all subnational governments. Vietnam hasa well-defined system of reporting from lower tohigher levels, and governments must make certainbudget data public. Internal auditing is seriouslydeficient, primarily because of capacity constraints.The State Audit of Vietnam must audit all sub-national governments, but the agency is notindependent of the executive. Subnational budgetsinclude no performance measures. The Role of Civic Participation and Civil Society Most East Asian countries officially require civic participation, and civil society organizations gener-ally exist, but their development and influencevary substantially (see table 2.8). This sectionfocuses on how central governments engage citi-zens in decision making and support and regulatecivil society organizations. In countries with lim-ited democratic institutions, such as China andVietnam, mechanisms for civic participation tendto be weak, and civil society less independent of thestate. The roles of nongovernmental organizations(NGOs) also differ greatly across East Asia, withsome taking direct responsibility for providing 36 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 2.8 Subnational Civic Participation and Civil Society Country Subnational civic participation Subnational civil society Cambodia Civic participation introduced in Some active civil society groups the context of emerging commune emerged from the period of system, but weak in many areas. civil war.

Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand, for example, boast many active NGOs, but they tendnot to interact extensively with local governments. Civic participation mechanisms are most developed, and civil society the most organized anddynamic, in the Philippines. Civil society grewduring the Marcos dictatorship, when antigovern-ment sentiment was high and focused on \"people'sempowerment.\" After the democratic transition,civil society organizations became more active.The 1987 Constitution and Bill of Rights ensurethe rights of independent NGOs and facilitatepopular consultation. The 1991 Local GovernmentCode requires public participation in barangay development plans and certain local functions.ABarangay -Bayan Network assists barangays in developing plans and projects, and the LocalGovernment Code Network supports governance.Despite these positive features, the country hasroom for improvement. The country has notimplemented key constitutional provisions on therepresentation of marginalized groups and localreferenda, and civil society includes armed left-wing groups that threaten national stability. The official framework for civic participation and civil society is relatively strong in Thailand andIndonesia. Thai military regimes discouragedNGOs, but civil society is now officially consideredimportant for good governance. Thailand's 1997Constitution requires the state to promote popularparticipation in preparing policies and plans, mak-ing public decisions, and monitoring the exercise ofstate power. The Constitution also enshrines theright to petition and receive a response from thestate, and to peacefully resist unconstitutionalattempts to acquire power. The Eighth DevelopmentPlan (1997-2001) supported the emergence of localcivil society, but slow progress on decentralizationhas constrained the development of civil societyorganizations. Neither Indonesia's Constitution nor its recent Bill of Rights mentions popular participation.However, the country does have some local tradi-tion of community consultation. For decades,repression and state-organized unions weakenedsocial participation. Thousands of NGOs havesprung up since the late 1980s, but the InternalSecurity Law limited their development. The move-ment that overthrew Suharto dissipated withoutdeveloping into strong civil society organizations,but those that attained formal status have moved into advocacy on key policy issues. Examplesinclude attempts by the Forum for Popular Partici-pation to push amendments to Law 22 of 1999, andthe support of citizen forums by the IndonesianPartnership in Local Governance Initiatives, a net-work of local NGOs. China and Vietnam do not emphasize civic par- ticipation and do not have vibrant civil societies.Formal NGOs have a shorter history in China thanin other East Asian countries, and social welfare isconsidered the responsibility of central govern-ment. In the late 1970s and 1980s, governmentdepartments at all levels approved and managedsocial organizations. As these groups proliferated,the Ministry of Civil Affairs took control of thisprocess in 1988. In 1989, after the Tiananmen inci-dent, new regulations were applied retroactivelyand became even stricter and more extensive in thelate 1990s. Social organizations\u2014official, semioffi-cial, and popular\u2014must register and win sponsor-ship of a government agency. Only a minority ofgrassroots organizations has been able to registerlegally. Many are financed by international agen-cies, but support is scarce in less-developed areas.In the late 1990s, a government campaign to regu-larize NGOs required reregistration at the Ministryof Civil Affairs. The number of NGOs fell from180,000 in 1995 to 160,000 in 2000. According to Vietnam's 1992 Constitution, the Communist Party is the leading organ of the state,which includes civil society and mass organiza-tions. Economic reform, however, has encouragedthe development of civil society. The countryenacted a Law on Co-operatives in 1997 and issueda Grassroots Democracy Decree a year later, estab-lishing a legal framework for citizen participationat the commune level. The Law on Complaints andDenunciations is now under revision to expandopportunities for citizens to register complaintsagainst the civil service. State-sponsored massorganizations, however, are still the major form ofsocial organization. Representatives of the Women'sUnion, Y outh Union, Farmer's Union, and GeneralConfederation of Labor\u2014whose membershipsinclude a large proportion of citizens\u2014sit onnational and local committees that discuss policiesaffecting their constituencies. Strictly speaking,state-sponsored mass organizations are not part ofcivil society, although they have become somewhat The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 37more like NGOs.A growing number of community- based organizations, such as water users' associa-tions, medical volunteers, and village developmentcommittees, have formed and are enhancingVietnamese civil society. A 2003 decree on NGOsrecognizes their importance, but some of its provi- sions raise concerns about how freely they canfunction. Cambodia's decentralization legislation requires participatory planning at the commune level,although the extent to which this is genuine andinclusive varies considerably. Though weak inmany parts of the country, civil society groupsplayed an important role in providing communityservices in the absence of local government.Initially hostile to government-related local institu-tions, NGOs in Cambodia have since offeredimportant expertise and capacity building underSeila, and some are partnering with new communecouncils. With little tradition of popular participa-tion in local governance beyond religious-basedcommunity development, effectively incorporatingcivil society participation in local public sectordecision making will remain a challenge for theforeseeable future. Fiscal Decentralization This section outlines the fiscal functions of sub- national governments in East Asia, focusing onassigned roles and own-source and intergovern-mental revenues. (See chapter 6 for more detail onown-source revenues, and chapters 1 and 3 forinformation on subnational borrowing.) Distributing Functions among Levels of Government The distribution of functions among levels of governments is far from uniform in East Asia,with subnational roles ranging from modest todominant (see table 2.9). Although subnationalgovernments have substantial functions in mostcountries, incomplete implementation of legalauthority has resulted in low subnational expendi-ture shares in some cases. The pattern of assign-ments also varies across government levels andsectors, and the magnitude of subnational expendi-tures is not clearly related to autonomy. At one extreme is Cambodia, where provinces account for less than 20 percent of public expendi-tures and act primarily as agents of the center.Elected communes have few mandatory functions andaccount for only about 2 percent of public expendi-tures, although enabling legislation provides for theeventual formal transfer of specific functions tothem. Other East Asian countries have assigned,at least in broad legal terms, relatively signifi-cant responsibilities to subnational governments,although legal provisions are not always opera-tionally defined and implemented. An interestingcontrast to Cambodia is Thailand, where the 1999Decentralization Act calls for the transfer of sixmajor functions to local administrations. Becausethe country has implemented these legal provi-sions only partially, Thai subnational governmentsaccount for only about 10 percent of public expen-ditures, although that figure is expected to growsharply. The Philippines and Indonesia have gone fur- ther in defining and implementing functionalassignments. The 1991 Local Government Code inthe Philippines devolved substantial responsibili-ties to the various types of local governments,which currently account for about 20 percent ofpublic spending. They also have some regulatorypowers, including land reclassification. Indonesia'sLaw 32 of 2004 reserves only national defense, for-eign policy, security, justice, monetary and fiscalpolicy, and religion for the center. Local govern-ments must perform a wide range of obligatoryfunctions under Law 22 of 1999 and Law 32 of2004. The province played a smaller role in manyfunctions under the 1999 legislation, focusingmainly on regional coordination and the backstop-ping of underperforming local governments. Manyof the provincial functions assigned under Law 32of 2004 are similar to those assigned to localgovernments, raising concerns about clarity andredundancy. Subnational governments account forjust over 30 percent of total spending, and that fig-ure is expected to continue growing. China and Vietnam emphasize the sharing of responsibilities. China's Budget Law defines a broaddivision of functions between central and localgovernments, but does not disaggregate local cate-gories. The result is concurrent assignment andsignificant variation across regions. Subnationalgovernments have heavy safety net responsibilities,including pensions, unemployment, and social wel-fare, which are unusual subnational responsibili-ties. The center sets broad expenditure guidelines, 38 East Asia Decentralizesat least in principle. Subnational governments account for around 70 percent of public spending,with the county level accounting for more than40 percent. In Vietnam, intergovernmental respon-sibilities are more specific on paper, but the centerand subnational levels share functions in practice.Still, subnational governments have been playing amore dominant role in some sectors, includingagriculture, forestry, irrigation, fisheries, power,water, education, and health. Their share of publicexpenditures stands at around 50 percent. Subnational Revenues: Own-Source and Shared Most East Asian countries have few productive own- sources of local revenue (see table 2.10 and chap-ter 6). Even where local revenue shares are relativelyhigh, most are centrally defined and/or managed taxes over which subnational governments havelittle control, with the proceeds fully assigned orshared locally. These are in fact intergovernmentaltransfers, but are included here with own-sourcerevenues because of the lack of disaggregated datato clearly distinguish between the two in somecountries. Informal, off-budget revenue is a majorissue in some countries (see chapters 1 and 6). China, Vietnam, and Thailand rely primarily on shared taxes. As economic reforms proceeded andsubnational governments came to dominate publicsector revenues, China introduced the recentraliz-ing 1994 Tax Sharing System noted above andfurther refinements in 2002. Subnational revenueincludes shared taxes\u2014the relative proportionsof which are sometimes negotiated\u2014and severalexclusive subnational taxes.

The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 41 complete freedom to assign revenue to lower levels, resulting in a variety of practices across the country. Strictly speaking, Vietnam has no subnational taxes. The central government controls tax basesand rates completely, and the Department of TaxAdministration collects all nontrade revenue.Subnational taxes are either assigned 100 percent tothe local level or shared among levels. Under 2002reforms, provinces formally receive the proceeds ofall shared taxes and assign portions to districts andcommunes subject to central standards. Fully andpartially shared taxes have recently provided around46 percent of subnational revenues, in roughly equalproportions. In Thailand, subnational revenues include own- collected taxes and nontax revenues, centrally col- lected taxes, and shared taxes. In 2001, locally col-lected revenues accounted for only 11-12 percentof subnational revenues, while shared revenuesaccounted for about 54 percent, including about18 percent from the value added tax. The recentProperty Tax Act\u2014which combines the land andbuilding tax and the land development tax\u2014couldprovide subnational governments with more localrevenue. Indonesia and the Philippines take a different approach. Both have tax sharing, but they pool ahigh proportion of shared resources into a consoli-dated fund allocated by formula as an intergovern-mental transfer (see below). Indonesia also assignsto provincial and district and city governments ashare of revenues from selected taxes. Provinceshave uniform tax rates and share the revenues withlower levels. Shared taxes account for about 32 per- cent of provincial and 20 percent of local income,but Law 33 of 2004 increases tax sharing, particu-larly on selected natural resource bases. Localgovernments exercise control\u2014within nationalceilings\u2014only over a limited set of taxes, many ofwhich are holdovers from the prereform era. Bothprovinces and local governments collect usercharges. Law 34 of 2000 allows new local sources,but it led to the adoption of some problematic localtax and nontax revenues and is slated for revision.Overall, own-source revenues account for about35 percent of provincial and about 6 percent oflocal income, although the latter average masksstronger performance in larger urban areas. In thePhilippines, only cities may impose the full set oflocal taxes, while provinces and municipalities haveless taxing power. Cities and provinces must oftenshare portions of their tax revenues with munici-palities and barangays . As a newly decentralizing country, Cambodia has established few official subnational own-source rev-enues. As noted above, the government centralizedrevenues after the 1993 elections to impose disci-pline on provinces. The 1998 Provincial Budget Lawreinstated limited provincial revenues, but mostprovincial resources continue to flow through cen-tral sectoral budgets. The 2001 Law on Commune/Sangkat Administrative Management grants rev- enue sources to communes, including a land andproperty tax, but the law requires follow-up legisla-tion.

Some communes also collect minor user fees, but these are extralegal as no enablingregulation exists. The new Department of LocalFinance in the Ministry of Economy and Financehas made developing commune own-source rev-enues a priority. Intergovernmental Transfers Intergovernmental transfer systems in East Asia range from substantial to modest in terms of bothcentral and subnational government budgets,from complex to simple in structure, and from rel-atively transparent to highly nontransparent (seetable 2.11). In most cases the central governmentprovides significant intergovernmental transfers,which represent a large share of subnational resources. The intergovernmental transfer system in China is the most complex and least transparent amongthe countries considered here. During the past twodecades, the government has added componentsdesigned to address newly recognized problemswithout removing or altering existing elements.Beyond shared taxes (discussed above), whichaccount for some 40 percent of transfers, there are avariety of specific-purpose grants. These includequota subsidies (left over from an earlier schemethat subsidized deficits on approved expenditures),transfers to offset the impacts of the 1994 TaxSharing System, final account subsidies, and a fewminor programs. Subnational governments rely on 42 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 2.11 Intergovernmental Transfers Country Unconditional transfers Conditional transfers Cambodia Communes receive largely unconditional transfers via formula allocation from Commune/ Sangkat Fund.Provinces receive line-ministry allocations, not transfers; decentralization law allows for conditional transfers to communes.

Philippines Internal Revenue Allotment shares by formula account for 40% of internal revenues; 23% each to provinces and cities, 34% to municipalities, 20% to barangays; the IRA accounts for 94% of transfers.Modest categorical grants, including the Municipal Development Fund, the Local Government Empowerment Fund, and the Calamity Fund. Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources.China Tax Sharing System (1994) assigns shares of certain taxes (table 2.10) to subnational governments' general revenue, but they are officially subject to some expenditure guidelines.Complex accumulation of old and new systems; conditional grants account for more than half of all transfers; dominated by social security, wage increase, and fiscal stimulus grants. Thailand Substantial shared tax revenues (table 2.10); \"general\" transfers for fiscal equalization and other purposes; some, such as the transfer for devolution of compulsory functions, are not trulyunconditional.Specific grants are mostly for capital expenditures, with one type earmarked for education and other types less restricted, so not heavily conditional; some \"general\" transfers (see left column) subject to conditions. Vietnam Certain taxes fully assigned to or shared with subnational governments (table 2.10); equalization transfer distributed by formula to jurisdictions where approved expenditure budgets (based on minimum standards) exceed the sum of shared taxes.Before 2002, no conditional grants, only national program budget allocations; Budget Law (2002) recast these as specific transfers and provides for more types of conditional transfers. transfers to finance nearly half their budgetary expenditures in the aggregate. Thailand and Vietnam also have complex trans- fer systems, but they are generally more transparent.Thailand has two main forms of intergovernmentaltransfers besides shared tax revenues. The centralgovernment devotes the bulk of seven types ofso-called \"general\" grants to fiscal equalization,devolution of compulsory functions, and taxpromotion. Grants fulfilling the first goal are allo-cated by formula, those fulfilling the second goalare based on the number of beneficiaries, and thosefulfilling the third goal are based on past tax per-formance. Specific grants\u2014largely discretionary\u2014are mostly for capital expenditures; one programis earmarked for education, and larger programsare broader. Subnational governments depend ontransfers for about 34 percent of their revenues,not including the 54 percent derived from sharedtaxes. Vietnam provides two types of intergov- ernmental transfers: equalization transfers andspecific-purpose transfers. In the past, the centralgovernment negotiated transfers with subnationalgovernments mostly to fill budget gaps. As of 2003,the government distributes the equalization trans-fer by formula to jurisdictions whose approvedbudgets (based on minimum standards) exceed thesum of \"100 percent shared\" and partially sharedtaxes. The formula must remain in place for threeto five years. These reforms have improved thetransparency and stability of intergovernmentaltransfers. Line ministries have also long used trans-fers to support national priority programs, and the2002 Budget Law formalizes these resources as con-ditional transfer programs. As noted above, justunder half (46 percent) of the revenues of subna-tional governments come from 100 percent andpartially shared taxes; the other 54 percent takes theform of intergovernmental transfers. Indonesia's Law 25 of 1999 significantly altered the transfer system. The dana alokasi umum (DAU) combined substantial transfers for local civil servicewages and the fragmented general program Inpresinto a revenue-sharing fund financed by at least25 percent of central domestic net revenues, with2.5 percent assigned to provinces and 22.5 percentto cities and districts. Under Law 33 of 2004, the pool increased to at least 26 percent of domesticrevenues, and provincial/subprovincial shares nowdepend on functions. The DAU is formula-driven, so the allocation of transfers is more transparentthan in the past, and the formula attempts to con-sider expenditure needs and revenue capacity. Law25 of 1999 and Law 33 of 2004 also provide forspecial-purpose transfers: the dana alokasi khusus (DAK). These are expected to be mainly sectoralconditional (matching) transfers designed in con-sultation with line ministries, but the Ministry ofFinance has only begun to experiment with DAK ona small scale. Given the weak devolution of revenuepowers, subnational governments rely on transfers(exclusive of shared taxes) for more than 65 percentof their revenues, with provinces averaging 34 per-cent and local governments averaging 74 percent. The main intergovernmental transfer program in the Philippines is the Internal Revenue Allotment(IRA). The Local Government Code requires thatthis program share 40 percent of gross nationalinternal revenues (with a three-year lag), and theprogram accounts for 94 percent of total transfers.Subnational levels share the IRA pool, with 23 per-cent going to provinces and cities, 34 percent tomunicipalities, and 20 percent to barangays . A sim- ple formula based on population, equal share, andland area allocates the appropriate pool share amongunits at each level. Two modest revenue-sharingschemes\u2014the national wealth share (national rev-enues derived from certain taxes) and the tobaccoexcise share\u2014and a few small categorical grants alsoexist. Subnational governments rely heavily on trans-fers, which account for over 80 percent of provincialbudgets and around 70 percent of municipal budgets.Cities are more financially independent, relying onthe IRA for just over 40 percent of their income. Cambodia's intergovernmental transfer pro- gram is modest, reflecting its early stage ofdecentralization. The country launched the Com-mune/ Sangkat Fund (CSF) in 2002 to coincide with the first election of commune councils. The CSFrelies on both domestic and external sources. Thecentral budget contributed 1.2 percent of recurrentdomestic revenue in 2002, and that share grew to2.5 percent in 2004. The Commune/ Sangkat Law requires that the Cambodian government devote ashare of its budget to the CSF, but how to deter-mine this percentage and ensure that it will grow isunclear. CSF transfers are divided into generaladministration and local development compo-nents, with no less than 70 percent allocated to the The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 43latter. The central government allocates the general administration share to communes and sangkats in proportion to the number of councilors, and thelocal development share based on a formula withthree components: equal share, a share propor-tional to population, and a share proportional torelative poverty. Given the weak development oflocal resources, Cambodian communes depend onthe center for almost 100 percent of their funds. Managing Decentralization Reforms Chapter 1 highlighted the importance of moving beyond the decentralization structure to considerthe decentralization process. This section providesa more in-depth, country-specific look at keyaspects of this process, focusing on responsibilityfor designing and managing decentralization, thestrategy for implementing it, and the capacity-building activities designed to support it. Responsibility for the Decentralization Process In some East Asian countries, regular government institutions manage decentralization. In others, spe-cial bodies manage the process, but these differ incomposition and role. All countries experience ten- sions between reformists and defenders of the statusquo, and various political parties and institutionsmay hold different visions of decentralization.Table 2.12 summarizes arrangements for designingand managing decentralization in the region. Because decentralization is not a formal policy in China, central ministries \"manage\" decentralizationthrough routine interactions with subnational gov-ernments. Existing institutions similarly managethe decentralization process in Vietnam. The Min-istry of Finance and Ministry of Planning andInvestment, and their provincial counterparts, areparticularly important. The Philippines has alsorelied on existing national institutions, supportedby an interagency committee responsible for moni-toring implementation of the Local GovernmentCode. Key players include the National Economicand Development Authority, the Department ofBudget and Management, and the Department ofInterior and Local Government. Besides cities and afew provinces, associations of local governmentsalso play important roles in the Philippines' decen-tralization process. Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia all estab- lished special bodies to guide decentralization.44 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 2.12 Responsibility for Managing Decentralization Country Institutional responsibility Cambodia The interministerial National Committee to Support the Communes (chaired by the Ministry of Interior) in charge of developing and implementing decentralization involving communes; Council for Administrative Reform in charge of deconcentration involving provinces; generally weak coordination between the two. Single integrated, interministerial process created in 2004 to develop consistent decentralization and deconcentration strategies. China No formal decentralization policy, so intergovernmental issues managed through regular government institutions. Indonesia High-level Regional Autonomy Review Board initially in charge of decentralization policy but process now dominated by the Ministry of Home Affairs, with specific matters formally under the Ministry of Finance or other ministries; generally weak interministerial coordination and some problematic competition. Philippines Interagency oversight committee to monitor implementation of Local Government Code; National Economic and Development Authority, Department of Budget and Management, and Department of Interior and Local Government also play important roles. Thailand National Decentralization Committee, with broad representation from national and subnational governments as well as the nongovernmental arena, charged with making, implementing, and monitoring decentralization policy. Vietnam No formal decentralization-specific body; regular government institutions such as Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning and Investment manage reform. Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources. Indonesia's Regional Autonomy Review Board (DPOD), composed of minister-level members,played a significant role in setting the initial direc-tion of decentralization policy. With a basic legaland institutional framework for decentralizationnow in place, key national ministries have assumedprincipal responsibility for detailing and imple-menting broad policy parameters. The Ministry ofHome Affairs plays the strongest official role, andthe Ministry of Finance and the national planningagency (Bappenas) provide key inputs in specificareas. Sectoral ministries help develop regulationsfor decentralizing services, but Home Affairs isattempting to assert leadership. Weak coordinationand interministerial competition remain signifi-cant problems. Although Home Affairs is techni-cally in charge, it has limited authority over otherministries with important decentralization roles. In Thailand, the National Decentralization Committee serves as the strategic unit for decen-tralization policy. Its members include local gov-ernmental and nongovernmental officials as well asrepresentatives of central government. This com-mittee, like the Indonesian Regional AutonomyReview Board, was instrumental in designingdecentralization, and is now also charged withmonitoring and implementing reforms and pro-viding policy recommendations to the cabinet.National agencies, particularly the Ministry of Inte-rior, also engage in the day-to-day management ofdecentralization. Responsibility for decentralization policy in Cambodia is fragmented, with the Ministry of theInterior, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the Ministry of Planning particularly involved. Thegovernment established the National Committee toSupport the Communes, chaired by the Ministry ofInterior, to develop and implement decentraliza-tion to the communes. The Seila task force andits secretariat are also helping integrate the donor-initiated Seila Program with the deconcentratedand decentralized systems as they develop. TheCouncil for Administrative Reform, attached to theCouncil of Ministers and responsible for overallpublic sector administrative reform, has been themain player in deconcentration, although the Min-istry of Interior has recently taken a stronger role indeveloping the required legislation. In 2004 theCambodian government established an integratedprocess overseen by an interministerial committeeto develop decentralization and deconcentrationpolicy in an integrated way. Strategies for Implementing Decentralization East Asian countries have generally not imple- mented decentralization strategically or systemati-cally (see table 2.13). The tendency toward ad hocapproaches is not surprising, given the variety ofpolitical rationales for decentralization and the dif-fering nature of regimes in the region. Decentraliza-tion is mostly occurring within highly centralizedsystems. National agencies often lack serious com-mitment to reform, slowing progress even in coun-tries with reasonable frameworks. The overallenvironment is not conducive to well-planned and The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 45 TABLE 2.13 Decentralization Strategies Country Nature of strategy Cambodia Limited elements of a strategy for commune system, but weakly developed and short term. China No formal strategy; some asymmetric treatment of subnational governments.

Because decentralization in China was essentially a by-product of economic reform, it lacks a realstrategy. The central government treats varioustypes of subnational governments differently, butthere is not a developed asymmetric decen-tralization strategy. Because of the nature of theadministrative hierarchy and the diversity of thecountry, however, provinces make decisions aboutsubprovincial roles, perhaps in some cases reflectingstrategic attempts to improve subprovincial per-formance. The lack of an overall strategy is alsomanifested in ad hoc central government steps todefine the intergovernmental system, resulting indisjointed revenue and expenditure assignmentsand an inconsistent intergovernmental transfersystem. Indonesia and Cambodia also have weak imple- mentation strategies. Decentralization was adoptedquickly and with little debate in both cases. InIndonesia this occurred in a crisis situation, whileCambodia's efforts might be characterized as acase of political opportunism. Because Indonesia'sreforms emerged from crisis, the general frame-work was pushed urgently, without much thoughtgiven to how to make it work. The country's decen-tralization is often referred to as a \"Big Bang\"because significant resources and functions weredevolved so quickly. A substantial portion of theresources, however, are used to pay for staff whowere transferred to local governments, suggesting a possible conscious effort to reduce the effects ofmajor reform shocks. Operational details on manyof the legally devolved functions still have to bespecified, and the above-noted weak coordinationof the national agencies involved constrains thedevelopment of a genuine strategy. Cambodia has limited elements of a strategy. As many of the newly elected communes had little orno capacity or political credibility, the early designincluded initially modest functional expectations,simple structure and staffing of councils, and clas-sification of communes into two categories basedon capacity, with differential funding awarded onthat basis. As the system matures, communes are tobe assigned greater responsibilities. Unfortunately,there is no strategy for making further progress.The classification system has been abolished with-out any assessment of the extent of capacity devel-opment in weaker communes. There is no clear vision of where the overall system is headed, theplan for fully folding Seila into the formal govern-ment system is incompletely developed, and, as inIndonesia, coordination of the key actors is inade-quate. The new interministerial effort noted aboveis intended to provide direction and facilitate coor-dination, but how successful it will be is unclear. Though decentralization in the Philippines also emerged from crisis, the country did attempt todevelop a strategy, at least on paper. A Master Planfor the Sustained Implementation of the 1991 LocalGovernment Code (1993-98) provided the blue-print for reform. The plan included three phases.Phase one (1992-93) involved the transfer of func-tions, which varied by type of local government.Phase two (1994-96) gave local governments timeto adjust to their formal responsibilities. Phase three (1997 onward) expected a more stable systemto focus on building local capacity, with technical assistance from national agencies. The interagencyoversight committee noted above was charged withmonitoring implementation. The extent to whichthis phasing was followed is not clear, and decen-tralization continues to face political difficulties,instability in some regions, and limited resources.Some central agencies have held on to functionsthey were supposed to devolve, and development oflocal revenue has been slow. Thailand and Vietnam are closest to having a decentralization strategy, but both have imple-mented it slowly. In 1997, after the new Thai Con-stitution mandated decentralization, a Local FiscalMaster Plan identified 17 measures to enhancelocal revenues, clarify responsibility for expendi-ture, reform the intergovernmental transfer system,establish mechanisms for monitoring local fiscalsystems, promote new methods of mobilizing capi-tal for local investment, and develop local capacity.Parliament did not approve a more comprehensiveplan to decentralize administrative power to localadministrations until 2002. The plan includes ageneral framework, objectives, and guidelines fordecentralizing administrative power in three stages.During the first stage (2001-4), the country wassupposed to transfer 245 tasks, improve local andregional administrative systems, eliminate overlap-ping functions, and strengthen local capacity tomanage functions, personnel, revenue, and assets.Unfortunately, these goals were not fully achieved, 46 East Asia Decentralizesthe coordinating National Decentralization Com- mittee (NDC) is understaffed and inadequatelyfinanced, and the strength of political support isunclear. Thus, the NDC has not been able to opera-tionalize what appears to be an atypically carefullyconceived implementation strategy. In Vietnam, the movement to give greater respon- sibility to subnational governments has progressedin stages. Expenditure and revenue assignments havebeen changed gradually, and the transparency andstability of the intergovernmental transfer systemhave improved. The central government has alsogradually introduced autonomy measures, removingthe requirement that the National Assembly approveprovincial budgets, and giving provinces moreauthority over lower levels. Pilot programs have alsoaccorded some urban areas greater autonomy. How-ever, these elements may reflect the conservatism of ahighly centralized government in a one-party statemore than a strategic effort to decentralize. Building Subnational Capacity As chapter 1 notes, capacity building is an impor- tant part of any decentralization strategy. This istrue not only for subnational governments but alsofor central agencies, which must learn new ways ofdoing business and new skills in developing localsystems, strengthening subnational actors, andmonitoring the implementation of decentraliza-tion. Although most East Asian countries haverelied on technical assistance and provided trainingto central employees involved in decentralization,they have paid limited attention to ensuring thatnational staff can meet their shifting obligations and to realign relationships in the way required. Local level capacity building under decentraliza- tion is generally of two types. The first type involvestraining to ensure that subnational staff can per-form their technical functions. The second typeinvolves building governance mechanisms that arerequired for a decentralized system to work effec-tively. Either of these two types can be supply-driven (by the central government) or demand-driven (by subnational governments). The lattertype is considered good practice based on therecognition that a lack of demand for reforms and the capacity needed to make them work under-mines their chances of being realized and sus-tained. Most countries in the region have focusedon traditional supply-driven technical capacitybuilding, and most governance training has alsobeen supply-driven (table 2.14). Cambodia faces the greatest challenges. Capacity is weak in many communes, which had no realfunctions before the first elections in 2002, even aspart of provincial administrations. Regions thatparticipated in the Seila Program developed rea-sonable capacity, but other communes generally lagfar behind. Even Seila communes must adjust tonew systems and procedures under official decen-tralization policy, posing significant challenges. TheMinistry of Interior and the Ministry of Economyand Finance have conducted most commune-leveltraining, and technical staff at the provincial levelhelp communes implement new procedures. Thistraining, however, has barely laid a foundation, andmuch work remains at both the commune and The Rules of the Intergovernmental Game in East Asia: Decentralization Frameworks and Processes 47 TABLE 2.14 Building Decentralization Capacity Country Capacity-building provisions Cambodia Massive, basic program run by central government for developing commune system.

Source: Compiled by the author from multiple sources. higher levels. Deepening and institutionalizing capacity takes time, and the prominent role ofdonors in providing and financing decentralizationcapacity-building efforts in Cambodia raises con-cerns about sustainability. Subnational governments elsewhere in the region have greater capacity, but the levels andmechanisms for building it vary. In China, wheredecentralization is not official policy, capacitybuilding has focused on improving overall govern-ment performance. All ministries and departmentsreceive an annual training budget, and most train-ing is organized locally. The central governmentalso posts its own mid-career staff to subnationaladministrations for six months to a year, whichmay boost the capacity of those governments.Although Vietnam has also long been heavily cen-tralized, its decentralization program is more for-mal. Subnational capacity is generally strongest inprovinces and larger cities. Staff from higher levelsof government provide most training of subna-tional staff. Neither China nor Vietnam has madetraining of citizens to interact with local govern-ments a priority. In Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, local governments have benefited from the transfer ofhigher-level staff. Indonesia has decentralized morethan 2 million officials since 1999. The Philippinestransferred some 70,000 employees from centralministries to local governments following the LocalGovernment Code of 1991. Given its more incre-mental approach to decentralization, Thailand hasmade more limited transfers involving about 4,000central employees so far. In all these cases, the helplocal governments receive is not always the type theyneed. Capacity levels vary widely within these coun-tries and are generally higher in urban areas, withsignificant gaps in smaller urban and rural areas. InIndonesia and Thailand, higher-level agencies drivelocal capacity building. In the Philippines, localgovernments are formally responsible for buildingcapacity, but training focuses on councilors ratherthan staff, and the central government, internationalagencies, and NGOs often assist with the provision ofsuch training. Summary and Conclusions The various historical and political roots of decen- tralization in East Asia are reflected in the observeddiversity in the paths it has taken, the enabling frameworks that define it, and the ways in which it isstructured. In Indonesia and the Philippines, thefocus quickly shifted from deconcentration todecentralization, and this is happening in Thailandas well. The focus remains on deconcentration inChina and Vietnam, but there are emerging ele-ments of delegation and devolution. Cambodiamakes a stark division between deconcentration anddevolution. Within their basic policy thrust, allcountries have multiple tiers of government oradministration, but exact forms and responsibilitiesvary. In Thailand, most levels have a role, while thefocus has been on provinces and urban governmentsin China and Vietnam. In Cambodia, Indonesia, andthe Philippines, subprovincial units have been themain targets of decentralization reforms. Decentralization enabling frameworks differ sig- nificantly. The Philippines and Thailand have robustconstitutional and legal foundations, and Indonesiaadopted constitutional reforms to institutionalizedecentralization. Indonesia and Vietnam have legalframeworks, although not fully developed. Weakerlaws underpin the system in Cambodia, but addi-tional legislation is in process. China has the weakestframework, with only a few laws that refer to subna-tional roles. The nature and degree of developmentof the enabling framework do not seem to affectdecentralization progress or quality, but all coun-tries eventually need to define the roles of relevantactors in a framework that protects their rights andprovides a basis for accountability. Although far from complete, governance is improving in the region through political, institu-tional, and fiscal decentralization reforms. Allcountries considered here have subnational elec-tions, ranging from Vietnam at all levels to Cambo-dia at one level. Subnational councils usually havean element of direct election, but in some casesthere are higher-level appointments or party listvoting. In the Philippines, council leadership isdirectly elected, and this will soon occur in Indone-sia and Thailand. Political competition varies fromone-party states in China and Vietnam to thenearly chaotic multiparty system of Indonesia.Cambodia has multiple parties, but one dominates,while political competition is somewhat morerobust in the Philippines and Thailand. Autonomy differs in complex ways across coun- tries. Thailand and Vietnam have higher-level 48 East Asia Decentralizescontrols over subnational budgeting and personnel decisions, although they are not always exercisedand are being relaxed. Philippine subnational gov-ernments are more independent in principle, if notalways in practice, while new laws curtail autonomyin Indonesia. On transparency, the Philippines andThailand provide extensive public access to subna-tional budgets and minimally acceptable auditing,while China and Vietnam do not. Incorporatingcitizen input into local decisions is a priority onlyin a few cases, and civil society varies, from rela-tively free and robust in the Philippines to heavilycontrolled in China and Vietnam. Expenditure and revenue assignments vary con- siderably. In most cases there is some formalassignment, but details typically need clarification.In the Philippines and Indonesia, the process is substantially or moderately advanced. Cambodiahas a very long way to go, and China has no clearinterest in formalizing assignments. Own-sourcerevenues are generally weak, so subnational govern-ments rely heavily on shared taxes and intergovern-mental transfers. In China, Thailand, and Vietnam,national taxes are shared on a tax-by-tax basis,often by origin. In Indonesia and the Philippines,most shared revenues are pooled into a consoli-dated fund for distribution as a formula-basedtransfer. Cambodia has little formal tax sharing;provinces are funded primarily through nationalsectoral budgets, and the commune transfer pool isdetermined on an ad hoc basis. Transfers varywidely in significance, structure, complexity, andtransparency. China's system is highly complex andnontransparent. Other countries have somewhatsimpler and more transparent systems, especiallyfor general revenue sharing, but there are com-monly less transparent conditional transfers, oftenfor capital expenditures. Although often neglected, the institutional structures and processes for defining and managingdecentralization are critical for success. In mostEast Asian countries, decentralization is primarilyoverseen by regular government agencies. Specialdecentralization bodies exist in some countries, buttheir composition and role differs. Indonesia hasa high-level policy body that influences majordesign decisions. An interministerial body in thePhilippines has primary responsibility only formonitoring implementation. Interministerial bod-ies in Cambodia and Thailand play broader roles inboth design and implementation. In no case are coordination or enforcement of decentralizationactivities adequate. Many decentralization problems result from the lack of an implementation strategy. Given China'scontext, the conspicuous lack of strategy is under-standable. Both Indonesia and Cambodia arestruggling to deal with the consequences of poorplanning prior to rapid, politically driven decentral-ization. The Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnamhave more considered implementation strategies,with articulated phases and timelines. In thePhilippines, the final phase of the 1991 decentraliza-tion effort is in process, but the phasing does notseem to have been systematically followed, and prob-lems persist. Vietnam, out of an abundance of cau-tion expected in a centralized one-party system, hasmoved in an atypically structured way. Thailandhas a well-articulated strategy, but implementationhas been slow. None of these countries has a clearstrategy in the sense of using graduated, asymmetricfunctional assignments and capacity-building sup-port consistent with the performance of individuallocal governments. Political factors elaborated in chapter 1 compli- cate the development of decentralization frame-works and strategies, and the pitfalls of trying to betoo normatively comprehensive in designing andimplementing decentralization are well known. It isalso clear, however, that the costs of ignoring theproblems that have often emerged as decentraliza-tion has unfolded in East Asia are potentially veryhigh. With a basic decentralization vision and adegree of leadership, East Asian countries shouldfind it possible to accommodate political realitiesand strategically use opportunities to build moreeffective decentralization frameworks, structures,processes, and outcomes. This is the significantchallenge facing all countries in the region. Endnote 1. The information in this chapter is largely derived from country reviews prepared as background papers for thisvolume.

If,however, decentralization is designed badly orimplemented and monitored improperly, such a sys-tem can foster \"soft\" budget constraints\u2014loosenedcontrols on the fiscal activities of subnationalgovernments\u2014that may undercut the spectaculareconomic growth occurring in East Asia today. This chapter highlights the challenges of decen- tralization in the context of macroeconomic man-agement, especially in achieving fiscal sustainabilityand providing a medium-term environment forsustained growth. The focus is twofold. First, thechapter highlights the critical need for central gov-ernments to monitor subnational fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities through well-designed reporting,auditing, and financial management institutions, aswell as information databases. Second, the chapteraddresses the need to institutionalize incentives forsubnational governments to publicly and regularlyreport relevant financial information. Most East Asian countries are at the early stages of this twofold process. Unless the process keepspace with decentralization, the result will be subna-tional arrears and pressures for central bailouts\u2014thelatter occurring through ad hoc financial transfers,or accounting \"adjustments\" that take significant taxand spending activity off-budget. Once countriesabandon the discipline of hard budget constraints,systematic budget planning and execution at central 533 Achieving Fiscal Sustainability Sudarshan Gooptu and subnational levels will yield to uncertain inter- governmental flows, capricious revenue policies,and a lack of medium-term fiscal planning. Much is at stake in getting this decentralization system right. East Asian countries have recoveredrapidly from the 1997 financial crisis, posting highgrowth rates. Regional output grew by 6.7 percentin 2002 and 7.9 percent in 2003 and an estimated7.8 percent in 2004. Growth is expected to reach7.1 percent in 2005\u2014the strongest record since thestart of the global and regional recession in late2000. The number of people living below US$2 perday is estimated to have fallen to around 34 percentin 2004, amounting to some 636 million people\u2014down from 50 percent as recently as 1999, repre-senting 890 million people (World Bank 2004, 2005table 1.1). The policy challenge for each country is to maintain its high growth rate while strengtheningits fiscal health through intergovernmental coordi-nation and monitoring. Unfortunately, this taskis far from straightforward. For a start, whetherdeveloping countries experience a causal relation-ship between decentralization, macroeconomic sta-bility, and economic growth is unclear. The reasonsare twofold. First, the data for measuring the extentto which a country has fiscally decentralized are simply not available\u2014a worldwide problem thatalso exists in East Asia. Second, the line is notalways clear between formal and informal institu-tional arrangements for enforcing hard budget54 East Asia Decentralizes constraints. Even if the right data and definition were available to measure decentralization, track- ing fiscal risks can be difficult when subnationalgovernments have hidden, off-budget expenses andfunds, as in some East Asian countries. Still, the elements of responsible fiscal manage- ment, and the criteria for maintaining fiscal disci-pline in a decentralizing environment, are wellknown. This chapter therefore focuses on empiricalconclusions regarding the links between fiscaldecentralization and growth, the role of budgetconstraints in fostering fiscal discipline, the rela-tionship between subnational borrowing and acountry's overall fiscal sustainability, and the result-ing need for managing financial risk. Links between Fiscal Decentralization and Economic Growth In theory, devolving fiscal responsibilities can improve public sector efficiency, boost competitionamong subnational governments in delivering pub-lic services, and stimulate economic growth (Birdand Wallich 1993). These potential benefits reflectthe belief that subnational governments can bestmake growth-promoting public expenditures insectors such as education, health, and infrastruc-ture, because they have better information on localcircumstances and interregional differences (Oates1993). 1 East Asia's spectacular precrisis growth and postcrisis rebound have depended significantly onprudent macroeconomic management. However,empirical research has been inconclusive regardingany causal relationship between decentralizationand growth in developing countries. In a study of 46 countries from 1970 to 1989, Davoodi and Zou (1998) found a negative relation-ship between fiscal decentralization and economicgrowth in developing countries, and no relation-ship in developed countries. 2The authors explain that \"conventional wisdom points towards positivegrowth effects of capital and infrastructure spend-ing and negative growth effects of welfare and cur-rent spending.\" This implies that in developingcountries\u2014where subnational entities spend alarger proportion of their budgets on wages andsalaries and social welfare\u2014decentralized systemsexhibit slower long-term growth per capita. 3Thetime frame for assessing the impact of different types of public spending is also important. Analystssee health and education spending, for example, asan investment in human capital with a long-termpayoff, resembling physical investment. 4 Ebel and Yilmaz (2003) reproduced this analysis by weighing degrees of revenue autonomy. Theyfound that tax autonomy and nontax autonomy havea positive correlation with economic growth, whiletax sharing has a negative relationship (see chap-ter 6).These results suggest that a country's economic performance partly reflects the degree to which sub-national governments control their revenues. In a study of the United States, Xie et al. (1999) showed that further fiscal decentralization with theaim of boosting efficiency and economic growthwould in fact harm growth. Akai and Sakata (2002)refuted that finding, incorporating a more elabo-rate definition of fiscal decentralization. Theirstudy examined the growth impact of giving sub-national governments the authority to raise taxesand spend public funds. 5Since local governments do not necessarily spend locally collected revenueslocally, the authors found that they may not in facthave tax autonomy (Zhang and Zou 2001). Martinez-Vazquez and McNab (2001) con- firmed the inconclusive relationship between fiscaldecentralization and economic growth and theimportance of individual country circumstances\u2014including noneconomic ones\u2014in determiningcausality. Lin and Liu's analysis of China (2000),using provincial-level data from 1970 to 1993, sug-gests that fiscal decentralization has helped spurthat country's impressive growth over the past 20 or30 years. 6However, Zhang and Zou (2001) found a negative relationship between fiscal decentraliza-tion and economic growth in China. 7 Subnational Fiscal Discipline and Budget Constraints Determining the degree of fiscal discipline among subnational governments in East Asia requiresidentifying the budget constraints they face. Doingso in countries like Cambodia\u2014where subnationalgovernments have little spending and revenueauthority and rely almost entirely on transfers fromthe center\u2014is relatively easy. At the other extreme,about half or more of the resources availableto China's subnational governments come fromAchieving Fiscal Sustainability 55 off-budget sources, over which they have virtually total control.8In Vietnam, off-budget accounts such as the Social Security Fund, the Health Insur-ance Fund, and the National Development Fundconstrain the budget autonomy of subnationalgovernments. In some East Asian countries, state-owned enterprises at the subnational level receive off-budget resources in the form of deferred taxes orarrears accruals on debt service and other contrac-tual payments. This is a particular concern in Chinaand Vietnam. In Thailand, this problem is miti-gated by the fact that subnational governments donot typically own enterprises, and by the inclusionof all state-owned enterprises in the \"consolidatedpublic sector's\" budgetary accounts. Extrabudgetary revenues and expenditures among subnational authorities make their truebudget constraints difficult to ascertain. This isespecially problematic when data are not reportedin a timely manner and are often incomplete, as inmost East Asian countries. Thus, when govern-ments rely substantially on extrabudgetary funds,national budgets give only a partial picture of fiscalrealities. Enforcing hard budget constraints among subna- tional governments requires clear expenditureassignments, formula-based transfer systems, localrevenues, prudent subnational borrowing rules, andgood financial reporting (see box 1.3 in chapter 1).None of the East Asian countries examined here meetthese prerequisites. Such a situation can lead to per-verse incentives to overspend, accumulate arrears,and overborrow. Key among such incentives is theprevailing practice of higher-level financial bailoutsfor subnational governments that are already in oreven heading toward default. This is of particularconcern if the subnational government is large, as isoften the case with soft budget constraints. 9 A country's system of intergovernmental fiscal management (or lack thereof) may also motivatesubnational authorities to keep their transactionsoff-budget\u2014especially richer provinces that do notwant to cede part of their revenue base to the centerfor tax sharing. Effective fiscal decentralizationrequires an institutional structure that minimizessuch adverse expectations. In China, \"fee-to-tax\"reforms aim to bring some off-budget subnationalrevenues within the budgetary umbrella, but muchremains to be done in most East Asian countries.Information on these quasifiscal transactions remains weak, and work on improving this infor-mation base is just beginning, even in China. Finally, subnational governments in many coun- tries have faced difficulties in planning their activi-ties and managing their finances owing to delays inallocation decisions and a lack of predictabilityregarding intergovernmental transfers. In Thai-land, other than knowing with certainty that theirnongrant revenues will equal those of the previousfiscal year, local governments find it difficult topredict their shared tax revenue allocations. This ismainly due to delays in establishing the criteria fordistributing the allocations from the center to localgovernments. 10 Subnational Borrowing and Fiscal Sustainability Fiscal sustainability means that a subnational gov- ernment covers its expenditures out of its own rev-enues, reducing its dependence on borrowing andtransfers from the center (Bird 2003). T o determinewhether a subnational government's plans are fis-cally sustainable, analysts need accurate informa-tion on revenues and expenditures at the central,regional, and local levels. Analysts also need tounderstand the interplay between intergovernmen-tal grants and government borrowing\u2014that is, howhard the subnational budget constraint truly is.Careful analysis of country-specific intergovern-mental relations, and the resulting incentive frame-work, should accompany any analysis of fiscalsustainability. Subnational governments in most of the East Asian countries examined here rely heavily onintergovernmental transfers. The large bailoutsduring the 1997 financial crisis and since, such asthe recent recapitalization of Chinese state-ownedbanks in 2004, have undermined fiscal sustainabil-ity in East Asia by softening the budget constraintsimposed on subnational governments. Discre-tionary transfers to deficit subnational govern-ments in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, andunclear assignment of responsibilities throughoutthe region, have compounded this result. Many subnational governments in East Asia also have access to onlending from the central govern-ment and donors. Such lending is typically in theform of sovereign guaranteed external loans that56 East Asia Decentralizes the central government contracts but channels to subnational entities at different interest rates.Onlending interest rates and terms vary acrosscountries. In China, the final borrower bears theentire foreign-exchange risk associated with theseloans, while in other countries the center assumessome or all of this risk. Most subnational borrow-ing in Indonesia has occurred through central gov-ernment onlending mechanisms on terms that arehighly favorable to the center. However, the repay-ment record of Indonesian subnational borrowershas been poor. 11Thailand allows subnational gov- ernments to borrow from domestic banks andbond markets, subject to legal ceilings in any givenbudget year. In Indonesia, the Ministry of Financesets the aggregate limits to regional borrowing for aparticular fiscal year in August of the previous year,and no direct borrowing from foreign sources ispermitted. Instead, all such borrowing occursthrough onlending arrangements with the min-istry. Subnational governments in Vietnam may notborrow at all (see table 3.1). International experience since the early 1980s, especially in Latin America, suggests that withoutappropriate accountability and transparency mech-anisms, decentralization can encourage dangerousopportunistic behavior by state and local authori-ties. If left unchecked, such opportunism couldundermine macroeconomic stability. The mostvivid manifestation of this phenomenon is the soft-ening of subnational budget constraints (Rodden2000a; World Bank 2002). Avoiding this riskdepends on the ability of the central government toprevent subnational authorities from passing theirliabilities to higher-level governments. 12This, in turn, requires institutional mechanisms to disci-pline borrowing by state and local governments. Examining experiences in Argentina, Brazil, and India, Rodden et al. (2003) show that unsustainablesubnational deficits emerge when provinces havepowerful representatives, when they depend heavilyon intergovernmental transfers, and when theyhave autonomous access to sources of deficitfinancing. The latter can include bonds, loans fromdomestic banks (which may themselves be state-owned, as in China), nonpayment of employeewages, and contingent liabilities. If these existwhere the central government cannot commit toa no-bailout policy, or cannot limit subnationalborrowing, subnational governments have incen- tives to run unsustainable deficits. Fiscal, political, and financial institutions that strengthen competition at the local level, especiallyfor capital, can promote hard budget constraints. 13 If institutions directly or indirectly suggest that thecentral government will step in to cover subna-tional liabilities in the case of default, they mayencourage subnational governments to \"overbor-row, overspend, or undertax\" (Rodden 2000a). The Latin American experience suggests that subnational governments that are subject to hardbudget constraints are more likely to tax and spendprudently (Bird 2001). Fiscal sustainability is also aforward-looking concept, in that it requires accu-rate assumptions about revenues and expendituresand key economic variables. Making meaningfulassumptions that are palatable to policy makers andtheir constituents requires a good understanding ofinstitutional and country-specific details. In Indonesia, for instance, only after it passed Laws 22 and 25 on intergovernmental fiscal rela-tions in 1999 and issued implementing regulations(PP107) in 2000 could regions borrow withoutstrict approval from the center. 14Subnational domestic borrowing is now subject to a rule-basedapproach and central government approval. For-eign borrowing is not allowed, except throughonlending from the central government or donors. In view of Indonesia's public debt burden, how- ever, and as the country establishes local financialmanagement structures, a ministerial decree tem-porarily banned any subnational borrowing untilthe intergovernmental fiscal relations Law 25/99was revised. This ban has been in effect since 2000but was to be lifted at the end of fiscal year 2004,after the implementation regulations of the revisedLaw 25 are in place. The goal is to maintain fiscaldiscipline by strengthening both market and rule-based mechanisms\u2014highlighting the fact thatcountries may sometimes require strong, centrallyimposed fiscal constraints, especially in the earlystages of decentralization. Subnational govern-ments may rely on short-term borrowing (withmaturities of less than 12 months) to manage theircash flow. In theory, as in China, the Indonesiancentral government can intercept general grantfunds if a region fails to meet its debt serviceobligations.TABLE 3.1 Subnational Borrowing Practices Summary of practices Cambodia China Indonesia Philippines Thailand Vietnam Borrowing power and practices(excluding bor-rowing from cen-tral government) Borrowing from the government/donor onlending LGs cannot borrow.

SOCB evaluates large-scaleprojects. 59In Thailand, local governments may borrow domestically and internationally, with priorauthorization from the cabinet. These governmentsmay issue debt securities and borrow from official,external bilateral creditors for development proj-ects. In practice, local debt financing is somewhatlimited, including from domestic capital markets.The primary source of borrowing has been localdevelopment funds managed by the Ministry ofInterior. Subnational governments have more recently borrowed from commercial banks andpublic revolving funds. In Vietnam, subnational governments may not run fiscal deficits. Provinces may borrow, but onlydomestically, by issuing project investment bonds,or by borrowing from the Development AssistanceFund. 15Provinces may use these funds only for projects with prior approval from the ProvincialPeople's Council under the five-year provincialPublic Investment Plan. The province must alsoallocate funds for debt service in future budgetsuntil the debt matures. 16Local state-owned enter- prises that provide essential services, such as wastedisposal, water, electricity, and transportation, mayborrow from both external and domestic sources.All external borrowing is subject to approval by thecentral government, which provides a sovereignguarantee. T o promote responsible subnational borrowing, some East Asian governments have disseminatedwell-defined, transparent fiscal rules. The rationaleis that all borrowing decisions should take intoaccount the fiscal implications for future genera-tions. 17The issue of implementation remains to be addressed, however. In Indonesia, regulations implementing the decentralization framework limit the debt-to-revenue ratio to 75 percent of the previous year's general revenue, and the debt service-to-revenueratio to 40 percent in any given budget year. Regula-tions also govern onlending to the regions. 18In the Philippines, the central government limits transfersto local governments to 40 percent of their internal revenues from three years before. 19Since the ratio of revenue to gross domestic product has beenfalling, this rule implies that some local govern-ments may receive higher transfers than intended,or than the central government can afford. Declin-ing trade taxes also build upward bias into the rev-enue share of local governments. If policy makersdo not intend such an outcome, or if local gov- ernments do not use the allocated resources effi-ciently, the resulting trends will undermine fiscalsustainability. For such rules to be credible and sustainable, they must be part of a well-articulated fiscal frame-work that improves the government's position overthe long term. Such a framework includes clearintergovernmental fiscal relations, appropriate sub-national tax structures, and public pensions. 20 The central government needs to clearly defineaccountability and establish financial managementpractices to enforce these rules. 21In fact, the tem- porary ban on subnational borrowing in Indonesiais a prudent interim measure until the countryestablishes a more solid framework for regionalborrowing and a regional financial informationsystem. A more solid framework for subnationalborrowing must include procedures for handlingregional default. Otherwise, without a credible legalor regulatory threat, the center will end up payingthe bill. 22 Managing Fiscal Risks Rules and administrative controls can help reduce the risks of subnational borrowing. Key measuresinclude strengthening the intergovernmental fiscalsystem and, when the situation warrants, requiringex ante authorization and ex post monitoring. For instance, the central government could set annuallimits on the debt of individual local governments,review individual loans, including their terms andconditions, and centralize all borrowing, withonlending to local governments. 23Other measures to encourage fiscally sustainable borrowing includeprohibiting subnational authorities from issuingguarantees (see table 3.2 for the kinds of explicitand implicit guarantee mechanisms that may existat subnational levels), and imposing ceilings on thenet worth or loan portfolio of borrowers. Indonesiaand Thailand have established ceilings on debt ordebt service as a share of local revenues. Othercountries, such as Vietnam, require local govern-ments to balance their budgets and restrict theirborrowing to specific purposes, such as capitalinvestment. Countries can also rely on the market to regulate subnational borrowing. A market-based systemrequires minimum legal and regulatory structures,60 East Asia Decentralizessuch as supervision and disclosure practices; guide- lines for issuing, settling, and repaying debt; bank-ruptcy procedures (including creditor remedies);protection against disruption of essential publicservices; and measures to prevent moral hazard.East Asian countries are only now establishingthese institutional structures. Another market instrument for reducing the credit risk of subnational borrowing is regularmonitoring of creditworthiness. Private sector enti-ties can help investors by rating the likelihood thatsubnational governments will default. Such creditratings should reflect both the capacity and thewillingness of debt issuers to make timely paymentson both principal and interest. Key elements ofcreditworthiness include the subnational govern-ment's economic base (net worth), revenue auton-omy and stability, revenue-expenditure balance,intergovernmental fiscal relations, the subnationaldebt burden, and contingent liabilities. Financialmanagement practices in the region matter, as doguarantees, insurance, and other mechanisms toenhance the credibility of subnational borrowing.However, credit ratings of subnational entities are not yet available in most East Asian countries.Subnational governments that relax their budget constraints contribute to public sector deficits andthreaten national solvency. Hidden budget channelsinclude off-budget borrowing; arrears on civil serv-ice wages and payments to suppliers and other levelsof government; indirect liabilities through publicenterprises or publicly owned banks, which are ofteninsolvent; and other contingent liabilities such asunfunded pension and provident funds. Soft budgetconstraints and the expectation of central bailoutscontribute to moral hazard. Data on these \"hiddendeficits\" in East Asia are just becoming available(Kharas and Mishra 2001). Thus central govern-ments lack the information they need to monitor thefiscal risks of subnational governments. In most EastAsian countries, the Ministry of Finance typicallyreceives regular reports on budgetary revenues andexpenditures on a cash basis from subnational gov-ernments. The ministry does not, however, haveaccess to timely information on many extrabudgetaryand off-budget capital expenditures and borrowing,or on local guarantees, financial institutions, pen-sion funds, employment insurance funds, and othertransactions that could generate liabilities (Ma andBrixi 2002).

In China\u2014where direct and indirect support of expanded investment and credit to subnationalentities has driven much recent growth\u2014relianceon banking and off-budget funds has been impor-tant. 24Poor monitoring of such investment implies that the health of the financial sector is at risk. Sig-nificant investment in industries such as cement,steel, and aluminum seems even riskier, given sub-stantial excess capacity. Table 3.2 outlines typical sources of contingent liabilities, which can be explicit or implicit. Forinstance, the explicit fiscal burden from risingsafety net expenditures may generate liabilities forthe central or provincial government. Also, whatmay be \"contingent\" for the central governmentmay be a direct liability for a provincial or subna-tional government. Cataloguing such liabilities isan essential first step in establishing a system toassess the obligations and fiscal risks of localgovernments. 25China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam are now embarking onthis important endeavor. As provincial and municipal governments gain greater authority to tap domestic and internationalfinancial markets, the financial risk at subnationallevels will also grow\u2014and will need managing.Weaknesses in regulation and oversight have led tothe proliferation of off-budget financing, govern-ment guarantees, and other contingent liabilities.Decentralization has given subnational governmentsa greater role in managing and delivering publicservices, and more budgetary responsibility for civilservice pensions and provident funds. All these fac-tors exert a significant impact on the quality of serv-ices and expenditure mix of local governments. Countries need to estimate the costs of deliver- ing devolved responsibilities so they understand thepotential fiscal risks. For example, if Thailand allo-cates 20 percent of revenues to local authorities butdoes not devolve commensurate responsibility forexpenditures, then the central government bears asignificant risk of assuming the resulting deficit. 26 These risks will grow if service delivery declinesowing to capacity constraints among subnationalgovernments. In China and Indonesia, where sub-national governments have more expenditureresponsibilities than revenue-raising authority,subnational borrowing and off-budget financingvehicles that carry explicit or implicit guarantees from the central government raise the latter's risk.Y et estimating the scope of the contingent liabilitiesthat subnational spending and borrowing imposeon the central government is difficult, especially ifno one government agency is cataloguing thesetransactions. East Asian countries are just begin-ning to undertake this task, at least for large contin-gent liabilities. China and Thailand have beenbuilding the capacity of the central government tomanage overall public debt. Early warnings, such as those used in Brazil, Colombia, and the United States, can provide agood starting point for monitoring the fiscal risksof subnational borrowing, but such indicators maynot reliably reflect future financing pressures. 27Ma (2001) has proposed a composite indicator thatreflects both fiscal pressures and the current fiscalposition of subnational governments. Informationon their assets and liabilities, exposure to marketand rollover risks, capacity for managing thesefinances, and the compatibility between revenueand spending responsibilities will enable informedjudgment concerning fiscal risks that may needimmediate attention. Without sound fiscal report-ing and auditing at the subnational level, even thebest-designed early-warning system will not beeffective. Countries need clear rules for dealingwith debt-distressed subnational governments.Vietnam is examining the fiscal risks of borrowingby state-owned enterprises, but most East Asiancountries are just beginning to tackle this issue. Conclusions A piecemeal approach to intergovernmental fiscal reform is unlikely to succeed because it will nottake into account the interdependence betweentransfers and revenue assignments, or betweenexpenditure assignments and own-source revenuesand transfers. T o enforce hard budget constraints,institutions must clearly and credibly convey themessage that local governments will bear the costsand benefits of their fiscal decisions. One suchinstitution is the capital market, which in theoryrations access to capital among subnational bor-rowers based on the soundness of their fiscal deci-sions. Institutions that ensure that public officialsmust answer to the needs and aspirations of thelocal populace are essential as well. However, such62 East Asia Decentralizesinstitutions can work only if local governments have considerable fiscal autonomy, and when thecentral government makes a credible commitmentthat it will not provide bailouts (World Bank2000b). None of the countries in East Asia nowmeet these conditions for enforcing hard budgetconstraints. East Asian countries need a comprehensive approach to intergovernmental fiscal reform, tack-ling subnational expenditures and revenues at thesame time. Subnational governments must haveenough revenues to implement their spendingresponsibilities (see chapters 5 and 6). T owardthis end, incentives that encourage cooperationbetween officials at different levels are essential.China and Indonesia need such incentives, forexample. Central governments need to carefully monitor subnational borrowing and the resulting fiscalrisks in order to maintain fiscal discipline and pru-dent macroeconomic management. Before countriesgive subnational governments free rein to borrow\u2014domestically or abroad\u2014they need to make infor-mation critical to analyzing subnational creditwor-thiness available to stakeholders. Appropriate checksand balances must ensure that these data are reliableand consistent across provinces. Domestic andforeign capital markets play an important role indiversifying local government funding sources andtracking subnational creditworthiness. East Asiancountries\u2014especially those with weak financialsystems\u2014will need to implement a complex set ofinstitutional reforms to support these efforts. Finally, to achieve fiscal sustainability, countries will also need to reform governance, public enter-prises, sectors such as power, and the intergovern-mental fiscal structure to ensure hard budgetconstraints for subnational governments. Centralgovernments also must monitor contingent liabili-ties to ensure prudent fiscal management. Over thelonger term, a database and analytical indicatorscan form the basis for a credit-rating system forlocal governments. Such a system is critical toopening up subnational borrowing and developinga municipal bond market. 28Also important in minimizing future surprises from the decisions ofsubnational governments is a clear division ofresponsibilities across levels of government, formalchannels for reporting contingent liabilitiesand analyzing their potential fiscal impact, andappropriate early-warning systems for fiscal risks. East Asian countries have begun work in these crit-ical areas, but success will require consistent effortover the short and medium term. Endnotes 1. This theory assumes that labor and capital mobility will ensure competition among subnational governments foreffective public sector service delivery, as well as a matchbetween the preferences of local citizens and governments. 2. Davoodi and Zou (1998) define fiscal decentralization in terms of spending by subnational governments as a fraction of total government spending. Fiscal decentralization rises ifspending by state and local governments expands relative tospending by the central government. The authors use theaverage growth of real per-capita output over 5-year and10-year periods as a proxy for long-run growth. 3. Davoodi and Zou (1998) did not use disaggregated subna- tional data to determine which province or region spentmore on capital and infrastructure relative to others. Theauthors also noted that countries may not realize the effi-ciency gains of fiscal decentralization if central authoritiesconstrain subnational revenue collection and spending,and if local citizens do not elect local officials. Labor andcapital mobility may not be as easy as theory assumes. 4. A significant part of spending in these sectors often occurs under \"current expenditure.\" 5. See chapter 2 in Litvack et al. (1998) for a discussion of the distinction between decentralization, deconcentration, anddelegation. 6. Lin and Liu (2000) found that rural reform, development of the nonstate sector, and capital accumulation have alsobeen driving forces in China. 7. In the same study, the authors found a positive relationship between fiscal decentralization and provincial economicgrowth in India. Questions about the appropriateness ofthe \"decentralization variable\" again arise. See Ebel andYilmaz (2003). 8. See World Bank (2002). Subnational governments in China also often engage in commercial activities to supplementtheir revenue, using land resources and enterprise assets astheir investment capital. Under a model pioneered inShanghai, many municipalities are creating \"corporations\"to manage public resources and debt obligations. Thesecorporations may \"enhance their debt servicing capacity\"by engaging in profit-making activities. The General Corporation of Shanghai Municipal Property Devel-opment is one of the first such vehicles, created tohelp finance the city's enormous need for facilities andinfrastructure. 9. Wildasin (1997) showed that a local government's ability to extract a bailout from the central government depends onthe former's size. Larger subnational governments thustend to operate under softer budget constraints, creatingincentives for overspending and overborrowing if not ade-quately monitored by the center. 10. For example, although Thailand's central government set grant allocations well in advance of fiscal year 2002, it didnot disburse these grants until the very end of the fiscalyear because of delays in establishing the allocation rule. 11. Empirical evidence in Lewis (2003) suggests that local governments have borrowed \"well within their fiscalAchieving Fiscal Sustainability 63capabilities to repay,\" but that they have largely been unwilling to repay these debts. The key issue is thereforeone of credit risk rather than fiscal sustainability of subna-tional borrowing in Indonesia. 12. For example, state-level defaults on debt payments helped trigger Brazil's financial crisis in 2000. See Rodden 2000a. 13. Rodden et al. (2003) draw on the experiences of seven developing and transition economies and four OECDcountries in identifying institutional arrangements associ-ated with soft and hard subnational budget constraints.This exercise provides lessons for East Asian countries. 14. States in Indonesia can now borrow for projects that gener- ate a \"direct or indirect\" financial return, per ImplementingRegulation 107 of 2000. However, the central governmentcan restrict borrowing if \"general conditions\" warrant sucha restriction, as in the temporary ban by ministerial decreein 2001. 15. The Vietnamese Budget Law stipulates that, for a given year, a province can borrow up if its outstanding debt willnot exceed 30 percent of its capital budget. Until 2003, localgovernments had issued only two project bonds, both byHo Chi Minh City (HCMC). In 2003 the central govern- ment approved new HCMC urban infrastructure bonds. InSeptember and October 2003, HCMC issued two-year andfive-year bonds at annual interest rates of 8.52 percentand 9 percent, respectively. In December 2003, HCMCissued another five-year urban bond at 8.5 percent interest.As of October 2003, provincial borrowing amounted to 0.43 percent of gross domestic product (D 2.5 trillion). 16. The Ministry of Finance closely monitors this commitment each year, requiring all subnational authorities to reporttheir debt, interest and principal payments, and borrowingplans by type of instrument. In practice, subnational gov-ernments have delayed providing this information. 17. Hence, these rules are often derived using the fiscal sustain- ability approach based on the government's \"lifetimebudget constraint.\" 18. Decree KMK35 of 2003 in Indonesia stipulates that onlending is allowed only for regional government projectsthat generate revenue. The decree does not specify how tohandle a default by a subnational entity, except in the caseof loans from the center, where deductions from the gen-eral grant would cover the debt service. KMK35 is currentlyunder review. 19. This means that the intergovernmental transfer equation excludes trade taxes. 20. See Kopits (2001). Adopting fiscal reporting in accordance with the IMF's Code of Fiscal Transparency would signalcredibility of rules. 21. These include best-practice accounting standards and effec- tive monitoring and reporting of government liabilities. 22. Where the central government tightly controls local spend- ing decisions, as in Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and tosome extent Thailand, local governments are more likely tocredibly shift blame for a fiscal crisis to the center (WorldBank 2000b). 23. See Burki et al. (1999).24. The fixed-assets investment is driven by local governments rather than the central government. For the first half of2003, central government projects amounted to only\u00a5 184.8 billion (12.3 percent), a decline of 7.7 percent overthe previous year. However, local government projectsamounted to \u00a5 1,322.4 billion (87.7 percent), an increase of41.5 percent over the same period in the previous year.Most of this investment is in infrastructure projects.25. Such a system can potentially be used to generate a ranking of local governments based on their fiscal health, and toenable the central government to decide when to interveneand provide emergency assistance (Ma and Brixi 2002). 26. These risks will be compounded as the local share of rev- enues grows to 35 percent by 2006. 27. See World Bank (2002). Brazil had imposed limits on sub- national borrowing, Colombia had a \"traffic light system,\"and Ohio in the United States has a \"fiscal watch program.\" 28. See Ma and Brixi (2002) for relevant experiences in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, New Zealand, and theUnited States, and a list of risk indicators for monitoringthe contingent liabilities of subnational governments.

It is also true, however, thatdecentralization can result in inequities in servicedelivery among citizens of the same countrydepending on where they live. While decentraliza-tion need not cause these inequities, devolution ofrevenue sources, combined with disparities inendowments of regions, is likely to lead to dispari-ties in fiscal resources at the subnational level. If left alone, these disparities could lead to either lower levels of services in fiscally poor regions orhigher tax rates for similar levels of governmentservices in those regions. In turn, disparities inservice delivery could thwart poverty alleviationefforts, as public services that are usually providedat the subnational level, such as primary health andeducation, are critical in empowering the poor.Disparities in the level and quality of these servicescould therefore eventually perpetuate inequalitiesin income levels, or at least delay conversion ofincomes across regions. Large fiscal disparitiescould also induce migration to regions that havehigher revenues and better services, even though 674 Fiscal Disparities in East Asia: How Large and Do They Matter? Bert Hofman and Susana Cordeiro Guerra the migrants could have been employed more pro- ductively elsewhere.1Finally, large disparities in public service delivery may cause social unrest inregions that are left behind, and could underminethe sense of unity in a country. Such diversity, cou-pled with growing disparities across regions, mayconstitute the basis for regional insurrections suchas in the Muslim regions of Mindanao in thePhilippines, and in West Papua in Indonesia(Hill 2000). Most governments take an interest in the level and distribution of public services provided totheir citizens, even in a decentralized system. Forsome countries, this is reason enough not to decen-tralize the financing or provision of servicesdeemed critical to national goals. Indeed, incomeredistribution is seen primarily as a central func-tion because central governments are regarded asbetter able to manage one of the key instruments ofthis goal: a progressive income tax. 2Y et, at the same time, services that are likely to affect income distri-bution, poverty alleviation, or similar nationalgoals aredecentralized. Moreover, many govern- ments have entered into commitments on the out-comes of services that are routinely at least partiallydecentralized to subnational levels of government. 368 East Asia Decentralizes So they should be concerned about the level and distribution of fiscal resources among levels of gov-ernments, as those resources enable subnationalgovernments to deliver services. Even if governments care about the distribution of services, they may not take policy action to cor-rect the distribution of fiscal resources among sub-national governments\u2014known as horizontal fiscalimbalances. This could occur for two reasons. First,policy makers may count on market adjustments.Thus, for some countries, migration is considered acountervailing, equalizing force, driving people tothe constituency that delivers the most beneficiallevel of public services at tax rates deemed appro-priate by the constituents. Second, legitimate policytradeoffs need to be weighed: an aggressive transferpolicy may be seen as dampening needed incentivesfor increasing own-revenue mobilization by subna-tional governments. Such a short-term tradeoffdeemphasizes equalization to provide for an own-revenue foundation for a future of reduced fiscaldisparities and transfer dependency. 4 Similarly, an equalization-only policy (perhaps just in the early stages of decentralization) maycompete with broader considerations of efficiencyand growth on the nation's agenda. In China, forinstance, the coastal development strategy of the1980s and 1990s deliberately left more resources inregions with stronger growth prospects. Using datafrom the 1985 to 1998 period of fiscal decentraliza-tion in China, Qiao et al. found that inequality inthe distribution of fiscal resources across provinceswas positively related to higher economic growth,and that that higher growth, in turn, led to greaterinequality (Qiao et al. 2003). Y an found a similartradeoff between growth and equity in China, andfurther showed that the fiscal reforms in 1985 and1994 did not contribute to increased equalization(Y an 2003). In other countries, governments compensate for horizontal fiscal imbalances not through redistri-bution, but by centrally providing certain servicesin poor regions while leaving rich regions to fendfor themselves. This approach may indeed also bebeneficial from an efficiency point of view, as someevidence suggests that the center is better at someservices critical for poverty alleviation, includingthe targeting of a social safety net (Ravaillion1998). Finally, redistribution of fiscal resources mayremain limited for political reasons: rich regionsalso tend to be powerful regions, and taking resources away from them to give to poorer regionsmay simply be politically unfeasible. Most East Asian governments care about equi- table services to their people, and thus take aninterest in the distribution of fiscal resourcesamong subnational governments, which delivermany of these services. Countries such as Indonesiahave included subnational fiscal equity as anexplicit goal in their Constitution. 5Other coun- tries, such as China and the Philippines, includestrong commitments on equal access to services intheir Constitution, whereas the delivery of many ofthese services is devolved to subnational govern-ments. 6Similarly, international commitments to public service outcomes, such as the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, often relate to services deliv-ered at the subnational level. These commitmentsimply that the state should care about whether sub-national governments are capable of deliveringsuch services, and thus a concern about subna-tional fiscal capacity and its distribution over sub-national entities. In fact, most East Asian countriesshow that they care to some extent by having someform of fiscal equalization mechanism in place. This chapter reviews the causes and conse- quences of fiscal inequities among subnational gov-ernments in East Asia. It shows that endowmentsand fiscal capacities among subnational entities arelarge, and that these inequities translate into largefiscal inequities before equalization. The transfersystems now in place in East Asian countries areonly mildly equalizing, so that even after equaliza-tion the remaining fiscal disparities are still large.The chapter discusses the possible consequences ofthese disparities for service delivery inputs, out-puts, and outcomes. It concludes with some guide-lines on how to increase transparency on inequali-ties at the subnational level, and how to maketransfer systems more equalizing without under-mining the incentives for local governments to raisetheir own revenues and spend their resourcesefficiently. Fiscal Disparities in East Asia East Asian countries show a wide variety of natural endowments, economic opportunities, levels ofdevelopment, and poverty (see figure 4.1). Indeed,the richest province in Indonesia has 17 times thegross domestic product (GDP) per capita as the poorest province; in China that figure is 11, and inVietnam it is 9.5. 7These disparities in per capita income have been relatively stable (Hill 2000;Garcia-Garcia and Soehstianingsih 1998). In suchan environment, devolving expenditure responsi-bilities and revenue sources could lead to inequitiesbecause of regional disparities in revenue potentialand the cost of delivering services.Indeed, East Asian countries reveal large dispar- ities in subnational revenue-generating capacity(table 4.1). In fact, disparities in own-revenues arelarger than disparities in income per capita. InChina, for instance, own-revenues per capita of therichest province are 15 times those of the poorestregion. These disparities are even higher in Indone-sia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. 8In the latter three countries, natural resource revenues collectedFiscal Disparities in East Asia: How Large and Do They Matter? 69 FIGURE 4.1 Percentage of Population Living below PPP$2 a Day in 2002, East Asia and Pacificor shared by the center with the regions exacerbates apparent inequalities. Below the provincial level,inequalities grow even larger. In Indonesia, forinstance, the richest local government had 50 timesthe own-revenues of the poorest local governmentin 2001, and the richest county in Gansu provincehad 82 times the per capita revenues of the poorestprovince (World Bank 2003b and World Bank2002a). 9 These interregional fiscal disparities are not a recent phenomenon. In China, data show thatlarge fiscal disparities have persisted over time(see table 4.2). 10Expenditure disparities have risenslightly, with the interprovincial coefficient of variation rising from 0.7 to 0.8; revenue disparitieshave fallen from 2.0 to 1.2. Y et the latter continue tobe large, with Shanghai having almost 16 times theper capita revenue of Tibet. Tibet's per capita expen-diture was similarly 8 times that of Hainan in 1979,while Shanghai's is 8 times that of Henna today. In Indonesia, disparity in total revenues after grants was nearly as large in 2002 as in 1994(see table 4.3). Disparities in own-revenues acrossprovinces were already rising before decentraliza-tion began in 1999. Disparities in own-revenues plusshared revenues have risen since decentralization,70 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 4.1 Disparities in Provincial Revenues before Grants, per Capita (US$, latest available year) China Indonesia Philippines Vietnam Maximum 283.2 59.5 7.6 343.4 Minimum 18.1 3.8 0.2 6.5Average 55.7 12.1 1.5 36.9Max./min. a15.7 15.7 35.4 53.0 Standard deviation 54.8 variation b0.98 0.96 0.97 0.79 Sources: SABER Database; Indonesia Regional Fiscal Information System.

Equalization Mechanisms China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam rely on grant systems to address fiscal dis-parities (see table 4.4). These systems rely on a for-mula to determine distribution, and three of thefive use a formula to determine the resource pool.Three of the systems take into account both therevenue capacity and the expenditure needs of localgovernments, whereas the Filipino and Thai sys-tems consider only expenditure needs. The distribution pools vary greatly from coun- try to country. In Indonesia and the Philippines,equalization grants account for the largest share ofgrants from the center to local governments, whileearmarked grants dominate in Thailand and China.In some countries earmarked grants include equal-izing elements, but in others they exert a counter-equalizing effect. Although numbers are hard tocome by, the equalization system can also includecentral spending that exerts a regional impact. In Indonesia, the equalization grant\u2014 dana alokasi umum (DAU)\u2014is the mainstay of the inter- governmental fiscal system. DAU funding consistsof 25 percent of central revenues after tax sharingwith the regions. 11Of this amount, 10 percent goes to the provincial level, which plays a relatively minorrole in public services, while 90 percent goes to localgovernments. The DAU finances some 70 percent oflocal government spending and some 50 percentof provincial spending.The central government distributes the DAU according to a formula that takes both revenuecapacity and expenditure needs into account. Rev-enue capacity is defined as potential own-sourcerevenues plus shared tax revenues, plus 75 percentof shared natural resource revenues. 12The central government defines expenditure needs based onpopulation, poverty rate, land area, and construc-tion costs as an indicator of \"geographical circum-stances.\" Distribution of the DAU is based partly onpast spending patterns\u2014largely to accommodatethe transitory impact of the 2001 decentralization.A lump sum per region also plays a role in theallocation. The new earmarked grant system (DAK)is still small compared with general grants\u2014amounting to about 3 percent of total grants. How-ever, it also includes an element of equalization.Regions with low fiscal capacity pay only 10 percentin matching funds, whereas those with high fiscalcapacity pay up to 50 percent. In China, the central government dedicates an ad hoc amount to transfers to the 16 poorestprovinces. Although the 1994 Tax Sharing Systemintroduced an equalization scheme based on vari-ables such as provincial GDP , student-teacherratios, number of civil servants, and populationdensity, the scheme is still in \"transitional\" status. 13 The scheme also remains small: each beneficiaryprovince receives only a fraction of its fiscal needsas determined by the formula, and in 2001 thescheme accounted for only 3 percent of total cen-tral transfers (World Bank 2004e). Although thereform marked the first time that the governmentexplicitly budgeted an equalization grant, it mayFiscal Disparities in East Asia: How Large and Do They Matter? 71 TABLE 4.3 Variation in Revenues across Provinces in Indonesia, 1994-2002a 1994 1999 2000 2002 Own-revenues SABER Database. a.

Two-thirds are \"tax return grants,\" whichamount to revenue sharing on a derivation basis. In Vietnam, the tax sharing-cum -contracting system equalizes. The revised State Budget Law(2002) gives the equalization transfer to jurisdic-tions whose approved expenditure needs exceed thesum of own-revenues and 100 percent retention ofall shared revenues (World Bank 2004e). Accordingto the equalization formula, the local tax adminis-tration branch determines revenue potential basedon collections from previous years, factoring in anychanges in tax policy and expected economic growth(Mart\u00ednez-V\u00e1zquez 2003). Expenditure needs arebased on per capita expenditure norms rather thanphysical standards as prior to 1996, which wereunaffordable. Regions may keep revenues in excessof agreed shares. Beyond the equalization transfer,Vietnam has no other conditional grants except aseries of \"national programs\" aimed at the poorestcommunes and to fulfill reforestation and healthgoals. The government channels these programs torecipients through provincial budgets. In Thailand, general grants include a fiscal equal- ization grant. 14Fiscal equalization grants rely on a strict formula based on equal share (25 percent),population (30 percent), area (5 percent), invert tolocal revenues excluding grants (20 percent), andinvert to specific grants received (20 percent). Asecond type of grant, known as specific grants,covers educational capital investment and develop- ment projects based on project criteria. Althoughgrants were the largest source of intergovernmentaltransfers in 2003\u2014accounting for 38 percent oflocal revenues\u2014the central government does notdetermine allocations until well after the fiscal yearbegins. This leads to a lack of transparency and anextremely politicized system, and creates planningand budgeting difficulties for local governments.Grants do not alleviate the fiscal imbalance betweenthe central and subnational governments. Under the Local Government Code (LGC) in the Philippines, local governments receive a fixed shareof central tax revenues, known as the Internal Rev-enue Allotment (IRA). The LGC sets the aggregateIRA share at 40 percent of subnational revenuesthree years before the current year. 15Of this share,provinces and cities receive 23 percent, municipali- ties receive 34 percent, and barangays receive 20 percent. The share within each tier of governmentreflects three basic criteria: population (50 per-cent), land area (25 percent), and equal sharingacross provinces (25 percent). Before the LGC, therelative weights of these criteria differed: popula-tion (70 percent), land area (20 percent), and equalsharing (10 percent). The greater emphasis onequal sharing (from 10 to 20 percent), coupled withthe fall in population weight (from 70 to 50 per-cent), shows a shift in equity concerns. Do Grant Systems in East Asia Equalize? Determining whether these grant systems equalize requires defining \"equalization.\" Common usedefines fiscal equality as \"the capability of subna-tional governments to deliver similar levels ofservices at similar levels of taxes\"(Searle 2002). Whilesuch a definition points to how an equalization grantmight best be designed, determining whether itequalizes requires information on differences in thecost of services\u2014which can be large\u2014among sub-national levels of government, and these data arenot yet available. 16This chapter therefore uses a simpler approach, asking whether disparities amongsubnational revenues drop as a result of intergovern-mental grants. The answer is that indeed, for all thecountries reviewed, the distribution of revenues percapita becomes more equal after transfers, althoughtheir equalizing effect varies significantly, beingstrongest in Vietnam and weakest in the Philippines(see figure 4.2 and tables 4.1 and 4.5). Comparing revenues and expenditures per capita against income per capita provides furtherevidence of the equalization properties of transfersystems. If the income elasticity of expenditures islower than the income elasticity of revenues, it canbe argued that the transfer system is equalizing. 17 This is indeed the case for the East Asian countriesfor which enough data are available, suggesting thatgrant systems equalize (see table 4.6). Even after transfers, though, per capita revenue disparities remain large. The richest province in thePhilippines has 28 times more revenues per capitathan the poorest one, while the numbers for China,Indonesia, and Vietnam are 8, 10, and 22, respec-tively. For comparison, in the United States, the74 East Asia Decentralizespoorest state has about 65 percent of the revenues of the average state. In Germany, the Finanzausgle-ich subsidizes any state falling below 95 percent ofthe average level (and taxes any state receiving morethan 110 percent). In Brazil, the richest state has 2.3times the revenues per capita of the poorest state.In Russia, disparities are larger: the richest of 89regions has revenues per capita some 40 timeshigher than the poorest (World Bank 2002b;Mart\u00ednez-V\u00e1zquez and Boex 1998). However, Rus-sia's regions are smaller than the average East Asianprovince, and indications are that the smaller thesubnational entity, the larger the measured inequal- ity. In Indonesia, the richest local government had30 times the revenue per capita of the poorest localgovernment in 2002, while the comparable numberfor 2001 was more than 50. Within China's Gansuprovince, the per capita revenues of the richestcounty were 37 times those of the poorest in 1999(Hofman et al. 2003; World Bank 2002a).Intraprovincial disparities thus appear to be largerthan interprovincial ones. A number of studies confirm the modest impact on equalization of intergovernmental fiscal sys-tems. A recent study of the Philippines suggests thatthe IRA 's equalizing effect has not countered dispar-ities in tax base across local governments (Manasan2002). The same study found that the IRA had aFiscal Disparities in East Asia: How Large and Do They Matter? 75 TABLE 4.5 Disparities in Province-Level Revenues after Grants, per Capita (US$, latest available year ) China Indonesia Philippines Vietnam Maximum 444.4 Statistical Statistical Yearbook; Philippine Statistical Yearbook; Vietnam Statistical Yearbook; Ministry of Finance (Vietnam); Indonesia Regional Fiscal Information System; Public Expenditure Reviews; Regional Expenditure Reviews;authors' calculations.Note: The table presents consolidated province-level data.

InIndonesia, Lewis (2003) found the DAU distribu-tion to be equalizing, but less than warranted byrevenue capacity and expenditure needs alone,whereas Hofman et al. (2003) elaborated on theDAU's weak equalization performance. Vietnam's fiscal system seems to be more equal- izing: the country redistributes a substantial pro-portion of revenues collected in wealthier provincesto poorer ones (World Bank 2000). Rao (2001) usescross-section estimates to show that elasticity ismuch lower for revenues than for expenditures.This implies a significant degree of equalization, inline with the steep drop in provincial inequalitypresented here. For China, Y an (2003) shows thatfiscal reforms in 1985 and 1994 have not alleviatedthe unequal impact of market reform, and indeedappear to have exacerbated regional disparities.Indeed, evidence reveals that earmarked grantsare mostly flowing to richer provinces (Ahmadet al. 2000; World Bank 1993). Disparities in percapita revenues after grants translate into dispari-ties in per capita expenditures, although not on aone-to-one basis. These disparities may reflect dif-ferences in access to borrowing or in the use ofreserves. Do Fiscal Disparities Matter? Policy makers may focus on fiscal disparities for a number of reasons. However, they matter if theytranslate into large disparities in service deliveryand outcomes. Indicators of service delivery at thesubnational level are as scarce as fiscal data, but Human Development Indicators and informa-tion on persons per hospital bed, literacy, and lifeexpectancy are available for most countries underreview. 18The first indicator\u2014persons per hospital bed\u2014measures service inputs, whereas the otherindicators measure outcomes. These measures showlarge variation across and within countries, althoughless than the fiscal indicators reveal. 19In terms of persons per hospital bed, Indonesia's lowest-rankingprovince is 7.6 times worse than the best-rankingprovince, while the same numbers for Vietnam,China, the Philippines, and Thailand\u20143.3, 3.4, 4.4,and 6.8, respectively\u2014are better but still discourag-ing. 20China's highest-ranking province is almost 3 times as literate as the lowest-ranking one, whileIndonesia (1.34) and Vietnam (1.9) follow closebehind. Human development and life expectancyindicators confirm this trend, with Vietnam's bestprovince ranking nearly twice as high as the lowestprovince on both indicators. The figures for Chinaand Indonesia are only slightly better (see tables 4.7to 4.10). T o assess whether there is a systemic relation between fiscal disparities and disparities in servicedelivery indicators, we used a simple regressionapproach.We used two specifications (see table 4.11).Specification 1 is a regression of social outcomeindicators\u2014HDI, persons per hospital beds, lifeexpectancy, and literacy rates\u2014as a function of aconstant and expenditures per capita. In specifica-tion 2, we also include per capita GDP as anexplanatory variable, to control for potential corre-lations between provincial per capita income and76 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 4.7 Disparities in Province-Level HDI Indices, 1997-2002a China Indonesia Philippines Vietnam Maximum 0.85 0.65 0.52 0.54 1.34 1.65 1.72Standard deviation 0.07 0.04 0.11 0.06Coefficient of variation 0.10 0.06 0.19 0.08 Sources: United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Indicators (HDI); Government of Indonesia 2002; National Statistical Coordination Board 2003; Republicof China, multiple years; Republic of Vietnam, multiple years. a.

In China andVietnam, the indi-cators usually correlate significantly with expendi-tures. In China, the only exception is literacy rates:the correlation, although positive, is not significant. The reason may be that education financing still fallspartly under the auspices of the central government,given recent efforts to recentralize education expen-ditures. In Vietnam, the only exception to the corre-lation between social indicators and subnationalexpenditures is persons per hospital bed.

Data are for the most recent year available. Data are not available across all provinces for Thailand.Data for the Philippines refer to the regional level.Another possible explanation for the weak corre- lation between fiscal disparities and service indica-tors is that the latter change slowly over time. OnlyChina has data that allow for testing the hypothesisthat indicators deteriorate in regions with persist-ently low spending, compared with regions thatspend more. In this third set of regressions, we use alonger time series for provincial per capita expendi-tures (1985-2000) as the explanatory variable forservice delivery indicators (see table 4.12). We alsoadd a fifth social indicator\u2014combined studentenrollment for primary, secondary, and tertiaryschools\u2014to further test our hypothesis. 25In this case, excluding life expectancy, both specifications1 and 2 suggest a significant correlation between thefour outcome indicators and subnational expendi-tures across time, suggesting that persistent fiscalinequities do matter. 26 In sum, although the variation in outcome indi- cators is much less than the variation in revenues,there is some evidence that outcomes are affectedby different levels of subnational revenues acrossprovinces. In the short run, effects seem dominatedby differences in income per capita, but evidenceon China suggests that persistent fiscal inequalitiesresult in inequalities in social indicators beyondthose that can be explained by income per capita.78 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 4.11 Expenditure Disparities and Service Outputs and Outcomes at the Subnational Level Dependent variable and specification China Indonesia Vietnam HDI 1 0.10* 0.01 0.10* HDI 2 /H110020.01 0.002 /H110020.001 Persons per hospital bed 1 /H110020.48* /H110020.29* 0.04 Persons per hospital bed 2 /H110020.39* /H110020.15 Life expectancy 1 0.04* 0.02* 0.04*Life 0.01 /H110020.02 2 /H110020.03 0.01 /H110020.02 Source: Authors' calculations.

Infant mortality might therefore be a betteroutcome measure in this case because it relatesdirectly to health services, unlike life expectancy,which may imply other variables such as foodsource. In Indonesia, unlike in China and Vietnam, the results are significant only for persons per hospitalbed and life expectancy. Such relatively modestresults may reflect the fact that the decentralizationprocess is just beginning in these countries. In specification 2, per capita subnational expen- ditures do not correlate with service outputs andoutcomes. A possible explanation for these ambigu-ous results may be multicollinearity, 23which reduces the efficiency of the estimation, although the esti-mator remains unbiased. 24 In addition, the outcome indicators used in this chapter are naturally limited in the power of theirestimation. Most provinces score highly in literacyand life expectancy rates, for example. Unlike income,most of these outcome indicators are bounded, soconvergence over time should be the norm, whichpresents difficulties with the estimation.Although public spending can be critical in improving health and education outcomes, thereare many reasons why increased public spendingdoes not necessarily translate into better servicesand better outcomes. How (effectiveness) andwhere (sector allocation, levels of government, geo-graphical distribution) resources are used deter-mines whether they lead to positive outcomes. Forexample, Thailand and Peru both increased publicspending on primary schooling, yet completionrates fell in Thailand while they rose in Peru. Con-versely, health spending in Mexico and Jordandiverged, but child mortality fell in both countries(World Bank 2004a). Indeed, effectiveness in theuse of funds varies widely across countries. Studiesshow that the nonpoor typically receive a dispro-portionate share of public spending (Filmer 2003).Y et, even if spending is well targeted, it doesnot always reach frontline service providers (teach-ers, doctors), and when it does, providers mustbe both present and effective in their jobs (WorldBank 2004a). Services can also fail poor people due to a lack of demand. In this case, the geographical distribution of resources matters because there maybe insufficient demand for services in certainregions and locations. Ultimately, whether spend-ing will materialize into better services and out-comes will depend if it is coupled with accountabil-ity systems (strong performance management andproducer accountability) and appropriate policies(Pritchett 2004). Conclusions This chapter shows that fiscal disparities among subnational governments in East Asia are consider-able. Equalization mechanisms diminish subna-tional fiscal disparities, yet they remain large. Wefind considerable disparities in service outputs andoutcomes as well, but data and methodologicalissues prevent us from establishing a strong linkwith large fiscal disparities. For the one countrywith enough data (China), we find that persistentfiscal disparities do seem to affect health and edu-cation outcomes. The reasons why inequalities may persist are numerous. First, expenditure needs may vary sig-nificantly. Such variation could reflect differencesin costs or the fact that some regions provide moreservices than others. Persistent inequalities mayalso reflect the central government's emphasis onrevenue mobilization. T oo much equalization\u2014ifnot well designed\u2014could reduce the incentivesfor subnational governments to mobilize own-revenues,undermining overall tax revenues.Inequal-ities among regions could also induce people tomigrate to regions with better economic prospects.Poor regions may be less capable of handling fundsthan rich ones, or less concerned with poverty alle-viation than the center. Rich regions are also pow-erful, and they do not like to lose out to poorerregions. Reasons for persisting inequalities in theEast Asian context include the coastal developmentstrategy in China, which allowed some provinces toget rich first, and Indonesia's policy of channelingrevenues from natural resources to regions withseparatist tendencies. Based on these preliminary findings and the broader implications of interregional inequity,we offer recommendations to address such inequityin four areas: information management, transferFiscal Disparities in East Asia: How Large and Do They Matter? 79 TABLE 4.12 Fiscal Disparities and Public Services Outputs and Outcomes in China,1985-2000 Variable and Specification HDI 1 0.11* HDI 2 0.003Persons per hospital bed 1 /H110020.50* Persons per hospital beds 2 /H110020.40* Life expectancy 1 0.06*Life expectancy 2 /H110020.02 Literacy 1 0.06*Literacy 2 0.07*Combined 0.13*Combined enrollment 2 0.08* Source: Authors' calculations.

The policy debate on fiscal inequalities\u2014and intergovernmental fiscal relations more generally\u2014requires more data. Without better information onthe size of inequalities and how they have evolved,informed debate over which are acceptable isimpossible. Each East Asian country suffers from adearth of data. Those analyzed here are far fromperfect, and we could not include other countriesbecause they lack fiscal data at the subnationallevel, especially below the first subnational tier.Data on differences in the cost of delivering servicesare also critical in assessing interregional dis-parities. Governments must set up monitoringsystems\u2014an undertaking that requires significantresources. Indonesia maintains a database that\u2014supported by the legal requirement that regionsreport\u2014includes fiscal information on most of 410local governments. In China, subnational govern-ments have fiscal data, but the central governmenthas little of this information. Some countries alsoneed to adjust their accounting and budget classifi-cation systems. China, for instance, classifies signif-icant fiscal resources as \"extrabudgetary\" and infor-mation on those funds is even scarcer, even thoughthey fundamentally alter conclusions on fiscaldisparities. More data analysis also needs to inform the policy debate. Countries should aim to regularlyreview the results of their intergovernmental fiscalsystems, including fiscal and service disparities. Forexample, following the highly successful example ofSouth Africa, Indonesia published the first of whatwill be a regular intergovernmental fiscal review inMarch 2004. Such reports will allow policy makersto evaluate the intergovernmental fiscal system. Regardless of whether more or less fiscal equaliza- tion is desirable, countries have significant scope toimprove the design of their intergovernmental sys-tems. Central governments must determine theirequalization goals and priorities regarding incomelevels, fiscal capacity, expenditure needs, and percapita revenues (Bahl 2000). The goals of equaliza-tion grants are often unclear: some grants embodyfeatures of earmarked grants, for example, usuallybased on temporary considerations.A more compre-hensive goal would require each local government todeliver a minimum level of goods and services.Country-specific recommendations include: China's transfer system could aim to reflect local revenue capacity and expenditure needs in a rules-based manner, rather than through ad hocdistribution. Besides a more transparent system,China should also aim for simpler equalizationmechanisms\u2014perhaps by combining variousequalization grants into one overarching grant.T o further enhance both transparency and sim-plicity, the country could systematically identifytotal equalization funds, based on tradeoffsbetween equalization, growth, and incentives forlocal revenue mobilization and expenditures. Although Indonesia's transfer system introduces the notion of expenditure needs and revenuecapacity through its equalization grant, it shoulddefine a more equalizing DAU by phasing outthe transitional elements and the \"hold harm-less\" portion of the allocation. In terms of trans-parency and simplicity, Indonesia should focuson more consistent treatment of natural resourcerevenues in revenue sharing and the equaliza-tion formula. The country should introduce aselective system of specific grants combined withan onlending window to promote local financ-ing of national priorities. In Vietnam, negotiation and discretion remain, primarily for \"surplus\" provinces and local gov-ernments. The central government may wish toconsider introducing conditional grants orother transfer instruments\u2014with or withoutmatching provisions\u2014to create incentives andprovide financing for expenditures in priorityareas such as health and education. Local gov-ernments could also use such funding for socialassistance programs, along with grants for capi-tal infrastructure. 27 Our data show that although huge fiscal dispari- ties exist across subnational governments, inequali-ties in health and education outcomes are relativelymodest. Why? What are the countervailing forceswithin each country or groups of subnationalprovinces and municipalities? Do people tend tomigrate from one region to another? Is there a pushfor asymmetrical decentralization? What are gov-ernment preferences, and what role do they play inpolicy making? Debate regarding the center's role80 East Asia Decentralizesand the impact of its programs is also critical. These and many other questions present challeng-ing lines for further empirical analysis. Endnotes 1. Migration can be considered excessive in an economic sense, if the marginal productivity of a worker would behigher in his place of origin, or if the congestion costs in theregion of destination are larger than the private benefitsobtained from the better services; see Ahmad and Craig inT er-Minassian, ed., 1997. 2. For an extensive discussion of this point, see Tanzi and Shuknecht 1995 and Prud'homme 1995. 3. A review, assessing constitutional rights to education and health care in 187 countries, concludes that of the 165countries with written constitutions available, 116 madereference to a right to education and 73 to a right to healthcare (Gauri 2003). 4. In the Philippines, for example, IRA allocations have some- what detracted from LGUs' incentive to improve the collec-tion of own-source revenues (World Bank 2003a). 5. Art. XVIII (a), sub. 2, of the Indonesian Constitution states, \"The relationship in finances, public services, utilization ofnatural resources and other resources . . . shall be regulatedand executed fairly and equitably based on the law.\" 6.

The State shall promote social justicein all phases of national development.\" 7. The figure for Vietnam excludes the oil-producing region of Ba-Ria Vung Tao. 8. Fiscal disparities can differ depending on the indicator of inequality. A future version of this study will also use thepopulation-weighted Theil indicator to calculate fiscaldisparities. This will better measure the impact of fiscal dis-parities from the individual's perspective. 9. The level of fiscal disparities is sensitive to cost differentials across provinces. However, data on provincial cost of livingare not readily available for these countries. 10. Data limitations, along with changes in these countries' decentralization processes, make a similar analysis very dif-ficult to perform for other countries in our sample. 11. In principle, the law prescribes this as 25 percent of actual revenues, but the DAU has so far been based on budgetedrevenues. 12. For detail, see Hofman et al. 2003.13. As a result of the 1994 Tax Sharing System, revenue-sharing arrangements changed from a negotiated, mildly equalizingsystem to one based on strict tax assignments (Wong 2002).For more detail, see Ahmad et al. 2000. 14. Besides fiscal equalization, general grants promote tax effort and local good governance, devolution of compul-sory functions, train ticket compensation, local develop-ment, and education. Exceptions to the formula-based allo-cation criteria are local good governance, train ticketcompensation, and local development. 15. Although the aggregate IRA share is fixed by law, the central government withheld 5 percent after the 1998 Asian finan-cial crisis without any consultation. Despite a Supreme Court ruling in favor of local governments, disagreementremains on whether the formula should be subject to appro-priation or decreased as part of the congressional appropri-ation process. See Manasan 2002. 16. The United States has seen some success in using these data for grant design. See Rafuse 1992. 17. This ignores the effect of borrowing. However, since richer regions are likely to have more access to borrowing, theconclusions on equalization are likely to hold. 18. This chapter adopts the UNDP procedure for computing HDI. Provincial HDI is based on three indicators: longevity,as measured by life expectancy at birth; education attain-ment, as measured by a combination of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and combined primary, secondary, and terti-ary enrollment ratios (one-third weight); and standard ofliving, as measured by real GDP per capita in terms of pur-chasing power parity (in dollars) (UNDP 1999). We broadlydefine persons per hospital bed in terms of public hospitals.(In Indonesia, the indicators include both special andgeneral hospitals.) We define literacy rate as the percentageof people aged 15 and above who cannot read and write ashort, simple statement about their everyday life (WorldBank 2003c). We define life expectancy as the number ofyears a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns ofmortality remained the same throughout its life (WorldBank 2003c). 19. Variation is measured through the coefficient of variation, which is the standard deviation divided by the average. 20. Although maximum-to-minimum ratios within countries capture the same trends as more sophisticated measures(such as the gini coefficient), those ratios are more respon-sive than other measures to the tail-end of the distributionacross countries. 21. Specification 2 aims to address the problem of reverse causality between expenditures (revenues) and outcomes.Otherwise, reverse causality would suggest the possibilitythat our regression estimates may be upwardly biased. Thethird set of regressions, which examines a longer time seriesfor China, will address the possible problem of multi-collinearity (when two or more independent variables areapproximately linearly related) in specification 2. 22. \"In 1998, the public expenditure share in aggregate health spending was only about 20 percent, with householdsaccounting for the remaining 80 percent\" (World Bank2000). 23. The problem of multicollinearity is when two or more independent variables are approximately linearly related inthe sample data. 24. Indeed, expenditures are highly correlated with GDP for China (.67), Indonesia (.42), and Vietnam (.67) (with sig-nificance at the 1 percent level). It would be interesting tosee if the same results hold at even lower levels of govern-ments. The only exception to the rule is China. 25. As shown in the previous set of regressions, life expectancy yields ambiguous results, as it is affected by a broad rangeof factors for which we do not control. Infant or child mor-tality would therefore be a better indicator. Lacking thosedata, we have used combined gross enrollment as our fifthoutcome indicator in this final set of regressions. 26. The only exception to the results is HDI in specification 2, yet this is understandable, as GDP is one of its components. 27.

W. Wong East Asia has been home to some of the world's most centralized public expenditure managementsystems. From a macroeconomic perspective, thisapproach may have had its merits\u2014for example,allowing for a rapid fiscal response during the 1998crisis. However, such top-down approaches havetypically not been conducive to locally responsiveservice delivery (World Bank 2000d, pp. 31-33).Countries have often achieved fiscal discipline atthe expense of effectiveness and efficiency. T oaccomplish broader national objectives\u2014not onlymacroeconomic stabilization but also povertyreduction and effective and efficient local servicedelivery\u2014public expenditure management is mov-ing closer to the frontline. Intergovernmental reform of expenditure man- agement presents some major opportunities. Localmanagement of spending can support servicedelivery that is more responsive to the needs andwishes of local people and more efficient givenlocal conditions. Equally, there are significantthreats: duplication, poor coordination, growinginequity, and even the collapse of essential services.Of the five most populous low- and middle- income countries in East Asia\u2014hereafter referredto as the EA5 1\u2014four are designing programs to transfer expenditure responsibilities to lower-levelgovernments. Indonesia is implementing a \"BigBang\" decentralization program. Thailand hascommitted to implementing a gradual but poten-tially major decentralization program. Vietnam hasrecently legislated to shift greater expenditureauthority and responsibility to provincial People'sCouncils. And the Philippines continues to explorepolicy options for strengthening its comprehensiveprogram of decentralization started a decade ago.The fifth country, China, is alone in moving in theopposite direction: since the late 1990s it has insti-tuted a program to reform public expendituremanagement that will\u2014at least in the short run\u2014increase central scrutiny of local spending. How-ever, since China has gone furthest among theEA5 in assigning spending responsibilities tosubnational governments, the recent changesshould be seen as part of a continuing effort tofind the right balance between central controland local flexibility, rather than a rejection of decentralization. Given the EA5's relatively recent moves to decentralize expenditure management, derivingconclusions as to whether these countries have\"failed\" or \"succeeded\" in terms of service deliverywould be premature. Instead, this chapter reviewsexperiences so far with decentralizing expendituresin the EA5. The chapter presents some empirics onexpenditure decentralization and provides an ini-tial assessment of the nascent expenditure manage-ment systems at subnational levels in these coun-tries. Finally, the chapter analyzes the extent towhich the incentive framework and institutionalenvironment in each country are likely to fostersuccessful subnational expenditure management. Subnational Expenditure Management in the EA5: Some Empirics The extent to which EA5 countries have decentral- ized public spending varies. By the conventionalmeasure of subnational shares of total spending,China is by far the most decentralized of the five,with subnational spending at 69 percent. It isfollowed by Vietnam, with 48 percent. At the lower end is Thailand, where subnational spending is just10 percent of the total. The East Asian archipelagocountries are somewhere in the middle: thePhilippines is at 25 percent and Indonesia reached31 percent after Big Bang decentralization. Table 5.1compares the subnational expenditure shares of theEA5 with those of other countries. In a study of some 100 countries, Roy Bahl and his colleagues at Georgia State University found theshare of subnational expenditures to be positivelycorrelated with per capita gross domestic product(GDP) and land area, and negatively correlated withethnic diversity. 2Transition economies as a group also tend to be more decentralized than expectedfrom the other variables. Led by the two transitioneconomies of China and Vietnam, the EA5 havedecentralized more than the average 14 percent oftotal expenditures that Bahl et al. found for develop-ing countries, but have decentralized less than theaverage of 35 percent in developed countries. Evenconsidering these factors,however,the authors foundthat China and Vietnam were more decentralizedthan expected in the 1990s, Indonesia and Thailandless,and the Philippines exactly at the expected level. 386 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 5.1 Expenditure Decentralization in East Asia in Comparative Perspective Subnational expenditure (% of national expenditure) China 2002 69 Indonesia 2002 32Philippines 2001 26Thailand 2001 10Vietnam 2002 48Developing countries 1990s 14Transition countries 1990s 26OECD countries 1990s 32 large countries, Note: OECD /H11005Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.However, while subnational spending share is a convenient measure for comparing decentraliza-tion across countries, it is often misleading whenthe locus of spending does not coincide with thelevel of decision making, as has often been the casein East Asia (Bahl 2002). Vietnam is a perfect illus-tration of this shortcoming. Despite its high subna-tional spending share, Vietnam was\u2014until itimplemented the new State Budget Law in January2004\u2014formally one of the least decentralizedcountries in the world. Local governments wereessentially carrying out deconcentrated functionsat the behest of the central government, whichdetermined service levels and standards. Another conventional yardstick for measuring decentralization is the pattern of expenditureassignments. Table 5.2 shows expenditure assign-ments for the EA5 and other countries. Chinaagain appears to be the most decentralized of thefive. Compared with the other countries, Chinahas transferred a much larger portion of expendi-ture responsibilities to local governments, includ-ing several big-ticket items\u2014not only educationand health, which are common local functions inmany countries, but also unemployment benefitsand pensions. The latter make China highlyunusual. Pensions and unemployment benefitsoften exceed the financing capacity of subnationalgovernments, and their cyclical nature makes themoften inappropriate for such governments. Inalmost all other countries, these responsibilitiesare either central or shared with state govern-ments. Indonesia and Thailand are also quitedecentralized compared with other countries, witheducation and health assigned solely to local gov-ernments. In the Philippines, health is a jointresponsibility of state and local governments,while education remains a central governmentresponsibility. Table 5.2 shows expenditure assignments, but again we must be cautious in interpreting suchsummary tables. The table identifies only the levelof government responsible for providing services,not necessarily the one that finances the services.Indonesia, for example, assigns costly functions likeeducation and health to subnational levels, butfinances them through specific transfers from thecentral government. Subprovincial governments inChina, in contrast, receive limited transfers fromwhich to fund their expenditure mandates. Localgovernments are responsible for not only providing but also financing their service responsibilities, withlittle support from either earmarked or equalizationtransfers. Differences in how countries report the division of responsibilities may also muddy comparisons.Such differences may simply reflect different trans-fer instruments. A central government that ear-marks transfers for education would more likelyreport education as a joint responsibility than acentral government that provides block grants tolocal governments. Given the heterogeneity of the EA5, another dimension is worth mentioning: multiple levels ofsubnational government. China's intermediate levelof government is larger than that of most countries:each such government has an average of 45 millionpeople. Prefectural units\u2014mostly municipalities\u2014have an average population of 3.7 million, makingthem as large as or larger than provinces and statesin many countries. Considering the size of countriesthemselves is also important in drawing inferencesabout state versus local service provision. Evenaccounting for size, China is extreme in havingtransferred so many responsibilities to the lowestlevels: municipalities and counties\u2014not provincesor the central government\u2014are responsible forsocial welfare provision. Public Expenditure Management Processes in the EA5 East Asian countries have substantially expanded the extent to which subnational levels manage pub-lic expenditure. The most critical expenditure man-agement processes, which are nascent and stillevolving, include the following: Policy analysis and planning. The policy respon- sibilities of government departments and the legis-lature must be clear, appropriate, and transparent.An effective policy analysis and planning processshould identify clear development goals and priori-ties, provide a realistic fiscal framework for publicexpenditure rather than encouraging a \"shoppinglist\" approach, and inform planning with sound,evidence-based policy analysis. Such a processshould also involve sector departments within thesubnational government rather than just planningand finance departments; provide a mechanism forthe central government to coordinate policy with Public Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 8788 TABLE 5.2 Expenditure Assignments in East Asian and Comparison Countries Environment Foreign and natural Unemployment Industry and Social Country Defense affairs resources insurance agriculture Education Health welfare Police Highways EA5 countries: China F F F, S, L L F, S, L L L L L F, S, LIndonesia F F .. ..

Budget formulation. An effective budget cycle should have a logical sequence and timing andbuild on the planning framework. The budgetshould also reconcile development goals and pol-icy priorities with a realistic assessment of fiscalconstraints. The budget should cover all subna-tional expenditures, including capital and currentexpenditures as well as subsidies, transfers, inter-est, and net lending. The budget should explicitlyincorporate the use of extrabudgetary funds,including those financed by donors; minimize ear-marking of resources; and clarify the future budgetimplications of investment decisions. Once againall stakeholders should be involved, with budgetswidely disseminated and enough time allowedfor consultation and debate before legislativeapproval. Budget execution. Budget execution should adhere as closely as possible to the estimatesapproved by the legislature (although under clearlyprescribed circumstances the finance agency mayhave the authority to change departmental alloca-tions during the fiscal year). Annual cash require-ments for each spending unit should be forecastso cash management is efficient and consistentwith releases and authorizations to spend. Arrearsshould not be significant as a proportion of totalspending, and planning and control systems shouldprotect against overspending, provide effectivecrosschecks between human resource managementsystems and payroll, and establish competitive andtransparent procurement. Monitoring and accounting. National law needs to establish financial reporting and accountingrules for subnational governments that reflect rec-ognized accounting standards. Subnational govern-ments need to collect comparable data, to facilitatepolicy analysis as well as management of nationalfiscal targets. In-year and end-year statementsshould be produced shortly after the end of the fis-cal year and made routinely available to all stake-holders. And governments should monitor budget outputs and outcomes to the extent possible. Auditing and evaluation. A clear distinction should be made between internal and externalaudit. End-year accounts of subnational expendi-tures should be audited under a reasonably rapidtimetable, ideally by an independent auditor generalor under his or her supervision. Audit reportsshould be scrutinized by the legislature and madepublic in a timely fashion. When the auditor generalissues an adverse report, policy makers need to takeappropriate follow-up action. Audits should includebudget outputs and outcomes as well as financialinputs to the extent possible. They should alsosystematically evaluate a sample of projects and pro-grams, with the results drawn upon in planning andbudget formulation for subsequent years. Assessing East Asian Countries T o what extent do the EA5 countries have these core expenditure management processes in place?T o answer that question, we reviewed publishedand unpublished reports on expenditure decentral-ization in these countries. 4We found that such processes generally remain weak at the subnationallevel (see table 5.3). Planning processes are discon-nected from fiscal planning and budgetingprocesses, and poorly coordinated with planningat other levels of government. Budget formulationsuffers from major delays and is fragmented, withparallel budgets for investment projects and recur-rent expenditures managed by separate institu-tions. Budget execution is slow, with long delays ineffecting appropriations, significant divergencebetween approved appropriations and outturns,and corruption in procurement. Monitoring andaccounting systems often produce data that are nei-ther timely nor accurate. Auditing is typically weak,and evaluation almost nonexistent. Part of the explanation is that countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam are just begin-ning to decentralize expenditures. However, timedoes not automatically solve these problems: Chinaand the Philippines are still struggling to build theinstitutions they need despite starting one and twodecades ago. We provide further assessment, with country- by-country examples, on the next page.Public Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 89Policy Analysis and Planning. Vietnam has an established tradition of planning at subnational aswell as national levels. Provincial Planning andInvestment departments coordinate inputs to aFive-Y ear Plan and a five-year Public InvestmentProgram (PIP). The national Five-Y ear Plan andPIP then consolidate these plans. However, prob-lems persist. First, under Vietnam's system of \"dou-ble subordination,\" reporting arrangements remainconfused: the provincial departments of Planningand Investment report not only to the local People'sCommittee and People's Council, but also to thecentral Ministry of Planning and Investment, andthrough it to the National Assembly. Second, thelocal planning process occurs with little referenceto fiscal constraints. Provinces submit investmentplans that would typically add up to much morethan the resources available. Third, the planningprocess encompasses only the investment budget(capital projects plus the often donor-fundeddevelopment projects), paying little attention to thecost implications of development expenditures orthe future budgetary implications of new spend-ing commitments. Vietnam has started pilotingmedium-term expenditure planning, both atnational and provincial levels, bringing planning ofcapital and recurrent expenditures under a singleframework. However, establishing this system fullywill take some years. In China, provincial Planning Commissions address the priority areas declared by the centralgovernment in its Economic Development Plans.As in Vietnam, capital budgeting is separate fromrecurrent budgeting at each level of government. For example, a provincial Finance Bureau deter-mines the annual capital provision, but a provincialPlanning Commission allocates these resourcesbetween projects. These agencies rarely use cost-benefit analysis or other selection techniques. In Indonesia, the center has traditionally domi- nated planning processes. These processes havestarted to evolve since the Big Bang decentralizationof 2001, and the government has introduced anumber of subnational planning instruments. Par-ticipation of civil society at the village level hasgreatly increased, reflecting new regulations thatprescribe this participation. Planning processes arethus both top-down and bottom-up. However,major weaknesses remain. It is unclear how andwhen the top-down and bottom-up planningprocesses are integrated, for example. There is alarge amount of duplication between these plan-ning processes, as well as some inconsistency. Theplanning process is largely devoid of considerationsof affordability: only the annual regional plan takesfiscal considerations into account. This results inmuch disappointment at all levels of government:district governments must make difficult choicesand sharp cuts in the wish lists of villages, bureaus,and the district as a whole. Also similar to Vietnamis the focusing of planning on the developmentbudget and capital projects rather than on thebudget as a whole. Altogether, this situation isinconsistent with Indonesia's plans to require\"performance budgets\" from regional governmentsunder Government Regulation 105 /H208622000. However, 90 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 5.3 Strength of Core Expenditure Management Processes at Subnational Levels China Indonesia Philippines Thailand Vietnam (1980) (2001) (1992) (1999) (1994-1996) Policy analysis and planning /H17038/H17038 Budget formulation /H17038/H17038 /H17038 Budget execution /H17038 Monitoring and Source: Authors' assessment . Note:/H11005strong, /H17038/H11005medium, /H11005weak. Start date of decentralization in parentheses.only a few regions, such as Semarang, have prepared to move in that direction. The lack of clarity regard-ing the postdecentralization role of the nationaldevelopment planning agency, BAPPENAS, furtherconfuses these processes. In the Philippines, the Local Government Code prescribes a participatory approach to planning,but compliance is poor. The code mandates thateach local government have a comprehensive, mul-tisectoral development plan formulated by its LocalDevelopment Council (LDC) and approved by itslegislature. However, fewer than half of local gov-ernments have an LDC in place. According to thecode, one-quarter of LDC members should comefrom nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) andpeople's organizations. However, one survey foundthat fewer than one-third of local developmentplans have benefited from meaningful input fromNGOs and people's organizations. The planningthat does exist focuses heavily on capital projects.Some cities and provinces report having medium-and long-term development plans. However, mostsmaller local governments have only an AnnualInvestment Plan. Project prioritization is usually anad hoc process, conducted with little reference tocosts and benefits. Local officials report that theirinvestment plans are formulated independently ofregional and national investment plans, and viceversa. Budget Formulation. In Vietnam, provincial Departments of Finance manage budget formula-tion at subnational levels, supervised by the provin-cial People's Council. Province-level spending unitssupervised directly by the provincial governmentsubmit their spending bids to the provincialDepartment of Finance. At the district level,Bureaus of Finance filter the spending bids ofdistrict-level spending units and communes. Theprovincial People's Councils previously submittedtheir budgets to the central Ministry of Finance forreview and approval by the National Assembly.Under the new State Budget Law, however, theprovincial People's Councils have enhancedauthority to approve provincial spending plans,with the National Assembly responsible principallyfor approving revenue shares and transfers fromthe center, plus the consolidated budget. Transfersfrom the center to the provinces for stable periodsof three years will also promote local budget planning. Although seemingly coherent, this subnational budget process has continuing weaknesses. Perhapsthe most significant problem is the separateDepartment of Finance and Department of Plan-ning and Investment at the provincial level, and therelatively weak coordination between these financeand planning functions. This produces a discon-nect between planning and budgeting processes,and between recurrent and capital spending, withplans focused on capital investments and little for-ward planning for recurrent spending. The ruraltransport sector, for example, has recently attractedmajor capital investment: only 269 communes nowhave no road access to district centers. However, alack of maintenance provisions means that manyroads fall into disrepair soon after construction iscomplete. Requiring communities to contribute toroad maintenance places a disproportionate bur-den on the poor: World Bank staff estimate thatsuch annual contributions equal 9.8 percent of theannual poverty line in the relatively poor NorthernUplands, compared with 4.6 percent in the countryas a whole. In China, the 1994 Budget Law governs the budget formulation process at central and local lev-els, but major weaknesses in subnational budgetingpersist. The period allowed for preparing thebudget is too short, often beginning only twomonths before the start of the budget year inJanuary. This has a cascading effect through thefive-tiered system, since each tier has to wait forinformation from the higher level before it can for-mulate its own expenditure and transfer plans.Because capital subsidies usually require matchingfunds, subnational governments have to hold largereserves. Budget formulation occurs on an annualbasis, and the budget is not explicitly linked to amedium-term strategy or a multiyear plan. Instead,budgeting is essentially incremental, characterizedby passive distribution of resources among exist-ing structures and services. Extrabudgetary fundsfinance portions of expenditures in most subna-tional departments, and many local governmentsfinance investments off-budget. The main budgetincludes considerable earmarking. Budget formulation in Indonesia's regions remains principally an administrative exercise, Public Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 91largely guided from the center, with district govern- ments and regional councils getting involved late inthe process. All spending units submit their budgetproposals to the local government's budget com-mittee, which in East Lombok, for example,includes representatives of the regional secretary,the finance bureau, the revenue office, the planningbureau, and the legal bureau. The budget commit-tee reviews revenue estimates and spending plansbefore finalizing the budget proposal around Octo-ber for submission to the Regional Council. At leastin some provinces, the Regional Council approvesthe budget before the start of the budget year inJanuary. However, regional budget preparation during the first few years of decentralization hasbeen compressed as a result of late approval of thenational budget, which determines transfers fromthe center. These processes are further complicated by con- tinuing confusion regarding relationships betweennational and subnational governments, andbetween agencies at each level. According to regula-tion 105 /H208622000, the Ministry of Home Affairs is still in charge of issuing budgeting guidelines, but theMinistry of Finance sets standards for financialmanagement throughout the public sector. In the Philippines, the integrity of local budget- ing is distorted, as in Indonesia, by poor revenueestimates during the budget formulation process.In particular, the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA)supplied by the central Department of Budget andManagement has been highly unreliable: in 1998the IRA estimate was 9 percent short of actualreleases. The shortfall dropped to 2 percent and6 percent in 1999 and 2000, respectively, but shotup to 15 percent in 2001. Budgeting is largely con-ducted in an incremental fashion. Community par-ticipation is limited: budget hearings are officiallyopen to all interested parties, but local governmentsoften do not circulate the budget document orexpenditure statements. In Thailand, annual budgeting has been rela- tively well-established in local administrationssince it was first instituted. Local authoritiesprepare their budgets in conformance with centralmandates. Executive bodies usually ready theirbudget documents between May and July and sub-mit them to the local council in August, with finalendorsement by provincial governors or districtheads by the start of the budget year in October.However, only a small proportion of Thailand's public spending is managed at the local level. Budget Execution. In Vietnam, provincial People's Councils approve subnational budgets. However,provincial and district branches of the State Trea-sury Department\u2014part of the central Ministry ofFinance\u2014supervise financial execution of theapproved budget. Treasury offices are responsiblefor issuing line-item allotments, approving checksdrafted by spending units against those allotments,maintaining records of unspent balances, and com-piling periodic financial reports. These mechanismshave proven broadly effective in preventing over-spending, helping Vietnam earn its reputation forfiscal prudence. Although procedures exist for real-locating the budget during the fiscal year, divergencebetween budget plans and outputs is smaller thanin most countries at similar levels of development.However, multiple layers of control also contribute to delays in projects and programs. Furthermore,a portion of subnational expenditures\u2014althoughoften eventually accounted for by Treasury\u2014remains outside the budget execution process. Indonesia has established procedures for appor- tioning and executing the approved budget. How-ever, delays in issuing warrants pose a significantproblem. The main reasons for these delays are lackof information about revenues from the centerand lack of clarity of central regulations regardingdecentralized funds. In the first year of decentral-ization, many regional governments were forced toengage in a major budget adjustment. The maincause was a centrally mandated increase in civilservice wages announced in July 2001 (althoughcontingency transfers offset the impacts of thisincrease). In China, likewise, budget execution at local lev- els has been characterized by slow disbursement.Late approval of the budget and the long delay ineffecting appropriations mean that spending unitscannot plan their spending efficiently. A significantportion of expenditures thus occurs during the lastmonths of the year. Procurement processes remain weak and poorly administered at national and subnational levels inmost EA5 countries. In Vietnam, the Ministry ofPlanning and Investment formally oversees pro-curement at all levels of government, but its scrutinyis weak and indirect, and a clarifying Procurement92 East Asia DecentralizesOrdinance has yet to be approved. In Indonesia, Law 25 of 1999 (now Law 32 of 2004) allows regions toestablish their own procurement regulations, withupcoming tenders published in local newspapers.However, Presidential Decree 18 of 2000 allows for preferential treatment of local bidders, and manyregional officials see procurement as a means tosupport local contractors rather than a way toobtain the best price. In the Philippines, the LocalGovernment Code decentralized procurement tolocal governments at a time when the legal andinstitutional framework was unclear and nontrans-parent. Although the country has since strength-ened the national procurement framework, localpolicies and practices still raise concerns, includingdelays, excessive local preference, and contract pricenegotiation, which often becomes an entry point forcorruption. In Thailand, local politicians oftenintrude in the procurement process. Monitoring and Accounting. Experience from around the world has underscored the importanceof having the central government set and enforcestandards for financial reporting. National lawneeds to provide reporting and accounting rules forboth the central and subnational levels. Such provi-sions help ensure that subnational governmentsgenerate financial reports that are comparable withthose of other localities. They also help ensure thatthe central government can generate data for theentire government, for both analyzing policy andmanaging fiscal targets. Local capacity constraintsmay also require the central government to lead inthis technically complex area. However, under asystematic program, local governments can oftenquickly develop their capacity to fulfill this task. China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam all have programs to modernize their financialmanagement information systems at national andsubnational levels. In the Philippines and Vietnam,the central government has the legal authority toset and enforce financial reporting standards. Bothcountries also have centrally specified charts ofaccounts, accounting systems, and reporting proce-dures. However, while these systems can producegeneral government reports, they are not timely oraccurate. For example, end-year accounts are notavailable in Vietnam until 18 months after the endof the fiscal year. In the Philippines, local financialmanagement is still based mainly on manual sys-tems. Each country is implementing new financial management information systems that shouldstrengthen overall government reporting. In China and Indonesia, each budget level main- tains its own accounting system. Both countries haveestablished some reporting requirements, but insti-tutional confusion over the powers of central agen-cies to specify and enforce these requirements hasundermined them. In Indonesia, for example, thedecentralization law splits subnational responsibilityfor financial management between two ministries\u2014Finance and Home Affairs. In both countries, thequality of reporting is poor, financial reports are dif-ficult to compare, and consolidating these reportsis difficult. This situation reflects poor financialmanagement information systems. For example,in Indonesia, subnational units submit quarterlybudget reports and financial accounts to the Min-istry of Finance mostly on paper. These two coun-tries are investing in strengthening their financialmanagement information systems. However, successwill depend on their ability to resolve issues regard-ing the authority of central government to imposeaccounting systems on subnational governments. Auditing and Evaluation. In Indonesia, local audit arrangements remain confused. Law 25 of 1999determined that\"prevailing regulations\"should gov-ern audits of local budgets. These regulationsassigned the central government's internal auditor,the Supreme Audit Authority, the Inspectorate Gen-eral of the province, and the Inspectorate Generalof Home Affairs as external auditors. PresidentialDecree 74 of 2001 has since assigned three internalauditors the right to audit local budgets: the localgovernment's auditor, the province's auditor, and theinspectors general of line ministries on technicalaspects. According to Law 5 of 1973, the SupremeAudit Agency\u2014the only external auditor in thecountry\u2014has the authority to audit all levels of gov-ernment. However, a draft law submitted to Parlia-ment in September 2000 puts this authority in doubt. In Vietnam, the State Audit of Vietnam (the external auditor) has existed for less than a decade.The Ministry of Finance recently issued 21 newauditing standards that reflect international stan-dards and strengthened reporting to the NationalAssembly. Formally, the State Audit of Vietnamincludes provinces and has five regional offices. Inpractice, however, the role of the state auditor at thePublic Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 93subnational level has not been established, and most auditing is performed by the State InspectionOffice (the internal auditor) and the network ofprovincial inspection offices. In the Philippines, the Commission on Audit has the power to audit local governments. However,the internal audit function is nonexistent in mostlocal governments. Until recently, the commission'sregional directors were overstretched, personallysupervising the audit of all government agencies inthe region, although the government took steps in2002 to address that problem. Auditing is a weak link in China's subnational expenditure management. Local audit bureaus doex post audits of local budgets. Audit bureaus mayalso select particular departments for a more in-depth audit and are also charged with auditingextrabudgetary funds. Each local government at theprovince level and below has its own audit bureauwith similar responsibilities. However, althoughlocal audit bureaus also report to the People's Con-gress, they are under the direct authority of theexecutive branch, compromising their indepen-dence. They are also underresourced and in need ofstaff training. In Thailand, only a small number of large-scale local authorities, such as the Bangkok MetropolitanAdministration, Pattaya City and Nakorn munici-palities, have internal auditors. Two external audit-ing units\u2014the Office of Auditor General andthe provincial auditing teams\u2014have considerablecredibility but limited capacity to provide auditingservices to all local authorities. In most EA5 countries, subnational budget eval- uation is still in the earliest stages of development.In China, local budget evaluation barely exists. InVietnam, the government has conducted threeprovincial expenditure reviews and is planningseveral more. In Indonesia, the head of a region isrequired to present an annual accountability reportto the Regional Council. However, because thebudget documentation does not specify measurabletargets, evaluating outputs and outcomes is difficult. Subnational Expenditure Management: Getting Institutions and Incentives Right The institutional environment for subnational pub- lic expenditure management will play an importantpart in determining its evolution in the EA5. Centralgovernments have an important role to play. Unless they establish appropriate institutions and incentiveframeworks, successful subnational expendituremanagement processes are unlikely to develop. Keyfactors include the following: Clear assignment of responsibilities. Clarity is essential regarding which expenditures each level ofgovernment is responsible for. According toWallace Oates's \"decentralization theorem,\" \"eachpublic service should be provided by the jurisdic-tion having control over the minimum geographicarea that would internalize the benefits and costs ofsuch provision.\" 5The European Union has adopted the \"subsidiarity\" principle, which asserts thatlower levels of government should have responsi-bility for spending and delivering services unlessthere is a convincing case for assigning that respon-sibility to higher levels. Matching of resources to responsibilities. The resources available to each subnational governmentshould reflect the costs of the services it must provide.Such a match can occur through some combinationof tax and revenue assignment, tax- and revenue-sharing agreements, unconditional grants, condi-tional block grants (transfers subject to conditionsor service standards), targeted grants for specificpurposes or projects, and appropriate borrowingauthority. These resource flows should be as stableand predictable as possible to facilitate local planning. Matching of authority to responsibilities. Subna- tional governments will build stronger expendituremanagement processes\u2014and deliver services moreeffectively\u2014if they have the necessary degree ofauthority over those resources. Central govern-ments sometimes pass functions and resources tosubnational governments but then deny them thecontrol they need to deliver responsive and high-quality services. Such overconstrained approachesrest on the often false assumption that central offi-cials have better information and sharper incentivesthan subnational officials. Such approaches distortexpenditure management processes and impede theability of local governments to innovate. Above all,micromanagement and second-guessing blur thelines of accountability between tiers of government. Local capacity. Subnational governments need the capacity to develop strong processes for manag-ing expenditures for cost-effective service delivery.In deciding how far to decentralize responsibilityfor public spending, central governments need to94 East Asia Decentralizesassess local capacity. Nevertheless, substantive capacity is likely to develop only through \"learningby doing,\" in which subnational governments aregiven some budget to manage. Central governmenthas an important role to play in creating such anenvironment, as well as in mentoring and traininglocal officials. Local accountability. If subnational expenditure management is to translate into cost-effective serv-ices, local governments need to be accountable tocitizens and their institutions. Such accountabilityincludes external auditors and representative localassemblies, public interest bodies and civil society,and individuals with concerns and grievances. Ana-lysts often argue that boosting the share of localexpenditures financed by own-revenues enhanceslocal accountability (although this argument hasdeficiencies in countries where only a small pro-portion of citizens pay direct taxes). National accountability. Because subnational administrations draw on transfers and deliver serv-ices with national impacts, central governmentsmust find a way to hold them accountable but stopshort of micromanagement. T oward that end, centraland local governments could create multiyear\"contracts\" covering both expenditure and revenueassignments that include performance criteria andminimum service standards. Assessing East Asian Countries T o what extent have EA5 countries established these conditions for success? Once again we reviewedpublished and unpublished reports on expenditure decentralization. At present, as table 5.4 shows,none of the EA5 countries score highly on any ofthese conditions. Assignment of responsibility isoften fuzzy. Resources and authority over thoseresources are often poorly matched with responsi-bilities. Local capacity and accountability\u2014to bothlocal people and central government\u2014are oftenlimited. The following sections elaborate on this assessment. Clear Assignment of Responsibilities. Al a c ko f clarity in assigning responsibilities is a commonproblem in the EA5. In Indonesia, these problemsare due mainly to hasty implementation of sweepingchanges and the inexperience of reformers. Thisexperience illustrates the difficulty of applying theo-retical concepts of decentralization. Based on thesubsidiarity principle, the decentralization law (Law20) of 1999 gave all \"authorities\" to local govern-ments except those specifically assigned to the centerand regions. However, since \"authorities\" arebroader than functions, the result is much confusionover who is responsible for what, from legislation toplanning to implementation. Further confoundingthe assignment of responsibility is the fact that cen-tral line ministries still account for a significantamount of local spending. Adding to the confusionand disputes, Law 22 of 1999 called for adjustingsectoral laws and regulations to conform to the newdecentralization framework\u2014in effect setting asidethe functional responsibilities and operationalPublic Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 95 TABLE 5.4 Do EA5 Countries Meet Conditions for Effective Decentralization of Expenditure Management?

Legal battles have ensued, as some centralministries sought to exempt their agencies fromdecentralization laws, at least until local govern-ments were ready to take on the functions. 6 In China and Vietnam, the lack of clarity stems from a second dimension of the assignment prob-lem: how to distribute functions among levels ofgovernment in a multitiered administrative setting.In both countries, the administrative systems oper- ate as nested hierarchies, in which the central gov-ernment sets rules only for provinces, which setrules for districts and communes. 7 China's 1994 Budget Law spells out in broad principles the division of functions between centraland subnational governments, but is silent on thedivision of labor between tiers of subnational gov-ernment. This leaves essentially all decentralizedfunctions as concurrent assignments for the vari-ous subnational tiers. In practice, China typicallyassigns the responsibilities based on economies ofscale and the subsidiarity principle. For example,provinces operate universities and large hospitals,while lower-tier governments run primary andmiddle schools and small hospitals and healthclinics. This approach has led to two undesirable out- comes in China over the past decade. First, expen-diture assignments are murky, with a good deal ofuncertainty about which level of subnational gov-ernment is responsible for what. With all subna-tional levels jointly responsible, no one is account-able. Second, this murkiness has worsened the fiscal status of the lowest tiers and adversely affectedservice delivery. This has been evident in rural pro-vision of basic education: provinces, prefectures,and counties have done little or nothing to helprural townships that lack the resources to imple-ment the national policy of providing nine years offree education. Table 5.5 shows what happens in the absence of formal rules. For China as a whole, and for three ofthe four provinces in the sample, counties andtownships together lost expenditure shares from1994 to 1999, indicating that they had fewerresources to finance their responsibilities, whichdid not change. These trends confirm the com-plaint in many localities that each administrativelevel tries to capture more revenues by redefininghow to share \"local\" taxes with the level below.Since the county and township levels together pro-vide the bulk of basic services, including 70 percentof total public expenditures on education and55 percent of expenditures on health, this trendcould significantly undermine services, especiallyin rural areas. Provinces, in contrast, have gainedsignificant expenditure shares even though they arenot directly involved in providing services or redis-tributing income. A third result of the lack of clear assignments occurs when central ministries and departmentsresist giving up their authority under decentraliza-tion. In Vietnam, the roles of sectoral ministriesand provinces in prioritizing expenditures are96 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 5.5 Distribution of Expenditures and Revenues in China, by Administrative Level (percent) Expenditures Revenues 1999 China Hebei Gansu Hunan Jiangsu China Hebei Gansu Hunan Jiangsu Province 28.2 26.4 32.8 31.6 25.8 21.2 20.6 16.5 13.6 16.2 Prefecture 30.2 23.7 19.5 22.4 34.7 35.4 23.4 24.9 27.8 43.8County a41.5 39.2 34.3 37.8 39.5 43.4 35.8 39.9 35.2 40.0 Township 10.7 13.4 8.9 0.0 20.2 18.7 23.4 0.0Change since 1994/95 (in percentage points)Province 1.8 6.8 0.5 5.6 5.8 4.1 0.9 /H110021.4 /H110020.4 Prefecture 0.6 /H110029.5 /H1100211.0 1.9 0.0 /H110021.5 3.8 /H110023.6 0.0 Source: World Bank 2002a, table 8. a. County figures for China include townships.unclear. Ministries establish unrealistic service norms that provinces largely ignore. This phenom-enon is common in China and the Philippines aswell. In fact, national standard setting on civil serv-ice wages and salaries, and even nationally man-dated wage increases, are common in all EA5 coun-tries to varying extents. This is extremely disruptiveto local budgeting, given the large share of localexpenditures absorbed by personnel costs (seechapter 7). The realities of service delivery are often such that simplistic assignment of complex services to asingle level of government is not practical. Mostcountries have overlapping assignments. However,clarifying responsibility for regulation, financing,implementation, provision, and maintenance ofassets is still important, as is ensuring that theseassignments are clear to all, including the public.Most of the EA5 countries have considerable scopefor improvement in this regard. Matching of Resources to Responsibilities. The literature on fiscal federalism implicitly assumesthat local governments are largely financing theirown services\u2014hence the choice between high-tax,high-service packages and low-tax, low-servicepackages across localities. The reality is that there isno a priori reason why, under a well-designed inter-governmental system, the expenditure needs ofsubnational governments will match their ability togenerate own-revenues to meet those needs. Thus,intergovernmental transfers play a crucial role,both vertically (in determining whether local gov-ernments have the resources to perform theirassigned responsibilities) and horizontally (inkeeping interregional disparities to acceptablelevels). All the EA5 countries face problems coordinat- ing the decentralization of revenues and expendi-tures, albeit for different reasons. In Thailand, thetransfer of revenues has outpaced the transfer ofresponsibilities. In principle, the laws provide localgovernments with minimum transfers, but the cen-tral bureaucracy has been slow to decentralize com-mensurate functions. As a result, in mid-2003, localrevenues were about 22 percent of national rev-enues, while the country has decentralized onlyabout 4 percent of expenditures. In Indonesia, even though central authorities scrambled to decentralize expenditures to avoidhuge deficits, they devolved more than enough rev- enues in 2001 to match expenditure responsibili-ties. In the Philippines, decentralization has alsotransferred more resources than responsibilities tothebarangays (fourth tier), specifying that they can levy a tax of up to 1 percent of gross receipts onbusinesses and collect fees, but without specifyingthat they perform any significant duties(Azfar et al.2000). China reveals the opposite mismatch: subna- tional governments account for a much larger shareof expenditures (70 percent) than revenues (45 per-cent). Central transfers\u2014which finance about45 percent of subnational expenditures onaverage\u2014fill the vertical fiscal gap. However, thetransfer system is not equalizing, often giving moreto rich provinces than to poor ones (see chapter 4).Thus, resource gaps emerge in poor regions withinadequate self-financing, and at lower tiers ofthe administrative hierarchy such as counties andtownships. Since fiscal capacities vary greatly acrosslocalities\u2014reflecting the uneven distribution ofeconomic activities\u2014the result has been large andgrowing service disparities between urban andrural areas, and between regions. As interregional disparities in spending have risen sharply since the mid-1990s, public serviceshave gradually deteriorated in poor regions (WorldBank 2002a). In Yunnan Province on China'ssouthwestern border, 106 of 127 counties werereportedly unable to meet budgeted expendituresin 1995. In neighboring Guizhou, the poorestprovince in China, many counties could not meetpayroll (Dai Xiaoming 1997). In the Liangshan Yiminority Prefecture in Sichuan Province, this led tothe elimination of free medical care and epidemicprevention programs, among other services. Manyclinics and health stations closed, and epidemic dis-eases thought to have been wiped out reappeared.In 1996, only 40 percent of Yi children attendedschool, a figure that dropped to 10 percent inpoorer villages (Heberer 2001). With ambitiousmandates for many public services, local govern-ments must raise their own funds off-budget, rely-ing heavily on user charges to finance primary edu-cation, and on the sale of medicines, supplies, andother assets to finance public health. Fiscal pressures have also reduced the resources available to local governments in the Philippines.With revenues falling from 18.7 percent of gross Public Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 97national product in 1997 to 14.6 percent in 2001 and continuing to fall through 2003, the resultingbudget deficits and rising interest costs havesqueezed social spending and the ability of localgovernments to fulfill their responsibilities. Thedecline is exacerbated by budgetary inflexibility atthe sectoral level. For example, in education, theratio of personnel costs to the total recurringbudget rose to 92.4 percent in 2001, severely limit-ing room to maneuver (World Bank 2003e). None of the EA5 except China has assigned local governments significant revenue bases, and Chinadid so through the \"backdoor\"\u2014that is, largely off-budget (see box 5.1). Matching of Authority to Responsibilities. Another significant shortcoming in the institu-tional framework and incentive environment forsubnational expenditure management has been fre-quent mismatch between authority and responsi-bility. Local governments and service providersoften have functional responsibility without the authority to manage related public expenditures.This undercuts the promised benefits of both devo-lution and delegation strategies (see box 5.2). One dimension of this problem is a lack of local authority regarding sectoral spending allocations.Directives by the central government often tie a sig-nificant proportion of revenues and resourcestransferred to local governments to specific sectors,functions, or services. In Vietnam, for example, provincial finance departments must allocate their budgets inaccordance with norms specified by central lineministries. However, budgets allocated to provinceshave not enabled them to meet all the obligationsimposed by the center. Provincial finance depart-ments, in consultation with the People's Commit-tee and People's Council, have therefore used theirdiscretion in allocating funds between sectors andspending units. A new State Budget Law, whichtook effect in January 2004, consolidated this98 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 5.1 The Backdoor Route to Decentralization in China While straining under diminishing fiscal resources but facing growing demands for services, localgovernments in China have turned to a plethoraof fees and levies on local constituents to bridgethe budget gap. These include education sur-charges, traffic safety fees, family planning fees,and contributions to National Day celebrationsand preparation for the Olympic Games. Thecentral government sanctioned these efforts, andencouraged and even urged local governmentsto \"find local solutions.\" Today local governments depend on extra- budgetary resources to finance nearly half theirexpenditures, on average. aIn 1998, for exam- ple, the budget financed an average of only53 percent of China's expenditures in education;tuition, fees, social contributions, and profitsfrom school-run enterprises provided the rest. Inthe health sector in 1999, budgetary appropria-tions provided only 11 percent of total operatingrevenues in public hospitals and clinics, whileout-of-pocket payments by patients accountedfor 59 percent. A 1999 survey in China's Shanxi Province illustrated the dominance of fees over taxes insome sectors and localities. The survey foundthat annual fee payments averaged almost \u00a5 11,000 in the nine cities surveyed, while taxeswere less than \u00a5 1,500. The ratio of fees to taxesranged from a high of 13 to a low of 4, with thehighest in smaller cities. These fees were almostentirely outside the purview of the budget, as dif-ferent departments collected and used the feesuntil public expenditure management reformsimplemented since 2002. Once authorized, thereporting requirements for fees were lax, andfinance departments were often unable to tracktotal collections and how they were used. Expen-diture management reforms are attempting tobring these extrabudgetary revenues undertighter supervision, but resistance is reportedlywidespread. These extrabudgetary funds provide a back- door route to decentralization in China, as theygive local governments real autonomy on boththe revenue and expenditure sides, which theylack under the formal budget. However, thesefunds are not transparent, and the user chargesfrom which they are financed are often highlyregressive. a. Wong 1998; Fan 1998; and World Bank 2002a.de facto discretion. Recognizing this reality in law will help clarify accountability and strengthen localtransparency. But some constraints on provincesremain. They must spend 15 percent of their bud-gets on the national priority sector of education by2000, 18 percent by 2005, and 20 percent by 2010.They must also spend 2 percent of their budgets onscience and technology. In China, a multiplicity of laws stipulating spending increases in certain sectors and regionsconstrain local governments. For example, the cen-tral government required education expendituresto rise to 4 percent of GDP by 2000, that agricul- tural spending must grow faster than revenues, andthat spending on propaganda and culture shouldbe no lower than overall revenue growth. The cen-ter also required that spending on science and envi-ronmental protection each rise to 1.5 percent ofGDP by 2000, and that health care spending keeppace with revenue growth, with per capita spendingrising from \u00a5 2.6 to \u00a5 4 by 2000. Reconciling all these constraints and unfunded mandates is almost impossible for local govern-ments. These constraints have contributed to China's backdoor decentralization, whereby localgovernments have moved more and more fundsoutside the purview of the budget and fiscalauthorities. In Indonesia, the central government continues to enforce regulations that determine spending oncertain items, including the Education Law, which calls for providing nine years of education to all,with free primary schooling. Government regula-tions 109 and 110 of 2000 also regulate the ceilingfor spending by the head of a region and theprovincial representative assembly, but these regu-lations are widely ignored. Another common problem is a lack of authority transferred from the central or local finance func-tion to local service providers, which have little dis-cretion in using resources. In Vietnam, provincialfinance departments required spending units toagree to every detail in their budgets and obtainformal approval before reallocating spending.However, recent decrees have gradually delegatedgreater budgetary flexibility, within a fixed blockPublic Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 99 BOX 5.2 China: Devolution by Default Rather Than by Design During China's transition to a market economy, decentralization has occurred more by neglectthan by design. Subnational expenditures haverisen from about 45 percent of the total on theeve of transition to around 70 percent today.However, this increase reflected changes in thecomposition of expenditures and relative pricesrather than a major change in expenditureassignments. As in other Soviet-type economies, in China the central government was responsible fornational defense, economic development(capital spending, research and development,industrial policy, and universities and researchinstitutes), and national institutions such as thejudicial system. The central government had del-egated to local governments responsibility forday-to-day public administration and social serv-ices, such as education (except universities),public safety, health care, social security, hous-ing, and other local and urban services. A largeportion of central spending focused on makingcapital investments and financing state-ownedenterprises. When the transition began, thetransfer of financing for state-owned enterprisesfrom the budget to the banking system reduced central spending, while wage increases pushedup the cost of labor-intensive services, whichwere mostly local. Safety net expenditures\u2014alsolocal responsibilities\u2014rose rapidly with retrench-ment in the state-owned enterprise sector,which entailed unemployment stipends, earlyretirements, and pension payouts. As a result,local expenditures grew relatively. Behind these numbers, real decentralization had in fact occurred. While local governmentsare performing largely the same functions asbefore, under the planned economy they hadacted as agents in fulfilling deconcentrated func-tions of the central government, which bore thecosts through revenue-sharing arrangements.During the transition, however, incrementalchanges in revenue-sharing arrangementsweakened and then severed the link betweenretained revenues and expenditure needs, andlocal governments became responsible forfinancing their assigned functions from own-revenues. This devolution had occurred withoutfanfare in the mid-1980s and was later codifiedin the Budget Law of 1994.grant, to spending and service delivery units.8Units will have the freedom to shift resources betweenrecurrent budget lines and\u2014crucially\u2014to usesavings from staffing cuts or lower operationalcosts to finance salary supplements. Selectedspending units in Ho Chi Minh City have pilotedthis approach over two years, and a recent WorldBank-sponsored assessment concluded that thepilots may have resulted in significant staffingreductions and savings (Bartholomew et al. 2005).(See box 5.3 for further details on this experiment.) Nominally decentralized expenditure manage- ment regimes involving high levels of central con-trol are likely to be both inefficient and ineffective.Such regimes will tend to make the allocation ofresources overly rigid and encourage compliancewith rules and red tape rather than a focus onresponsiveness and service outputs and outcomes.Such regimes also remove incentives among serviceproviders to find savings, because officials cannottransfer savings within expenditure items orsubitems to other categories but must forfeit themto the treasury. Above all, micromanagement andsecond-guessing blur the lines of accountability forresults between the finance function and the spend-ing unit. Nevertheless, central governments need to manage the passing of budgetary authority tosubnational governments carefully. Checks and bal- ances need to be in place if the move away fromline-item budgeting is not simply to replace oneform of inefficiency with another. As they lift line-item budget constraints, central governments needto create alternative mechanisms such as strongercapacity and greater ex post accountability for theuse of resources and service performance. Strongfinancial management systems are essential for pre-serving fiscal discipline. We turn next to issues ofcapacity, accountability, and reporting. Local Capacity. Local capacity for managing fiscal resources varies greatly, not only across administra-tive tiers but also within each tier. As the Ho ChiMinh City block grant experiment suggests, theadministrative capacities of large cities may some-times be equal to those of the central government.That story also clearly reveals that mobilizing thesecapacities to improve resource allocation and serv-ice delivery depends critically on establishingappropriate incentives and constraints. For the most part in the EA5, however, local governments typically have weaker capacity inexpenditure management skills, such as plan-ning, budgeting, execution, audit, and procure-ment. In China, local public expenditure manage-ment is extremely poor. Budgeting is passive and100 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 5.3 The Block Grant Experiment in Ho Chi Minh City In 1999, the Vietnamese government authorized a pilot to introduce block grant budgeting in 10administrative units (districts and departments) inHo Chi Minh City. An early World Bank-sponsoredassessment found that the pilots had made signif-icant progress in meeting their objectives: Restructuring departments and streamlining administrative procedures. In most pilot agencies, restructuring and streamlining had alreadybegun. The pilot gave a further boost to this,although centrally prescribed functional obliga-tions limited the scope for restructuring. Reducing administrative costs. Reported gross financial savings in the first year of the pilot rangedfrom 13 percent to 29 percent, based on adminis-trative economies as well as staff reductions.Because departments used the savings to supple-ment salaries, as planned, net savings were zero.Reducing overstaffing. Most agencies cut their staff by around 15 percent compared with theirquota, and some made bigger cuts. However,most staff were transferred rather than retired orretrenched. Raising incomes of employees by reapplying savings. Departments used gross savings to raise incomes, with 70 percent going to salaries,20 percent to a bonus fund, and 10 percent toa staff welfare fund. Increasing transparency. Departments launched various initiatives to monitor service delivery stan-dards and customer satisfaction. No evidencesuggests that service quality declined in the pilotagencies. Source: Bartholomew et al. 2005.input oriented rather than results oriented. Budget formulation is almost totally inertia-driven, as itadds incrementally to past year's allocations with-out focusing on goals, outcomes, or performance.Accounting standards are lax, and waste of resources is common (World Bank 2002a). Thatthese problems persist after more than two decadesof economic decentralization suggests that theirroot cause lies elsewhere. The inefficiencies of localexpenditures can be explained by the bifurcatedChinese fiscal system: local officials are often notinterested in improving financial management ofbudgets over which they lack real control; they focusinstead on developing extrabudgetary resourcesover which they exercise near-total control. Another dimension of the problem is that coun- tries have sometimes made \"wrong assignments\" bydevolving responsibility for providing services tolevels of government that do not have the resourcesand administrative capacity to respond. Again,China provides a good example. Throughout thehistory of the People's Republic, rural basic educa-tion has been the responsibility of township gov-ernments, which average 27,000 in population, andtheir antecedent, agricultural people's communes. 9 Under the collective economy, public funds of thecollectives financed rural education, with teachersmostly paid in \"work points,\" or shares in the col-lective's net income. Under that system, the leveland quality of education varied among collectives,depending on their resources and allocativechoices. Through the 1980s the governmentimposed rising standards on rural schools andteachers, and by the late 1980s directed that all ruralteachers be upgraded to the status of publicemployees. This greatly raised the cost of providingrural education, as the average salary for teachers instate-run schools was several times that of teachersin rural \"community\" schools. Expenditure pressures on townships rose further when the government introduced a CompulsoryEducation Law calling for nine years of UniversalCompulsory Education (UCE) by 2000\u2014a levelthat far surpassed provision in most rural areas.T ownships\u2014primarily agricultural units\u2014have nosignificant tax base, except for the lucky ones incoastal provinces, where township and village enter-prises thrive. For them, education is by far thelargest budgetary outlay, which even in the early1990s absorbed 40-60 percent of the total. Despitepressure from upper levels to comply with UCE, townships in poor regions have not met targets(Wong et al. 1995). 10At the same time, the strain of trying to do so has led townships to impose escalat-ing fees and involuntary contributions on rural res-idents, spawning a rising tide of collective proteststhrough the 1990s. 11Thus, decentralizing basic edu- cation to townships has hindered the prioritynational program of universal compulsory educa-tion while imposing high tax burdens on localpopulations. Local Accountability. Institutions for managing expenditures focused on effective and responsiveservice delivery are likely to evolve only if institu-tions also hold local governments accountable forthe way they use resources. As previous sectionsmake clear, however, local governments cannot beheld accountable for nonperformance if they havenot been given clear assignments, if they do nothave the resources and authority to respond, or iftheir assignments and capacities are poorlymatched. One of the key assumptions of decentralization is that local governments are more responsivebecause they are \"closer to the people.\" The litera-ture on fiscal decentralization tends to emphasizebottom-up mechanisms of \"voice\" (elections) and\"exit\" (mobility), both exercised by the electorate.In the nascent democracies of Indonesia and Thai-land, these mechanisms may take time to develop.Even in the Philippines, where grassroots democ-racy began a decade earlier, a 1999 study found thata lack of information limited popular influence onlocal decision making\u2014citizens generally knew lessabout local government than about national gov-ernment. While citizens rely on the media for infor-mation on the national government, they relylargely on local officials and personal contacts forinformation on local government, as the mediatend to focus only on \"big news.\" In turn, local offi-cials have little awareness of the preferences of localcitizens, although municipal officials were moreaware than provincial officials. In the Philippines,decentralization also does not seem to haveimproved civic discipline despite the democraticsetup. Measured corruption remains high and hasgrown under decentralization (Azfar et al. 2000). Analysts also often assert that local taxing author- ity enhances local accountability: when local citizensPublic Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 101are paying directly for public services, they devote more attention to local politics and officeholders.However, this assertion lacks empirical justificationanywhere in the world, is conceptually suspect to theextent that it elides citizens and taxpayers, and isparticularly questionable in the EA5, where only asmall proportion of citizens pay direct taxes. The exit option is not an effective mechanism for holding local governments accountable incountries where government is the sole provider ofmany services. This is true in China and Vietnam,where private providers are just emerging in vitalservices such as education and health care, andwhere government monopolies and administrativerestraints hinder the development of many serv-ices. In these countries, people's option of movingto another jurisdiction (\"voting with the feet\") isconstrained. Political culture also hinders theresponsiveness of local governments and serviceproviders. Officials who are used to responding torules and regulations will need time to becomemore client oriented. National Accountability. The transition eco- nomies of China and Vietnam, and to some extentthe other countries in the EA5, also have top-downmechanisms to hold local governments account-able. A study of transition economies in EasternEurope and the former Soviet Union found thatintermediate levels of government tended torespond to higher levels of government rather thanto local people (Wetzel 2001). In China and Vietnam, through the nomen- klatura system of appointing the top officials, the Communist Party continues to wield control oversenior civil servants. In China, the government relieson elaborate systems of evaluation and performancebonuses for top officials at all levels of governmentto induce compliance on priority goals such asgrowth, family planning, and prevention of socialunrest. These mechanisms have been spectacularlysuccessful in ensuring that local officials promotegrowth and invest in basic infrastructure. Judgingfrom the remarkable record of high and sustainedgrowth rates over the past two decades, China isarguably a successful case where the central govern-ment gets more of what it wants by giving incentivesto local governments to fulfill the central agenda.This is the argument of the so-called \"market-preserving fiscal federalism\" school. That approachhas been far less successful in meeting other targets, however, such as exerting aggregate fiscal discipline,ensuring the delivery of vital services to all citizens,and protecting vulnerable social groups. Although Vietnam remains a one-party state, the National Assembly is growing in importance,reviewing government plans, budgets, and imple-mentation and exercising its constitutional author-ity as the highest organ of the state. The bureau-cracy sees the National Assembly as a significantsource of authority and a potential arena for inde-pendent criticism of government performance.However, the People's Councils at provincial levels and below have yet to emerge in all but the majorcities as significant checks on the executive. Thememberships of the People's Councils (the legisla-ture) and the People's Committees (the executive)often overlap, and their capacity is often limited. Given the fragile nature of local democracy in EA5 countries, the central government plays animportant role in managing decentralization. Itmust have strong capacity to monitor and evaluatedecentralization, and it must set up mechanisms tohold local governments accountable in fulfillingtheir responsibilities. But central governmentsmust balance these imperatives against the need togive local governments autonomy and incentives,and the need to guard against micromanagementand the reassertion of authority. The availability and timeliness of information on subnational governments is weak for mostcountries in the world, and the EA5 is no exception.Improving local transparency and informationflows is vital to building subnational accountabilityto both citizens and higher-level governments. Conclusion Building sound public expenditure management processes at the subnational level in the EA5 is alarge and daunting program. The success of thatprogram will depend on establishing appropriateinstitutions and incentives. In other parts of theworld, expenditure management processes and thesupporting institutions and incentives evolved overdecades and even centuries. The East Asian experi-ence is still unfolding. Nevertheless, a number ofpreliminary conclusions emerge from this review ofthe region's early experiences in decentralizingpublic expenditures.102 East Asia DecentralizesFirst, expenditure management processes at the subnational level are generally weak. Planningprocesses are disconnected from fiscal planningand budgeting processes, and poorly coordinatedwith planning at other levels of government. Bud-get formulation suffers from major delays and isfragmented, with parallel budgets for investmentprojects and recurrent expenditures managed byseparate institutions. Budget execution is slow, withlong delays in effecting appropriations, significantdivergences between approved appropriations andoutputs, and corruption in procurement. Monitor-ing and accounting systems often produce data thatare neither timely nor accurate. Auditing is typi-cally weak and evaluation almost nonexistent. Part of the explanation is that countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam are just begin-ning to decentralize expenditures. However, timedoes not automatically solve these problems: Chinaand the Philippines are still struggling to build theneeded institutions despite starting one and twodecades ago. There is no regional panacea: everycountry will need to find its own way forward.Nevertheless, all the EA5 countries clearly need toprioritize strengthening core expenditure manage-ment processes at subnational levels as part ofwider decentralization programs. In so doing,countries need to devote attention to budget for-mulation and execution, and focus on \"getting thebasics right\" rather than attempting \"best practice.\" 12Most EA5 coun- tries should pay early attention to coordinatingsubnational planning and budgeting, integratingextrabudgetary resources into the budget pro-cess, and strengthening information on financialmanagement. Second, none of the EA5 countries score highly on the institutions and incentives needed to man-age subnational expenditures effectively. Assign-ment of responsibilities is often fuzzy. Resourcesand the authority to manage those resources areoften poorly matched with responsibilities. Localcapacity and accountability to both local peopleand central government are often limited. AlthoughEA5 countries can take immediate steps tostrengthen expenditure management processes,governments cannot expect healthy local institu-tions to develop organically until they haveaddressed these structural issues. Over the longerterm, central governments need to assign functionsclearly and match resources and authority to responsibility. These efforts should go hand inhand with strengthening capacity and accountabil-ity institutions at both local and central levels. Third, decentralizing expenditure appears to have yielded some benefits. In particular, given flex-ibility and the right incentives, local governmentshave shown significant capacity to innovate, both inresponding to local demands and conditions and inachieving cost savings. Innovations in service deliv-ery associated with flexibility given to frontline serv-ice providers by subnational governments inVietnam and China are cases in point. Such innova-tion has occurred despite imperfect conditions fordecentralization and its incomplete nature. How-ever, major distortions have emerged as well. In par-ticular, inequalities in service provision have oftengrown. EA5 governments need to pay greater atten-tion to the impacts of decentralized management ofpublic expenditures and service delivery on povertyreduction and equity. The process for learningthrough local innovations must be formalized. Bothpositive and negative experiences need to be ana-lyzed, compared, and disseminated, and both localand central authorities must respond flexibly tofacts on the ground. Central governments\u2014as wellas regional groups such as the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and internationalorganizations such as the World Bank\u2014have animportant role to play in capturing and disseminat-ing such lessons. Fourth, perhaps the defining challenge in EA5 countries is to balance the need for bottom-up localdiscretion with the need for top-down direction insubnational expenditure management. In countryafter country, central ministries continue to overplaytheir role by creating unfunded mandates andimpinging on the necessary discretion of local gov-ernments. At the same time, central governmentsplay an important role in guaranteeing minimumservice standards, transparency, and accountability;in transferring resources between regions; in ensur-ing coordination between central and local initiativesas well as between local initiatives; and in creatingincentives for developing local expenditure manage-ment capabilities. This is particularly the case giventhe weaknesses of local democracy in EA5 countries.Efforts to decentralize public expenditures need tofocus on redefining the role of central ministries aswell as developing new roles for local agencies. Public Expenditure on the Frontline: Toward Effective Management by Subnational Governments 103Endnotes 1. Our study does not include Cambodia. 2. The study sample included countries for which subnational budgetary data were available from the InternationalMonetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and Development, and othersources. 3. Bahl's regression results (2002) showed a \"decentralization effort\" of 2.6 for Vietnam, 1.4 for China, 1.0 for the Philip-pines, 0.9 for Indonesia, and 0.6 for Thailand. The authormeasured decentralization as the ratio of actual subna-tional expenditures to \"predicted\" expenditure share. 4.

Ideally, and according totheory, subnational governments provide servicesto their constituents up to the point at which thecost\u2014in terms of taxes\u2014equals the benefit, interms of the value of the services. T o satisfy this con- dition, local governments must have the authorityto exercise own-source taxation, and be in a finan-cial position to do so. This is the essence of account-ability and efficiency under decentralization, andthat is why decentralized revenue policy matters. The design of a local revenue system includes three central dimensions: the assignment of rev-enue sources among types of government, thedegree of autonomy with which subnational gov-ernments can exercise their assigned authority, andthe efficiency of the revenue administration system.For a decentralized system to meet expectations,policymakers must ensure coordination betweenthese dimensions. 1076 Subnational Own-Source Revenue: Getting Policy and Administr ation Right Robert R. T aliercio This chapter follows this logic. It begins by ana- lyzing the links between revenue assignment andautonomy by country and type of revenue, andthen assesses the region's revenue performance.The ensuing two sections take up the question ofrevenue administration and address the politics oflocal taxation, highlighting issues of policy imple-mentation. The last section offers final commentson the implications of these findings for both pol-icy and administration. The chapter's overarching conclusion is that East Asian countries reveal many inconsistencies andcontradictions vis-\u00e0-vis commonly accepted criteriafor a \"good\" intergovernmental revenue system.However, this newly decentralized region is also see-ing rich experimentation and innovation, whichbodes well for further reform. The Setting and Normative Framework Except in the Philippines and perhaps Indonesia, subnational governments in East Asia make littleuse of own-revenues to finance local services (seetable 6.1). That is, the region is not characterized bysignificant fiscal decentralization. The implications108 East Asia Decentralizes of this are considerable. The fact that subnational governments have both limited powers to raise rev-enues and limited capacity to collect them posesprofound questions about the actual benefits ofdecentralization. Can local governments respond tolocal preferences in taxation and thus service deliv-ery, thereby achieving greater accountability andefficiency? Are fiscal tools and capacities sufficientto generate sustainable own-source revenues? Has a reliance on transfers, in their myriad forms, madesubnational governments dependent on nationalgovernments and weakened subnational incentivesto improve own-source collections? The three dimensions of revenue policy provide a framework for addressing these questions: 1 Which taxes should be authorized or assigned to central governments and which to subnational gov-ernments? The decision should be legal and trans-parent, occurring through both constitutional andlegislative processes. However, as discussed below,governments sometimes assume \"authority\" ille-gally. That such illegality and informality are unde-sirable will become clear; nonetheless, in somecountries, particularly China, these approaches arecommonplace. Focusing on assignment of revenuesources among governments stresses the impor-tance of understanding decentralization as anintergovernmental partnership. Numerous public finance economists have pro- vided guidance on how to think about assigningtaxes between national and local governments, andmany of the resulting perspectives place a high prior- ity on economic efficiency. The first principle of rev-enue assignment\u2014summed up by the \"finance-follows-function\" refrain\u2014is that it should be basedon assigned expenditures. A second principle, giventhe matching of revenues to expenditures,is that localtaxation should avoid introducing economic dis-tortions by inappropriately taxing the factors of pro-duction.The third general principle\u2014subsidiarity\u2014holds that revenue-raising powers should beassigned to the lowest-possible level of government,except where such assignment would produce eco-nomic distortions or negative externalities. 2 These three principles provide a general frame- work for assessing revenue assignment, which\u2014when fleshed out with more specific considerations\u2014offers a set of practical guidelines. According toNorregaard, governments should not levy \"localtaxes\" on very mobile factors lest they encouragetaxpayer migration (though what constitutes \"verymobile\" is largely an empirical issue) (Norregaard1997). Such taxes should not be unevenly distrib-uted among jurisdictions (as in the case of naturalresource taxation), should raise enough revenue toavoid large vertical fiscal imbalances, should not beexportable to nonresidents (which would weakenthe accountability link), and should be based on thebenefit principle. Taken one step further by Bird,these principles suggest a number of major taxsources usually prescribed for subnational govern-ments, \"more or less in order of preference\u2014usercharges, property taxes, excises, personal incometaxes, payroll taxes, general sales taxes, and businesstaxes\" (Bird 2003b ,4-5). The following sections address each of these options. Autonomy and Policy The decentralization literature can be surprisingly unclear about the fundamental question of whatconstitutes a subnational tax. However, if terminol-ogy is not clear as to what constitutes subnationalown-source revenue, policymakers will not havethe conceptual tools needed to design fiscal systemsand appreciate their consequences. Such a situationwill also obfuscate debate over the policy changes needed to allow a jurisdiction to realize the effi-ciency benefits promised by decentralization. Subnational revenues may be divided into cate- gories of decreasing local autonomy (see table 6.2).TABLE 6.1 Estimated Own-Source Revenue of Subnational Governments(as percentage of total subnational government revenue) Country Percentage Cambodia (2003) /H110215 China (2003) /H110215 Indonesia (2002) 15.4Philippines (2002) 31.1Thailand (2002) 10.9Vietnam (2003) /H110215 Sources: Indonesia (Ministry of Finance), Philippines (Department of Finance), and Thailand (World Bank 2004c).

Figures include only official, legal revenues.Subnational Own-Source Revenue: Getting Policy and Administration Right 109 If subnational governments have total or significant control over a tax, fee, or charge, as shown by con-trol over the tax rate (that is, if it is necessary andsufficient), it is a subnational tax. If, in contrast,subnational governments have no control over thebase and rate of a tax, as, for example, when thecentral government determines how to split rev-enues (\"tax sharing\"), it is not a subnational sourceof own-revenue. This taxonomy of taxation serves the very useful purpose of setting out the basic definition of whatis and is not a source of own-revenue. Thus, forexample, the taxonomy makes clear that although ashared tax adds to subnational budget receipts,such revenue is not \"own\" taxation. Tax sharingoccurs when the base and rate of a tax are centrallyset and then some percent is returned, typically ona derivation basis, to the \"originating locality.\" T obe an own-tax or revenue source, the subnationalunit must, at the very least, legislate the rate. More nuanced is the practice whereby a central government restricts the rate of an own-revenuesource (such as the rate ceiling). This clearly limitssubnational autonomy, and some would argue thatonce the cap is reached it fully eliminates localautonomy, as the subnational government loses itsability to raise taxes at the margin. Such rate regula-tion is particularly common in East Asia.A typical argument for rate ceilings is that they prevent local governments from doing egregiouslyinappropriate things (though ceilings may simplybe a nontransparent mechanism for central con-trol). The practice, however, counters the accounta-bility and efficiency arguments for decentraliza-tion. One might make a case for centrally imposedrate ceilings during the transitional period from centralization to decentralization, as they mightallow local governments to develop policy andadministrative capacity, but such limitationsshould be short-lived. Subnational governmentsbuild capacity by using their assigned powers. Autonomy and Administration The third dimension of revenue policy\u2014that sub- national governments must have some control overrevenue administration\u2014matters for two reasons.First, control over some aspects of revenue admin-istration is instrumental for controlling revenues atthe margin, as this allows for changes in the effec-tive tax rate (a ratio of actual tax collected com-pared with the size of the legal tax base). Localgovernments can change the effective tax rate byboosting compliance through audits and enforce-ment, or by lowering compliance costs for tax-payers through better services (such as moreTABLE 6.2 Classification of Subnational Taxes by Degree of Central vs. Local Control Local autonomy in revenue policy Limited autonomy No local autonomy Subnational government (SNG) sets tax rate and base. SNG sets tax rate only. SNG determines the tax base. SNG sets tax rate, but within centrally permissible ranges. Tax sharing, whereby central/local revenue split can change onlywith consent of SNG.

(For example, the InternationalMonetary Fund's Government FinanceStatistics includes this category as a \"local tax.\") May accompany political decentralization. Sources: Adapted from OECD 2002; Ebel and Yilmaz 2002. user-friendly tax forms and payment processing, and access to information). This dimension is relevant in all cases, especially in China and Vietnam, where subnational govern-ments collect taxes whose rates and bases are deter-mined centrally. Second, and conversely, this con-sideration suggests that subnational governmentsneed not have full control over administration tocall a tax or fee an own-source revenue. Devolvedresponsibility does not necessarily imply fullydevolved administration, especially in the contextof weak local capacity. National governments, forexample, might take responsibility for certainadministrative functions, such as assessing prop-erty, or assist local governments with core functionsrelated to information and communications tech-nology. This opens up a much-needed discussionof the appropriate division of labor betweennational and subnational jurisdictions, and of theoptions for assisting low-capacity subnational gov-ernments with revenue administration (see below). Review of Current Practice and Initial Evaluation Whereas several East Asian revenue systems rely on central controls, countries are also showing a will-ingness to review the twin features of assignmentand autonomy. This represents an important policycrossroads: if, as shown, assignment and autonomycan be reinforcing, the opportunity to combinepolitical with fiscal decentralization promises more efficient delivery of public services. The Philippines has the region's longest-running record of an explicit decentralization policy andis also the most revenue decentralized of all thefocus countries. Y et, as the Philippines example alsoattests, the decentralization sorting-out processtakes time, and even the Philippines is a \"young\"decentralizing state. The country has clear oppor-tunities for further reform. In the Philippines, primary responsibility for subnational taxation rests with provinces, munici-palities, and cities (see table 6.3). Cities are the mostautonomous: they are authorized to impose the fullset of local taxes, while provinces and municipali-ties can levy only subsets. In some cases the rev-enues collected by provinces and cities are allocatedto municipalities and barangays . The latter are also responsible for collecting miscellaneous taxes andfees and charges. But again, whereas this assignment suggests a well-designed system of revenue decentralization,the Local Government Code is not fully consistentwith the autonomy criteria (see table 6.2). The cen-tral government sets tax rate ceilings, leaving localgovernments little control over one of the mainlevers for mobilizing revenue, including the prop-erty tax, which is a large revenue generator. Thecode also fixes maximum rates for most other taxesand nominal per unit amounts (as in the case of theprofessional tax). The code further specifies that110 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 6.3 Tax Assignment by Local Government in the Philippines Revenue source Provinces Cities Municipalities Barangays Real property tax 40% of provincial 25% of collections provincial or 30% of city collections Transfer of real property tax Tax on sand, gravel, and other quarry resources 30% of provincial 40% of provincial collections collections Amusement tax 50% of provincial collections Business taxes Franchise tax Community tax 50% of collections Source: Local Government Code (R.A. 7160), 1991.local governments can adjust tax rates only once in five years, and not by more than 10 percent.3 In Indonesia, subnational governments have the authority within the framework of Law 34 of 2000on regional revenue to levy a number of importantbut minor revenue sources. The central governmentcontrols the most potentially productive localrevenues\u2014those on real estate and personal income\u2014and shares the receipt. 4Less revenue- productive taxes are assigned to the provinces(motor vehicle registration, transfer and fuel taxes,and a water user fee, all of which are shared withcities and regencies), and cities and regencies (excisetaxes on hotels, entertainment, advertisement, streetlighting, mining of selected minerals, and parking). The national government restricts this arrange- ment even further: subnational governments maynot impose surcharges on national taxes, and Law34 of 2000 sets maximum rates on those that areassigned. 5Evidence suggests that most regions already charge the maximum rate, and that somewould raise it further if allowed to do so.For example,the widely assessed hotel and restaurant rate is lim-ited to 10 percent, yet a World Bank report concludesthat some jurisdictions (such as Bali and Jakarta)could gain from rate increases (World Bank 2003a). China overhauled its subnational revenue sys- tem under the 1994 Tax Sharing System reform.The tax structure now includes three tiers of taxes:those fully accruing to the national government,those shared between the national and subnationalgovernments, and those fully accruing to subna-tional units. Allowable subnational own-sourcerevenues include the urban land use tax, for whichthe local government can set the rate up to a ceiling;local option entertainment and slaughterhousetaxes; and a local option surtax on collective enter-prises, for which the subnational government caninfluence the rate (Bahl 1999). Revenues in Thailand are national, local, or shared. Shared taxes include the value-added taxand sales tax, the special business tax, the naturalresource tax, excise taxes, and the vehicle tax, all ofwhich accrue to local governments. Own-taxationis limited to the house and land tax, land develop-ment tax, signboard tax, petrol tax, tobacco tax, andhotel tax. Local governments may also collect userfees, charges, permits, license fees, and fines. Cambodia is still at an early stage of decentral- ization: it has not yet assigned functions or rev-enues to communes. However, communes and sangkats (urban communes) may collect four types of own-revenue. These include administrative feesfor civil registry functions, agency fees for functionsperformed on behalf of line ministries and others,contributions to development projects to meet thematching requirement imposed by transfers fromthe Commune Sangkat Fund, and user fees and charges to cover the recurrent costs of providingservices (UNCDF 2004). Data on actual collec-tions are not available, but the amounts are thoughtto be quite small. Provinces\u2014deconcentrated levelsof the national government\u2014may also own-revenues, which accrue to governors' budgets (theSalakhet ). 6These revenues, which are not proper own-source revenues, accounted for 48 percent ofthe total Salakhet , of which the tax on motor vehi- cles (17.4 percent), the excise on public lighting(12.3 percent), the wealth transfer tax (7.0 percent),and the business tax (6.8 percent) are the mostsignificant (World Bank 2003b). Vietnam, as a transitional country, reveals some similarities with China. The Law on State Budget,which took effect in January 2004, establishesthree types of revenue assignments. These includerevenues assigned completely to the central level,those assigned completely to the local level, andthose shared between the central and subnationalgovernments. Shared revenues\u2014which includethe value-added tax, enterprise (corporate) incometax, personal income tax, special consumptiontaxes, and gasoline and oil fees, among others\u2014constitute the bulk of revenues at all levels. Own-source revenues are virtually nonexistent inVietnam. The only exception is user fees, such asroad tolls and select fees for schools and hospitals,which are not generally significant sources ofrevenue (World Bank 2000). Own-Source Revenue Practices and Options Revenue assignment in East Asia is consistent with the framework's principles and guidelines in someways and inconsistent in others. The next sectionfurther highlights specific regional practices foreach revenue source. This discussion serves to stressthat a well-designed subnational revenue systemshould rely on a mix of taxes, and also suggests fur-ther options for reform.Subnational Own-Source Revenue: Getting Policy and Administration Right 111112 East Asia Decentralizes As table 6.4 reveals, there is no own-source revenue common to all six countries, though anumber of countries make use of user fees andcharge business taxes, excise taxes, and propertytaxes. As admirable as the user charge and propertytax package is, international experience has shownthat such taxes can be both difficult to implementand unlikely to provide an adequate fiscal base ifsubnational governments have major social spend-ing responsibilities (Bird 2003b). Accordingly,several options are available to further mobilizeown-source revenues. Property T axation Given the role of property taxes as revenue genera- tors in the developing world, the fact that the prop-erty tax is not an own-revenue source in many coun-tries raises concerns about sustainable revenueflows, subnational autonomy, and thus the promisedbenefits of decentralization. In the 1990s, propertytaxes accounted for 40 percent of all subnationaltaxes in developing countries, but only 12 percent intransition countries (Bird and Slack 2002). Exceptfor the Philippines and Indonesia, East Asian coun-tries do not come close to the benchmarks of eitherdeveloping or transition countries, suggesting thatproperty taxes could yet serve as a greater source ofrevenue in the medium term, and an importantsource in the longer term. Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia diverge the most from international practice. Vietnam has noproperty tax in the modern sense of the term. Thecountry does have taxes on land and housing, landrent, and transfers of land use rights, but local gov-ernments have little or no control over these taxes.Thailand imposes land taxes, but they account foronly about 5 percent of subnational resources, andsubnational governments lack authority over theirrates and bases. Cambodia's land taxes are insignif-icant in revenue terms. China has multiple taxes on property, often on the same base, which do not rest on market orupdated property assessments. Thus, these taxes donot deliver on their revenue potential. Y et unlike inVietnam, local governments can set the tax rate onurban land use subject to legislated maximums andminimums (larger cities can set higher rates, forexample). In fact, the tax on urban land use is oneof only a small set of own-source revenues inChina. The tax base is the physical land area, notthe market value, as the country has no formal market for land transactions. Indonesia provides another important example of limited local autonomy over the property tax.Subnational governments are not responsible fortaxing property (or property transfers). While thecentral government shares about 80 percent of prop-erty tax revenues with the originating region, anddistributes another 10 percent among all regions,policy and administration are firmly in centralhands. This has led to two negative developments: areliance on taxes that essentially substitute for prop-erty taxes, such as the street lighting tax; and theproliferation of nonbenefit taxes\u2014user charges andservice fees not linked to the provision of services. The Philippines is the only country where a traditional property tax is a source of subnationalown-revenue. The property tax accounts for nearly37 percent of subnational own-revenues. However,the central government limits control over taxrates and bases. For example, the national govern-ment sets the real property tax rate (includingthe Special Education Fund levy) at 2 percent forprovinces and 3 percent for cities and municipali-ties in metropolitan Manila. All provinces outsidethe capital region avail themselves of the maximumrate, while most cities are under the maximum. 7 International experience suggests that subna- tional governments are likely to use discretion overproperty tax rates, so they vary widely. Bird andSlack report, for example, that the effective rateof property tax in the United States ranges from0.4 percent to 2.9 percent for residential propertyand 0.7 percent to 6.0 percent for commercialproperty (Bird and Slack 2002). Property tax reform can offer a source of rev- enue, perhaps modest in transition countries, and asource of autonomy and accountability across theregion. Rationalizing land taxation in Vietnam\u2014and moving toward a modern property tax withsome local discretion over rates and introducingmodest property taxes in Cambodia\u2014would befirst steps in those countries. Devolving authorityover rates in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, andThailand is also a reform option. Business T axation Some analysts regard business taxes as a potentially inefficient means of raising revenue. Often levied athigh rates, these taxes can distort firms' investmentSubnational Own-Source Revenue: Getting Policy and Administration Right 113 TABLE 6.4 Own-Source Revenue Assignment Cambodia China Indonesia Philippines Thailand Vietnam User charges?

These taxes might also serve as barriers to new firms and theexpansion of small ones. On the other hand, businesstaxes are potentially large revenue generators andmore elastic than other traditional subnational taxes(such as the property tax), although they may also bemore distortionary. Business taxes can be justifiedaccording to the benefit principle: firms are consum-ing benefits provided by subnational governmentsand thus should be charged for them. This principle offers a rationale for differenti- ated business taxes at local and regional levels, suchas user charges along with some form of businesslicensing tax, and perhaps a low-rate tax on grossreceipts, either in place of or in addition to thoseoptions. At the regional level, the benefit caseargues for a broad-based levy that remains neutraltoward the factor mix, such as a value-addedincome tax or a business value tax (both options fortaxing value-added income). One further option isto levy both a payroll tax and a tax on capital. Pay-roll taxes are easy to administer and productive atlow rates. However, they can act as a barrier toemployment in the formal sector\u2014a concern thatmight outweigh their benefits in economies strug-gling to boost rates of formal employment. Table 6.4 shows that China and the Philippines have formal business taxes, which are major sub-national revenue generators. The business tax inChina\u2014levied on gross receipts not subject to thevalue-added tax\u2014covers a wide range of sectors,including transportation, communications, andconstruction, and accounts for a large share ofprovincial tax revenues (22.6 percent, on average, in2001). The business tax in the Philippines is similar,in that it is also levied on gross sales and accountsfor a significant share of local revenues (29.8 percent,on average, in 2002, including business licenses).Giving subnational governments in China and thePhilippines control over rate setting could be bothrevenue-productive and autonomy-enhancing. Cambodia and Indonesia do not have local busi- ness taxes per se. Indonesia relies on taxes on specificsectors, including hotels, restaurants, and advertis-ing. A growing number of subnational governmentsin Indonesia are also taxing specific sectors, mimick-ing business taxes. There is concern that the prolifer-ation of these taxes will result in distortions andinefficiencies at the local level. This suggests theneed to rationalize the taxes imposed on businessesto minimize distortions, such as by introducing asimple low-rate, broad-based \"single business tax\" to replace sectoral and \"nuisance\" levies and fees. 8 Cambodian provinces levy business licenses, thoughit might be more appropriate to transfer businesslicensing to the commune level and introduce astandard business tax at the provincial level. Personal Income T axation No country in the region makes use of personal income taxes as a source of subnational own-revenue. China, Indonesia, and Vietnam use suchtaxes as shared revenues, however. Such taxes wouldthus appear to be a potential new source of revenuefor Cambodia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Allow-ing regional (provincial) governments to piggybacktaxes on national personal income taxes is an impor-tant option for boosting local revenues, and poten-tially for increasing autonomy. This assumes thatsubnational governments could set the rates,and thatthe central government would administer the tax toavoid burdening local administrative capacity. 9 User Fees and Charges Official use of charges and fees is widespread in the region.10In Thailand, subnational governments levy user charges on garbage collection, public util-ities, mass transportation, and medical and child-care. The Philippines has more than 33 differenttypes of user fees and charges, ranging from animaland civil registration to garbage collection fees.T otal collections from each major source are rela-tively small, reflecting the dispersion of revenuesources (see table 6.5). Moreover, a large number offees and user charges together generate less than0.10 percent of the total operating and miscella-neous revenue of subnational governments. It isimportant to note, however, that the main eco-nomic rationale for levying user charges is topromote efficient use of public resources throughthe pricing mechanism, not necessarily to raiserevenue. Still, eliminating these extremely low-yield fees would reduce the administrative andcompliance costs arising from the complexity of thesystem. In Indonesia, the most significant provincial collections from user fees come from charges forhealth services. Collections from charges for build-ing licenses are second in importance. At the city anddistrict level, 62 percent of fee revenue comes frompublic service fees, 23 percent from licensing fees,114 East Asia DecentralizesSubnational Own-Source Revenue: Getting Policy and Administration Right 115 TABLE 6.5 Highest-Yield Fees and Sources of Operating Revenues of Subnational Governments in the Philippines, 2000 (pesos) Pesos % of total Market receipts 1,568,806,000 15 Electrical light and power fees 738,108,000 and miscellaneous revenue 10,218,000,000 100 Source: COA 2001.

All other provincial and local charges together contribute avery small percentage of total revenue. In fact,provinces levy 14 charges that generate less than1 percent of charge revenues, and local governmentslevy at least 30 such charges (with at least 93 differentlocal charges throughout the country in 2002). Many of these low-yielding fees are levied on businesses,creating a heavy administrative burden and sug-gesting the need for rationalization (see table 6.6). Bird and Tsiopoulos sum up the challenge of user charges as ensuring \"that the right prices arecharged for the right services\" (1997, 33). They also argue that central governments need to provideguidance\u2014perhaps in the form of an overarchinglegal framework\u2014to subnational governments oncreating and managing user charges. Elements ofsuch a framework include clear and transparentparameters for setting prices and a process for con-sulting with local stakeholders. National govern-ments in countries with a particular concern in thisarea, such as China, Indonesia, and Vietnam, mightbe warranted in intervening\u2014at least in the nearterm\u2014with lists of allowable or prohibited charges. Excise T axes East Asian countries are split on excise taxes. The Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam do not usemajor excises, which suggests another reform optionfor these countries. 11Allowing local governments to impose excise taxes or fees on motor vehicle regis-tration would give those governments an appropri-ate and potentially important source of revenue thatwould be relatively easy to administer. 12 Significant Others: Fees, Other Taxes, Charges, and the Problemof Illegal Proliferation Illegal Activities Lack of control over tax policy has encouraged local governments to seek other tax and nontax sourcesof revenue. In a number of East Asian countries,local governments have the authority to enact newtaxes and fees, though their authority is regulatedby law, and in some countries is subject to reviewby the central government. Central control hasencouraged local governments to become entrepre-neurial, with both positive and negative results. InChina, this situation has led to the proliferation of\"illegal\" extrabudgetary fees, some of which havedistortionary effects. Indonesia has seen the prolif-eration of nuisance taxes, which collect very little inrevenue yet impose high administrative costs onlocal governments and compliance costs on taxpay-ers. In the Philippines, local revenue codes yield atax system of great complexity, with a resulting lossof transparency and ability to monitor the system.Some subnational governments are avoiding col-lecting legal taxes and others are collecting \"illegal\"taxes, undermining the integrity of local gover-nance and thus public support.The Chinese case is particularly acute given the large number of \"unofficial\" charges. Because of alack of autonomy, local governments have resortedto introducing fees not permitted by law, and theserepresent a significant percentage of local budg-ets. 13The fees include surcharges on household utility bills, hospitals and school charges, roadmaintenance, advertisement, vehicle purchases andothers (World Bank 2002). While these fees mayintroduce distortions and raise compliance costsimposed on taxpayers, the World Bank has arguedthat \"fears of run-away local governments arbitrar-ily creating a jungle of local fees and charges do notappear to be justified.\" Y et the growth of extrabud-getary financing among local governments hasbecome a serious concern. The World Bank esti-mates that extrabudgetary funds and off-budgetactivities may represent 18 to 22 percent of grossdomestic product (GDP) (World Bank 2002). The Chinese government has had a policy of converting informal fees into official taxes, but itis implementing this policy unevenly. In Gansuprovince, for example, provincial officials report-edly approve all local fees at the prefecture, county,and township levels. But no one knows the extentto which local governments are staying ahead ofprovincial authorities by implementing new fees. Similarly, Cambodia has had serious concerns about the proliferation of \"informal\" fees andcharges at the commune/ sangkat level. In fact, this proliferation seems to be impeding developmentof a system of own-source revenues for newlyelected subnational governments. Evaluations ofexisting practices have been only exploratory, butthere are reports of birth registration fees being\"unofficially inflated\" from US$0.10 to US$10(UNCDF 2003). In China, fees and charges undermine the tax system because they are not officially on the books.In the Philippines, a similar argument can bemade\u2014but with a variation. In the Philippines,numerous fees and charges on the books under-mine the system because they are either not col-lected, or are not collected in accordance with therevenue code. In the city of Bacolod, for example,the mayor's business permit fee has more than 200different rates, which vary by type of establishment.This complexity adds greatly to administrativecosts. Thus, putting revenues on the books andlegalizing them does not necessarily solve the116 East Asia Decentralizesproblem or eliminate the need to develop the local capacity to manage user charges. Overall, the proliferation of illegal, extrabud- getary revenues raises concerns about efficiencylosses stemming from distortions and relatively highadministrative (and possibly compliance) costs. Atthe same time, citizens of some localities may bewilling to pay for off-budget services from localgovernments (in these cases, efficiency losses wouldpresumably be lower). Some subnational govern-ments collect these off-budget sources in responseto limited autonomy, so the practice is somewhatunderstandable, if not justifiable. However, theselevies can undermine public trust in the tax system,which cannot be good for long-term compliance. Apolicy of reviewing and converting illegal fees intoofficial ones, as in China, is warranted. Open Lists One of the issues around the use and abuse of user charges is the authority to enact new levies. In boththe Philippines and Indonesia, local governmentshave formal authority to introduce some new taxesand fees. In the Philippines, the Local GovernmentCode provides a range of tax and fee options forlocal governments, though the country should con-sider more options.The code gives local governmentsthe option to levy other taxes, fees, and charges, pro-vided that the code does not specifically prohibitthem and the National Internal Revenue code doesnot already include them. 14That all makes sense within the framework established above. But what isproblematic is if subnational governments abusethis \"open list\" approach by levying taxes and fees ina nontransparent, illegal manner. Monitoring andenforcement of tax law matter. In Indonesia, besides formally assigned taxes, Law 34 of 2000 allows cities and regencies to levyadditional taxes if they follow a number of generalcriteria. 15T o ensure that governments meet these criteria, the central government requires them tosubmit regional regulations to the Ministry ofHome Affairs for review. If the ministry, in consul-tation with the Ministry of Finance, finds that a taxviolates legal provisions, the ministry may cancelthe regulation, in which case the local governmentmust rescind the tax. 16 As noted, the \"open list\" approach has its merits. However, countries might not want to seize on it as amajor reform option for at least two reasons. First, the positive list of taxes provided in Indonesia(Law 34 of 2000) does not include any taxes that cangenerate significant revenue. This prompts manysubnational governments to introduce taxes that donot necessarily generate much revenue either, as away to assert their autonomy. As a result, nuisancetaxes and charges abound. The Ministry of Financefound that more than 200 regulations submitted tothe central government between August 2001 andJanuary 2003 violated Law 34. Many are levied on agriculture, mining, and interregional trade. InLombok, for instance, three local governmentsjointly impose a 5 percent tax on 174 productsleaving the island (Ray 2003). Thus, the problemin Indonesia is not the open list itself but the factthat it does not include appropriate broad-basedtaxes. Second, the review mechanism does not seem to work very well without adequate monitoring. Forexample, Lewis estimates that subnational govern-ments send just 40 percent of all regional tax- andcharge-related regulations to the Ministry of HomeAffairs for review, so many potentially harmfultaxes and charges remain in effect (Lewis 2003). Revenue Assignment between Subnational Levels Revenue assignment between local governments in East Asia often seems to create incentive problems.These occur between provinces and subprovinciallevels in China and Vietnam; between provinces,cities and municipalities, and barangays in the Philippines; and between provinces, cities andregencies, and villages in Indonesia. In China andVietnam, the lack of formal revenue assignmentcreates unpredictability and reduces accountability.In the Philippines and Indonesia, the transfer ofsignificant shares of collections from province tosubprovincial levels may reduce provincial incen-tives for collecting own-revenue. In China, provincial governments may assign revenues to local governments within their jurisdic-tion (see box 6.1). Most, if not all, provinces seem tofollow the traditional hierarchical approach, assign-ing revenue between the province and the first layerof local government (cities and prefectures), andleaving each layer to work out arrangements withthe one below it. As mentioned, while the lack ofSubnational Own-Source Revenue: Getting Policy and Administration Right 117formal assignment may have some advantages for provinces, the disadvantage for subprovincialgovernments in terms of uncertainty would seem tooutweigh the potential advantages. Revenue Performance Own-source revenues in Indonesia and the Philippines have risen in nominal (and real) terms,but have not fared as well as a percentage of GNP .In the Philippines, own-source revenues rose sig-nificantly right after decentralization, but havebeen stagnant as a percentage of GNP\u2014at 0.91 in2001\u2014ever since. In Indonesia, own-source rev-enues rose from 1.1 percent of GNP in 1995 to1.4 percent in 2002. In China, in contrast, localtaxes, which are predominantly shared revenues asopposed to own-source revenues (in fact, officialown-source revenues are minimal), grew signifi-cantly as a percentage of GNP since the Tax SharingSystem reform, from 5.0 percent in 1994 to 7.0 per-cent in 1999. Moreover, estimates of buoyancy inthe post-reform period \u2014a measure of revenue pro- ductivity as a result of economic growth\u2014showthat it is quite high. 17Overall, these results indicatethat despite policy, administrative, and political challenges, own-source collection shows some pos-itive signs, which augurs well for the future. However, in most cases, own-source revenues compose a small percentage of total subnationalrevenue and their share has either not improvedmuch or has actually declined. This means thatsubnational governments have not reduced theirdependence on central government transfers.The next sections analyze that result for severalcountries. Composition of Own-Source Revenues From 1992 to 2002, own-source revenues in the Philippines composed 34 percent, on average, oftotal resources available to local governments.However, own-source revenues declined from 38 per- cent in 1992 to 31 percent in 2002. Thus, theserevenues,although nominally growing,have not keptup with the growth in transfers from the centralgovernment (the Internal Revenue Allotment). In the Philippines, as in numerous developing countries, property taxes account for the largestsingle component of local revenues. In 2002, the118 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 6.1 Revenue Assignment across Subnational Governments in China's Gansu Province Gansu province is centralized, in that the provin- cial level retains a relatively large share of alllocal taxes and rebates. For example, theprovince retains the entire amount of the value-added tax shared with subnational governments(that is, 25 percent of total national collections).A number of important features characterizesubprovincial revenue assignment: Revenues from the enterprise income tax and the value-added tax are allocated to the levelof government that \"owns\" the enterprise. The city maintenance tax is shared 30 per- cent with the province and 70 percent withprefectures and cities. The resource tax is shared 70 percent with the province and 30 percent with prefecturesand cities. The urban land tax is shared 40 percent with provinces and 60 percent with prefecturesand cities. For all other local taxes, prefectures and cities have full discretion over sharingarrangements. For certain local taxes, counties have full dis- cretion over sharing arrangements withtowns and township governments. Thesetaxes include the farmland occupation tax,the land appreciation tax, the housing prop-erty tax, the vehicle license tax, and animalhusbandry charges. Given discretion at each level of government, a variety of other arrangements exist. Forexample, in some counties the prefecturegovernment received a share of the countyvalue-added tax despite the provincial rulethat allocates the tax by ownership. Source: World Bank 2002, pp. 57-58.real property tax accounted for 36.5 percent of sub- national own-source revenues, while business taxesand licenses accounted for nearly 30 percent, andoperating and miscellaneous revenue accounted for22 percent (see table 6.7). 18These percentages have remained stable over time. In Indonesia, own-source revenues accounted for about 39 percent of total revenue at the provin-cial level, but only 7 percent at the city and regencylevel (see table 6.8). Moreover, the percentage ofown-source revenues to total revenue at the cityand regency level declined from 12 percent to 9 per- cent from 1995 to 2000, and dropped further to6 percent in 2001, after decentralization. Transfersrose in relative importance over the same period,from 84 percent to 87 percent of total revenues. Trends in Own-Source Revenues Both the Philippines and Indonesia show a clear trend: own-source revenues have risen slowlybut steadily.

Note: Figures are projections based on data for 28 provinces (including Jakarta) and 324 cities and regencies.collections have grown steadily in all major cate- gories: property taxes increased nearly fourfoldfrom 1993 to 2000 ,while taxes on goods and serv- ices rose fivefold. Taxes on goods and servicesrecorded the highest average annual increase,followed by the property tax. Growth rates for allcategories slowed during the latter part of theperiod. In Indonesia, decentralization spurred a 40 per- cent nominal rise in local own-source revenuesbetween fiscal years 2000 and 2001. 19While rev- enues from taxes and charges grew by 21 percentand 32 percent, respectively, the largest increaseoccurred in the category of \"other,\" which rose by155 percent (see table 6.9). In 2001, locally raisedtaxes contributed 43 percent of own-source rev-enues, while charges raised 33 percent and the shareof \"other\" revenues grew to 21 percent. Between 2000 and 2001, provincial tax revenue more than doubled in Indonesia. Several factorsmay explain this sudden jump. One factor seems tobe that provinces received additional taxing powersunder Law 34 of 2000 (even though the law abol-ished some nuisance taxes). Another factor is thattax collections, especially from the vehicle transfertax, rose considerably. Third, changes in revenue-sharing arrangements may have created strongerincentives for provincial governments to increasecollections. Fuel and motor vehicle-related taxation domi- nate provincial own-source revenues in Indonesia.Provinces also appear to levy taxes that are formallyassigned to local governments, such as the hoteland restaurant tax and the street lighting tax.Despite their insignificant expenditure respon-sibilities, provinces raise almost twice the own-source revenues as cities and regencies. In 2001, forexample, revenues from local taxes and chargeswere less than half those from provincial taxes and charges. Street lighting and hotel and restaurant taxes account for over two-thirds of own-source collec-tions among cities and regencies. \"Other\" taxes\u2014which most likely include a large number of nui-sance taxes that local governments have introducedsince Law 34 of 2000\u2014represent only 6 percent oftax revenue, indicating that the new taxes do notgenerate significant additional revenue. Own-Source Revenue Administration Arrangements for tax administration vary through- out the region, ranging from highly decentralizedin the Philippines to highly centralized in Vietnam,with Indonesia and China between these twopoles. Y et in all cases the relative roles of local andnational governments have not been well designed,resulting in both capacity and incentive challenges.The Philippines, for example, is highly decentral-ized with respect to tax administration. The Bureauof Internal Revenue (BIR) administers nationaltaxes, while each local government administers itsown-source revenues according to the LocalGovernment Code and local revenue codes. More-over, the law provides for little formal cooperation:the BIR operates independently of local tax admin-istrations, and the national government provideslittle support to local governments. 20Meanwhile, local tax administrations usually operate independ-ently of one another. At the other extreme is Vietnam. The General Taxation Department\u2014operating under theMinistry of Finance, with offices at the provincialand district levels\u2014is responsible for collectingall internal revenues. Local governments have no120 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 6.9 Annual Nominal Growth in Local Own-Source Revenue in Indonesia, 1996-2002 (percent) Annual increase 1995/1996 1996/1997 1997/1998 1998/1999 1999/2000 2001 2002 Regional tax 31 22 20 48 26 21 23 Regional charges 18 14 11 /H1100212 20 32 32 Profits\u2014enterprises 18 33 /H1100222 0 2 6 1 0 8 9 Other 40 0 15 75 /H110021 155 93 Total 24 16 14 20 20 40 42 Source: BPS and Ministry of Finance.tax administrative responsibilities. However, tax administrators operate under a system of dual sub-ordination, in that they are responsible to theirministerial management as well as to representativesof local governments. 21Thus, the system is charac- terized by built-in tensions. Mart\u00ednez-V\u00e1zqueznotes that administrative centralization may reduceincentives for revenue collection, as central officialshave fewer incentives to collect local revenues com-pared with local administrators, who would havegreater incentives to collect local revenues .On the other hand, he notes, provincial authoritieshave been known to pay bonuses to tax adminis-trators who improve their collection performance(Mart\u00ednez-V\u00e1zquez 2003). In this sense, subnationalgovernments have some administrative control atthe margin. In Indonesia and China, the central government administers all shared taxes, while local govern-ments administer revenues assigned to them. InIndonesia, local revenue agencies administer thetaxes for which they are responsible, with littlesupport from the central government. As in thePhilippines, the result is that administrative capac-ity and collection costs vary widely by locality.China's Tax Sharing System reforms of 1994 cre-ated two separate tax administrations\u2014one at thenational level to administer national and shared revenues, and a provincial tax administrationtasked with all subnational revenues. According tothe World Bank, \"de facto dual subordination\" ofcentral tax administrators to local governments isstill a problem, owing to old allegiances and the factthat local governments provide bonuses and assesspenalties to stimulate collection, thus creatingpotential conflicts of interest (World Bank 2002). Local Revenue Administration: Models and Options Tax administration can also be assessed from the perspectives of autonomy and efficiency. Vehornand Ahmad (1997) offer four models for taxadministration in decentralized polities. Theseinclude central tax administration with revenuesharing, central tax administration with assignmentof taxing powers to different levels of government,multilevel administration with revenue sharing,and self-administration by each level of govern-ment. Mikesell (2002) stresses another dimension:the extent to which national and subnationalauthorities cooperate or operate independently.Table 6.10 reveals a great deal of diversity in theregion on the administrative side, with transition Subnational Own-Source Revenue: Getting Policy and Administration Right 121 TABLE 6.10 Tax Administration Models in East Asia Models Countries Observations Central administration with Vietnam Highly centralized, but dual tax sharing Cambodia subordination of tax administrators gives SNGs some control at the margin.

Guidance from the literature on good practice in tax administration in decentralized contexts is lessclear. No consensus has developed on the principlesof devolved administration. The efficiency criterion would argue for reducing total administrative and compliance costs by takingadvantage of economies of scale and scope. ThePhilippines, for example, includes hundreds ofsmall-scale tax administrations collecting revenuesthroughout the country. Their ability to attract andretain qualified personnel is limited, as is theiraccess to information technology. This limitedcapacity has direct consequences for taxpayers interms of higher compliance costs. Variations in local capacity also mean that taxpayers do not receiveuniform treatment throughout the country. The key question is whether it is possible to cen- tralize some administrative functions to reducecosts while not curtailing local autonomy. That is,to what extent is local tax administration a sine qua non of autonomous local governance? One couldargue that since some functions of tax administra-tion effectively control marginal revenues, subna-tional governments must have control over thesefunctions in order to have\u2014by definition\u2014own-source revenues. Looking at administration as abundled set of functions rather than a homoge-neous process allows one to think about differentialtreatment of administrative functions. For exam-ple, the level of enforcement activity will have adirect bearing on the level of tax arrears collections.Thus, a subnational government that controlsenforcement activities would be able to increaserevenues at the margin. The same holds for tax-payer registries, which can be managed more or lessaggressively, and taxpayer services. The argument isless true for other functions. Take property valua-tion. If valuation relies on market methods, there isnot much scope for differences in implementation.The point is that administrative as well as policylevers can affect marginal revenues (though someadministrative effects might be quite small). Local governments do not, in theory, need to control all tax functions directly if they control theadministration of those functions. The law requirestax administrators, as bureaucrats, to do as theirpolitical principals say. One definition of a good taxadministration is one that simply follows the tax code, leaving aside the question of whether the lawis good policy. In the Philippines, bureaucrats areemployees of the local government and thereforeagents of local executives. But bureaucratic agentsof higher-level governments could also be responsi-ble to the local chief executive. The point is that taxadministrators do not need to be local governmentemployees to ensure accountability to local govern-ments. Devolved responsibility does not necessarilyimply devolved administration, especially in thecontext of weak local capacity. A number of options would preserve local auton- omy while improving efficiency. These options neednot be universal for all subnational governments ina given country. Rather, subnational governmentscould consider the options on a case-by-case basis,which would imply asymmetrical treatment.Depending on local conditions, asymmetry mightmake sense, and would likely generate useful pilotsfor more comprehensive reforms. A similar approach would encourage local gov- ernments with greater capacity to perform, for afee, some functions for other local governmentswith less capacity. That occurs with Lima's TaxAdministration Service, which collects propertytaxes for two other Peruvian municipalities (Ateand La Victoria) for a 5 percent commission. Thecritical issue is whether subnational governmentswould control administration at the margin. Another option would be to establish a tax agency that would assist local governments\u2014on acase-by-case basis, for a fee\u2014with core administra-tive functions: registration, collection, and compli-ance. Such a subnational tax agency would alloweconomies of scale and scope, which could loweradministrative and compliance costs. At presentthere are no known examples of this approach. Y et another approach is for the national govern- ment to take responsibility for functions such asproperty assessment, or to help local governmentswith core functions. National governments assistwith core functions in many countries. In Colombia,the central government maintains the property reg-ister and updates property valuations. In Cyprus,Estonia, Jamaica, Malawi, and Pakistan, the centralgovernment is responsible for assessing propertyand collecting taxes, even though property taxes areassigned to local governments (Vehorn and Ahmad1997; McCluskey and Williams 1999, cited in 122 East Asia DecentralizesMikesell 2002).22T o add a dynamic element to this approach, one could envision local governmentsprogressively taking over more functions as theydevelop capacity in these specialized areas. All localgovernments would not necessarily perform all taxadministration functions, as some undoubtedlymake more sense administered centrally. Some East Asian countries have already taken advantage of economies of scale and scope. Respon-sibilities for administration vary among subnationallevels of government, with larger jurisdictionallevels having some responsibility for collections forsmaller jurisdictions in many countries. For exam- ple, in Indonesia and the Philippines, provinces col-lect and transfer some revenues to lower levels. Thisoption\u2014provided that higher jurisdictions aregiven adequate incentives\u2014is worth exploring as away to rationalize administrative arrangementsbetween national and subnational governments, andbetween subnational governments themselves. Though there are some success strories in the region (see, for example, box 6.2), the administra-tive capacity of subnational governments is weakin many cases, and is the binding constraint on Subnational Own-Source Revenue: Getting Policy and Administration Right 123 BOX 6.2 Improving Tax Administration in Quezon City, Philippines Quezon City\u2014the largest city in metropolitan Manila in land area and population\u2014faced a seri-ous budget deficit in 2001. The administration ofMayor Feliciano Belmonte, Jr., who assumed officein July 2001, inherited outstanding obligations ofP=1.4 billion and bank debt of P =1.2 billion. The city decided to improve its revenue collection. The mayor's first step was to convene a search committee, headed by the dean of the College ofPublic Administration of the University of thePhilippines, to recommend candidates for treas-urer. The mayor settled on Dr. Victor Endriga, whoquickly implemented reforms over the next 18months designed to reverse the city's fiscal course.Treasurer Endriga adopted a \"carrot-and-stickapproach.\" The \"sticks\" include the following: Property auctions for delinquent property taxpayers. The city conducted three auctionsin 2002\u2014the first postcode auctions inQuezon City. (Although delinquent taxpayershave sued the city, they do not phase thetreasurer: \"it's part of the game.\") Delinquency letters sent to recover the esti- mated P =10.7 billion owed the city. (Each staff member must send out at least 20 lettersdaily, as staff had sent few before.) The use of presumptive minimum levels of gross sales for the business tax and for markets. A requirement that all business establish- ments with gross receipts over P =500,000 sub- mit their previous year's financial statement,as well as information on monthly tax pay-ments from the Bureau of Internal Revenue. A requirement that all payments of real estate taxes include confirmation of payment ofother taxes, including the business tax and mayor's permit fees. Direct withholding of taxes from city contrac- tors and suppliers, which rose from 12 per-cent to 75 percent of gross collections. The \"carrots\" include the following: An increase in the discount on early payment of property taxes, from 10 percent to 20 per-cent for annual payers, and from 5 percent to10 percent for quarterly payers. Improved taxpayer facilities, including mod- ern air-conditioned lounges with automaticqueuing systems, free coffee and tea, freelocal telephone calls, and televisions. Plaques from the mayor presented in a public ceremony to the 10 most \"outstanding\"taxpayers. The city also computerized its property and busi- ness tax registries and collection processes, hiredan outside firm to input all paper records, insti-tuted new security features, raised tax rates, andreassigned employees within the treasurer'soffice to avoid familiarization. The city nowrewards (such as with overseas trips) and pun-ishes revenue examiners based on actual collec-tions, and conducts house visits of delinquenttaxpayers. This reform program has paid off. Own- source revenues rose from P =2.3 billion in 2001 to P=3.9 billion in 2002, and the city closed the year with a surplus of P =0.5 billion.

The principalproblems include the following: The prevalence of stop filers, nonfilers, and late filers, owing to low local capacity to register tax-payers. This results in delinquent payments andthe accumulation of arrears, especially in thePhilippines. Infrequent audit and enforcement (temporary closures and property auctions), resulting in lowcompliance. This seems to be a problem in bothIndonesia and the Philippines. The limited availability of taxpayer services, although some local governments in Indonesiaand the Philippines offer important examples ofgood practice. The low professional qualifications of staff in all three countries. Inadequate support from and coordination with the national government. Overall, the East Asian experience suggests that the multilevel administration model (with tax shar-ing) may hold the most short-term promise. Theadvantage of this model is the possibility that dif-ferent levels of administration could assume differ-ent functions, and it could also facilitate assistanceto subnational governments. Assigning complextasks with economies of scale (such as property val-uation) to either a central government agency or anagency dedicated to subnational support wouldreduce administrative costs and likely improveservice quality. East Asian countries could furtherexplore the idea of a subnational tax supportagency, funded by subnational governments andunder their control. Other solutions, such as forsubnational governments to contract out to otherlocal governments or piggyback on national taxes,are also worth consideration. The Politics of Local T axation While policy and administrative constraints on local taxation are critical, political constraints also affectperformance. Several local governments in thePhilippines, for example, reported that \"politicalintervention\"underlay their limited use of the powerto auction or close businesses. Other governmentsreported that instead of confrontation, mayors used their \"charisma\" to persuade businesspeople to paytaxes. One government reported active oppositionfrom the chamber of commerce to the GeneralRevision of Assessment, and another reportedintense lobbying from the private sector againstincreases in tax rates, which resulted in compromise.Other localities report that businesses have takenlegal action against property auctions and taxincreases. Taxpayers sued Quezon City, for example,over \"confiscatory\" tax rates. While no one knows the precise impact of political constraints on local taxation, a numberof hypotheses\u2014focusing on incentives\u2014may beposited. One possibility is that politicians simplyweigh the net impact, or political tradeoff, of higherrevenues against greater expenditures. Simply put,officials decide to increase taxes (either throughhigher rates or better administration) when the dis-counted benefits of greater expenditures are higherthan the discounted costs of higher taxes. Manyofficials seem to decide that the political costs ofhigher taxation are greater than the expected bene-fits. There are several possible reasons. First, theexpected marginal benefit is small compared withthe political cost of unhappy constituents. Ineffi-ciencies in delivering services (such as patronage orpadded projects) might also outweigh the impactof greater revenues, \"wasting\" the tax increase. Another possibility is that the incidence of benefits and costs\u2014in terms of expenditures andrevenues\u2014might undercut local elites. Increasesin property tax collections would most likely harmthe wealthy from a distributive standpoint, whileincreases in service delivery would most likely favorlower-income groups. However, politicians maynot weigh these impacts equally, and may be reluc-tant to use higher tax collections to fund pro-poorservice delivery. Other explanations focus on the timing of bene- fits and costs, the extent of executive control overspending, and the electoral strength of the incum-bent. T erm limits on local executives\u2014whichlimit them to two terms of three years each in thePhilippines, for example\u2014might also make themreluctant to invest in tax improvement programsthat would yield fruit over the long term. Property tax collection by local governments in the Philippines may be particularly problematic.

Own-source revenues are administered directly by DIPENDAs of the cities, regencies,and provinces, except for street lighting andfuel taxes. However, by issuing permitsand licenses, local departments actuallycollect the user charges coordinated by theDIPENDAs. The administrative performance of the DIPENDAs varies widely. DIPENDAs have few cooperative agreements or information exchanges with other agen-cies within the same government, except forproperty tax field offices of the DirectorateGeneral of Taxation . DIPENDAs may use a certain percentage of total tax revenues to pay allowances to staff,though these bonuses are not usually basedon performance. The quality of tax administration varies. Most DIPENDAs receive taxes directly in theiroffices, while others use partially government-owned regional development banks. One of the highest priorities of most DIPENDAs is developing the ability to professionally audittaxpayers, considered the weakest link in thesystem. The approach to taxpayer auditingvaries by local government. DIPENDAs tried tointroduce information technology in the early1990s, but few local governments are stilloperating the computer systems because oflack of training. Evidence from the Philippines: Principal constraints on taxpayer registration include:- A lack of regular maintenance and validation of the property tax and business registers.- A lack of automated registers. - Low-quality record keeping. Business tax registers are known to be incom- plete, given frequent changes in registeredestablishments, which results in low levels ofcontrol and compliance. Problems undermining property tax collec- tions include:- Collection efficiency for property taxes is low, resulting in the hemorrhaging of themost important source of local revenues.Local governments seem to be in a weakposition to collect the taxes. Improving theefficiency of collection can raise these rev-enues significantly. - Property assessments have not kept up with changes in market values. Most localgovernments have not performed the Gen-eral Revision of Assessment since 1991,resulting in significant undercollection ofproperty taxes. - Noncompliance with the requirement for regular assessment requires urgent atten-tion. The country could revise the code toallow the national government to do theassessments for local governments that donot comply. The compliance function seems inadequate. Major constraints include: - Infrequent exercise of local audit authority.- Infrequent exercise of local enforcement authority, in the form of temporary clo-sures of firms and auctions of property. The difficulties of local governments in enforcing compliance suggest the need forpresumptive taxation in some cases, espe-cially for the business tax and some fees andcharges. The principal constraint on taxpayer services is their limited availability. The lack of eventhe most basic taxpayer services and writtenmaterials means high compliance costs arelikely to be the norm across the country. One main cause of underperformance is weak administrative capacity, owing partly tothe low professional qualifications of staff.Inadequate coordination with the Bureau ofInternal Revenue, and low levels of supportfrom the Bureau of Local GovernmentFinance, which might establish information-sharing protocols, are also factors.that country has been concentrated. This legacy pits powerful landowners\u2014some of whom havediversified their wealth into other assets\u2014againstweak local governments, some of which have beenrun by local elites for generations. Not surprisingly,the ability of local governments to enforce compli-ance with local revenue codes is weak in the face ofelite resistance. Conclusions and Implications This review of experiences in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnamfinds that local governments have limited authorityand ability to raise their own revenues at the mar-gin. As a result, own-source revenues are low as ashare of total subnational resources, and in somecases have been declining as a share of totalresources. Limited revenue-raising power andcapacity raise questions about the supposed bene-fits of decentralization in improving accountabilityand allocative efficiency. Reliance on transfers intheir myriad forms creates dependence on thenational government and may weaken subnationalincentives to improve own-source revenue. Fourkey messages merit emphasis. First, local governments have limited control over tax policy, including the ability to set rates anddefine the tax base. Decentralization is thus morepolitical than fiscal. Lack of control over taxationat the margin breaks the tax-accountability link,undermining the expenditure efficiency promisedby decentralization. While the general limit onown-source revenues is not the only constraint,policy autonomy is essential for significantimprovement to occur over the medium term. Second, the lack of authority over tax policy seems to have spurred local governments to seekunofficial tax and nontax sources of revenue, withdeleterious consequences. In a number of coun-tries, local governments have the authority to enactnew taxes and fees and thus engage in entrepre-neurial behavior, yielding both positive and nega-tive results. The resort to informal and illegal feesis even more unfortunate considering that subna-tional governments in the region are unable to availthemselves of many taxing options open to govern-ments in other regions. Third, despite the lack of opportunity to raise revenues and the apparent interest in \"unofficial\"avenues, subnational governments do not appear to have exhausted all their options. In some countriesand for some taxes, local governments appear toprefer a lax collection strategy (property taxation inthe Philippines, for example). Moreover, to theextent that the quality of local tax administrationreflects both capacity and interest (according tothe \"revealed-preference\" line of thought), thenmany subnational governments \"prefer\" weakadministration. Incentives thus play a role in determining collec- tion levels of own-source revenues. This chaptersuggests that two kinds of incentives play a role.The first is the systemwide incentive. For example,inherent in the intergovernmental fiscal transfersystem are incentives that affect own-source collec-tions. In Indonesia, the fact that the principal inter-governmental grant is based on the differencebetween fiscal needs and revenue capacity, ratherthan actual revenues, gives subnational govern-ments incentives to raise collections to close thegap. The opposite is the case in Vietnam, whichbases transfers on the difference between expendi-ture needs and forecasted revenues, which arebased on previous collections. This formula couldprovide negative incentives, since higher collectionsresult in lower transfer amounts (World Bank2004b). Second, rational politicians might not pre-fer to increase own-source collections under cer-tain circumstances. Fourth, improvements in local tax administra- tion would greatly strengthen subnational financesystems. Tax administrations vary throughout theregion, ranging from highly decentralized in thePhilippines to highly centralized in Vietnam, withIndonesia and China between these two poles. Y etthe relative roles of local and national governmentshave not been well designed, resulting in bothcapacity and incentive challenges. Local govern-ments tend to underperform on own-source collec-tion and administration, reducing the credibility ofthe local tax system and contributing to a culture ofnoncompliance by raising compliance costs for tax-payers. Local administrative capacity is thus quiteweak in many cases, and the binding constraint onimproving revenue performance. This chapter points out that the lack of develop- ment of significant own-source revenues in manycountries is limiting the extent to which subna-tional governments can finance decentralized service 126 East Asia Decentralizesdelivery and make decisions about taxation and service levels. However, it must be noted that localgovernments in some East Asian countries receiverelatively large shares of national income. Thusany efforts to boost own-source revenues wouldneed to occur in the broader context of matchingtotal resources\u2014including transfers and sharedrevenues\u2014to expenditure responsibilities. Challenges remain for improving local tax policy and administration. The lack of autonomy under-mines the ability of local governments to realize thebenefits of decentralization by tapping significantrevenue sources to satisfy local preferences regardingthe level and quality of services. Fiscal sustainabilityrequires improvements in own-source revenue col-lection and administration more generally. Weakadministration undermines local tax systems by con-tributing to high rates of noncompliance, high com-pliance costs for taxpayers, and high administrativecosts for local governments. Getting the relationshipbetween the national and local governments right\u2014in both policy and administrative terms\u2014is pivotal. Endnotes 1.

The percentage split for the Land and Building Tax (exclud- ing mining and plantations) is: center (9 percent), which isintended to cover administrative costs of the deconcen-trated revenue offices; provinces (16 percent); originatinglocal government (65 percent); 6.5 percent equally acrossregions; and 3.5 percent to regions that exceed their previ-ous year's revenue target. A Land and Building Transfer taxis also shared: provinces (16 percent), originating local gov-ernment (64 percent), and the remainder to all local gov-ernments. The personal income tax is 80 percent central,8 percent provincial, and 12 percent originating local gov-ernment. See Law 25/1999, GR 115/2000, GR 104/2000. 5. Reference to Indonesia's\"regions\"generally means provinces and regencies and cities, while the term \"local governments\"refers to regencies and cities. 6. The Salakhet refers to the portion of the provincial budget that is under the control of the provincial governor, not thebudgets of the deconcentrated line ministries at the provin-cial level. Nationally, the Salakhet represents about 20 per- cent of the total provincial budget allocation. 7. Only 7 cities charge the maximum 3 percent rate, and only 21 cities charge rates greater than or equal to 2.5 percent(outside the National Capital Region). No cities or provincesin the NCR charge the maximum allowed. 8. For example, countries could impose the business tax on gross receipts or rely on a subtraction method value-added tax. Notethat this will require interjurisdictional apportionment of thetax base. However, the process need not be complex as inPakistan, where small towns ( tehsils ) adopted levies on gross receipts in 2002 (and contracted out collections). 9. It is noteworthy that the region has no cases of piggyback taxation with local rate setting. 10. User charges are defined here, following Bird and Tsiopoulos (1997, 39), as \"charges levied on consumers of governmentgoods and services in relation to their consumption,\" whenconsumption is voluntary (such as public water charges).Fees are defined, in contrast, as cost recovery for a mandatedpublic service (such as automobile licensing). 11. In fact, provincial councils will set the rate for Thailand's vehicle tax as of 2005. 12. However, the Local Government Code in the Philippines prohibits local excise taxes (Sec. 133 (h)) as well as levies onmotor vehicle registration and driving (Sec. 133 (l)). 13. Ahmad et al. (2000), report that extrabudgetary funds rep- resented nearly 40 percent of all local revenues in 1999. 14. R.A. 7160, Sec. 186.15. For any taxes not listed in Law 34, local governments can decide on appropriate tax bases and rates, as the centralgovernment establishes only general principles. 16. The regional parliament must pass these regulations to authorize the introduction of a new tax or charge. 17. The World Bank calculated the buoyancy coefficient of local taxes at 1.6 for the 1994-1999 period (2002, 55). 18. However, a significant share of property tax revenues is earmarked for education spending. On average, over theperiod 1992-2000, the Special Education Fund, which isearmarked for education, accounted for 44 percent of totalproperty tax collections, which is quite high consideringthat property taxes are the main source of subnationalown-revenue. Earmarking is another form of reduced sub-national autonomy. 19. This is based on annualized data for fiscal year 2000 (which lasted nine months). In general, observers agree that thequality of fiscal year 2000 data is questionable, since\u2014besides being shorter\u2014this year was the transition to decen-tralization. Thus, it would not be appropriate to place muchemphasis on comparisons involving fiscal year 2000 data. 20. The only notable exception, in some ways, to this rule is that subnational treasurers are employees of the Depart-ment of Finance. 21. Still, the General Taxation Department is responsible for appointing, promoting, and transferring departmentalstaff. T o what extent local officials have input into theseprocesses is unknown. 22.

Y et, in practice, the civilservice\u2014a critical component of government\u2014rarely enters the decision calculus of decentraliza-tion design. The civil service is often recognized asan afterthought rather than seen as essential to suc-cessful decentralization. This is lamentable but notsurprising, as decentralization is quintessentially apolitical process. In East Asia, whether it was thedesire to quell the forces of regional disintegrationin the Philippines and Indonesia, the urgent needto meet the demands of economic transition inChina and Vietnam, or pressure to improve servicedelivery and citizen participation in Cambodia andThailand, the primary motivation for decentraliza-tion has been political\u2014notwithstanding variedproximate causes. The common failure to address the details of civil service management as an integral part of thedecentralization package has significant implica-tions. Civil servants form a crucial link between thedelivery of financial resources to the governmentand the delivery of essential public services tothe people (World Bank 2003a). The relation-ship between decentralization and civil service 1297 Managing Human Resources in a Decentralized Context Amanda E. Green management is a two-way process. The behavior of civil servants has important consequences for gov-ernment performance in a decentralized setting.Conversely, decentralization alters both the incen-tives of and the demands on the civil service.Managing this behavior is critical to realizing thebenefits of decentralization. Accordingly, this chapter argues that civil service management\u2014or more broadly humanresource management\u2014should be seen as anessential component in the design of decentraliza-tion rather than a separate, stand-alone process.The discussion marshals evidence from across EastAsia and around the world. The following sectionpresents a framework for exploring the interactionbetween administrative decentralization and civilservice management\u2014in terms of both the theo-retical goals of decentralization and their realiza-tion in practice. The third section delves into therealities of administrative decentralization in EastAsia through the experiences of six countries:Cambodia, China, Indonesia, the Philippines,Thailand, and Vietnam. The varied approachesand responses of these countries offer insightsinto the process of managing civil servants in adecentralized setting. The final section examinesthe central dilemmas that arise in designing130 East Asia Decentralizes administrative decentralization and draws lessons on how countries in East Asia and beyond canmaximize the benefits and minimize the risks ofdecentralization. The Interplay between Decentralization and HumanResource Management Decentralization is a spectrum rather than a single state, ranging from deconcentration to delegationto devolution (see box 1.1). As table 7.1 shows,key features of the civil service vary with thedegree of administrative decentralization. Overall,East Asian countries fall into the intermediate cat-egory, with local managers enjoying some freedomto recruit and allocate staff subject to centralguidelines on pay levels and total employment.Indonesia and the Philippines took the biggestleaps along the decentralization continuum inboth law and practice, but central governmentsretained considerable control over civil servicewages at the local level. In Indonesia, recent revi-sions to the Law on Regional Administration haverolled back decentralization in hiring decisions.In the Philippines, the momentum behind imple-menting decentralization policy has slowed con- siderably. China and Vietnam have taken a moreopportunistic approach, experimenting with dif-ferent degrees of local autonomy. However, thecentral government and Communist Party con-tinue to influence how decentralization plays out.In Thailand, a legal framework defines an interme-diate form of administrative decentralization, butmost of this framework has yet to materialize inpractice. Finally, Cambodia can best be describedas a deconcentrated system, with a high propor-tion of staff based in the field but working onbehalf of the central government. Movement along the spectrum of administrative decentralization depends partly on interplay withthe political and fiscal aspects of decentralization.For example, a local government that has fullauthority over the size of its civil service cannonetheless face restrictions in the use of fundstransferred from the center. Similarly, the strengthof a country's accountability framework is influ-enced by whether political decentralization has cre-ated institutions for locally elected politicians tooversee the activities of local governments. The casestudies illustrate the results of a mismatch in thedimensions of decentralization. TABLE 7.1 Key Features of Administrative Decentralization Deconcentration (minimal change) Provider staff working at local level are employees of andaccountable to the center,usually through theirrespective ministries; centralemployees compensate forweak local capacity. Accountability remains distant: the short route of accountability may be weak ifprovider monitoring is weak,and citizens may have torely on a weak long route stretching to politicians at thecenter; a strong compact between policymakers andproviders can compensate tosome extent.Delegation (intermediate change) Providers could be employees of central or local government,but the center typically definespay and employment. Local government has some authority over hiring andlocation of staff, but is lesslikely to have authority overfiring. Both longandshort routes of accountability are potentiallystronger; greater localknowledge can allow bettermatching of supply with localpreferences and bettermonitoring, strengtheningboth the compact andclient power.Devolution (substantial change) Providers are employees of local government. Local government has full discretion over salary levels,allocation, and numbers ofstaff, as well as the authorityto hire and fire. An overarching civil service framework covering localgovernments may stillestablish standards andprocedures for hiring andmanaging staff. Potentially strongest longand short routes to accountability, but influenced by local socialnorms and vulnerable to localcapacity constraints andpolitics.

A functioning system ofdecentralized civil service management\u2014as dis-tinct from a centrally directed model\u2014has severalkey characteristics: Local government functions are clearly defined so staff know what is expected of them and man-agers can adapt the local civil service to reflectwhat needs to be done, without inefficient gapsor overlap with other levels of government. Local government can allocate staff across func- tions as needed . This requires that civil service managers have autonomy\u2014or at least influ-ence\u2014in operating the local establishment aswell as deploying staff across different depart-ments and facilities. Local government is able to attract and retain qualified individuals , and to build a team with a diverse set of skills. This requires that localgovernment have something to offer, throughcompetitive pay, career opportunities, prestige,or other incentives. Local government has flexibility in managing financial resources . Managing civil servants requires managing their cost, either directlythrough pay levels or indirectly through staffnumbers. Local government can hold staff accountable for their performance . This requires the capacity to supervise and monitor civil servants, the abil-ity to reward good performance through payincreases, promotions, and other benefits, andthe authority to punish deficient performancethrough disciplinary measures or dismissals. Countries may not meet some or all of these criteria for numerous reasons. In some cases, thefailure is one of design. For example, as mentioned,comparatively limited independence among localgovernments on fiscal and political matters mayconstrain their administrative autonomy. In other cases, it is by design that the criteria are not met. First, keeping local civil services underthe umbrella of central direction can ensure somestandardization in working conditions across thecountry. Otherwise, local governments in poorer areas will find it difficult to compete against richerareas, and national coverage of public services maysuffer. Second, central government involvement instaffing may expand civil servants' career paths byopening channels between local and centralemployment. Third, the center may wish to retaincontrol over hiring and pay to shield subnationalgovernments from local pressure to overspend onwages and salaries. Fourth, centralized rules can beimportant in sectors that need to enforce minimumprofessional qualifications, such as with teachers,doctors, and nurses. Fifth, where ethnic or othertensions threaten stability, the central governmentmay use the civil service as a tool for nationalintegration. Finally, the central government's reluc-tance to decentralize may stem simply from a desireto retain control. The Implications of Decentralization How a country resolves the tension between the motivations for decentralizing the civil service onthe one hand, and the reasons for caution on theother, will shape the design of decentralization and,ultimately, how the process plays out. The implica-tions of decentralizing civil service managementcan be examined along four critical dimensions:capacity, incentives, autonomy, and accountability.Each factor plays a significant role in the success ofdecentralization and is, in turn, heavily influencedby the decentralization process. These four dimensions are closely linked and entail important tradeoffs. For example, civil serv-ice training programs are not likely to strengthencapacity in a sustainable way unless incentives moti-vate civil servants to use what they learn. Similarly,improvements in accountability at the local levelrequire that civil servants have the capacity\u2014through accounts and records\u2014to render thataccountability effectively. Finally, holding local civilservice managers accountable for their decisions isdifficult when they do not have autonomy in mak-ing those decisions. Capacity. For civil servants to deliver the higher-quality local services envisioned underdecentralization, they need to have the capacity todo so. This involves both individual and institu-tional elements. First, the success of decentraliza-tion depends on the ability of individual civilservants to take on new tasks, at both central and local levels. Second, smaller size and budgets canconstrain the institutional capacity of local govern-ments. The process of decentralization itself canhave important implications for capacity needs atthe local level. The devolution of public serviceresponsibilities requires both a broader variety ofskills and a greater depth of knowledge in specificareas, such as financial management and perfor-mance monitoring. Moreover, local leaders need tolearn to supervise staff, mobilize more own-sourcerevenues, interact with local constituents andelected officials, and develop local institutions. For-merly central civil servants who move to local levelscan transfer some of these skills; local governmentsneed to gain the rest through experience. At thesame time, central employees need to shift from\"doing\" to facilitating and supervising. Incentives. In some cases, what appears to be a lack of capacity to carry out the functions of decen-tralized government is instead a lack of motivationto act in the public interest. The structure and man-agement of the civil service influence the outcomeof decentralization reforms by affecting how localcivil servants behave. The level of pay and benefits,options for career mobility, and degree to whichmerit is recognized or unsatisfactory performancepenalized can determine the dedication withwhich a civil servant works, as well as the type ofindividuals who choose to become civil servants.Decentralizing functional and managementresponsibilities to the local level, in turn, modifiesthe incentive structures of local civil servants. Theproximity of local government to the recipients ofpublic services can tighten the link between effortsand results. However, some local civil services aretoo small to offer significant opportunities forcareer advancement, and poorer local governmentsmay be unable to pay salaries high enough toattract talent. In remote areas, a combination oflow pay and difficult conditions creates a viciouscircle whereby an inability to attract high-qualitystaff leads to further deterioration in conditions. Autonomy. The argument that decentralization boosts the responsiveness of civil servants assumesthat local managers have the authority to respond tothe demands of their constituents. Local autonomyin allocating human resources can improve effi-ciency by allowing managers to hire staff whoseskills align with planned activities, to discipline ordismiss ineffective staff, and to trim numbers to keep costs down. Though less common at the locallevel, direct financial autonomy\u2014such as the abilityto set pay levels and charge user fees\u2014can improvestaff performance and thereby enhance the benefitsof decentralization. However, to achieve these bene-fits, performance incentives and accountabilityframeworks must be robust enough to preventinefficiency and mismanagement. By definition,administrative decentralization would seem to aug-ment local autonomy, but this is not always the case.The center often retains a significant degree ofcontrol, particularly in financially sensitive areassuch as the size and wage levels of the civil service,especially when local capacity and accountability arein question. Table 7.2 provides a stylized but usefulcomparison of East Asian countries in these areas. Accountability. The potential for improving service delivery through decentralization depends,among other factors, on accountability relation-ships\u2014the degree to which civil servants are heldto account for their performance and integrity, andto whom they are accountable. Without a strongsystem of local accountability, devolving authorityand financial resources to local governments canlead to waste or misuse of public funds, and thepotential for political capture at the local level candistort the benefits of decentralization. On theother hand, where corruption is systemic at thecentral level, devolution may enhance service deliv-ery. Where political decentralization allows foroversight by locally elected bodies, the need forreelection offers strong incentives for better per-formance. If civil society monitoring mechanismsare strong, the downward accountability of localstaff will tend to encourage a closer connectionbetween public services and citizen demands. Ifaccountability is only to the center, however, decen-tralization may not deliver the potential benefits ofbringing government closer to the people. Decentralization can, in turn, affect local accountability. In shifting responsibility for moni-toring civil servants to local managers, decentral-ization can make it more difficult for civil servantsto get away with laziness and corruption. Thecloser proximity of local citizens to governmentdecision makers can enhance their ability to holdthose decision makers accountable. However, ifcritical checks and balances to protect the neutral-ity and independence of civil servants are not in 132 East Asia Decentralizesplace, decentralization can lead to nepotism, with local managers rewarding family members andsupporters with coveted positions, and can facili-tate political capture by bringing civil servantswithin reach of local power bases. Taken together, the capacity, incentives, auton- omy, and accountability of civil service manage-ment provide both a lens through which to evaluatethe design of decentralization and a picture of howadministrative decentralization has played out inpractice. The following section shows how thesefour dimensions have influenced decentralizationin East Asian countries, and how policy makers canleverage those dimensions to get the most out ofdecentralization. Civil Service Management on the Ground in East Asia The structure of government and, by extension, the civil service varies greatly across East Asia. Somecountries have focused decentralization efforts onthe lowest levels of government, while others haveemphasized deconcentration to an intermediatelevel, such as provinces. Countries also differ inwhom they consider civil servants. Some countries treat teachers, health workers, and police as part ofthe civil service, while others consider them separatecategories. The distinction between ministry staffon the one hand, and employees of public serviceagencies and state-owned enterprises on the other,may also blur the definition of a civil servant. Finally,the determination of which civil servants are subna-tional employees can reflect either their physicallocation or the level of government that pays them. Even in the absence of agreed standards and definitions, broadly characterizing civil servicedecentralization in the region is worthwhile.Figure 7.1 shows the wide variation in civil servicestructures across the region. The share of employ-ees at the subnational level ranges from around19 percent in Thailand to just over 90 percentin China. The share of personnel expenditures intotal subnational spending also reflects the extentof administrative decentralization. As figure 7.2shows, average subnational spending on personnelranges from roughly 41 percent of total spendingin Thailand to around 60 percent in China. It isimportant to note, however, that these figures donot necessarily point to China as the region's mostManaging Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 133 TABLE 7.2 Central Authority over the Subnational Civil Service Cambodia China Indonesia Philippines Thailand Vietnam Legislation and regulations: Designation 1 2 1 2-3 2 1Recruitment 1 4 2 3 2 2-3 Structure and career management: Establishment control 1 3 2 2-3 2 1Appointment and mobility 2 3 3 4 2 3 Employment framework 1 1 1 3 1 1 Performance management: Standard setting and rewards 2 2 2 3 2 2 Training and development 2 3 3 4 3 3 Accountability 2 4 3 4 2 2 Sources: World Bank 2003d, 16; staff leadership; 5/H11005autonomous.and innovative responses, the cases attempt to glean important lessons about the interplay betweencapacity, incentives, autonomy, and accountabilityin decentralized civil service management. The Big Bang and Beyond: The Philippines and Indonesia In both the Philippines and Indonesia, decentral- ization was an integral part of a political open-ing following the overthrow of an authoritarianregime. In these sprawling archipelagos, risingsocial tensions added a note of urgency to the deci-sion to decentralize, and local autonomy came to beseen as the key to quelling threats to national unity.Neither government felt it had the luxury of per-fecting the design of intergovernmental fiscal andadministrative arrangements before decentralizing.Following the logic that a chasm cannot becrossed in two leaps has worked well in manyways. 2Neither country experienced major service disruptions during the transition, and the rela-tively open-ended design of decentralization hasencouraged innovative local responses to newresponsibilities. However, once the dust settled,momentum slowed, and important challengesremain in correcting some of the imperfections134 East Asia Decentralizes decentralized country. The degree of authorityexercised by subnational civil service managers indetermining the amount, structure, and allocationof resources plays an important role. Though dif-ferent countries have focused their decentralizationpolicies on different levels of government, table 7.3provides a general picture of how civil service man-agement practices have taken shape in East Asia. The remainder of this section outlines the expe- riences of East Asian countries in dealing with thehuman resource implications of decentralization. InIndonesia and the Philippines, extensive decentral-ization of the administrative apparatus has broughtto light both the opportunities and the risks ofdevolving authority to local managers. In Chinaand Vietnam, where decentralization has proceededin stages, the roles of state and party offer additionalinsights into the relationship between decentraliza-tion and civil service management. Finally, in Cam-bodia and Thailand, the focus on building capacitybefore rather than through decentralization hasmeant limited implementation of decentralizationpolicies, and this experience offers an opportunityto consider how best to balance caution and progress. T ogether these six case studies explore therealities of human resource management in adecentralized setting.

Central Rules and Local Responses in the Philippines. The 1991 Local Government Code (LGC) provided the major impetus for\"genuine andmeaningful local autonomy\" in the Philippines,Managing Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 135 TABLE 7.3 Staffing Authority among Subnational Governments Enabling mechanisms Cambodia China Indonesia Philippines Thailand Vietnam Budget control Determine the wage envelope /H17034/H17034/H17034 /H17038 /H17034 /H17038 Dismiss surplus staff /H17034/H17038/H17038 overall staffing numbers /H17034/H17038/H17034 /H17038 /H17034 /H17038 Control staffing numbers in individual offices /H17034 /H17038 Recruitment Formal /H17033 Have independent merit-based service commission) /H17034/H17038/H17038 /H17034 /H17034 Career management Promotion is available /H17034/H17033/H17038 within local government are possible /H17034/H17033/H17033 /H17033 /H17034 /H17038 Horizontal mobility within local civil service cadre /H17034/H17034/H17034 /H17034 /H17034 /H17034 Performance management Direct and supervise /H17033 /H17033 are for most recent available year, ranging from 2000 to 2003. Ratings refer to the subnational level prioritized by the country's decentralization policy and to de factopractices as well as de jure authority. devolving substantial government functions, and attendant financial and human resources, from thenational to the local level. 3Over 70,000 staff were transferred to local governments. In each tier of government, the local chief executive\u2014governor, mayor, or barangay captain\u2014 can hire, fire, and promote staff, subject to guide-lines from the central Civil Service Commission(CSC). 4Civil servants are bound to a code of con- duct and required to declare their net worth andfinancial and business interests. Government employees are also supposed to disclose a list ofclose relatives in the public service, but this doesnot in practice seem to limit family connections inthe civil service. Indeed, despite the constitutionalrequirement that \"appointments in the civil serviceshall be made according to merit and fitness,\"several mechanisms cause merit and fitness to loseout to patronage and nepotism at the local level. 5 For example, although candidates on the shortlistsfor civil service appointments generally meetthe minimum qualifications set out by the CSC, thelocal chief executive is not bound to choose thetop-ranked applicant. Moreover, recruitment for confidential, highly technical, and noncareer staff positions is exemptfrom the prescribed appointment process. Perhapsbecause these workers are relatively easy to hire,noncareer employees composed over one-third(38.6 percent) of total local government staff in2001\u2014significantly more than in national govern-ment agencies (4.67 percent) (World Bank 2003e).Furthermore, local governments can retain emer-gency and casual staff for up to six months withoutCSC approval. Local officials often use this provisionto circumvent central controls and delays andavoid contributing to the national employee benefitscheme. Repeated extensions of temporary contractslead to de facto permanent employment, and not alllocal governments advertise nonpermanent posi-tions. This lack of transparency undermines merit-based hiring, as temporary positions are oftenhanded out as patronage for loyal supporters. Central regulations on local establishment size and expenditure allocations constrain the chiefexecutive's flexibility in appointing staff. A uniformsystem of job classification imposes rigidities onsmall local civil services. The central governmentlimits local personal services expenditures to 45 to55 percent of the previous year's income, depend-ing on the income class of the local government. 6 The center also determines salary scales and benefitentitlements. Base wages tend to be low, but aresupplemented by a complex system of both mone-tary and in-kind allowances and benefits. From1992 to 2001, aggregate local spending on personalservices averaged 56.8 percent of the previous year'stotal regular income, exceeding the nationally man-dated cap on the wage bill. In municipalities, theaverage was 64.4 percent (World Bank 2003f). 7The 1989 Compensation and Position Classifi- cation Act set salaries in all but first-class local gov-ernments lower than those at the center. 8However, because the salaries of national staff transferred tolocal governments remained the same, this createda wage gap between local and devolved staff. Infact, some civil servants who transferred to lower-income municipalities earned more than themayor. This influx of better-paid staff imposeda budget crunch on local governments. The 1993Salary Standardization Law, which called for unify-ing pay regimes across all levels of government,exacerbated this problem by raising salaries atlower levels. The law has also affected the incentivesof civil servants by compressing salaries and thuslowering the increases that employees can expect asthey move up the ranks. The compact organiza-tional structure of local governments also restrictsthe career mobility of civil servants. Local governments have responded in different ways to these central directives. Some cash-strappedgovernments are forced to simply ignore the man-dated salary scales and pay their employees less.Some local chief executives have elected not to fillmandatory positions to leave room for other staff orsalary supplements. Others have attempted to layoff workers, though this is rare owing to the politi-cal sensitivity of retrenchments. Local governmentswith greater access to own-source revenues supple-ment staff incomes even for positions covered bythe national government, such as police. Local gov-ernments have also responded to rising personnelcosts by charging some expenditures, such as pay-ments for contract workers, to other budget lines.This crowds out nonpersonnel expenditures whilemasking the true extent of staff costs. As the centralgovernment does not have the capacity to enforceits regulations, local governments have much moreflexibility than the legal framework implies. Balancing National Unity and Local Autonomy in Indonesia. Indonesia's Big Bang decentralization\u2014 ambitious and swift as it was\u2014risked disruptingpublic services, inciting local unrest, and leavingcivil servants unpaid. In actuality, the transitionwent quite smoothly. Delivery of services contin-ued for the most part unscathed, and expectedupheavals among reassigned civil servants failed tomaterialize. Over 2.1 million staff\u2014nearly 60 per-cent of central employees\u2014were transferred to136 East Asia Decentralizesprovincial and (primarily) district civil services with relatively little difficulty, although few people had tophysically move because the previous system hadbeen highly deconcentrated. The central govern-ment greatly aided the process by continuing to paydevolved civil servants from national coffers for fivemonths. In the wake of the Big Bang, several legal dis- crepancies came to light. Considerable confusionensued in applying various laws and regulations,leading to overlapping authority and eroding effi-ciency. According to the original administrativeframework (Law 22 of 1999 on Regional Adminis-tration), the head of region had the right to hire,fire, promote, transfer, and discipline staff. TheCivil Service Law, however, maintained thatauthority for civil service appointments rested firstand foremost with the central government, whichcould delegate that authority to heads of region.Government Regulation 97 of 2000 allowed thehead of the regional administration to determinethe size of the regional establishment. However,central regulations requiring nationwide advertis-ing for some posts\u2014although perhaps intended tospark interregional mobility\u2014limited the flexibil-ity of regional managers. Recent changes to the framework laws have moderated the initial thrust toward devolution andintroduced even more uncertainty about the rolesof different levels of government in managing thecivil service. The revised Law on Regional Adminis-tration (Law 32 of 2004) has rolled back localauthority to manage human resources, stipulatingthat the central government will supervise regionalcivil servants within a national framework, and thatregional heads can hire, fire, and relocate onlylower-level staff at the same level of government. 9 Regional managers no longer have explicit author-ity to manage their civil services. The central government also determines pay levels and increases regardless of their affordabilityat the local level, limiting the autonomy of regionalmanagers. 10Local governments must further pay the pensions of civil servants transferred from thecenter, which can create an unsustainable burden,particularly as the cost of pensions rises along withsalaries. In 2001, the dana alokasi umum (DAU)\u2014 or general to cover the 14-30 percentpay increase mandated by the center. Though thecentral government introduced this transitional mechanism with good intentions, it created incen-tives for overstaffing at the local level, as regionalgovernments began to assume that excess person-nel costs would continue to be covered by supple-mentary funding. The structure of the DAU itself discourages pru- dent local management. Currently, the DAU isdivided into three parts: a \"lump sum\" distributedin equal amounts to every region, a \"formula\"amount determined by the extent to which aregion's financial need outstrips its fiscal capacity, and a \"balancing factor\" based largely on theregion's wage bill as a share of total subnationalwage expenditures in the previous year. The balanc-ing factor deters local managers from cutting costsbecause lowering the wage bill lowers next year'sDAU allocation. This disincentive will becomestronger with the implementation of the revisedLaw on Fiscal Balance (Law 33 of 2004). The equal-izing lump sum component will be eliminated in2006, and the \"hold harmless\" clause that keepsregional DAU allocations from decreasing overtime applies only until 2008. Moreover, in the inter-est of national unity, the central government hasresolved to fully fund regional salaries through theDAU, which will create strong incentives for subna-tional managers to increase staffing. Until recently, a zero-growth policy prevented formal recruitment to the Indonesian civil service.New staff appointments in November 2004 werethe first of their kind since decentralization wasimplemented. At the same time, Government Reg-ulation 8 of 2003 on Local Government Structureand Organization defines the maximum number ofstaff in the regions, though it is not clear howstrictly this regulation is enforced. Both the centraland regional governments have taken to hiringcontract workers to circumvent these formalrestrictions. At the local level, this strategy hasallowed managers to hire and fire temporary staffand consultants as desired, without interferencefrom the center. Contract workers, who nowaccount for about 10 percent of governmentemployees, are also attractive because their employ-ment is not subject to qualification standards orpension obligations. In theory, the government must base hiring and promotion decisions on merit, but anecdotalevidence reveals that this needs strengthening inManaging Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 137practice, especially in promoting staff. The head of region has the right to discipline and dismiss lower-level staff who are underperforming, subject to dueprocess and approval from the provincial governor.Dismissals are rare in practice, however, and staffreassignment seems to be the preferred penalty. The civil service agency, BKN, has begun to define job classifications and qualifications for thecivil service as a whole, including regional govern-ments. The Indonesian government has also beendeveloping minimum standards for service deliv-ery, including broad directives on supervising min-imum wage levels as well as highly specific technicalguidelines. Heads of region have generally beenenthusiastic about this initiative, both because theyprefer to be held accountable against establishedcriteria rather than arbitrary standards set by localparliaments, and because they expect to receivemore funding in exchange for taking on greaterresponsibilities (World Bank 2003d). In principle,minimum service standards can improve civil serv-ice management by offering some basis for unityamong public servants, ensuring a minimum levelof performance across the country, and enhancinglocal accountability through improved understand-ing of what is expected of local civil servants. InIndonesia, however, most line ministries are issuingstandards without giving enough thought to theirfeasibility and affordability at the local level. T o beeffective, minimum standards must be designedcarefully, so they are specific enough to provideclear direction on what is expected of the local civilservice but not so detailed as to hamstring regionalleaders. The design of decentralization in Indonesia con- stricts the interregional mobility of civil servants,and therefore their career paths. No streamlinedsystem exists for relocating subnational civil ser-vants to other areas. Discriminatory hiring prac-tices at the regional level seem to further limitmobility. Despite regulations designed to preventthis, some heads of region are reportedly engagingin preferential treatment of \"sons of the soil,\" ordiscriminating based on ethnicity, religion, or otherspecial interests. Many regions have resisted takingon staff transferred from the center, owing largelyto ethnic tensions (central civil servants are prima-rily Javanese) and the association of staff in Jakartawith the authoritarian rule of Soeharto (WorldBank n.d.). Curbing this tendency before itbecomes deeply entrenched will be important, as interregional mobility of civil servants can helpensure national unity and acceptable levels of serv-ice delivery in more remote regions. Possible mea-sures to address this issue include joint trainingacross regions and a secondment system, in whichfixed-term placements in local areas improve thecareer prospects of central civil servants. Ironing Out the Wrinkles. Both the Philippines and Indonesia considered decentralization neces-sary to keep the nation together and regain the trustof disaffected local governments. There was astrong sense that decentralization plans could notawait the relatively long process of institutionaldevelopment and capacity building, and thus thathuman and institutional capabilities should beexpanded during the decentralization process.This approach succeeded in focusing the policyagenda on the actual transfer of functions andmanagement authority to the local level, but left inits wake some unfinished business that hasslowed the momentum behind decentralization.In Indonesia, concern over the loose ends hasprompted the central government to roll backdevolved authority. Capacity. Decentralization policies in the Philippines and Indonesia have focused on the low-est tier of local government, but implementation ofdevolved functions is running up against thelimited capacity of staff in these administrations,particularly in planning, budgeting, and financialmanagement. In response, the Indonesian govern-ment has adopted a National Framework forCapacity Building, but will now have to work tofinance and implement this plan. It is also unclearwhether the top-down application of this frame-work will adequately address the capacity-buildingneeds of local governments. In the Philippines,the continuing mismatch between required andavailable skills at the local level points to a need forbetter coordination in training local civil servants.Most activities are now provided in isolation, eitherby individual central agencies or by local govern-ments themselves. Incentives. The decentralization process has also affected incentive structures at the local level. Boththe Philippines and Indonesia have encountereddifficulties in designing intergovernmental financ-ing mechanisms. The Internal Revenue Allotment138 East Asia Decentralizesin the Philippines has not followed the assignment of functions as closely as it should have, floodingsome localities with excess resources while saddlingothers with unfunded mandates. The former situa-tion skews incentives toward overspending andoverstaffing, while the latter discourages long-termplanning and spending on maintenance. InIndonesia, the central government's historical useof the DAU to cover local salary shortfalls and, now,to fully fund subnational wages creates a perverseincentive for overstaffing regional governments. Inboth countries, performance incentives for civilservants are dampened by compressed salary struc-tures, ineffective monitoring of performance, andweak links between performance and pay. Theseeffects have been compounded by a lack of mobilitywithin the civil service\u2014vertically in the case of thePhilippines, and horizontally in Indonesia. Autonomy . In its initial thrust, decentralization in the Philippines and Indonesia significantlyboosted the autonomy of local managers. Indone-sia, however, has recently repealed local staffingauthority. In both countries the central governmenthas retained control in defining pay levels for localcivil servants. Subnational governments are subjectto national wage scales that impose significantfiscal burdens, especially in poorer localities.Centrally imposed salary increases have furtherstrained local budgets. In Indonesia, the DAUcovered these, but in the Philippines, the SalaryStandardization Law is not yet fully implementedbecause many local governments find it simplyunaffordable. Another unfunded mandate thatimpinges on the autonomy of local civil servicemanagers in the Philippines is the 1993 MagnaCarta of Public Health Workers Act. The centralgovernment extended this generous package ofwage and benefit guarantees to health employeesas an inducement to accept devolution. This haswidened an already noticeable gap in the remuner-ation of local versus devolved staff, and hasimposed significant costs on local governmentswhile reducing the ability of local managers to allo-cate resources according to need. In both Indonesiaand the Philippines, limits on local authority haveled managers to bypass established regulations byhiring staff on a temporary basis and topping upsalaries with nontransparent allowances. Accountability . The tendency to circumvent the rules may reflect an adaptive response by localmanagers to do what needs to be done, but the resulting lack of clarity and transparency poses aconsiderable risk in reduced accountability and vul-nerability to corruption. In the Philippines, weakcontrols on staff appointments open the door topatronage and nepotism in local government. InIndonesia, though the speed of decentralizationprobably prevented vested interests from influenc-ing decentralization policies, there is evidence thatlocal positions are bought and sold in return for thepromised rewards of graft in the public service(World Bank 2003c). The accountability of localcivil servants is further threatened by a lack ofclarity\u2014in Indonesia because of imprecise roles,and in the Philippines owing to the \"double subor-dination\" of local staff to the local executive and therelevant central agency. Internal accountabilitymechanisms remain weak in both countries, thoughexternal accountability institutions\u2014such asombudsman institutions, complaint bureaus, andcitizen monitoring\u2014are growing in importance. Overall, the experience of East Asia's rapid decentralizers shows that, although establishing theright rules is important to administrative decen-tralization, good design on paper is not enough.Countries must pay attention to the realities ofimplementation, particularly to creating incentivesfor local governments to work within the rules andto maintaining the momentum to make neededpolicy adjustments. Decentralization in Transition: China and Vietnam Administrative decentralization in China and Vietnam was born of the transition to a marketeconomy. During the economic opening, centralgovernments relinquished control over some oftheir activities and offered greater administrativeand, to a lesser extent, political independence tosubnational entities in return for greater centralauthority over revenue assignments. This systemhas confused the roles of subnational civil servantsand limited the autonomy of local leaders in man-aging their activities. On the other hand, in \"crossing the river by feel- ing the rocks,\" 11decentralization in China and Vietnam has encouraged governments to experi-ment with local autonomy and address problemsbefore moving on to the next stage of decentraliza-tion. And local governments in both countries haveManaging Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 139formulated innovative responses along the way. The decentralization experiences of these twocountries\u2014different in size yet emerging from sim-ilar bureaucratic traditions\u2014provide insights intothe impacts of administrative decentralization oncivil service management and local service deliveryin transition countries. The Ebb and Flow of China's Decentralization. In a country as large and varied as China, some formof administrative decentralization is a necessity,yet the statutory basis for decentralized humanresource management is fairly limited. The 1993Provisional Regulations on Civil Servants addressthe nationally unified core civil service, whichincludes only white-collar workers such as man-agers and professional staff. T eachers, doctors, sup-port staff, research institute employees, and mem-bers of the military are not considered part of thecore service, but of separate Public Service Units(see below). Political appointees are consideredcivil servants, however, as no distinction is drawnbetween political and bureaucratic personnel.Though the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) isformally separate from the government, it doesinfluence staffing and other aspects of publicmanagement. Central and subnational civil ser-vants alike are subject to national guidelines;although local jurisdictions prepare their own reg-ulations, these usually conform to the nationalrules (Wong 2003). The People's Congress usually makes the deci- sion to hire or fire a local civil servant at the corre-sponding level; however, the CCP controls theappointments of senior staff through the nomen-klatura system of bureaucratic patronage commonin many communist countries. Since 1984, high-level officials in each administrative tier have beenappointed by the party committee at the next-highest level. 12Recruitment is supposed to be determined by open, competitive examinations,and the selection and promotion of employeesbased on merit and performance. It is important tonote, however, that these criteria are generallydefined to include \"political integrity,\" or commit-ment to party policies. Local staff are accountableto the central government rather than to localadministrations. Civil servants must follow codesof conduct set out in both the Provisional Regula-tions and party writings. T emporary workers, suchas substitute teachers, are exempt from the national guidelines. The number of posts authorized for local juris- dictions is determined by local branches of theState Commission for Post and Establishment, ajoint government-party organization, at the next-highest level of government. The commission usesa weighted formula to calculate each jurisdiction'soverall staff complement, including a quota for thenumber of support staff. 13Staffing numbers are not necessarily efficient, however, and inefficienciescan be preserved over time because responsibilitiesfor budget preparation and staffing policy areseparate\u2014a holdover from the days of centralplanning. Civil servants are paid according to a national salary scale, which is benchmarked to the wages ofstaff with similar responsibilities in state-ownedenterprises. This restriction pegs salaries closer tothose of staff in larger, urban localities. Bonusesand benefits are determined locally and often com-pose a hefty proportion of overall remuneration.Well-off localities use these perks liberally tosupplement the pay of civil service cadres. Poorerareas have difficulty meeting nationally mandatedwage increases, and some have been forced toignore these instructions or supplement personnelbudgets with funds originally allotted to capitalexpenditures. The central pay scale does not, there-fore, ensure nationally consistent pay. The fact thatlocal governments must cover civil service pen-sions, unemployment benefits, and other safety netexpenditures intensifies the fiscal pressures causedby central control over wage levels. When thenational government raises pay, these salary-basedexpenditures rise as well, tightening local budgetsbeyond the control of local managers. Relatively high salary scales further burden less prosperous local governments, where the civil serv-ice may be one of few sources of wage employment.Indeed, the tendency for local administrationsto serve as the employer of last resort is exacerbatedby higher-level insistence that they absorb streamsof recent graduates (Wong 2003). These forcestogether inflate staffing levels, especially at thecounty level, which accounts for over half of theexcess staff (World Bank 2002a). Despite severalattempts to downsize the civil service and streamlinethe structure of government, redundant agenciesremain and have tended to staff up again over time.140 East Asia DecentralizesWage levels appear to be high enough to allow governments to recruit and retain qualifiedemployees. The number of higher-level staff withuniversity degrees has risen from about 20 percentin 1981 to more than 80 percent in 1994. Thoughpay increases and bonuses are designed to reflectperformance evaluations, this does not seem tomotivate staff to perform well. The majority receivepositive appraisals, and managers generally handout bonus payments across the board rather thanto reward exceptional work. Overall pay levels arehighly compressed. The ratio of highest to lowestsalary is 5.6 to 1 for base wages, but flattens tosomething on the order of 3 to 1 when subsidiesand bonuses are included (World Bank 2002a). 14 The relatively small increments between pay cate-gories substantially reduce the payoff gained by anemployee who ascends to the next rung of thebureaucratic ladder. There are no explicit restric-tions on the transfer of local civil servants from onelocality to another, or up to the central level, but thestructure of the Chinese labor market\u2014in whichthehukou system of household registration assigns workers to a designated area\u2014limits mobility.Some movements occur among higher-rankedstaff, but rarely in the lower echelons. In the late1990s, the central government initiated a programto relocate mid-career officials to local jurisdictionsfor six months to one year as part of a career path tosenior public service. The core civil service, as defined by the Provi- sional Regulations, does not encompass a substan-tial proportion of government-financed workersemployed by Public Service Units (PSU), such asschools, hospitals, and research institutes. PSUs fig-ure prominently in the public employment land-scape, accounting for 96 percent of the civiliannon-state-enterprise workforce at the central level,and 73 percent at the subnational level. Humanresource management is slightly more flexible inPSUs than in core government entities. Local PSUscan be run at the central or local level or managedjointly. As in the core service, the next-highestbranch of the State Commission for Post and Estab-lishment determines the size of PSU staff. Theserestrictions do not seem to be heeded in practice,however, as local PSU employment averaged 110percent of the authorized staff size in 1999. AndPSU employment is growing, particularly at thesubnational level. In provinces, prefectures, andcounties, PSU staff complements expanded by 21, 21, and 75 percent, respectively, between 1991 and1999 (World Bank 2002a). PSUs are subject to the authority of and accountable to the central government. The bound-aries between these two forms of public employ-ment often blur. Throughout various attempts todownsize the civil service in the late 1980s and1990s, PSUs often absorbed retrenched employees,limiting cost savings. There is an expectation thatstaff can move freely between PSUs and core gov-ernment positions. In essence, PSUs are a reservoirof extrabudgetary human resources upon whichthe government can draw (World Bank 2002a). 15 Moreover, the functions of core agencies and PSUsoften overlap, creating inefficiencies in administer-ing and delivering public services. Traditional and Innovative Approaches to Decentralization in Vietnam. Along with the transition to market-oriented economic principles,a major outgrowth of the doi moi reforms begun in 1986 has been a shift in the balance of state power,first from the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)to the government, and then from central to subna- tional levels. The impetus for administrative decen-tralization is growing with the Master Program onPublic Administration Reform, which stronglyadvocates realigning the management of humanand financial resources to address the fact that\"administrative machinery at local levels is notreally responsive to people\" (Government ofVietnam, 2001, 2). Most civil servants in Vietnam are hired and fired by the People's Committee at the next-highestlevel of government. In the provinces, the Provin-cial People's Committee makes these decisions,though high-level appointments require the ap-proval of the prime minister. Openings must beadvertised within the locality, usually by way of apublic posting outside the Office of the People'sCommittee. While job classifications have beendefined centrally, they are not accompanied by pre-cise job descriptions, and thus offer local govern-ments significant discretion in determining theirstaffing profile. All civil service appointments and promotions are to be based on merit, as determined by exami-nations conducted by provincial-level politicalschools. There are indications that, in practice,Managing Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 141seniority is accorded more weight than perfor- mance in promotion decisions. Selection to higher-level positions also requires ranking membership inthe CPV . No performance management systemlinks high-quality work to high return on a civilservant's career path. Two 1998 regulations\u2014theOrdinance on Complaints and Denunciations andthe Ordinance on Procedures for Resolving Admin-istrative Disputes\u2014offer mechanisms for disciplin-ing staff, but managers do not exercise either ofthese very often. This is due in the former case to alack of specificity in the provisions, and in the lattercase to the limited effectiveness of AdministrativeCourts. No formal procedures are in place to allowdismissed civil servants to address grievances orappeal personnel actions. Though officially no geographical constraints hinder the recruitment and transfer of staff, incen-tives for interregional mobility are generally inade-quate, as local residents fill most local positions.Furthermore, remote areas tend to have difficultyattracting high-quality employees. There is alsoroom to boost recruitment of regional minorities,particularly above the commune level. In theory,local civil servants are not barred from moving intothe central civil service, but in practice, only People'sCommittee chairs move up to service in Hanoi. Instead, central civil servants seem to be spend- ing more time away from the capital. In 2003, thegovernment launched a new program of staff rota-tions aimed at deepening the hands-on experienceof top central bureaucrats. The intent is that timespent at the grassroots level will serve as a criticalstep on the path to high-level government posts(Cohen 2003). Whether this promising initiativewill bear fruit, however, remains to be seen. There is concern that the rotation scheme has been usednot as a tool for instilling an improved publicservice ethos but instead to banish politicalopponents. The central Ministry of Home Affairs manages the personnel establishment through staff quotas ateach level of government. Until 2004, these staffquotas also determined the budget allocations forpersonnel expenditures at the local level, but theone-to-one relationship between a larger staff sizeand a larger budget allocation created incentives foroverstaffing and penalized leaner, more efficientadministrations. Budgets now reflect a province'spopulation rather than its staffing levels.Salaries and allowances are specified centrally and apply uniformly to all levels of government.Wage levels have traditionally been considered lowcompared with alternative sources of employment,though new analysis casts doubt on the validity ofthese comparisons. Bales and Rama argue that,while professional and technical employees maybe underpaid compared with the private sector, thealternative employer for most civil servants\u2014particularly those based in rural areas\u2014is mostlikely the informal sector, where salaries tend to belower (Bales and Rama 2002). In poorer regions, infact, the comparatively high wages fixed by thecenter\u2014along with recent salary increases\u2014aretightening budgets. This pressure will only buildwith the planned pay reform program, whichpromises to raise salaries by 30 percent, on average.Because staff pay represents a considerable share ofspending in service sectors, wage costs can freezeout other important spending. Though the crowd-ing out of operations and maintenance expendi-tures is not a major problem overall in Vietnam, itis an important issue in poorer areas. Turning Transition into Forward Momentum. Decentralization in China and Vietnam has beenincremental, with the central government reactingto the effects of each policy before taking the nextstep. While this approach allows experimentation toaddress unexpected results before they becomeentrenched, the lack of a predefined plan can createinconsistencies in decentralized governance. Forexample, sufficient fiscal resources have not accom-panied administrative mandates\u2014indeed, in China,the recent trend has been toward recentralization offinances. In Vietnam, the PAR Master Program,which sees the capacity and accountability of civilservants as critical to improving the effectivenessand efficiency of public service, is an important steptoward redressing imbalances in fiscal and humanresources. Capacity. The PAR Master Program calls for developing a capacity-building plan to provide bet-ter training opportunities at local as well as centrallevels, refresh the curriculum and methods, andalign content more closely with needed on-the-jobskills. Enhancing the reach of educational opportu-nities will be important in addressing the lowcapacity of many local governments in Vietnam,particularly in remote areas. China has also made142 East Asia Decentralizestraining civil servants a priority: local governments must upgrade the skills of civil servants in line withthe needs of the market economy. In both coun-tries, the central government provides resourcesfor locally organized training programs. In China,local governments are taking advantage of theseresources to send their employees to Chinese uni-versities as well as training programs outside thecountry. However, local administrations in bothChina and Vietnam continue to lack expertise inaccounting and financial management. In Vietnam,a recent audit found an absence of record keepingin the communes, which keeps local managers fromeffectively overseeing the civil service and preventsthe center from tracking the use of funds. Incentives. Improving the ability of local govern- ments to manage financial resources addresses onlypart of the problem when the incentives of civil serv-ice managers are skewed away from prudent super-vision of local budgets. Until recently, Vietnam'ssystem for allocating administrative budgets\u2014calculated per staff member per year\u2014encouragedlocal managers to inflate staffing levels to obtainmore resources from the center. In China, local offi-cials have little motivation to reduce personnel costs,as they are budgeted separately from other expendi-tures. Indeed, managers who save on wages lose partof their budget allocation. In poor regions, addingstaff is often seen as the only way to increase the localbudget allocation. Coupled with the government'sposition as employer of last resort, this system hasencouraged overstaffing in local governments. The ability of decentralization to improve serv- ice delivery also depends on the incentives of civilservants themselves. In both China and Vietnam,despite official rules defining merit as the basis forpromotion, the career paths of local staff appear tobe more limited than those of their central govern-ment counterparts. Seniority and party loyaltyreceive as much or more consideration than per-formance, and salary compression limits the bene-fits gained from hard work. China's attempt toenhance incentives for high-quality work throughperformance-based pay has not succeeded becausemanagers have applied bonuses across the board.Staff rotation schemes in both countries focus ondeveloping the careers of central civil servantsthrough time spent in regions, rather than on rotat-ing local staff to other areas to facilitate sharing ofexperiences and information (see box 7.1). TheVietnamese government has had significant success in improving incentives for prudent managementof administrative expenditures through an innova-tive pilot program for block-grant budgeting in HoChi Minh City (see box 5.3). Autonomy . Controlling administrative expendi- tures has indeed proved difficult for local managersin these countries because of their restricted auton-omy in setting wage and staffing levels and, inChina, associated safety net expenditures. The highpercentage of local budgets preempted by person-nel costs, in turn, limits local discretion regardingother expenditures. In the meantime, local leadershave focused on a few areas of personnel manage-ment in which they do have autonomy. In China,local governments determine bonus pay, and haveused it to supplement civil service wages. In bothcountries, local governments have the right to sup-plement their budgets by collecting user fees forcertain services. While this has eased the strain onsome local budgets, many of these fees fall dispro-portionately on the poor. Moreover, because theseresources are external to the budget, governmentsoften spend them in nontransparent ways thatdo not reflect budget priorities and undermineaccountability. Accountability . The accountability of local civil servants in China and Vietnam is blurred by a lackof clarity on the roles and responsibilities of eachlevel of government, though Vietnam's new Bud-get Law has helped to address this problem. InVietnam, and at the township level in China, thelack of clarity is intensified by dual subordination,in which local staff are beholden to both the direc-tives of the central government and the demands oflocal elected assemblies. Audits of local expendi-tures in both countries have found that accounta-bility mechanisms are weak. In China, the internalaudit function is strong, focusing mainly on ensur-ing compliance and preventing fraud. Externalex post audits are less effective, as local auditbureaus report to the central government and thuslack needed independence. The effectiveness ofaudits in Vietnam is constrained by a lack of capac-ity and low pay. In both countries, efforts are underway to improve accounting and financial manage-ment at central as well as local levels. These mea-sures will help the central government improve andmonitor local service delivery. The presence of theCommunist Party in China and Vietnam holds Managing Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 143important consequences for the accountability of civil servants in a decentralized setting. The partyexerts considerable influence over staff appoint-ments and promotions, particularly at senior levels.As such, civil servants most likely feel moreaccountable to the party than to the local popula-tion. While the party can be seen as a source of dis-cipline in an otherwise weak system, its traditionalcontrol over the flow of information can reducetransparency and undercut efforts to hold civil ser-vants accountable (Wong 2003). Government transparency is beginning to improve in China and Vietnam, both within the civilservice and with respect to the public. The state-runmedia and citizens are paying increasing attention to corruption issues. In Vietnam, after peasantprotests in Thai Binh and Dong Nai provincesbrought to light the extent of corruption in the localcivil service, the central government introduced aGrassroots Democracy Decree to enhance local con-sultation with residents on decisions that affectthem. While this could in principle provide a strongcheck on abuse of power and strengthen accounta-bility by increasing the demand for good gover-nance, implementation has been weak because oflimited management responsibility at the communelevel, insufficient training of civil servants in sharinginformation with local citizens, and inadequate144 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 7.1 Personnel Exchange in India and Japan: Whose Capacity Is Being Strengthened? In many civil services around the world, systems enable staff to transfer across levels of govern-ment. The motivations behind these personneltransfers are varied. In some cases, the intent isto groom central civil servants for high-levelpostings by using hands-on work at the locallevel to ground and broaden their policy skills. Inother cases, central government staff are trans-ferred to subnational jurisdictions to fill gaps inlocal capacity to implement national programs.Where civil servants are transferred acrosssubnational governments, the aim may be tokeep them at a safe distance from local vestedinterests. A comparison of civil servant rotation schemes in India and Japan demonstrates howthe design of these human resource manage-ment tools can shape their impact in a decentral-ized setting. In India, the principal focus is onpreparing members of the elite Indian Adminis-trative Service (IAS) for senior positions in centraland state governments. Those who make the cutin the highly competitive recruitment processand rigorous training program are dispatched tostate governments, where they spend severalyears working in field and secretariat assign-ments in different sectors. After reaching seniorpositions in the field, IAS officers typically rotatebetween central and state governments, asrepeated exposure to field conditions is key tokeeping abreast of changing on-the-groundrealities. The IAS system also fosters activecollaboration between the center and subna- tional governments. In Japan, on the other hand, the impetus for personnel exchange arose from the need toboost technical capacity in newly establishedlocal governments. Many local postings havesince become \"hereditary,\" in the sense thatstaff members returning to central governmentare typically replaced by other central staff fromthe same ministry. Though it could be arguedthat this practice has prevented qualified localstaff from gaining access to senior positionsin subnational governments, the fact thatautonomous local administrations continue topay for relocated central staff implies that thetransfer of information and knowledge fromthe center still plays a useful role. Moreover, theJapanese system of personnel exchanges ismuch broader than that in India. Staff not onlytransfer from the center to prefectural govern-ments, but from prefectural governments tomunicipalities, from local governments to cen-tral postings, and across prefectures as well.While in both countries placing centrallyrecruited officials in local administrations canstrengthen the capacity of local staff as well astransferred officials, the design of the Japanesesystem is more conducive to developing theskills of local Schiavo-Campo et al. 1997; in social assis- tance funds. The Cautious Decentralizers: Cambodia and Thailand The implementation of decentralization has been relatively limited in Thailand and Cambodia. Inresponse to growing demand for improved servicedelivery at the local level, both countries have rec-ognized the importance of devolving some man-agement responsibilities\u2014and the rights thataccompany them\u2014to local governments. Y et con-cerns about the limited capacity of subnationalgovernments have engendered a cautious approachthat has concentrated on developing the legislativeframework and building local capacity to manageand monitor public services. In Thailand, a weak-ening political imperative to decentralize has alsostalled implementation of outlined policies. In low-capacity countries, a gradual transfer of responsibility can be a pragmatic way to ensurecontinuity in service provision and limit the poten-tial for political capture of inexperienced local civilservants. However, gradualism also has its disad-vantages. Piecemeal approaches may lack an overallstrategic focus, leading to a mismatch betweenresponsibilities and resources, and between author-ity and accountability. Moreover, caution can serveas an excuse for inaction on the part of central offi-cials who are reluctant to relinquish their authority.Thailand and Cambodia have faced some under-standable reasons for delay. Y et in taking such along time to establish the building blocks of decen-tralization, these countries have deferred potentialimprovements in service delivery. In the meantime,the success of several small-scale experiments withlocal autonomy indicates that, with careful design,decentralization can work in these countries. Thefollowing discussion of guarded decentralization inThailand and Cambodia explores how countriesmay resolve the tension between exercising cautionand achieving tangible results. Building the Foundations for Decentralizing Personnel Management in Thailand. Thailand's 1997 Constitution represents a significant step inbringing government closer to the people in atraditionally centralized country. Building on thissolid foundation, efforts have shifted to creatingthe institutions and developing the legal basis for devolving responsibilities to subnationaladministrations. So far, few civil servants have been transferred to local administrations. Only about 4,000 staff(less than 1 percent of the 1.2 million nationalcivil servants) in five departments\u2014principally theDepartment of Public Works and the Ministryof Interior's Accelerated Rural DevelopmentDepartment\u2014have moved to local service. Thetransfer of staff has thus not followed the transferof functions, as stipulated in the decentralizationlegislation. 16The strategy of the Office of the Civil Service Commission for transferring remainingstaff prioritizes voluntary transfers, though manda-tory transfers and compensated retrenchment arestill options. The commission has set up a PublicSector Personnel Development and DeploymentCenter as a hub for training and deploying centralstaff to positions in local government. Provincialpersonnel transfer centers are evaluating thestaffing implications of devolved authority for localgovernments. Still, the low number of relocations thus far points to a lack of motivation on the part of bothcentral agencies and public employees. Ministries inBangkok are understandably unenthusiastic aboutletting their staff go. Poorer local governments, espe-cially the small tambons, may be reluctant to accept more staff because of the burden they may pose totight budgets.Employees hesitate to move owing to alack of clarity about comparable pay, benefits(including pension fund provisions), recruitmentand dismissal procedures, career mobility, and localquality of life. Some staff worry that relocation tosmaller local communities will leave them\u2014andtheir jobs\u2014at the mercy of local politics (Wegelin2002). Civil servants who transfer to the regions areentitled to the same pay as in the center, but the sys-tem for classifying local positions does not offer thesame range of job levels (and accompanying paygrades). 17The central government has offered a financial incentive to public servants who volunteerto serve in local governments for a three-year term,but this does not address the longer-term issue ofpermanent personnel transfers. 18 The central government exercises general authority over personnel decisions at each level ofsubnational government through the Civil ServiceCommission. Local administrations may hire Managing Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 145low-level staff and contract workers but are not authorized to recruit higher-skilled or careeremployees. Vacancies are not formally advertised.Recruitment is based on competitive examinationsadministered by the commission, although it canwaive the exam requirement in certain circum-stances. All civil servants are subject to a code ofprofessional ethics, which requires those in higher-level positions to publicly declare their assets.Disciplinary procedures are rigorous and providefor appeal. The center rigidly prescribes the number and grade level of authorized staff positions at eachlevel of local government. Fifth-class tambons may employ no more than 3 staff members, and first-class tambons no more than 21. Limiting staff so strictly may undercut remote rural areas that needthe most intensive work on service delivery andpublic outreach. Y et keeping staff lean can helplocalities manage the fiscal burden of civil servicesalaries. Local governments must adhere to a cen-tral pay scale and a 40 percent cap on personnelexpenditures as a proportion of local spending.This is a Catch-22 for poorer tambons, where a sheer lack of staff constrains the capacity to per-form local functions, while paying more peoplewould leave little money for anything else (Wegelin2002). T o address local personnel issues and redressdisincentives to staff transfers, the Local CivilService Administration Working Group has pro-posed creating a Local Government Civil ServiceCommission\u2014as distinct from the provincial andmunicipal commissions that already exist. TheMinistry of Interior is also looking into a personnelmanagement system to track the pay, benefits, andcareer streams of subnational civil servants. Finally,the Thai government's recent acceleration ofbroader civil service reforms may reinvigorate thedecentralization process. Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches to Decentralization in Cambodia. According to its National Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2003-2005, Cambodia is pursuing a two-pronged approach to the devolution of power, tackling bothpolitical decentralization to the communes andfunctional deconcentration to provincial-level out-posts of the central government. The governmenthas recently initiated a process to develop an inte-grated policy framework.Cambodia has established the legal framework for devolution, but its impact on staffing has beenlimited. While recognizing that communes shouldhave their own financial resources, the Law onAdministrative Management is much less ambitiousabout decentralizing personnel and humanresource management. The law requires only twotechnical staff positions at the commune level: acommune clerk appointed and paid by the Ministryof Interior to assist the commune council, and anaccountant from the provincial treasury. Theseindividuals wield central influence over the other-wise relatively autonomous commune councils,although the commune chief can request theappointment of a new clerk based on the council'sdecision. If needed, councils may directly employother staff, whom the law deems outside the \"Stateframework.\"These employees are retained on a tem-porary basis for the duration of the council's man-date, but the next council can extend their terms. At the commune level, general administration expenditures are restricted to 30 percent or less ofthe allocation from the center. This limit reducesthe temptation for nepotism and overstaffing whilegiving communes considerable discretion in howfunds are spent within the threshold. There is con-cern that the centrally determined allowances paidto commune councilors are high relative to civil servant salaries, especially as the former are onlypart-time functionaries. This can foster resentmentamong local staff and further restrict administra-tive expenditures. The legal framework for deconcentration is less well defined, but the number of staff affected ishigh. As of 2003, some 78 percent of staff werebased in provinces, including health and educationemployees. The relevant central ministry deter-mines staffing needs and positions at the provinciallevel, but provincial administrations have discre-tion in whom they hire (World Bank 2002b).Though recruitment is supposed to be based oncompetitive examinations administered by theState Secretariat for Civil Service, anecdotal evi-dence indicates that provinces do not strictly followthis requirement (World Bank 2003a). Similarly,promotions within each grading category are to bebased on merit, but seniority appears to play astronger role in practice. Performance evaluationsshould be conducted annually, but this is notcommon. Disciplinary procedures exist but are146 East Asia Decentralizesrarely used. Incentives are therefore not structured to encourage civil servants to perform well and improve over time. Incentives are further dampened by extremely low and highly compressed pay. Wages are so lowthat many civil servants are forced to seek addi-tional employment in the private and informal sec-tors, and the resulting absenteeism underminespublic sector performance. While ministries areresponsible for monitoring attendance, punish-ment for absenteeism is rare (World Bank 2002b).Low pay also affects how civil servants spend theirtime when they are at work. For example, the pay-ment of per diems for field visits encourages staff tofocus on activities that require travel, regardless ofwhether this is the most efficient use of their timeor is indeed necessary. The central government determines salaries, allowances, and social benefits, which local govern-ments must pay on a priority basis. This limits theflexibility of provincial budget managers and maycrowd out other important activities. At the provin-cial level, personnel expenditures averaged 48 per-cent of total expenditures in fiscal year 2002,though this figure ranged from 18.6 percent inMondul Kiri to 57.4 percent in Kandal (WorldBank 2002b). This share is much higher than the33 percent that the central government spends onits wage bill (World Bank 2003a). 19Throughout the Cambodian civil service, a lack of systematic estab-lishment control has allowed the proliferation ofcontract workers and high levels of overtime pay,and these problems are likely even more noticeableat the local level. The combination of low pay, low staff motiva- tion, and low mobility has left line ministries des-perate to skew incentives back toward improvedservice delivery, and several ad hoc responses haveevolved. The Ministry of Health has allowed healthcenters to collect user fees and to apply 49 percentof receipts to supplement staff salaries. 20This approach has shown tangible benefits, as the use ofhealth centers has risen by up to 60 percent. Clientsare evidently willing to pay extra for better service.As Turner notes, \"The salary supplements meanthat staff are likely to devote more time to their offi-cial duties. When salaries might be only US$15 permonth, an extra US$10 makes a considerable differ-ence\" (2002, 357). However, these supplementsmay lead to pay inequalities across regions. TheMinistry of Education, Y outh, and Sports has tried to improve the efficiency of education servicesthrough financial incentives, including pay supple-ments for work in remote areas, double shifts ormultigrade teaching, and performance incentives toheads of provincial and district education offices. Balancing Caution and Action. The measured approaches to decentralization in Thailand andCambodia reflect expressed concerns on the part ofboth governments that local administrations andtheir staff do not yet have the capacity to takeresponsibility for service delivery. In Cambodiathese concerns have some basis in reality; in Thai-land, however, they may reflect a weakened politicaldrive toward decentralization. In both cases, policymakers have sought to avoid the potential dangers ofdecentralization by putting capacity building first. Capacity. Low capacity is certainly an issue in Cambodia, where decades of civil war and theatrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime took adevastating toll on the country's pool of humanresources. Even in Thailand, a middle-incomecountry with a bustling capital city, most local gov-ernments lack the technical skills and institutionalresources to deliver even basic services. Both coun-tries have created decentralized structures withoutdevolving significant authority or responsibility. Developing the skills of local staff is seen as the bridge between these initial steps and more sig-nificant decentralization. In Thailand, municipalstaff are regularly rotated to enhance the sharing ofknowledge and experience among subnational civilservants. Various training institutions offer a widearray of courses, but these have not yet been incor-porated into a focused strategy for developing localcapacity in a sustainable manner. Training andtechnical assistance for decentralization are alsogrowing rapidly in Cambodia, building on the suc-cess of the donor-supported Seila Program. A criti-cal challenge for Cambodia is to leverage this posi-tive experience to design coherent and sustainablecapacity-building initiatives that extend to all localstaff. Thailand and Cambodia have also turned todeconcentration as on-the-job training for civilservants\u2014in Thailand, through Local EducationAuthorities and Area Health Boards, and inCambodia, through Health Center ManagementCommittees, which have the authority to supple-ment staff salaries with proceeds from user fees.Managing Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 147Capacity is not just about technical and bureau- cratic skills, however. The institutional and finan-cial capacity of local governments is also crucial. Inboth Cambodia and Thailand, many local govern-ments are simply too small\u2014in geographicalsize, population, staff numbers, and budgets\u2014toexecute their functions. Most of Thailand's tambons employ only a handful of staff and cannot be con-sidered viable units of government, as many areunable to support even a primary school let alonemore technical services such as infrastructure. InCambodia, a maximum of 11 people sit on thecommune councils, supported by two centrallyappointed civil servants. Incentives. The small size of local governments has influenced the incentives of civil servants totake local employment, which has, in turn, affectedservice delivery. Few local civil service positions areavailable, and those that are sit at lower grade levelswith low salaries and limited career paths. Attract-ing highly skilled professionals is difficult, as localgovernments do not have enough work to sustainfull-time technical experts. As a result, central offi-cials in Thailand have strongly resisted transfer tolocal service. The Thai government has attemptedto address this by offering financial incentives tothose who volunteer, but unclear rules andbenefits have prevented this program from havingany significant effect. In Cambodia, where over three-quarters of staff are based in the field, localstaff are reportedly migrating to provincial centersin search of opportunities to supplement very lowpublic sector wages. Local public servants are ineffect being paid full time to work for part of theday. This is a particular problem in health clinics,which despite a 24-hour mandate often remainclosed for most of the day. The government maywant to consider explicitly allowing part-time workin public health facilities so they can ensure contin-uous availability of care. 21 Autonomy . In both Thailand and Cambodia, lim- its on personnel expenditures have prevented localgovernments from hiring enough staff to get the jobdone\u2014and even from filling all the positions towhich they are entitled. In Cambodia's KampongCham province, however, low use of health servicesmeans that even the small numbers of local staffemployed in provincial and district offices are exces-sive compared with the workload (WHO 2003).This hinders the efficiency and effectiveness ofservice delivery. Though local managers in these two countries do enjoy discretion in whom they hire,rural communities do not have access to the highly skilled staff available in the center. In Cambodia, alack of predictable financing further constrains theautonomy of local leaders. Unsure of when and inwhat quantity resources will arrive, field-basedmanagers are reluctant to make long-term invest-ments, including in human resources. The govern-ment has taken some steps to alleviate this problemby piloting mechanisms for streamlined executionof budgets in priority sectors. One example is thePriority Action Program, which allows local educa-tion authorities to supplement the low pay of theirstaff. Still, in these traditionally hierarchical soci-eties, local managerial autonomy remains limited. Accountability . The limited autonomy of subna- tional governments in Cambodia and Thailandposes important challenges for the accountability oflocal staff. In both countries, local governmentsat the lowest tier are officially accountable topopularly elected assemblies. Y et, so far, they areresponsible only for a limited set of tasks, and mostdecisions are handed down from higher levels. As aresult, it is difficult for local citizens to hold civil ser-vants responsible for the quality and timeliness oftheir services. Community monitoring is also lim-ited by incomplete dissemination of informationon decentralization plans and transferred responsi-bilities. The flow of information on public prefer-ences is interrupted by the \"missing middle\" ofdecentralized politics, as provincial authorities inCambodia and Thailand are not elected and thusreport only to the central government. Despite thetime taken by both governments to lay a solid foun-dation for decentralization, many local officials arestill not fully aware of their own responsibilities\u2014and thus the outcomes for which they are account-able. Local standards and benchmarks are not yet inplace to help the Thai and Cambodian central gov-ernments evaluate local performance. In bothcountries, vote buying, corruption, and elite cap-ture may be significant at local levels, posing animportant risk to decentralization plans. Successfully Managing the Civil Service: The Way Forward East Asia's experience with administrative decen- tralization highlights both the opportunities and148 East Asia Decentralizesthe challenges associated with devolving authority for managing the civil service to lower levels of gov-ernment. As the case studies show, decentralizingthe management of human resources can improvethe responsiveness and resourcefulness of localgovernments. Y et, without careful design, devolu-tion can also bring fiscal imbalances, negativeincentives, and confused accountability at the locallevel. There is no single formula for successful civilservice management in a decentralized context. Success can be found in various forms, and tactics that work in one context may produce theopposite result in a different environment. Thediverse approaches of the six cases offer lessons forcountries considering decentralizing civil servicemanagement. The relatively smooth start to BigBang decentralization in Indonesia shows theimportance of carefully managing administrativeelements of the transition, as when the central gov-ernment continued to pay the salaries of trans-ferred civil servants on an interim basis. The lim-ited implementation of decentralization policies inThailand shows that having the approach right onpaper does not necessarily lead to getting it rightin practice. Nonetheless, the latter is important,as evidenced by the legal ambiguities and rever-sals arising in the wake of Indonesia's rapiddecentralization. The experience of East Asian countries in man- aging the capacity, incentives, autonomy, andaccountability of the subnational civil service canprovide valuable lessons for other countries.The relatively stable transitions to decentralizationin the Philippines and Indonesia show that coun-tries can strengthen local capacity on-the-job.Cambodia's positive experience with improving theuse and quality of health services validates the roleof positive incentives\u2014such as salary supplementsfrom user fees\u2014in motivating civil servants toperform better. Vietnam's experiment with block-grant budgeting in Ho Chi Minh City has reducedadministrative costs and overstaffing, showing thatmore local autonomy can improve civil service effi-ciency. 22Finally, Vietnam's recent passage of a Bud- get Law that clarifies the responsibilities of variouslevels of government, as well as the experience ofthe Philippines in improving performance throughcommunity report cards, shows how efforts bothwithin and outside the government can improvethe accountability of civil servants.The experiences of East Asian countries also highlight several critical dilemmas that govern-ments must address in designing policies and insti-tutions for administrative decentralization: Centralized Control vs. Decentralized Management Implicit in the notion of decentralization is the devolution of some responsibility and authority tolocal levels, which brings decisions on public serv-ice delivery closer to clients while freeing centralgovernment of the day-to-day details of localadministration. On the other hand, retaining somecontrol at the central level can yield substantialbenefits, including national minimum standardsfor service delivery and wider mobility within thecivil service. It is critical for decentralization policy to achieve a rational equilibrium between these opposing butvalid considerations . Decentralization policies should not aim to devolve all authority to the locallevel, but rather to redefine the responsibilities of thecenter and local governments. Central authoritiesmust recast themselves as guides, providing localadministrations with a comprehensive, feasiblenational policy framework and enhancing their abil-ity to evaluate local performance. At the same time,policies must align the responsibilities andautonomy of local managers. The roles of local gov-ernments and their civil servants must be clearlyspecified and accompanied by the resources andflexibility to tailor activities to the needs of residents,as well as by mechanisms to ensure accountabilityand prevent proximity from opening the door toelite capture. Clear, locally feasible standards forminimum performance can mitigate the risks ofdevolving autonomy to subnational governments,as can better monitoring of performance throughthe collection, maintenance, and transmissionof information on performance across levels ofgovernment. Uniformity vs. Unification of the Civil ServiceThe degree to which countries devolve authority for civil service management has implications foruniformity across the civil service. If the centertotally circumscribes the conditions of local publicemployment, administrative decentralization willremain a myth, and its potential benefits unreal-ized. On the other hand, if local managers areentirely free to adjust salary and staffing levels, theManaging Human Resources in a Decentralized Context 149size and composition of local governments\u2014and their paychecks\u2014are likely to vary considerablyand may lead to interregional inequalities inemployment conditions. In its ideal form, a country's civil service will be uniform but not unified . Public servants will share a distinct national identity without necessarily beingsubject to identical rules on pay and employment.Countries can foster servicewide identity throughjoint training of civil servants working in differentlocalities, or by creating subnational associationssuch as the League of Mayors in the Philippines orprofessional groups that bring together civil ser-vants who confront similar issues across the coun-try. At the same time, some degree of local variation is important. Solutions to inequitable salary differ-entials include allowing local governments to topup centrally defined base wages through user feesand other own-source revenues, as in Cambodia,China, and Vietnam, or having the center set asalary range but allowing local managers toestablish exact salaries. If working conditions varyacross subnational governments, public servicecommissions could manage the careers and interre- gional mobility of subnational civil servants. Thesecommissions must have the authority to recruit,transfer, and properly oversee staff, however (seebox 7.2). Economies of Scale vs. Client Responsiveness Administrative decentralization also raises ques- tions about the appropriate level of government towhich responsibilities should be devolved. If thegoal is to bring government closer to the people,then countries should hand off public service pro-vision to the lowest tier of government, where civilservants are best placed to understand and respondto the needs of local residents. However, improvingthe responsiveness of local governments throughproximity can disrupt the potential for economiesof scale. Running a government, no matter how bigor small, requires a minimum number of staff\u2014accountants, managers, and secretaries, forexample\u2014and thus a minimum of human andfinancial resources.150 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 7.2 Lessons from Uganda's District Service Commissions Uganda's decentralization experience is gener- ally considered a success story in terms of itsextent and impact. As in Indonesia and thePhilippines, decentralization in Uganda took onthe characteristics of a Big Bang following an eraof political opening. Along with the launch ofregular local elections and the transfer of broadservice responsibilities and attendant fiscalresources to local governments, the countrytook steps to decentralize the administrativeapparatus. Staff posted to districts formallytransferred to local governments, and separateDistrict Service Commissions (DSCs) were set upto manage human resources in district and localadministrations. The right of the DSCs to hire, fire, and over- see subnational staff was enshrined in the newConstitution and further detailed in the LocalGovernment Act. DSCs were meant to provideinstitutional protection for the relative auton-omy of district governments in managingsubnational civil servants. However, the systemhas encountered several obstacles. Recruitmentprocedures are slow, performance evalua-tions rarely occur, and the authority of DSCs toenforce disciplinary decisions is limited. More- over, because the central Public Service Com-mission defines the size of local governmentsand institutions, vets DSC membership, andapproves recruiting standards, the central gov-ernment retains influence over subnational per-sonnel decisions. Finally, the existence of a sep-arate DSC in each district\u2014and the associatedrise in fiscal transfers and local employment\u2014has created political pressure to add newdistricts. This can lead to the proliferation ofsmaller and smaller local administrations andeventually to a loss of scale economies andoperating efficiency. As East Asian countries grapple with how best to manage civil servants under decentralization,the Ugandan experience with DSCs\u2014both posi-tive and negative\u2014may provide a useful guide.If designed well, subnational public service com-missions can promote the qualifications and pro-fessionalism of local civil services throughout thecountry. Sources: Ndegwa and Levy 2003; Evans and Manning 2003.In devolving responsibilities to the local level, cen- tral governments must consider the capacity of smallcivil services to undertake complex technical andmanagerial tasks, and avoid the proliferation of unvi-able local administrations . Small local governments generally have difficulty paying the salaries ofhighly skilled staff, and those staff are unlikely tohave enough technical work to keep them busy fulltime. Diseconomies of scale in providing publicservices are a particular issue in Cambodia andThailand, where local budgets and staffs are toosmall to viably provide such services. In thesecountries, ongoing boundary reviews may boostlocal technical capacity by consolidating local units,but they have not led to any decisions thus far.Alternatively, local governments could considerjoining forces to provide public services that requiremore sophisticated technical equipment and skills,or that create spillover benefits for other jurisdic-tions. In China and Indonesia, on the other hand,the larger scale of subnational governments limitstheir ability to effectively reach local populations. In addition to striking a balance in decentraliza- tion design, countries also face important decisionsin sequencing reforms. Administrative decentral-ization entails two main temporal tradeoffs: Capacity First or Capacity through Decentrali- zation? How best to sequence decentralization reforms and capacity-building initiatives is a sub-ject of considerable debate. On the one hand, ana-lysts see devolution of responsibility for manage-ment and public services as a necessary step inbuilding individual and institutional capacity. Skillsdevelopment, performance incentives, and innova-tion are encouraged through \"learning by doing,\"which is generally a more sustainable and individu-alized approach than occasional courses developedwithout close attention to the specific tasks per-formed by civil servants. On the other hand,Prud'homme and others warn of the \"dangers ofdecentralization\": the low capacity and inexperi-ence of local civil servants can mean a sharp deteri-oration in the quality and efficiency of public serv-ices (Prud'homme 1995). The critical challenge is to maintain forward momentum while balancing capacity considerations.Asymmetric approaches to decentralization canallow gradual devolution of responsibilities to localgovernments that have demonstrated the capacityto take on new tasks. Thailand, for example, has seen some success with ad hoc forms that devolveautonomy to social sector agencies based on \"readi-ness\" criteria. However, it is important not to allowoverly targeted approaches to delay the realizationof decentralization's potential benefits. The experi-ence of East Asia's rapid decentralizers\u2014Indonesiaand the Philippines\u2014shows that countries canbuild capacity through decentralization. In this sce- nario, careful planning for coordinated trainingwithin a national framework that is sensitive tolocal considerations is essential. Civil Service Reform before or after Decentrali- zation? Though a full discussion is outside the scope of this chapter, the nexus between decentral-ization and civil service reform is worth mention-ing. In principle, it makes more sense to decentral-ize the structure and management of the civilservice after ensuring that it is efficient and effectiveat the national level. Y et given the political drive fordecentralization and the difficulty of civil servicereform, many countries cannot wait for these tooccur before decentralizing. On the other hand, thedecision to delay civil service reform until afterdecentralization can allow the central governmentto transfer the political burden of difficult policymeasures. Countries should explicitly consider thelinks between these two key reforms to avoid repli-cating national flaws\u2014such as duplication of effortor overstaffing\u2014at the local level. Endnotes 1.

Under this revised law, provincial governors will have authority to hire, fire, and relocate provincial staff only atechelon 2 and below. Similarly, heads of districts and citieswill be able to hire, fire, and relocate staff only at echelon 2and below, and only after consulting with the provincialgovernor. 10. Some local governments, though, have begun to informally supplement salaries. Also, several regional allowances areoffered that are imperfectly recorded. 11.

These characteristics haveimportant implications for the design of healthpolicy in general, and especially for a decentralizedsystem of service delivery and sector management.This chapter outlines the decentralization healthpolicies and programs of Indonesia, the Philippines,and Vietnam, focusing on the period 1985-2003,spanning the years before and after significantdecentralization began in these countries. Thechapter also points to areas where reforms mayfacilitate more effective health care delivery. The Health Care Context of Decentralization Experience with decentralizing health in develop- ing economies is limited, and the literature reveals 1558 Decentr alizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam Samuel S. Lieberman, Joseph J. Capuno, and Hoang Van Minh no widely accepted, best-practice health policy framework. This is partly because decentralizationin many low-income countries is a recent develop-ment, while affluent countries historically movedin a centralizing direction as constituent statescame together to form federal unions. Another constraining factor has been the top- down, centrist bias in the influential Health for All(HFA) paradigm, used to build dominating butdifficult-to-manage and ineffective health ministriesin many countries. HFA 's main sponsor, the WorldHealth Organization (WHO), has been traditionallyuncomfortable with decentralization. The literatureon government roles in health systems is relevant tothe extent that privatization is a form of decentral-ization, but this literature misses the critical decen-tralization issue: the allocation of roles among levelsof government. The literature also lacks a connectionbetween options for decentralization and healthfinancing. Meanwhile, most approaches that focuson health challenges\u2014including the MillenniumDevelopment Goals of the United Nations and theWorld Bank-sponsored Poverty Reduction StrategyPapers in developing countries\u2014assume a strongcentral role for ministries of health.156 East Asia Decentralizes Nevertheless, a debate has developed around decentralization design issues, with contributorsdividing into two camps. Proponents see decen-tralization, if handled well, leading to systematiccitizen involvement in setting the goals, design,and financing for health policy, and in monitoringservice provision and other functions. In this view,decentralization can also spur providers to obtainthe skills, material support, and authority theyneed to offer high-quality services. Decentraliza-tion can further enable clients to secure informa-tion, financing, and bargaining power, and offerhealth ministries a chance to jettison impracticalobligations and carve out a new role and image. Detractors warn, however, that (badly designed) decentralization heightens vulnerability to near-term crises and longer-term risks. Typical start-upproblems include staff opposition, leading tobreakdown of deployment and other personnelmechanisms; mismatches between health carefunding and spending requirements; ambiguity inresponsibilities and premature delegation of func-tions, leading to deteriorating service quality; anddisruptions in reporting, accountability, and qual-ity control. Medium-term concerns include risingsystem costs. Specifically, downsizing administra-tive units may yield designs for key health func-tions that are neither technically efficient nor cost-effective because of diseconomies of scale. Such\"transitional\" problems may be difficult to correct. Because of these risks, public health commenta- tors have called for careful introduction and man-agement of decentralization. Most analysts supportWHO's recommendation that countries phase indevolution under central guidance, subject to strin-gent criteria, with health ministries continuing totake responsibility for specialized services, medicalsupplies, basic education and training, and otherkey functions (WHO 1995). This advice illustratestwo recurring themes: that the overriding rationalefor health decentralization is improved effective-ness and efficiency, and that the timing of theprocess is subject to ex ante design. Such premises are usually not valid, since the impetus for decentralization is generally political.Improved health is only a second-order objective,with imperatives such as preserving national unityusually driving the process and shaping the deci-sion to devolve to particular levels of government. That was arguably the case in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which decentralized theirhealth services starting in 1992, 1996, and 2001, respectively. 1Evidence suggests that health ministries in these countries initially were not prepared toarticulate and assume a new specialized role of sys-tem manager rather than main provider. Inconsis-tent policies further indicated that expediencyrather than strategy guided official responses totransition problems. At the same time, the faltering performance of the health systems in these countries beforedecentralization signaled a need for significantchanges in health policy. In the Philippines,improvements in infant survival rates and otherhealth status indicators in the 1980s were begin-ning to plateau, indicating decreasing returnsfrom health expenditures that were higher than inother developing countries in terms of grossdomestic product (GDP) (Solon et al. 1992). In Vietnam, the collapse of the agricultural financing system and economic reform in the 1980sundermined funding for primary health care serv-ices and produced shortages of drugs and skills,deteriorating quality of care, and a decline by a halfor more in use of government facilities. Fundinggaps also led to higher user fees, which became afinancial barrier and reduced access to care by thepoor. In Indonesia, the 1997 financial crisis brought funding cuts that confirmed the susceptibility ofthe government network to drug shortages andother breakdowns. But performance problems hadexisted earlier. The country did not sustain favor-able trends in survival and nutrition rates from the1980s in the 1990s, despite large-scale intervention.Use of public services also faltered. After rising tonearly a third, the share of people who soughtoutpatient care from public providers fell below30 percent by 1995, and below 20 percent by 1998.Meanwhile, households in the top expenditurequintile were far more likely than the poor to usepublic facilities as inpatients, and nearly as likely asto use such facilities as outpatients. Objectives of the Chapter This chapter examines decentralization experiences in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam with aneye toward three sets of questions. First, how candeveloping countries design decentralization toprovide an appropriate framework for a publichealth system, and what policies and instrumentspromise to be effective in improving the efficiency and equity of a decentralized health system? Second,how should countries handle transition problemsand other risks? Third, what lessons do the experi-ences of these three countries reveal? In addressing these questions, the chapter exam- ines the emerging role of central health ministries.Critical functions include monitoring and control-ling communicable diseases, setting standards andassuring quality for devolved health services andpharmaceuticals, ensuring access of the poor tohealth services, and sustaining health financing. The three countries have broad features that facilitate comparison. All have tropical or semi-tropical climates, and all are highly populateddeveloping countries composed mostly of rural-based agricultural households, with significantnumbers of poor. Each country also has a colonialhistory in which the struggle for independence ledto a unitary form of government with a strongcenter. Communicable diseases are the main causeof morbidity and mortality in all these countries,although each is now experiencing an epidemio-logical transition that brings growth of non-communicable, lifestyle-related diseases. Y et eachcountry also possesses unique features that provideinteresting contrasts to the other two. Unlike thePhilippines and Indonesia, for example, Vietnamhas adopted a market-oriented economic policyonly recently while retaining socialist features in its government structure. Unlike Vietnam, Indonesiaand the Philippines are archipelagos that are insu-lated to a degree from disease transmission acrossland borders. The available data limit comparison between these countries. Official statistics on health, demo-graphics, government finances, and other socio-economic indicators vary in scope, detail, and qual-ity. The same applies to secondary sources ofinformation. Data constraints also add to themethodological challenges of tracing the impact ofdecentralization on health amid other socioeco-nomic factors, external conditions, and policy inter-ventions. Thus, the analysis draws only broad con-clusions and policy guidelines. The analysis suggests that decentralization divi- dends so far have proved modest and concentratein some areas of each country. Decentralizationmay have helped sustain overall improvements inhealth status and spurred local initiatives in healthplanning, service delivery, and financing. However,decentralized arrangements have not worked as well as hoped, especially regarding access to high-quality health services for the poor. The Origins of Decentralization The fact that these countries have experienced only modest health gains from decentralization reflectscircumstances outside the control of policy makers.In particular, these countries introduced decentral-ization in less than favorable economic and politi-cal environments. For example, the 1997 Asianfinancial crisis underscored the direct link betweenmacroeconomic performance and health expendi-tures. Before 1998, the Philippine economy\u2014muchlike that of Indonesia and Vietnam\u2014was growingsteadily. Per capita income in the Philippines rosefrom US$2,310 in 1985 to US$3,870 in 1997. Fol-lowing the outbreak of the crisis in late 1997, percapita income fell to US$3,730. The impact of thecrisis in Indonesia was graver. Its per capita incomedeclined from US$3,030 in 1997 to US$2,580in 1998; by 2001 per capita income was US$2,900,still lower than before the crisis. Vietnam was lessaffected by the crisis, although per capita govern-ment health spending leveled off and may havefallen after the crisis. In the Philippines, the crisis prompted the national government to invoke \"an unmanageablepublic sector deficit\"\u2014a provision under the LocalGovernment Code of 1991 that allows a 10 percentcut in the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) dis-tributed to lower levels of government. 2Because most local governments depended heavily on theIRA, the reduction further reduced local healthspending, especially among provinces and munici-palities, which had absorbed the bulk of devolvedhealth functions. Uneven regional growth aggravated the situa- tion. In the Philippines, provinces in the EasternVisayas and Northern Mindanao continued to lagbehind other provinces, especially those in Metro-politan Manila and surrounding provinces. InVietnam, the cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh weredeveloping faster than other areas, and similarunevenness existed in Indonesia. Utilization ratesand other indicators of health access therefore var-ied widely across regions in all three countries. Indonesia and the Philippines also implemented decentralization amid considerable uncertainty fol-lowing political crises. After the fall of the MarcosDecentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 157regime, the Philippines ratified a new Constitution in 1987 and further articulated strong decentralistprovisions in the Local Government Code of 1991.In Indonesia, the overthrow of the Soeharto regimein 1998, and then de facto secession of the erstwhileprovince of East Timor in 2000, contributed to theclamor for decentralization. The Philippines expe-rienced several military uprisings after 1986, themost recent in late 2003, and has had four presi-dents and nine secretaries of the Ministry of Healthunder the present Constitution. These frequentmusical chairs in the health ministry have disruptedpolicy priorities and the ministry's momentum inadapting to a decentralized setting. Persistent ruralinsurgencies and kidnappings in areas such asSouthern Mindanao have made it difficult for boththe private sector to pursue investments and thepublic sector to reach out to the poor. Weak governance in the Philippines, including corruption in key branches of government, has alsoled to loss of revenues and waste of limitedresources. Mechanisms like Health Boards andother local consultative bodies have seldom beenconvened for counsel or feedback, contrary to theintent of the Local Government Code (World Bank2000a). However, the proliferation of nongovern-mental organizations (NGOs) and other civil soci-ety groups has been a major positive development.Many such organizations now work side by side with key national agencies in agrarian reform,health advocacy, local capacity building, livelihoodprojects, community mobilization, and governancereform. A second set of reasons for the modest gains from decentralization in these three countriesrelates to weaknesses in policy itself. While externalfactors limited the potential benefits, better man-agement by the central ministry of health, espe-cially in critical health functions, would havehelped. Experiences in the three countries suggesthow to define and pursue an effective role for thecentral health ministry. The next section analyzes the features and implementation of each country's decentralizationpolicy. The following section examines the impactof decentralized health services on health status,service coverage, overall efficiency, and equity inthese three countries. Ensuing sections examineintergovernmental fiscal challenges, personnelmanagement, and service delivery under thedecentralized health care systems in these three countries. The final section summarizes findingsand draws lessons regarding the role of the centralhealth ministry in managing the health sector. Health Policy under Decentralization Consistent with their respective constitutions, the three countries passed legislation that enabled, if notmandated, the decentralization of health services.Besides added administrative powers and responsi-bilities, local governments attained greater fiscalautonomy through higher shares of national gov-ernment revenues and expanded taxation powers. In Indonesia, the principal enabling legislative acts were Law 22 and Law 25 of 1999, while Regula-tion 25 of 1999 facilitated implementation. ThePhilippines promulgated decentralization throughthe Local Government Code of 1991, implementedthe following year. In Vietnam, the doi moi economic reforms that began in 1986 and the Public AdministrationReform of 1995 shaped health decentralization,with implementation based largely on the 1996 and2002 State Budget laws. The latter two measuresbrought fundamental changes in the preparation,approval, and execution of budgets for all govern-ment agencies, from the central to local levels. Since2004, province-level People's Councils have hadmore authority to prioritize expenditures anddetermine sectoral allocations and transfers tolower tiers, and stronger means of mobilizingresources. Transfers from the center for stable peri-ods of three years will promote local planning,while provinces must produce forward-lookingexpenditure plans in return. Decree 10, another element in Vietnam's legal underpinning for decentralization, took effect inJuly 2002. When fully implemented, this decreewill give managers of facilities much greater con-trol over their budgets, and more (though still lim-ited) discretion regarding pay and employment,user charges for nonbasic services, and domesticborrowing. In each country, later laws further articulated, directly supported, or affected the decentralizationof health services. In the Philippines, for example,these laws included the Magna Carta for PublicHealth Workers of 1992, the Barangay Health 158 East Asia DecentralizesWorkers' Benefit and Incentives Act of 1995, and the National Health Insurance Act of 1995. InVietnam, the Seventh Communist Party Congresspassed a resolution to broaden the \"scope of respon-sibilities and power of the sectors and localities,\"and passed the Grassroots Democracy Decree in1999 (Communist Party of Vietnam 1993; Govern-ment of Vietnam 1999). Main Design Features and Implementation At first glance, the division of responsibility for critical health functions between the national andlocal governments in these countries broadlyreflects efficiency principles. That is, local govern-ments have assumed responsibility for health func-tions that are simple to administer or confer local-ized benefits. The central government or higherlocal governments have assumed responsibility forhealth functions with significant economies ofscale or interjurisdictional spillovers. For example,basic, primary health care services are assigned tocommunes in Vietnam, including the network ofvillage health workers, to villages in Indonesia, andto barangays (villages) in the Philippines. Primary- level health facilities are assigned to cities andmunicipalities in the Philippines and to districts inVietnam. Secondary-level hospitals are assignedto provinces in the Philippines and Vietnam.T ertiary-level and specialty hospitals, on the other hand, are mainly the responsibility of the centralgovernment\u2014that is, the central heath ministry\u2014in all three countries. Central governments continue to provide cer- tain public goods such as health research and devel-opment, and merit goods such as maternal, childcare, and family planning services. Local govern-ments are often involved in and sometimes cofi-nance these programs. However, overall, the devo-lution of health functions and corrective measuresreveal flaws. Decentralization occurred gradually in Vietnam and not without setbacks. Local mobilization wasseen as a key element in the country's impressiveachievements by the mid-1980s in delivering pri-mary health care. As mentioned, the combinedprovince and commune share of governmenthealth outlays was already significant in the early1990s. Thus, local officers had experience withdecentralization when the 1996 State Budget Lawassigned additional health tasks to provinces and districts (Fritzen 1999). The law established finan-cial links underpinning a unitary system in whichnational authority is delegated to lower levels. Ateach level, budget preparation and implementationare the responsibility of the People's Council. In contrast, implementation in the Philippines and Indonesia occurred in Big Bang fashion. Theformer completed the transfer of 45,896 healthpersonnel, along with hospitals, clinics, and otherfacilities, in 1993, two years after passing the LocalGovernment Code. Indonesia completed a similartransfer in 2001, less than two years after enactingLaws 22 and 25. The Big Bang approach has its merits, but expe- riences in Indonesia and the Philippines reveal itsdisadvantages. In Indonesia, decentralization lawsand rules and regulations do not provide enoughdetail on functional and operational responsibili-ties, resulting in confusion and divergence betweenprovinces and districts. For instance, provinces aresupposed to handle cross-district tasks, but nodefinitive finding tells them how to apply that rule.The laws and regulations governing decentraliza-tion are also often inconsistent with other laws,especially civil service rules. This inconsistency haslimited the ability of local governments to right-size inherited health bureaucracies and anticipatepersonnel matters. Moreover, administrative preparation was inad- equate. For example, many local officials in thePhilippines were unaware of the precise nature andextent of their new expenditure responsibilities andpowers, and the central Department of Health(DOH) was slow to transform itself structurallyand operationally. 3Lack of personnel severely hampered the Local Government Assistance andMonitoring Service, created to troubleshoot transi-tion problems, and the service lacked clout, as dif-ferent DOH divisions managed public health pro-grams as before. With DOH looking uncertain,many local governments seemed to adopt a wait-and-see strategy, apparently hoping that the agencywould be blamed for the breakdown in the publichealth system and be forced to recentralize healthfunctions. In different degrees, these three countries also introduced local governance mechanisms to pro-mote transparency, accountability, and participa-tion as they devolved health services. This, ofDecentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 159course, complicated the transition, as local govern- ments initially had to adopt these mechanisms ontheir own without much guidance or experience,leading to delays, perfunctory compliance, or fail-ure to convene the mandated consultative bodies. Health Dividends under Decentralization On the whole, each country sustained favorable trends in overall health status after decentralization(see table 8.1). In the Philippines, gaps in healthstatus across regions continued to close during the1990s. Measured as the difference in infant mortal-ity rates (IMR) between the poorest region (EasternVisayas) and the richest region (MetropolitanManila), the gap narrowed from 15 in 1980 to 9.8 in1985. By 1990 the gap was almost zero, with theIMRs of Metropolitan Manila and Eastern Visayas27.4 and 27.1, respectively. In 1995, the gapremained near zero, although the IMRs of Metro-politan Manila and Eastern Visayas improved to21.3 and 21.6, respectively. Following the 1997Asian financial crisis, however, the disparitywidened. By 2000 the IMR of Metropolitan Manilawas 19.4\u2014worse than the 10.7 of Eastern Visayas. 4 Each study country also experienced an epi- demiological transition in the 1990s, in which theincidence of chronic, lifestyle-related diseases likecancer and heart diseases began to match\u2014if not overtake\u2014that of communicable diseases such astuberculosis and malaria (Solon et al. 1999). In Vietnam, disparities in survival rates between regions appear to have widened in the late 1990s,captured in the rising ratio of highest to lowestregional IMRs by region. After growing from 1.7 in1989 to 2.3 in 1994, this ratio rose to 3.6 in 2002.This is not to imply that rates and underlying con-ditions were static. On the contrary, IMRs them-selves fell by at least half in every region betweenroughly the early 1990s and 2003. However, thedecline in these changes was extraordinary, drop-ping to a third or less of the early 1990s figure in theMekong, Central Highlands, Southeast, and Cen- tral Coast regions. Some Progress in Health Outputs and Access The favorable trend in overall health status was arguably due partly to progress in health outputsand service coverage. In the Philippines, for exam-ple, the proportion of births attended by trainedhealth workers, and of the population with accessto clean water source and sanitation services, rosein the 1985-2000 period. Similar developments in health status, outputs, and access indicators occurred in Indonesia overthe same period. The 2002 Demographic Survey160 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 8.1 Selected Health Status Indicators Year Indicators 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2001 2002 Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) Indonesia 79 70 60 46 35 33 1.9Philippines 65 55 45 36 30 29 1.9Vietnam 50 43 36 32/30 28/18 30/18 1.9Under-5 mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) Indonesia 125 108 91 66 48 45 1.9Philippines 81 74 66 51 40 38 1.9Vietnam 70 60 50 43 34 38 1.9Life expectancy at birthIndonesia 55 59 62 64 66 66.3 66.7Philippines 61 63 66 68 69 69.5 69.8Vietnam 60 63 65 67 69 69.4 69.7 Sources: World Bank 2002; WHO 2002.and Health Survey pointed to a continuation or even an acceleration of favorable trends in fertility,contraceptive use, malnutrition, and trained mater-nal care. Some indicators worsened: immunizationrates fell between 1997 and 2002-3 for childrenunder age two, for example, while the prevalenceof childhood illness remained the same as in 1997.In Vietnam, on the other hand, output and accessmeasures all pointed in a positive directionbetween the mid-1990s and 2002. For example, thecountry reported a significant increase in child-hood vaccination coverage, and in the proportionsof women receiving prenatal care and giving birthattended by skilled health personnel (Committeefor Population, Family, and Children 2003). Health Expenditures Decentralization may have more than sustained momentum in improving health status and evenreversed worsening trends. Unfortunately, availabledata do not allow us to verify these two supposi-tions, nor do input measures such as health expen-ditures enable definitive conclusions. According to the World Development Report 2004, annual health expenditures remained more or less a constant proportion of GDP throughout1997-2001 in the three countries. The averageannual proportion was 2.5 percent in Indonesia,3.5 percent in the Philippines, and 4.9 percent inVietnam. In per capita terms, however, total healthspending fell in Indonesia from US$26 in 1997 toUS$16 in 2001, and in the Philippines from US$41in 1997 to US$30 in 2001 (World Bank 2004). 5 Asia's financial crisis led to a steep decline in 1998in health spending in these two countries: 50 percentin Indonesia and 24 percent in the Philippines.Seemingly immune to the financial crisis, Vietnam'sper capita health spending rose from US$16 in 1997to US$21 in 2001. 6In general, health expenditures as a percentage of GDP in these three countrieswere similar to those of most of their neighbors.For example, the average percentage share of healthexpenditures in GDP in Thailand and Malaysia was3.7 and 3.2, respectively. Meanwhile, the public sector share of total health expenditures in each of the three countriesdid not change much between 1997 and 2001.Indonesia's public sector accounted for roughly afourth of total health expenditures. In Vietnam, thepublic sector share fell slightly from 31.5 percent in 1997 to 28.5 percent in 2001. In the Philippines,the public share rose from 43 percent in 1997 to45 percent in 2001. A closer look at public sector outlays reveals a shift in the financing burden from the central tolocal governments. Most local governmentsdevoted health spending to hospital and personalcare services, much like the pattern before devolu-tion. This is understandable, as local governmentsabsorbed many hospitals under decentralization.However, this orientation may be inappropriategiven the high prevalence of communicablediseases and high relative cost of hospital-basedinterventions. The Philippines certainly saw such a shift in financial burden. The annual share of local govern-ments in public health expenditures climbed upfrom less than 5 percent before 1992 to 12.5 percentin 1993. By 2001, the local share reached 20.9 per-cent, exceeding the 16.6 percent share of thenational government. Moreover, personal care serv-ices constitute the bulk of public expenditures forhealth in the Philippines, and, ominously, a grow-ing portion of the health outlays of local govern-ments as well (Solon et al. 1992). In Indonesia, regional governments now account for most routine spending, while developmentspending at the regional level grew fourfold. How-ever, central development outlays rose almostthreefold, and nearly half of development expendi-tures still come from the central budget. Under-standably, local governments continue to regard theMinistry of Health as a key supplier of financialresources as well as personnel, equipment, drugs,and vaccines. 7 In Vietnam in the early 1990s, subnational gov- ernments, including those at the commune level,were already spending more on health than thecentral government (Knowles et al. 2003). Provin-cial spending accounted for 68 percent of govern-ment health expenditures in 1991 (not includingrevenues from user fees and donor support), whilecentral spending accounted for 13 percent. How-ever, five years later, after the country passed theLaw on State Budget, provinces accounted for53 percent and central units 26 percent of allgovernment outlays. By 2000 the latter figure hadfallen to 17 percent, while the province-level share(narrowly construed) had dropped to 44 percent.Decentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 161However, the thrust of the 1996 legislation would seem to suggest including revenue from healthinsurance and user fees in the provincial total. Inthat case,provincially\"controlled\"outlays accountedfor 76 percent of total government health spend-ing, up from 70 percent in 1996. (Donor outlaysare treated as a separate category influenced byparticular agendas and criteria.) In light of these financing and spending pat- terns, it is doubtful that decentralization haswidened access by the poor to quality health care. Anational client survey confirmed that Filipinos ingeneral were more satisfied with private hospitalsand clinics than with government health facilities.Filipinos also tended to rate traditional healers asmore satisfactory than any public providers (WorldBank 2001a). The low regard for public health serv-ices prevailed even among the poor, an indicationthat the public health system does not serve its tar-get clients well. A World Bank study of socioeconomic differ- ences in health, nutrition, and population inselected developing countries corroborated theseobservations (see table 8.2). In the Philippines,children born in 1998 to the poorest families weretwice as likely to die within a year as children bornto the richest families. The infant mortality rate forthe poorest families (48.8) was 1.7 times that of therichest families (28.8). The life chances of theseunfortunate Filipinos did not seem to improve withage: under-five mortality rates were 79.8 and 29.2for the poorest and richest families, respectively. Vietnam also had disparities in health status across economic groups, resembling those inIndonesia before decentralization. Like their coun- terparts in the Philippines, the poorest families had infant and under-five mortality rates severaltimes higher than those of the richest families.Discrepancies in health status between thepoorest and richest households appeared to beworse in Indonesia than in Bangladesh, India,the Philippines, and Vietnam. Perhaps because of the inferior quality of public health services, the poor\u2014like well-off fellowFilipinos\u2014continue to self-finance their access toprivate health services. Private sources, includingdirect out-of-pocket payments, accounted for anannual average share of 57 percent of total healthexpenditures in the Philippines from 1991-2001. Local Initiatives in Health Services and Financing Decentralization has given local authorities and other stakeholders greater leeway to adapt or evenreplace once-standard methods for delivering andfinancing health services. And these greater discre-tionary powers have led to numerous local innova-tions in health planning, service delivery, andfinancing. Most notably in the Philippines, thereare the provincial health insurance programs ofBukidnon and Guimaras, as well as other \"text-book\" cases, such as the health card system ofParanaque City, the City in the Pink of Healthprogram of Marikina City, and the CommunityPrimary Hospital Several of these programs havereceived formal recognition from government 162 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 8.2 Health Status of the Poorest and Richest Population Groups in Selected East Asian Countriesa Infant mortality rate Under-5 mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) (per 1,000 births) Country Poorest/ Poorest/ (year) Poorest Richest richest Poorest Richest richest a. Economic groups are based on asset (wealth) quintiles. agencies and private bodies such as the Galing Pook Foundation (see box 8.1) and the PhilippineHuman Development Network. 8 Vietnam has seen numerous instances of sponsored and spontaneous innovation at theprovince level. An example of the former was thehealth ministry's effort to encourage local responsesto childhood diseases, including community-determined indicators (Fritzen 1999). Reactions toHIV/AIDS illustrate the spontaneous case. As inseveral other provinces, the epidemic spurred theThanh Hoa government to pursue preventiveactivities such as harm reduction and 100 percentcondom use. These initiatives resulted from strongcommitment by the People's Committee. Besidesensuring the participation of the police (Depart-ment of Public Security), the committee allocatedan annual budget to fight HIV/AIDS. The com-mittee also organized a provincial Steering Com-mittee on HIV/AIDS headed by the Departmentof Health, under an umbrella Steering Committeeon HIV/AIDS, Drugs, and Prostitution Controlchaired by the vice-chair of the People's Commit- tee. District and communes adopted the samestructures. In Indonesia, Y ogyakarta province showed how to use the country's still immature decentralizedframework to introduce health sector reforms andelements of a health insurance system. Theprovince used donor funds to secure technicalassistance and conduct assessments, trials, bench-marking, workshops, training, and coordinationmeetings with districts, as well as advocacy events.The province established a board of trustees andnew fund-holder institutions, as well as a benefitpackage and an insurance premium. The province has created a plan for a quality council to accredit facilities and license practition-ers based on local standards. Meanwhile, theprovince increased user fees under local control toreflect the actual unit costs of providing services.Task forces developed strategies for improvingservice quality based on consumer surveys; pur-chasing equipment; developing accountabilityDecentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 163 BOX 8.1 Local Innovations in Health Service Delivery in the Philippines Charging User Fees for Health Services in Malalag, Davao del Sur In December 1993, the local Sangguniang Bayan (municipal council) of Malalag, in the provinceof Davao del Sur, enacted the Malalag RevenueCode. This code established a socialized feeschedule for health services, among other provi-sions. The graduated payment scheme reflectsusers' annual family income: those earningP=15,000, from P =15,000 to P =50,000, and more than P =50,000 pay 25 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent, respectively, of fixed servicecharges. The code also gave low-income familiespriority in receiving health services. Public con-sultations, hearings, and an information andeducation campaign overcame initial resistanceto the scheme. Partly as a result, the local gov-ernment earned about P =1 million worth of fees on an outlay of P =688,888. This enabled the gov- ernment to provide additional health services,including surgical, medical, and dental services.With these improvements, the local clientelehave become more demanding of the quality ofhealth services and the performance of healthpersonnel.Transforming a Rural Health Center into a Community Clinic in Sebaste, Antique Under Mayor Juanita de la Cruz, Sebaste in Antique\u2014a remote sixth-class municipality\u2014became a prime example of how to transform abasic rural health center into a full-service com-munity clinic despite limited resources. With onlyP=800,000 in IRA funds from the center, the gov- ernment tapped foreign donors, local people, andformer residents living abroad for support for itshealth goals while also appealing to the sense ofmission of health personnel. After creating a trustfund, the government infused P =3.085 million into the project from 1994 to 1998. By 1997, thecommunity clinic employed 16 people, includingtwo physicians, and remained open 24 hours aday, providing primary health care, laboratoryand pharmacy services, and minor surgery. Theclinic has reduced the cost of these services to thelocal clientele while also serving the medicalneeds of residents of neighboring municipalities.

The province launched the new system in 2003 by paying the premium to enable the poor to usepublic facilities. The program became available tothe nonpoor in 2004, competing with privateproviders in providing a benefit package. Theapproach in Y ogyakarta gives districts a key role, asspecified in Law 22, but also responds to the loss ofeconomies of scale that may make health servicesineffective and inefficient. The province encouragescross-district collaboration, especially in upgradingtechnical support, sharing medical and technicalspecialists and trainers, and organizing communi-cable disease control, quality assurance, and healtheducation and advocacy. The Joint Health Councilfacilitates such activities, with task forces makingrecommendations. But the provincially staffed T echnical Review T eam plays the largest role byreviewing district proposals and providing feed-back and guidance. A number of other provinces are closely watch- ing and applying this approach. Central agencieshave not been deeply involved, although Y ogyakartasought their guidance on establishing standards forits regulatory framework. Overall, the health impacts of decentralization are not easy to estimate. Few data indicate signifi-cant windfalls in health benefits linked to decen-tralization. The early phases were not incompatiblewith sustaining impressive overall improvements inhealth status, and decentralized governance openedthe way to promising local initiatives in healthplanning, service delivery, and financing. However,much better results would seem to be within reachthrough policy adjustments. Identifying appropriate policies\u2014though not easy\u2014is critical. In the Philippines, central agencies,often in partnership with NGOs, have documented,disseminated, and advocated best practices in localpublic services through the media, educational tripsfor local officials, and various training programs.Despite these initiatives, however, the speed ofinnovative practices has been limited, and the over-all level and quality of local health services havebarely improved. A lack of incentives rather thanmissing models\u2014including political dividends and other signals\u2014appears to be holding back neededpolicy interventions by local decision makers. Health Care and Intergovernmental Fiscal Challenges A country's intergovernmental fiscal system should meet the complex goals of its health system, as withother public services. The key to an effective fiscalsystem is \"finance follows function.\" The intergov-ernmental fiscal system must also usually addresshorizontal as well as vertical equity, key relation-ships between levels of government and jurisdic-tions, and incentives for collaboration. Weaknessesin the design of each country's fiscal system havehad important consequences for the delivery ofhealth services. In Vietnam, the budgeting and financing system formalized in the 1996 Budget Law revealed suchchallenges: Norms emerged during the 1990s to determine almost every kind of input into the system. Forexample, gaps between provinces in per capitahealth spending reflect a complex fund alloca-tion based on population norms and allocationsto and within sectors. These take into accountdiffering geographical conditions betweenprovinces but do not offset revenue and cost dis-advantages and variations in need. The Ministryof Finance may also rely on other criteria duringthe budget negotiating process. Provinces have substantial discretion in allocat- ing resources to districts and communes, andthe methods they use vary considerably. Dis-tricts have little autonomy, and interdistrictvariations are significantly greater than at theprovince level. The norm-based system relies on flows of accu- rate data. For example, user fees and insurancereimbursement rates reflect costs and expendi-tures in different settings. Besides the high costof regularly updating such information, thesefigures are unlikely to capture variations linkedto scale and quality as well as discretionary ele-ments. What's more, because the steps to createfee schedules are cumbersome, time consuming,and costly, the schedules remain in effect foryears; that in use today dates from 1995. 164 East Asia Decentralizes Despite formal autonomy at lower levels of gov- ernment, the norm-based system constrainsflexibility. Civil service salaries have first call onfunds and absorb most expenditures. Provinceswith fewer local revenues have less flexibility. The norm-based process limits sectoral inter- ventions. The Ministry of Health did not fullyparticipate in budget discussions and lackeddetailed information on expenditures byprovinces and lower levels of government. Theministry also could not assess whether actualspending by lower levels was consistent with sec-toral policies. Limited investment in local facilities, such as upgrades to community health centers, also af-fected quality of care, and more patients bypassedsuch facilities as a result. The Ministry of Health focused on allocating funds to national programs aiming at combat-ing high-priority diseases such as tuberculosis.Some of these programs were particularlyimportant to disadvantaged groups and imple-mented mainly through local governments.However, no mechanisms ensure that oncenational goals are met, those programs arediscontinued. Reliance on norms has also discouraged creation of medium-term planning frameworks thatfacilitate recognition of tradeoffs and set priori-ties between and within sectors. The December 2002 budget law, which took effect in January 2004, gives more discretion to sub-national governments. Province-level People'sCouncils have more power and a greater obligationto prioritize health spending, determine allocationsand transfers to lower tiers, implement policy, andmobilize resources. The fact that the central gov-ernment establishes three-year transfers once itreaches agreement with provinces on expenditureplans may allow the Ministry of Health to influenceallocations across functions and service levels. In the Philippines, the primary fiscal vehicle supporting decentralization is the Internal RevenueAllotment (IRA), which transfers funds to localgovernments. As noted, most local governmentsdepend heavily on this source, as do devolvedhealth services. The central Department of Health(DOH) also created the Local Government Assis-tance and Monitoring Service to manage transitionproblems, and to provide financial assistance to local governments unable to maintain health serv-ices or meet their Magna Carta obligations becauseof inadequate resources. DOH also implemented aconditional matching grant program, the Compre-hensive Health Care Agreements, intended tosecure local funding for devolved functions andcore public health programs. This reflected animportant part of the country's strategy of usingincentives and disincentives to achieve nationalobjectives in a decentralized system. However, the relationship between service deliv- ery and financing arrangements entailed significantweaknesses. For example, devolution of publicfacilities led to fragmentation of the hospital refer-ral system. Under the new regime, each hospital orclinic primarily serves the constituency of a localgovernment. Several provinces therefore reducedbudget appropriations to urban hospitals andchanneled resources to less-well-off municipalities,in the process raising the average cost of urbanservices. Instead of cofinancing these facilities withthe provinces, many cities opted to refurbish theirown clinics or build enclave hospitals. Further,weak monitoring of local compliance with Com-prehensive Health Care Agreements did not helpensure financing of the devolved services. Ensuring Equity In Vietnam, two factors have undermined the dis- tribution of heath services to the poor. First, thecentral government has not targeted resource flowsto poorer provinces, concentrating instead on thesupply side by improving multitiered service deliv-ery. The government has taken demand for serviceslargely for granted and has not weighed it heavily inpolicy making, at least until recently. Second, longstanding funding shortfalls contin- ued through the decentralization process. Startingin 1989, hospitals in Vietnam were allowed to col-lect user fees and mark up drug prices, and theresulting revenues became, and still are, a sizablesource of health financing. However, user fees werea disincentive to enhanced utilization by the poor.And with user fees only partially offsetting fundinggaps, lower quality followed. All this led to reduceduse of health services from the late 1980s, withdemand often shifting to \"private\" providers rang-ing from retired government doctors to informal Decentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 165drug vendors. These developments likely exacer- bated variations in health indicators by region andincome group, with poorer areas such as the north-ern uplands recently falling further behind. Some cities and provinces reportedly reduced user fees charged to the poor and other groups.Recent findings show that distribution of centraland local budget funding, official developmentassistance (ODA), and health insurance reimburse-ments among provinces benefit the poor dispro-portionately more than do other sources ofprovince-level funding. However, only the ODA isstrongly propoor. Neither central and local budgetfunding nor ODA relates significantly to province-level measures of health needs, household povertyrates, or the percentage of minorities. The distribu-tion of public health expenditures among provincesis weakly propoor, thanks largely to the state budgetand ODA (Knowles et al. 2003). Decision 139, issued in October 2002, further requires each province to set up a Health Care Fundfor the Poor to finance free health care for disad-vantaged groups, with budgetary support from thecentral government. Decision 139 entails a majorincrease in health spending in Vietnam amountingto D 700 billion (some US$0.5 billion) per year.This program is starting slowly to allow the countryto overcome difficulties in identifying the poor andchanneling funds to poorer provinces. The pro-gram may improve health access in remote areas asit does not cover the indirect costs of care. Alongwith Decree 10, which gives hospital managersmuch greater control over their pay and employ-ment, user charges, and use of surplus funds, Deci-sion 139 represents a shift in that the Ministry ofHealth is moving from direct service provider tosectoral steward, directing central resources to thepoor and other vulnerable groups based on cleardefinitions of eligibility. The directives also implydifferentiation of government roles, with provincialhealth departments organizing delivery of care andVietnam's insurance agency responsible for collect-ing contributions and purchasing services. This change is important because while the main clients of devolved health services in all thesecountries are the rural poor, their access to qualityhealth services is highly uneven owing to wide vari-ation in local revenues and the flawed design offiscal transfer programs. In the Philippines, forexample, economic growth remains uneven acrossregions, and only cities have generally robust economies. Most provinces and municipalities relyheavily on fiscal transfers, principally the IRA.However, the IRA formula favors highly populatedlocal governments and those with large land areas,and so does not ensure an overall propoor bias inhealth services. Studies have also shown that otherfiscal transfers, including those administered by thecentral Department of Health, correlate onlyweakly with poverty, with poor regions appearingto have received lower DOH budget allocations in 1994 and 1997. On the other hand, one of the rich-est regions in the country receives a disproportion-ate amount of the DOH budget (Mercado 1999;Capuno 2002). As in Vietnam, government hospitals in the Philippines may collect user fees and impose up toa 30 percent markup on drugs. However, cost-recovery rates remain low because of the inordinatevolume of charity and subsidized patients. In thecase of provinces, for instance, the combined shareof hospital fees never reached 13 percent of totalhospital outlays from 1992 to 2000. Municipalitiesfared better, with the share of fees in total hospitaloutlays rising from 9 percent in 1992 to 29 percentin 2000 (Capuno 2002). But because most hospitalswere devolved to provinces, the unintended resultof low cost-recovery rates is that many hospitals arepoorly maintained, understaffed, and ill-equipped. Vietnam and the Philippines instituted health insurance schemes in 1993 and 1995 that target thepoor. Health insurance in Vietnam has become asignificant financing source, more important thanin the Philippines (Knowles et al. 2003). Neverthe-less, in Vietnam coverage is still low and mainlyincludes civil servants and others employed in theformal sector. Decision 139 represents a potentiallysignificant scaling up of the number of people withinsurance. Records from the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) show that among thoseenrolled in the national health insurance program,the number of paying members, from both thepublic and private sectors but excluding the insuredindigent families, grew from about 5.57 million in1999 to 7.62 million in 2001. This suggests thatnearly four in eight Filipinos have social insurancecoverage, but that the program is still far fromachieving its target of universal coverage. However,since 2000, the PHIC has been aggressive in 166 East Asia Decentralizesenrolling indigent families under its Medicare para sa Masa (indigent program). As a consequence, thetotal number of indigent families enrolled hasgrown from 2,904 in 1997 to 1,762,116 in 2003. ByJune 2004, the total ballooned to 6,175,651 indigentfamilies. Whereas in 2001 about 37.8 percent ofthese indigent members were concentrated in therichest regions, by 2003 the same regions accountedfor only about 19.91 percent of the total member-ship. The fact that other regions have gained signif-icance suggests that a wider set of poor householdsnow enjoys coverage. However, this trend is likely toslow as more local governments must copay withthe national government the insurance premium ofpoor constituents. Most local governments see thiscontribution as another unfunded mandate. Health Care Personnel and Civil Service Management Many local governments find it difficult to hire physicians, nurses, and medical technicians, whoare in great demand in foreign markets. In thePhilippines, for example, local governments inmany areas where tuberculosis is epidemic havefound it difficult to hire medical technologists andrural physicians. Indeed, staff anxiety and opposi-tion were major problems during the transition todecentralization in Indonesia and the Philippines.Though usually temporary, staff discontent canaffect the quality and quantity of personnel avail-able under decentralization. In the Philippines, health workers were perhaps the largest group opposing decentralization. Manyinitially feared loss of job security, \"politicization\"of their functions and positions, limited careerprospects, and lower pay. 9 T o appease devolved workers, the central Department of Health pushed for the Magna Cartafor Health Workers in 1992. Among other features,this law provides for higher compensation andextra benefits and allowances to all health workers,including those devolved to local governments, andrequires the latter to pay the additional compensa-tion. This unfunded mandate would have demoral-ized other staff and made some rural physicians thehighest-paid local public employees, earning morethan mayors, which they considered unacceptable. As a stopgap measure, the Department of Health instituted the Doctor to the Barrios Program,which supplied temporary, contractual, and better- paid doctors to remote areas. In May 1993 theprogram began to deploy physicians to 271 munic-ipalities lacking doctors, and by December 2003,198 of these municipalities had received doctors.They receive an attractive package of salary andbenefits for serving two years, and some also receivehonoraria and material support, such as free boardand lodging, from local governments. However,only about a third remain after their two-year tourof duty, discouraged by the lower pay and fewerprivileges that accompany local employment. Thenumber of applicants to the program is dwindlingowing to a surge in foreign demand, and conflictareas remain underserved because of a lack ofincentives. T o supplement the local health force, the Barangay Health Workers' Benefit and Incentives Act of 1995 provided for training volunteer work-ers and providing minimal incentives to convincethem to join barangay health stations. These volun- teers assist in clerical tasks and minor health proce-dures, such as weighing and measuring patients.However, these workers do not effectively cater to the health needs of the population. In Indonesia, the central government estab- lished the contract doctor (PTT) scheme in theearly 1990s to ensure a flow of doctors to remotelocations. Doctors hired after completing their ini-tial medical degree received substantial monetaryincentives for practicing in more remote areas forthree years, as a condition of advancement. Special-ists also had to complete compulsory assignmentsfor one to four years or two to three years as PTTstaff. Discontent grew over the obligatory nature of assignments, relatively low salaries, and pooradministration of program benefits. In 1999, regu-lations were eased to permit alternatives such asteaching in a medical school, working as a PNS(civil servant) in designated areas, or working inprivate practice as a clinic employee in remoteareas. Service requirements for very remote areaswere reduced to two years, and new graduatescould postpone mandatory service if they wantedto start specialist training. These changes did not satisfy the PTT lobby, and doctors continued topress to scrap the regulations. PTT issues remained unresolved as decision makers launched decentralization. The Ministry ofDecentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 167Health has been exploring new ideas such as allow- ing medical personnel to serve in the military andthe police. Districts, meanwhile, have stayed withthe residual national system despite its flaws, aswithout central funds and guidance they might nothave been able to integrate the numerous centrallyassigned, locally based staff transferred overnightvia Law 22. Moreover, few districts can turn downcentral offers to recruit and assign PTT doctorsusing central funds. Still, district officials are con-cerned that staffing policies that reflect local priori-ties and conditions have not been established,including options to \"right-size\" staffs within eachdistrict. This issue arises especially in districts obli-gated to handle staff oversupply left behind byflawed centralized-era policies. Strong political and administrative leaders in some provinces have created master plans toreshape the bureaucracy to fit local conditions.These include using downsizing mechanisms suchas redeployment of staff, early retirement, volun-tary resignation with severance payments, andretraining to encourage entrepreneurship. How-ever, implementation of these plans awaits fullpolitical commitment, facilitating legal steps, andan injection of cash. The inability to proceed high-lights concerns voiced by district and provincedecision makers about dependence on centralgovernment for salary payments and methods for\"right-sizing.\" Vietnam confronted personnel issues under decentralization as well, as the distribution ofhealth personnel did not occur exactly as planned.Enough doctors and other higher-level staff aregenerally available in cities, but numbers are inade-quate in rural areas. Provinces with medical schoolshave about the right number of staff, but poorerprovinces do not, especially newer ones with nosecondary medical schools. One study showed only1.7 doctors per commune in the North Highlandsand the North Central Coast, while a commune inthe Southeast Region averages 6.8 doctors (WorldBank 2001b). The number of health workers at the provincial level is generally adequate (in relation to Ministryof Health guidelines), although some provinces donot have enough specialists. But districts generallylack enough doctors who specialize in priorityareas, such as obstetrics and gynecology and emer-gency surgery. Communes do not have enoughdoctors (nearly all at commune health centers are upgraded former assistant doctors), and often lackenough staff with other training as well, except indensely populated delta areas and near cities. Forexample, in 1997, 26 percent of communes lackedan obstetric-pediatric assistant doctor or a midwife.The Ministry of Health requires all communes toretain such an employee, reflecting the high priorityaccorded to local maternal and child care. Average monthly salaries of health staff have remained essentially unchanged in real terms since1994. In 1998, the average monthly salary of a gov-ernment health worker was merely US$29, eventhough user fees supplement salaries somewhat.This low pay, compared with the education sector,has induced many health staff to seek additionalsources of income, reducing the time, attention,and dedication they devote to their work (Dunget al. 2001). Service Delivery Mechanisms Health programs are prime examples of the need to design institutional arrangements carefully toensure that parties in the service delivery processhave the understanding, ability, and incentives tofulfill their roles. Coordination is invariably a cru-cial requirement of system effectiveness. While acountry's central health ministry should take keyresponsibility for controlling communicable dis-eases, it cannot do this efficiently and effectivelywithout the cooperation of local governments, asthe latter are at the forefront of service delivery. In the Philippines, programs to combat commu- nicable disease depend on devolved health person-nel and local counterpart funds, which are in shortsupply. Local governments see their participation asanother unfunded mandate, and program coordi-nation has suffered as a result. T o elicit local sup-port, the central Department of Health under theComprehensive Health Care Agreements (CHCAs)matches each peso that a local government com-mits with a higher amount. However, the local gov-ernment must first commit a minimum amountfor its devolved health functions. This requirementhas proved stringent, as many local governmentsinitially lacked the resources to finance these func-tions, much less meet their contractual obligationsfor vertical programs. DOH also did not develop amonitoring and enforcement mechanism to track 168 East Asia Decentralizescompliance. Worse, many local officials believed that strict compliance with the program was notnecessary, as DOH would always take the blame forpublic health failures (Esguerra 1997; Medalla1996). Hence, only after two rounds of implemen-tation, CHCAs were discontinued in 1997. In the three study countries, integration between programs within provinces as well as acrossprovinces remains poor. Subnational governmentsimplement national programs separately, leading tooverlap and overload of grassroots health facilities. Vietnam partly solved this problem by giving provinces a greater role in setting goals, developingplans, and using funds for national targeted pro-grams. This is appropriate given variations indisease profiles across regions, and is said to haveraised immunization rates and lowered fatalityrates. Low Quality and Unsteady Supply of Drugs at the Local Level The supply and quality of drugs at the local level have become a concern owing to limited funds,deficient drug management systems, and loopholesin procurement rules. In Indonesia, provinces havenot been aware of or prone to intervene in drugsupply, stocks, and use at the district level underdecentralization. Districts have been able to planfor and purchase their own drugs based on stan-dard procurement practice. However, compliancewith quality assurance procedures has been poor,partly because responsibilities have not been clearand districts do not have the technical capacity tohandle the task. In the Philippines, each local government simi- larly manages its own system of drug procurement,inventory, dispensing, and financing. The quality oflocally procured drugs is generally poor, the pur-chase price is often higher than in private pharma-cies, stock shortages are frequent, and irrationaldrug use occurs. A principal reason is that localtherapeutic committees are not constituted, notfunctioning, or not well trained in modern drugmanagement. Local drug procurement is alsocorrupt in many places: bids are rigged, qualifiedbidders are \"preidentified,\" and bidders connive.Moreover, the supply chain extends only to urbancenters; poor outlying municipalities rely on itiner-ant drug peddlers who arrive infrequently.T o ensure drug quality in all public health facili- ties, the central health ministry in all three coun-tries has adopted drug formularies and drawn upan essential drug list. In Indonesia and the Philip-pines, the central ministry even advocates and pro-motes generic drugs. However, these regulatorymeasures have not ensured the overall quality ofdrugs, owing to weak information campaigns andenforcement mechanisms. In the Philippines, forexample, many local governments, with supporteven from their own health officials, routinely buybranded drugs because of their supposed provenefficacy. Further, the Bureau of Food and Drugs,which lacks laboratory and regulatory capacity, hasnot convinced doctors of the supposed equivalenceof generic drugs (Lim and Pascual 2003). InIndonesia, hospitals buy drugs and unbrandedproducts outside the essential drug list. Unlike in the Philippines, in Vietnam and Indonesia state-owned enterprises dominate thedrug supply, as they can assure quality more easilythan a private drug market. In Vietnam, the state-owned VINAPHARM, which includes central andprovincial trading and manufacturing enterprises,is responsible for supplying drugs countrywide.The Drug Administration Department within theMinistry of Health is responsible for overall drugmanagement, supported by the Drug Quality Con-trol Institute and the Drug Inspectorate. In eachprovince a Drug Quality Control Department fallsunder the Provincial Health Bureau, while a DrugT esting Center and Inspection Department moni-tor drug quality in the local market. In Indonesia, four state-owned enterprises pro- duce generic drugs and vaccines. Regulatory func-tions, including enforcement, are the responsibilityof the Directorate General of Food and Drug Con-trol, a unit of the Ministry of Health. Quality assur-ance efforts include establishing the essential druglist; enforcing standards in the development, test-ing, registration, manufacture, and distribution ofdrugs; and overseeing health professionals. Work-ing through 26 province-level branches, the direc-torate monitors drug quality and safety throughfollow-up visits and testing programs. The direc-torate bases inspection of manufacturers on criteriafor good practice adopted in 1971. State-owned enterprises impose their own inef- ficiencies on the market. In Indonesia, these unitsare protected by tariffs and limits on final-product Decentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 169imports, constraints on foreign investment, and restrictions on registering new drugs, opening newpharmacies, and the nonpharmaceutical activitiesof retailers. Reforms adopted in the 1990s relaxedsome restrictions on foreign drug companies,encouraged generic drug prescriptions in publichealth centers, and enforced good manufacturingpractice. Hospitals could also keep drug revenues tosecure supplies at the facility level. However, inconsistencies and missteps weak- ened or negated these pre-2001 reforms, and theoutcomes unsatisfactory. Moreover, districtsinherited a flawed and incomplete reform agenda,with impacts on government stewardship obliga-tions. Since Law 22 has taken effect, deviation fromestablished standards, patterns, and procedures hasgrown. For example, complaints about the physicalappearance or expiration date of drugs are wide-spread, suggesting that longstanding quality assur-ance procedures are not being observed. Reportingof drug quality problems is not formalized, andprocedures for addressing quality concerns areunclear and complicated by multiple sources ofdrugs and funding. Limited skills surely play a roleas well, as many service units and district warehousesdepend on unqualified staff. Nor can provinces stepin, as they lack the authority to monitor, yet alonesupervise, district drug procurement. More generally, laws and regulations provide little detail on operating responsibilities andhave brought confusion and divergence betweenprovinces and districts. For instance, some pro-curement procedures have spurred small purchasesfrom 15 or more suppliers. Districts usually rejectpooled procurement despite possible cost savings. Nor is there a definitive view on which drugs belong in categories defined by the Ministry ofHealth in pre-2001 preparations. Central involve-ment appears to be limited, and provinces reveal nocommon pattern of procurement. Some are notsupplying any drugs, and plan to reduce future drugsupply. Some still buy drugs to cover emergenciesand temporary district shortfalls. Districts are usingtheir own funds to buy drugs from all three classes ofthe essential drug list. Meanwhile, the drug supplyand regulatory system in hospitals is different fromthat at the primary care level. Hospitals, which havelong been allowed to procure and dispense drugsoutside the essential drug list, are buying mainlybranded drugs, funded through self-financingrevolving funds and using spot buying methods.The change from central to district procurement may have also increased drug prices because of lowerprocurement volumes. This would likely widen vari-ations in drug prices, reducing equity and loweringthe availability of orphan drugs. Vietnam represents an interesting comparator. As in Indonesia, deregulation of pharmaceuticalproduction and distribution brought heightenedactivity among informal drug vendors and phar-macy shops and greater availability of drugsthroughout the country. Consumer purchases ofdrugs, especially for self-medication, grew as well,from 2.1 annual contacts per capita with drug ven-dors and pharmacy shops in 1993 to 6.8 by 1998.However, the two countries differ in their experi-ences with drug prices. In Vietnam, deregulationbrought a 30 percent fall in the real price of medi-cines in the 1993-98 period, while in Indonesiaprice reductions do not seem to have followed pol-icy reforms. Moreover, the risks facing Indonesia are compa- rable to those of Vietnam, where drug vendorsaccount for roughly two-thirds of health servicecontacts, and antibiotic resistance has reached epi-demic levels thanks to excessive and otherwiseinappropriate use. 10The resistance problem is compounded by the limited training of pharma-cists and the low average education level of drugvendors and the public. Even when doctorsprescribe drugs, compliance with appropriatetreatment guidelines is low. Oversight of healthproviders is weak as well. Enforcement of the manyregulations and decrees governing minimum qual-ity standards and the protocols expected of healthproviders through regular inspections of healthfacilities is less than satisfactory. In the Philippines, on the other hand, a few drug manufacturers and importers, which are mostlymultinationals, dominate the upstream segment,while a single drugstore chain effectively controlsthe retail segment of the domestic drug industry. Aparallel drug importation policy has not helpedbring down the overall price of drugs because thegovernment chose to maintain an import monop-oly with capital of just P =50 million\u2014not enough to affect the multibillion-peso domestic drug trade. Health Information Systems Decentralization in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam has fragmented the health information170 East Asia Decentralizessystem and undermined coordination among vari- ous sectors, and thus effective and efficient controlof communicable diseases. Subnational govern-ments are unaware of their roles, and, more criti-cally, lack the incentives and technical capacity toassume those roles. Subnational governments needsupport for activities from collecting health infor-mation to providing further inputs to performingoverall health planning to actually implementingprograms. From 1992 to 1995, the Philippine Department of Health implemented the German-funded Healthand Management Information System, whose mainobjective was to institutionalize a \"need-responsiveand cost-effective health information system\" at thenational and local levels. The initiative introducedsoftware modules and processes to fortify the pro-duction and use of information. Besides developingdistrict-level health indicators, the system sup-ported innovations in community health carefinancing and service delivery. However, the initia-tive stopped short of a nationally integrated butlocally operated health information system and wasnot sustained. In Indonesia and the Philippines, the central health ministry relies on local governments toreport information voluntarily. This has resulted inerratic or delayed submission and poor-qualitydata. The devolved staff members who wereresponsible for such data under the old regime nowsupply information on health expenditures andinput indicators to provincial and lower-levelelected officials, who are less concerned with out-puts and outcome indicators. In Indonesia, only 36 percent of health centers reported infectious disease surveillance data in2002. 11Those that do report do so irregularly or late. Thus, the limited data that flow through thesystem may not be reliable enough for use in plan-ning, policy analysis, or evaluation. In these countries, the central health ministry, lacking information, is less able to monitor thequality of laboratory services, hospitals, and otherdevolved services. This is worrisome as, for exam-ple, local health centers in the Philippines areresponsible for both finding cases of tuberculosis,which requires sputum examination, and monitor-ing cases. Indonesia discontinued some programssuch as those tracking leprosy because districts didnot monitor the number of cases. Quality assur-ance systems for provincial hospitals in both thePhilippines and Indonesia continue to rely heavily on input indicators such as the number of beds,floor area, and medical instruments, with onlyinfrequent verification of such information by localgovernments. In the Philippines, although the Department of Health deploys its own representative to provinces,cities, and municipalities to help monitor diseaseoutbreaks and coordinate vertical programs, theflow of health information remains slow. DOHrepresentatives must often double-up as serviceproviders, as many local governments lack theneeded personnel. Performance Standards and Incentives In the Philippines, efforts to improve the quality of health services have relied on both incentives,including awards and accreditation measures, anddisincentives. One example of an approach thatencourages local governments to upgrade theirhealth services is the Sentrong Sigla accreditation.Aside from providing a mark of quality, this accred-itation originally conveyed a P =1 million grant to local health centers. Based mostly on input indica-tors of a health facility's \"readiness to provide serv-ices,\" the program had certified some 48 percent ofhealth centers, 14 percent of district and provincialhospitals, and 3 percent of barangay health stations by October 2003. Though these numbers areencouraging, they represent only a minority of thecountry's facilities. Moreover, most of the cashawardees are better-off municipalities that do notneed the funds as urgently as localities that do notqualify (Lamberte 2003). In the Philippines, the Department of Health issued Administrative Order no.100 in 2003, whichestablished new guidelines to improve the SentrongSigla program. Instead of cash awards, the newguidelines specify a matching grant for new quali-fiers, and also make certification a prerequisite forother DOH grants and the Capitation Fund pro-gram, recently introduced by the Philippine HealthInsurance Corp. Under the latter program, anaccredited local government can claim reimburse-ment for services extended to PHIC-insured indi-gent families in their localities. However, theseaccreditation schemes are voluntary. Vietnam and Indonesia, in contrast, have adopted norm setting as their approach. Vietnam'sMinistry of Health sets province-level norms, butDecentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 171quality remains uneven because province and dis- trict health officials introduce norms and guide-lines as well. The Ministry of Health has useddecrees and circulars to define the quality ofhuman resources and equipment and performancestandards. The ministry also has issued more than100 treatment guidelines, though a survey con-ducted in 20 district hospitals in 2000 on acute res-piratory infections showed that compliance was 25to 40 percent, probably reflecting weak support andsupervision at the local level. Meanwhile, overuseand overprescription of injection drugs were com-mon, with representatives of drug companies influ-encing physicians' prescriptions (Dung et al. 2001). Indonesia established minimum health service standards by ministerial decree in 2003. Districtsmust deliver services according to local needs in32 areas, including immunization, nutrition serv-ices, prevention of communicable diseases, andcurative care. Such standards will help define theservice levels that districts are accountable fordelivering. Whether these standards will be require-ments or targets needs further consideration, alongwith measures for dealing with districts that do notmeet the standards. Toward a New Role for Ministries of Health Decentralization in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam may help sustain overall improvements inhealth that have occurred during the last twodecades. Decentralization has appeared to spurlocal initiative in planning, delivering, and financ-ing services. Users are now participating in plan-ning in many regions, leading to more appropriateand better-targeted health services. Volunteerssupplement limited local financial and technicalresources. More important, perhaps, citizenshipand trust in local government have deepened. Theresulting efficiency gains and social capital supportthe decentralization of health services. Still, experience in these three countries reveals that decentralization dividends have been modestfor two reasons. First, these countries decentralizedhealth services in less-than-favorable environ-ments. Inequitable economic growth, populationpressures that brought epidemiological changes,and political uncertainties have limited the poten-tial gains from decentralization. Improvements inhealth status are therefore greater in well-off provinces, and service innovations have failed tospread beyond areas where the local economy isrobust and the political situation relatively stable.In these provinces, local governments have hadthe resources to meet growing demand for healthservices. Weakness in decentralization policy also con- tributed to lower-than-expected health payoffs.These include ambiguities in goals, lack of detaileddesign, inconsistency with other policies, andpoorly thought-out implementation strategy.These follow from the fact that health was not themain\u2014much less the sole\u2014driver of decentraliza-tion. The Philippines, for example, included healthservices in its decentralization strategy only whenresistance from the education lobby forced legisla-tors to look at other national expenditures. Inconsistent priorities have translated into inconsistencies in policies and poor design of pol-icy instruments, especially the intergovernmentalfiscal transfer system. Local governments are alsotypically unaware of the types and timing ofnational interventions\u2014information that is crucialto their own budget and investment planning. Withprior knowledge of available grants, technical assis-tance, and other support from national agencies,local governments can use information on localneeds, and proximity and direct accountability tobeneficiaries, more effectively. In Indonesia, the slow and arduous emergence of a consensus on a health decentralization frame-work partly reflects a governmentwide determina-tion to avoid service interruptions. But this focushas also allowed the central government to post-pone difficult decisions over the role and scale ofkey central ministries. The Indonesian Ministry of Health also tends to view the public as passive service recipients ratherthan discriminating customers, owners, and poten-tial allies, and to present itself as a policing andstandards-upholding authority rather than a tech-nical agency. What's more, the government hasnot yet developed a clear concept of the role ofprovinces in the health system. Decision makersknow that districts are typically too small to sup-port cost-effective programs, but they have notdesigned institutional solutions to encourage jointservice areas, or to make provinces agents of publichealth and related programs. 172 East Asia DecentralizesPolicy weaknesses also stem from laws and regu- lations, introduced in Big Bang fashion, that lackeddetail on functional and operational responsibili-ties and brought confusion and divergence betweenprovinces and other local governments. The Min-istry of Health also failed to coordinate with localgovernments and other actors in performing criti-cal health functions. In these countries, reactive responses to transi- tion problems did not necessarily resolve fundamen-tal design issues. For instance, in the Philippines, theMagna Carta for Public Health Workers\u2014which provided supplemental funds to only a few localgovernments\u2014temporarily appeased disgruntledhealth workers but upset local governments byimposing unfunded mandates. Similarly, the coun-try \"resolved\" the mismatch between the distribu-tion of the IRA and devolved expenditures after 1992by providing grants to cities for hospitals they werealready financing before 1991. Thus, compensatingcities for their supposed \"losses\" due to the adjust-ments in the IRA was a politically necessary butcostly way of ensuring adequate funding for thehealth functions devolved to provinces and munici-palities (Capuno 2001). However, efforts to correct these weaknesses could expand the gains from decentralizing health,even within a less-than-favorable environment.T oward that end, central health ministries mustfocus on specific tasks such as setting up qualityassurance mechanisms for drug supplies, safe-guarding access to medicines by the poor, and dis-mantling state monopolies on drugs. Responsibili-ties for communicable diseases include monitoringnational and regional trends, supporting laboratorycapacity and quality control and assurance, alertingprovinces to outbreaks elsewhere, and advocatingfor emergency financing. With the Stewardship of the Ministry of Health These examples illustrate the contributions needed from central government during decentralizationof health services. Above all, central agenciesshould concentrate on activities that go beyond thedirect provision of preventive and curative services,focusing on core public health functions, respond-ing to overall imperatives, and preventing potentialfailures. 12These efforts include not only tasks related to pharmaceuticals and communicablediseases but also workforce training, recruitment, pay and benefits, and supervision. Other core public health functions include ensuring that the poor have access to affordablecare, overcoming micronutrient shortfalls, creatingsustainable funding arrangements, acting as asource of ideas and best practices from theprovinces, and providing technical assistance on aselective basis. As the steward, a Ministry of Healthwould build consensus on national health objec-tives and standards, and coordinate rather thanrequire local governments and civil society groupsto meet these goals. Instead of relying on some-times heavy-handed regulation, the ministryshould align incentives to elicit the cooperation andparticipation of all sectors. Rather than imposehigh standards, the ministry should perhaps pro-mote them through advocacy and by strengtheninglocal governance mechanisms. The stewardship role also entails pushing for greater consistency among goals, programs, andpolicies of different national agencies to supportlocal governments. Finally, stewardship includesmore than content: it clearly entails leadership anda flexible, opportunistic mode of building partner-ships and exploiting opportunities. Central interventions are warranted partly because these functions may not convey theurgency or tangible appeal of disease-specific pro-grams, and thus districts may neglect them. Subna-tional governments have little incentive to pursuecore public health functions because they cannotfully capture the returns, and because some func-tions are difficult to perform well because oflimited resources or lack of scale economies. Theimpacts of core public health functions are alsohard to measure: gauging the effects of a strong dis-ease surveillance and reporting system is difficult,while the direct distribution and use of drugs byinfected patients has obvious benefits. Has the Philippines Turned the Corner? The central health ministries in all three countries have taken steps to fulfill this new role, but nodefinitive transformation into stewardship has yetoccurred. Furthest along is the Philippines, whoseDepartment of Health has examined whetherdecentralization has paid off as a health reformvehicle.Decentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 173In 1999, under the Estrada administration, DOH formulated a comprehensive decentralizationstrategy called the Health Sector Reform Agenda(HSRA). The HSRA noted a slight resurgence ofcertain diseases and persistent inequities in serviceaccess. T o counter these problems, DOH posi-tioned itself as a health leader, enabler, and capac-ity builder, administering only certain services(Department of Health of the Philippines 1999b).As a leader, it would primarily be responsible forsetting national health policy and regulations andstrengthening regulatory agencies. As an enablerand a capacity builder, it would seek to promoteinnovations and standards in health services, espe-cially at the local level. And as an administrator, itwould confine itself to pushing hospitals towardfiscal autonomy, securing funds for priority publichealth programs, and promoting universal cover-age under the National Health Insurance Program. The novel aspects of this strategy are DOH reengineering and the convergence of all DOHinterventions in each province under the HSRAframework. DOH reengineering meant streamlin-ing operations, finances, and bureaucracy, anddeploying 1,638 personnel from the central officeto regional health offices, retained hospitals, andother DOH agencies. Under the convergence strat-egy, some provincial officials have drawn up healthdevelopment plans and interlocal health zones,with the DOH providing technical input and otherassistance. These zones bring together contiguouslocal governments around a district hospital to findways of improving the hospital referral system,exploiting economies of scale, and containingspillovers. In December 2004, for example, Capiz province devised a five-year development plan for enrollingindigent families in the National Health InsuranceProgram, upgrading selected hospitals, and adopt-ing revolving drug funds and new drug manage-ment systems, with specific targets and activitiesat provincial and zone levels. With initial DOHsupport of P =10 million ,the Capiz plan is expected to yield gains from economies of scale in hospitaloperations, pooled procurement of drugs, andcontrol of epidemics. Similar arrangements areexpected in 2005 in other sites such as Pangasinan,Agusan del Sur, and Misamis Occidental. As a dynamic process, decentralization in the Philippines will continue to require adjustmentguided by HSRA. For example, the country can do more to prepare the intended beneficiaries, suchas local governments and health care users, anddiffuse political resistance. At the same time, thecentral Department of Health needs to extend itspartnership with health NGOs and civil societyorganizations with whom it is already working.Local health finances must rest on a firmer footing,including through greater reliance on local funds.Carefully designed user charges would not onlymake service delivery more efficient but also makelocal health programs sustainable and help subsi-dize the health needs of the poor. But to justifyhigher user fees, local governments must improveservice quality and require up-front financingfor facility improvements, personnel training andhiring, and drugs and medical equipment. DOHmatching grants could support enhanced services iflocal governments introduced new fee schedules.Grants would also make local public employmentmore attractive to health workers. Waiting for Indonesia... Indonesia has not clarified the health roles and responsibilities of central and lower governmentsafter three years of decentralization. Nor has thecountry moved to emphasize core public healthfunctions, or seen marked improvements in spe-cific areas such as infectious disease control, phar-maceuticals, and human resources. Sectors besideshealth also have indeterminate policies, promptingadvice to clarify assignments across levels of gov-ernment and sectors (World Bank 2003a). Two strands of thinking on decentralization are evident within the Ministry of Health. The first isdistilled in a 2003 decree that lists 29 strategic issuesrelated to core public health functions and adds keysteps to address them, such as minimum servicestandards (MSS), partnerships with NGOs, andservices for the poor. The decree points to account-ability mechanisms and traditional command-and-control instruments to limit the risks of servicedisruption. The former include the use of MSS toelicit district commitment, including assistance infunding core public health functions. The Ministryof Health has been relatively assertive in exertingits authority in responding to infectious diseaseoutbreaks such as severe acute respiratory sys-tem (SARS), and overseeing surveillance of and 174 East Asia Decentralizesprograms to combat diseases of national impor- tance and involving international obligations, suchas tuberculosis and HIV . The Ministry of Healthdepends on central and donor funding to achievethese ends, though each is unreliable, and haslooked for district support, seeing MSS as targetsfor district spending. 13The decree assigns key responsibility to district chief executives, and statesthat efforts to attain MSS should rely entirely ondistrict budgets, with central and provincial gov-ernments providing technical help, supervision,and oversight. This approach is risky. Detailed, extensive MSS could undermine decentralization, and poorer dis-tricts could reject them because of limited fiscalcapacity. Most MSS have been set at high levels,imposed on rather than owned by local govern-ments, with the means of enforcement and penal-ties for noncompliance undisclosed. MSS would bebetter seen as medium-term goals rather than per-formance requirements that trigger funding andrequire enforcement. The Ministry of Health needsto develop ways of boosting district ownership ofefforts to prevent and control infectious diseases. The second strand of thinking within the Indonesian Ministry of Health takes a more benignand constructive view of decentralization. Thisapproach is embodied in initiatives under way inY ogyakarta and three other provinces (Lampung,North Sumatera, and West Java), with twenty-oneother provinces due to come on stream later. Min-istry officials who support this approach are tryingto use the momentum of decentralization as a cata-lyst for sector reform, with provinces playing animportant mid-level role. However, the above-citeddecree limits provinces to backstopping central anddistrict-level initiatives. The province-based approach remains new and under trial. It has already survived early bureau-cratic and other challenges, but the Ministry ofHealth needs to carefully assess experiences, impli-cations, and lessons emerging from the province-based framework and disseminate them to keystakeholders. The ministry can also help implementnew and existing provincial programs, includinginterventions that widen and deepen the decentral-ized approach. The ministry can also support pilotwork and research aimed at helping provincesrespond to the diverse challenges of managing anddeveloping the health workforce, such as by helpingprovinces rationalize staffing numbers. The min- istry could also sponsor trials of approaches toattract doctors, especially specialists, to remote andundesirable locations. The ministry also needs todevelop standards that provinces and districts canuse to license service providers; work with profes-sional associations to strengthen quality improve-ment efforts and establish partnerships for profes-sional development; consult with consumer groupsand hospitals on workforce quality; focus on trendsin medical education; and fund and deploy special-purpose health teams. Opportunities, imperatives, and stakeholder pressures could support the Ministry of Health'simpetus toward devolution and health reform.Budget constraints may force the ministry to lookto districts and provinces as sources of funds andjobs for the health workforce. Demands for betterservice quality and other public pressures havebegun to register with local political leaders andwithin the national ministry. A medium-term sce-nario resembles that in the Philippines: contesteddecentralization followed by a faster pace andmajor adjustments, leading to consolidation andmid-course correction. The Filipino experiencemost relevant for Indonesia is arguably the changein outlook within the Department of Health regard-ing its role in a decentralized system. Stewardship by Vietnam's Ministry of Health The tempo of change in Vietnam is quickening, with several distinct drivers governing the pace.The first is the reappearance of deadly public healththreats at the top of the policy agenda. Vietnam isclearly vulnerable to new and more virulent strainsof diseases such as SARS, HIV/AIDS, and influenza,and reemerging diseases such as tuberculosis anddengue fever. Malaria remains a major publichealth problem in mountainous and ethnic minor-ity areas. Successive crises have spawned rapid-reaction structures and shown the importance of timely andwell-targeted responses guided by updated diseasesurveillance data. The Ministry of Health appearsto be developing expertise in explaining disease challenges and engaging the public and politicalleaders while soliciting various sorts of assistance.The ministry has also gained credibility and builtstronger ties to decision makers at the provincial Decentralizing Health: Lessons from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam 175level and in key central ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Public Infor-mation, and the Ministry of Labor, Invalids andSocial Affairs. These drivers of change could inter-sect if, as seems likely, the revised agenda on com-municable diseases leads to requirements for morespending. This effort should involve a review ofarrangements for funding disease control andthe possibility of consolidating such outlays. Arelated issue is the need to avoid substituting forlocal expenditures; the ministry could make acase for requiring matching contributions fromlocal governments. The 2002 law requires some acceleration in efforts to adjust government roles. These effortswill entail significant shifts, and the experience andcredibility accumulated in fighting SARS and otherdiseases could prove helpful. In particular, the advent of provincially man- aged service delivery suggests the need for formalrecognition backed by real authority and resources, with the Ministry of Health focusing on key stew-ardship functions. Implementation of the 2002 lawwill thus enable the ministry to get out from undersecond- and third-best aspects of the de factohealth decentralization system that took hold in the1990s: Provinces are supposed to provide updates on how they are allocating their recurrent budget.However, this requirement appears to belargely a formality. The Ministry of Health haslittle information on health budgets, and it isnot clear to what extent, if at all, it can influ-ence provincial spending of budgets alreadyapproved. The ministry lacks a clear role in formulating and assessing policy and determining centralallocations to health; the ministries of Financeand Public Information are the key agencies inthis process. Central recurrent health spendingreflects projected revenue growth and recurrentexpenditures. Such incremental budgeting is not sensitive to the goals and priorities set by the Ministry ofHealth. The ministry can respond to the 2002 law partly by strengthening budgeting procedures as well asimproving allocation. These efforts may includereplacing allocation norms and hospital payment mechanisms with instruments based on the price ofhealth care services. The ministry would like to pre-pare expenditure norms to support management,monitoring, supervision, and control functions,and explore the use of norms that reflect populationneeds and improve equity in service access and use. The Ministry of Health also recognizes that it needs other policies with significant near-termimpacts to address disparities in health outcomesand per capita health expenditures across provinces.Per capita spending in the richest seven provincesis over three times that in the poorest sevenprovinces. Central and donor transfers do not pro-vide a counterweight, as the richest provincesreceive the largest per capita amount, and becausethe resources involved are relatively small. Endnotes 1. No consensus has developed on the starting point for health decentralization in Vietnam. This chapter treats the1996 Law on State Budget as a path-breaking measure. 2. On December 27, 1997, then-President Ramos issued Administrative Order 372, which effected the withholdingof the \"amount equivalent to 10 percent of the IRA.\" Localgovernments challenged this order before the SupremeCourt and won in June 2000. 3. This is a common observation by local officials interviewed for the Rapid Field Appraisal of Decentralization (Associates in Rural Development 1993a, 1993b, 1994). 4. The standard deviation in regional IMR also fell from 8.51 in 1980 to 4.84 in 1990, and then to 3.34 in 2000. 5. Figures from the Philippine National Health Accounts also show that total per capita health spending rose fromUS$20.82 in 1991 to US$29.79 in 2001. In real terms,however, the country recorded a per capita decline fromUS$12.15 in 1991 to US$8.84 in 2001. 6. Vietnam also achieved a hefty threefold nominal rise in total health expenditures over a five-year period, fromUS$0.68 billion in 1993 to US$2.17 billion in 1998(Knowles et al. 2003). 7. This occurs through the JPS-BK (the health component of the social safety net); the fuel subsidy; and the DAK (aspecial-purpose grant) channels. 8. The Galing Pook Foundation presents awards to local gov- ernments for the best innovations in public service deliv-ery. The Philippine Human Development Network uses theHuman Development Index to identify and honorprovinces that made the greatest strides in promotinghealth, wealth, and education. 9. Moreover, the Department of Health itself did not antici- pate these issues, as the initial plan was to decentralize edu-cation first. Opposition from that sector led the govern-ment to consider decentralizing health instead (Diokno2003). 10. Data from the 1998 Vietnam Living Standards Survey indi- cate that 93 percent of all drug vendor contacts entailedefforts to obtain medicines without a prescription, withlittle variation across economic groups.176 East Asia Decentralizes11. A survey conducted by the National Family Planning Coor- dination Board in 2002 found that less than 10 percent ofhealth centers followed the manual on preventing infec-tions that may result from the use of contraceptives. Thesurvey also discovered that counseling in the family plan-ning program was poor, and that 20 percent of public facil-ities had never been supervised. 12. The Pan American Health Organization established 11 essential public health functions through internationalconsensus. These have been field-tested and implementedin 43 countries of Latin America, the Caribbean, andEurope. 13. Central spending is limited and subject to strong competi- tion from outside and inside the Ministry of Health. Forexample, during 2001 and 2002, the central budget washighly constrained, and the ministry's main funding initia-tive aimed not to control disease per se but to hire doctorsto fill vacancies. The ministry allocated some funds forcombating tuberculosis and HIV and a few other pro-grams, leaving insufficient central resources for tacklingother diseases.

However, agrowing number of countries throughout theworld, including those in East Asia, are transfer-ring this responsibility away from the center, typi-cally as part of a broader reform to decentralizegovernment functions. This transfer has taken var-ious forms, including devolving fiscal responsibil-ity and management to lower levels of govern-ment, making public schools autonomous,requiring the participation of communities inoperating schools, expanding community financ-ing, allowing families to choose their schools, andstimulating private provision of education. Theimpetus for decentralization has often been politi-cal or financial rather than educational, yet sup-porters of decentralization would argue that it canaddress difficult problems confronting educationsystems, especially those relating to performanceand accountability. Education systems areextremely demanding of the managerial, technical,and financial capacity of governments, so thepotential returns to making such systems moreefficient and effective are great. The promise of decentralization lies in giving more voice and power to local leaders and school 1799 Education Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact Elizabeth M. King and Susana Cordeiro Guerra personnel, who presumably know more about local educational problems than national officials, andwho have an incentive to lobby for more resourcesand to innovate. Indeed, as the broader decentraliza-tion literature suggests, the benefits of decentraliza-tion lie in reinforcing accountability among thoseresponsible for delivering services\u2014between the cen-tral government and local governments, betweengovernments and school personnel, and betweenschool personnel and the communities they serve(Ahmad et al. 1998). 1In countries as large and diverse as China and Indonesia, generating local solutions toeducational problems and mobilizing local energiesand resources can yield dividends for all. Despite its promises, however, decentralization is not a policy panacea. As this chapter shows,choosing an appropriate design for transformingan education system is difficult. What's more, thereform process is never smooth. It is likely to bepunctuated by bursts of progress and frequent set-backs, which may lead to rising frustration andgrowing mistrust among stakeholders who seethemselves as losers under the reform process. This chapter reviews the experiences of East Asian countries in decentralizing their educationsystems, with the goal of understanding thechallenges of designing reforms, distilling lessons180 East Asia Decentralizes on implementation, and examining the impact on educational development. Decentralization lawstypically stipulate dramatic reallocations ofauthority and responsibility among levels of gov-ernment and also transfers of resources. However,the experience in East Asia\u2014and, indeed, innearly all countries that have decentralized\u2014sug-gests a lack of congruence between design andimplementation, or between de jure and de factodecentralization. Several factors have given rise to this incongru- ence: incomplete design and implementation lags,which may be due to weak technical and adminis-trative capacity, and lack of broad political supportfor reform. For example, central agencies are notshy about transferring responsibilities for financingand delivering education services to local govern-ments but are not as eager to share correspondingauthority and resources, and so find ways ofreasserting control. Local governments that aresupposed to yield some decision-making authorityto schools may also hold back from doing so.Indeed, two common challenges are to align func-tions, powers, and resources among levels of gov-ernments, and to define an appropriate role for thecentral authority within a decentralized system.Achieving a better alignment of functions, powers,and resources is primarily a matter of improvingdesign in some countries, and of improving imple-mentation in others. The next section examines the rationale for decentralization in East Asian countries. Theprincipal motives rarely relate to expanding orimproving public services, so the allocation offunctions and resources often does not provide acoordinated framework for managing servicesmore effectively. The third section reviews thenature and design of education reforms in thesecountries, as well as their implementation. This sec-tion focuses on the overall legislative framework:how decentralization has changed governance andmanagement; which responsibilities and functionscountries have devolved; whether resources areadequate to act on these; whether the structure ofthe system is aligned with the changes; and whatfunctions the central agency has retained. EastAsian countries reveal common design features butalso important differences, emerging partly fromdifferences in motivation for reform, initialconditions, and the political milieu.The fourth section reviews evidence on the impact of decentralization and the factors that haveinfluenced its effectiveness. Because educationaldevelopment is rarely the rationale for decentral-ization, there is no guarantee that the reform will,in fact, improve education outcomes. With theexception of China, East Asia's experience withdecentralizing education is fairly recent and re-search on its impact nascent, so the review focuseson shifts in education expenditures and on inequal-ity, and then relies on lessons from around theworld to evaluate the impact of decentralization onlearning. The final section summarizes key findingsand lessons about decentralization given experi-ences in the East Asian countries. The Impetus for Decentralizing Education Educational achievement in parts of East Asia is much admired. Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have achieved high enrollmentrates and high-quality education, with their stu-dents consistently topping international tests (seetable 9.1) (Martin et al. 2004a and 2004b). OtherEast Asian countries have not done as well, but they,too, have achieved high enrollment rates (see figure9.1). These countries face other educational chal-lenges: The emerging economies of China, Indone-sia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand mustbetter manage their education systems to reducedisparities between wealthier and poorer regions,and to improve the overall quality of education. Thepoorer countries\u2014Laos, Cambodia, and Papua NewGuinea\u2014must expand the number of children whoenter school, cut the number who drop out at theprimary level, ensure that the system producesenough talent to support economic growth anddevelopment, and address difficult problems infinancing and managing their education systems. These challenges, however, have not been the pri- mary rationale and main driving force behind effortsto decentralize the education systems in these coun-tries. Rather, political factors and fiscal concerns havebeen the impetus. 2Key design aspects of reform\u2014 including central-local transfers, local tax authority,and civil service rules\u2014may therefore ignore legal,financial, and administrative issues that are critical forachieving national education goals, and may establishstructures and incentives that imperil those goals.In China, decentralization of education can be traced to the decollectivization and economic liber-alization reforms of the 1970s, which laid thegroundwork for transferring responsibility forsocial services to local governments. Fiscal con-straints on the central government were also seen asa primary motive for that transfer (Hawkins 2000;Bray 1999; Cheng 1997). In Indonesia, politicalfactors\u2014a national call for democracy, the end ofthe Soeharto regime, the failures of the highly cen-tralistic government, intensified by the financialcrisis of 1997\u2014drove the decision to decentralizeall but a few sectors in 1999 (World Bank 2003a). In the Philippines, the 1987 Constitution mandateddecentralization, and the 1991 Local GovernmentCode provided legal guidelines for transferringresponsibility for providing services to subnationalgovernments. Except for the transfer of construc-tion and maintenance of school buildings to localgovernments, however, the Philippines has notformally decentralized governance of elementaryeducation. Political considerations underlie thisexception. One often-cited reason is that publicschoolteachers have traditionally counted votesEducation Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 181 TABLE 9.1 Student Performance on Mathematics and Science Tests (ranking among 38 countries ) Mathematics score and rank Science score and rank Country 1999 2003 1999 2003 Singapore 604 (1) 605 (1) 568 (2) 578 (1) Korea 587 (2) 589 (2) 549 (5) 558 (3)Taiwan 585 (3) \u2014 569 (1) \u2014Hong Kong 582 (4) 586 (3) 530 (15) 556 (4)Japan 579 (5) 570 (5) 550 (4) 552 (6)Malaysia 519 (16) 508 (13) 492 (22) 510 (21)Thailand 467 (27) \u2014 482 (24) \u2014Indonesia 403 (34) 411(35) 435 (32) 420 (27)Philippines 348 (36) 378 (42) 345 (36) 377 (43) Sources: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 1999 and Martin et al. 2004a and 2004b.

Sources: UNESCO 2002/2003; World Bank 2003b.Indonesia primary level secondary levelduring elections, so decentralization would make them vulnerable to local politics, possibly compro-mising election results (Loehr and Manasan 1999). 3 In Thailand, decentralization is said to result from the groundswell of support for greater democ-racy, shared powers and resources between the cen-tral government and local levels, and greateraccountability, culminating in the 1997 Constitu-tion (Mutebi 2003; Weist 2001). The motivation fordecentralization in Cambodia was also predomi-nantly political: building democratic governance ina country ruled by centralized power for most of itsmodern history. Because the regime that emergedfrom a long civil war was marked by rigid organiza-tion, inefficiency, leakage of funds, budget allocationdifficulties, and little community participation, civilsociety and the development community pushed todeconcentrate government functions to improveservice delivery, especially for the poor (RoyalKingdom of Cambodia 2001). The Design and Practice of Education Decentralization The design of decentralized education across East Asian countries reflects common features. One isthat devolved education systems rest on multilay-ered governance and management structures, withthe result that forging a coherent national policyrequires a much larger effort. Central and interme-diate (provincial, state, municipality, and district)levels of government generally continue to governpost-basic education, but the lowest level ofgovernment, and even schools themselves, governbasic education. China's policy stipulates multiple layers of edu- cational supervision involving the National Educa-tional Supervision Agency as well as correspondingagencies in local governments (Hawkins 2000;Wang 2004). The provincial level takes responsibil-ity for developing specific local policies and regula-tions in line with national education objectives.The local government\u2014the township level in ruralareas (the lowest level of the bureaucracy withouteducation offices), and the district level in urbansettings (with education offices)\u2014has responsibil-ity for ensuring that all children receive nine yearsof compulsory education. Earlier implementationrevealed inadequate capacity of township govern-ments to manage schools, so local responsibility forfinancing and managing basic education in rural areas was transferred from township to the countylevel in 2001. 4In 2002, the People's Congress passed the Private Education Promotion Law, whichdefined the legal status as well as the rights andresponsibilities of the private sector, further open-ing the door for diversified provision and multiplesources of funding for education (Wang 2004). In Indonesia, Laws 22 and 25 of 1999 transferred governance and management of primary and jun-ior secondary education to district governments,and the upper secondary level to provincial govern-ments, while the central government retains con-trol of the tertiary level. The Education Law 20 of2003 takes decentralization a step further, movingcontrol of basic levels of education from districts toschools (World Bank 2004a). In Cambodia, recentlaws have transferred functions and powers\u2014including the provision of public services\u2014to com-munes, and the country plans to boost accountabil-ity further by increasing the\"operational autonomy\"of schools and postsecondary institutions (RoyalKingdom of Cambodia 2001). 5 A second common feature of decentralized education across East Asia is that, at the deepestlevel, the vehicles for governance and manage-ment are typically community councils andschool committees involving local officials, civicleaders, and parents. In Thailand, each school issupposed to have a board composed of represen-tatives of parents, teachers, community organiza-tions, alumni, and students. Parents' organizationswith jurisdiction over schools are to establish aquality assurance system, and communities areurged to \"participate in educational provision bycontributing their experience, knowledge, expert-ise and local wisdom for educational benefits\"(Kingdom of Thailand 1999). In Indonesia, eachschool is supposed to have a School Committee\u2014declared an independent body by the 2003 Educa-tion Law\u2014to provide advice, direction, and sup-port for managing schools (Government ofIndonesia 2003). In China, school principals arecharged with greater responsibility than in thepast but also enjoy more autonomy. They areexpected to generate additional resources for theschool and ensure teaching quality, because theycan choose teachers without much interventionfrom the district or county, as well as determineincentives for teachers (Wang 2004).182 East Asia DecentralizesSuch deep decentralization is common outside the region, too, a means not only of mobilizinglocal resources but also of fostering greateraccountability and better performance. In Brazil,reform in several states has entailed establishingschool councils, allowing the direct transfer ofresources to schools, and giving communities thepower to elect the local principal. El Salvador'sCommunity-Managed Schools Program\u2014betterknown as EDUCO (Educaci\u00f3n con Participaci\u00f3n de la Comunidad) \u2014transferred management of each preprimary and primary school to an elected Com-munity Education Association composed mostly ofparents and other community members (Jimenezand Sawada 1999). These councils are legallyresponsible for running the schools, raising funds,and hiring and firing teachers, with the goal ofimproving accountability, attendance, and achieve-ment. Nicaragua's school autonomy reform gaveschool councils\u2014composed of principals, parents,teachers, and students\u2014the authority to hire andfire teachers, veto power over principals' decisions,and discretion over the sanctions of the Ministry ofEducation and the obligations of teachers and stu-dents (King and Ozler 1998). In Australia, undersite-based management reform, school councilsdevelop a school charter, which is a contractbetween the school and the government, while par-ents play a supervisory role through the council(Pascoe and Pascoe 1998). Overall, internationalexperience suggests that deep decentralization withempowered, accountable schools presents the bestopportunity for improving schools. One important difference between experience in Latin America and East Asia, however, is that schoolcouncils in Latin America elect their members fromthe community, whereas this is not yet the practicein East Asian countries. Elected council memberscan truly represent the interests of the communityand provide built-in accountability. In East Asia,the duties and legal powers of school committees\u2014in general and relative to school principals, whotend to sit on the committees\u2014are often unclear. The Locus of Decision Making Countries do not devolve responsibility and power to lower levels of government and schools whole-sale. While a central government may transfer gov-ernance and overall management of basic educa-tion to lower levels, it may retain control of peda- gogical matters, personnel management, andfinancing and resource allocation, or it may decen-tralize those functions to school councils. Howeach country assigns these specific decision areas is,in many respects, a more accurate measure of itsdegree of decentralization. In 1998, the World Education Indicators survey, conducted under the auspices of the Organisationof Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD), collected information on the locus ofdecision making in lower secondary education in asmall sample of developing countries, including afew East Asian countries (OECD 1998). The surveyexamined 38 decisions pertaining to instructionalcontent, personnel management, and resources andfinancing. T o update the resulting data for thischapter, we undertook a similar, though moremodest, information-gathering effort in East Asiancountries. (See the chapter annex for details on themethod we used and a list of functions comparingthe two sets of data.) Both databases reveal de facto rather than de jure decentralization in East Asia. 6However, these assessments of decision-making authority are sub-jective for at least two reasons: First, practice canvary widely within each country, so country-levelinformation is impressionistic rather than a\"weighted average\" of practice across areas. Second,periodic assessments are likely to reflect variationin implementation of legislation, a change in legis-lation, or both. These factors affect these two datasets. We present the results briefly, nonetheless, as arough indication of the change in the degree ofdecentralization of each country relative to othercountries. In 1998, the proportion of decisions related to secondary education made by the central govern-ment varied widely in East Asia\u2014from one-fifth inChina to three-fifths in Indonesia, indicating thatChina's education system was then much morehighly decentralized than Indonesia's (see table 9.2).At that time, China's provincial and local govern-ments were making one-third of such decisionsand schools about one-half, while Indonesia'sprovinces made less than one-tenth of such deci-sions and schools about one-third. By 2003, theallocation of decision making in Indonesia andChina had shifted considerably. China seems tohave retracted powers from schools but widenedEducation Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 183provincial and local power (among counties and townships)\u2014not uncommon in the country'sdecentralization history. In Indonesia, the 1999decentralization reform assigned powers andresponsibilities to district governments, quadru-pling the proportion of education-related decisionsby these governments. The numbers from 1998 and 2003 for the Philippines and Thailand are puzzling: they implythat these countries have recentralized rather thandecentralized during this period. The 1998 datasuggest that the central government was makingonly about one-third of decisions in secondaryeducation in the Philippines, and about one-half ofthe decisions in Thailand. These countries seem tohave pushed back decentralization in 2003, withthree-fifths and three-fourths of decision makinglying with the central government and the role ofschools greatly reduced. Historical background,however, suggests that decentralization to thedegree suggested by the 1998 numbers did notexist, and that the 2003 assessment more accuratelyreflects reality. In Thailand, following the 1997Constitution and the Decentralization Act of 1999,a Decentralization Master Plan approved in 2000stipulated details for transferring responsibilities.However, implementation has been slow. In thePhilippines, the legal framework for decentraliza-tion has not transferred overall management ofsecondary education to local government, althoughstrong local governments nevertheless use theirsubstantial autonomy under the Local GovernmentCode to supplement their administrative authority. In sum, despite the transfer of governance of lower secondary education to lower levels of gov-ernment in these countries, decision making on specific functions actually occurs at different levelsof government and in schools.The next section askswhether these countries reveal a pattern in allocat-ing specific decision areas, and whether such allo-cation is likely to improve the way the educationsystems operate and thus promote better outcomes. Who Makes Which Decisions? With different levels of government involved in mul- tiple areas of decision making, the goal is to ensuredelineation and alignment of responsibilities, coor-dination, and information sharing. Although thesechallenges may have existed before decentralization,pressure to address them has intensified. Decentral-ization is not likely to improve the education systemif local governments have the authority to hire andfire teachers but not to influence their promotion,compensation, and development, or if schools havethe authority to choose teaching methods but nottextbooks. Patterns emerge in the locus and mode of 22 of 38 decisions related to secondary education in theEast Asian countries (see table 9.3). Setting curricu-lum content, instruction time, and teachers'salaries, and allocating resources to schools, remainthe domain of the national or state and provincialgovernments. In contrast, all five countries leavethe choice of teaching methods and support activi-ties for students (such as remedial classes) entirelyto schools; four of five countries also assign deci-sion making on teachers' careers to local entities.Cambodia is the most centralistic with respect tothe 22 decisions:184 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 9.2 Percentage of Decisions Related to Lower Secondary Education at Each Level of Government, 1998 and 2003 Central State/provincial/ government local government School Country 1998 2003 1998 2003 1998 2003 Cambodia \u2014 75 \u2014 11 \u2014 14 China 21 3 33 77 46 20Indonesia 63 36 7 28 30 35Philippines 37 62 24 20 39 18Thailand 55 75 0 6 45 20 Sources: OECD 1998; World Bank survey for this study, 2003.

All these countries are reluctant to delegate standard setting and decisionson core curricula to local governments and schools,reflecting the widely held belief that the educationsystem helps promote a national identity as well as shared values and culture.

Note: \u2014/H11005missing data. Symbols indicate locus and mode of decision according to this legend: Decision made in full autonomy: government; /H17009, Local a national framework. China's central government continues to keep a close watchon curriculum, selection of textbooks, school-leav-ing qualifications, and teacher education, and alsoretains control over core subject areas such asmoral-political education (Bray 1999; Shen 1994;Hawkins 2000). A national curriculum frame-work\u2014developed primarily by the centralgovernment with some consultation with localgovernments and adopted in 1992\u2014specifiescompulsory courses. Local autonomy in educationcontent appears to be limited to art, music, andsports. Continuing to take control over the nationalcore curriculum, in 1999 the central government developed new curriculum standards for 18 subjectareas for the nine-year compulsory education level.These standards emphasized the need for the cur-riculum to respond to rapid changes in technologyand China's economy (Wang 2004). The new corecurriculum also allows for local and schoolcurricula, however. According to Indonesia's Education Law 20, the central government still determines the curricu-lum framework and structure for basic and sec-ondary education (Article 38). The central govern-ment is also establishing minimum servicestandards for education. However, district govern-ments, given constrained financial and technicalresources, may have trouble meeting these stan-dards. Likewise, in Thailand, the Commission ofBasic Education\u2014a pillar of the central educationagency\u2014is responsible for proposing standardsand the core curricula for basic education in linewith the National Scheme of Education, Religion,Art, and Culture. Parents' groups will provideinternal oversight of each school, while a centralagency will develop criteria and methods forassessing student performance and school quality.In the Philippines, the central government alsoretains responsibility for policy, curriculum, per-sonnel, and operations. Decisions on creating or closing a school are made at the national level in the Philippines andThailand but at the local level in Cambodia, China,and Indonesia. These countries usually decentralizedecisions on textbooks and teaching and assessmentmethods to provincial and local governments. Allcountries except Cambodia allow schools to makeautonomous decisions regarding grouping studentsand providing extracurricular activities.Countries outside East Asia show a similar reluc- tance to surrender control over the substance andquality of education to subnational governmentsand schools. For example, in Chile, the central min-istry maintains curriculum-setting, regulatory, andquality assurance functions (Delannoy 2000). InAustralia, the Curriculum Standard Frameworkdefines eight key learning areas, incorporating bothcontent and process standards (Pascoe and Pascoe1998). Likewise, the British school reform estab-lished a national curriculum with learning objec-tives for core subjects each year and at each keystage (Rodr\u00edguez and Hovde 2002). In Spain, whichis less centralized, the decentralization law estab-lished that the Ministry of Education defines65 percent of the instructional material taught inall schools, while autonomous communities maydefine 35-45 percent of domains that reflectregional interests (Hanson 2000). But in otherOECD countries, schools choose teaching methods,textbooks, and techniques for assessing studentsday-to-day, although usually within a frameworkestablished by a higher level of government (OECD1998). This is similar to the approach among somestates in Brazil, such as Paran\u00e1, Pernambuco, andRio de Janeiro, where most schools are responsiblefor elaborating pedagogical proposals and inte-grating them into the core curriculum process(Machado 2002). 7 Teacher management . Different levels of govern- ment make decisions regarding teachers, oftenleading to confusion and inefficiencies. These deci-sions range from teacher training to recruitment,deployment, performance evaluation, humanresources databases, payroll, and redeployment.Some countries decentralize some functions, suchas hiring and firing of teachers, while keeping oth-ers effectively centralized, such as setting compen-sation levels. Indonesia illustrates a mixed\u2014and confus- ing\u2014policy regarding teacher management. The2003 Education Law stipulates that the central anddistrict governments share responsibility for \"get-ting educators and education personnel to ensurethe implementation of good quality educationprograms\" (Article 41), and that these govern-ments will \"supervise and develop educationalpersonnel in education units\" (Article 44). How-ever, many aspects of teacher management remaincentralized, including managing the personnel186 East Asia Decentralizesdatabase, registering personnel actions, and trans- mitting this information to the payroll system.While districts manage personnel and payroll, therecording of such actions\u2014necessary to trigger the payroll\u2014is still centralized, and, according tocivil service law, the central government retainsmuch authority over teacher wages, positionallowances, family and rice allowances, and evenhonoraria. In focus-group discussions, teachersreported that while they support decentralization,they prefer central management of their employ-ment (World Bank 2004a). According to teachers,given that processes such as promotion stillrequire the center's approval, decentralization hasslowed action on personnel matters because it hasadded a bureaucratic layer. T eachers also claimthat management processes are neither moretransparent nor better monitored, even thoughthey occur at the district level. Without authorityor significant influence over teacher-related mat-ters, local governments and schools lack the singlemost important tool to influence the quality ofeducation. In countries outside East Asia, the approach to managing teachers is also mixed and reveals awillingness to experiment. In Chile and Mexico,control over contracts is centralized, and a nationalsalary scale standardizes teachers' pay. Other coun-tries have encouraged greater local participation. InEl Salvador, community education associations arelegally responsible for hiring and firing teachers. Inthe United Kingdom, while the national level sets aminimum pay scale and qualifications for educa-tors, public schools are responsible for hiring andpaying their own teachers. In Brazil, communitiesacross an increasing number of municipalities relyon direct elections to select school directors (Namode Mello 2005). Financing and resource allocation . This decision area is the most decentralized, as countries havesought to mobilize local funds for schools\u2014but notwithout second thoughts. Initial enthusiasm forgranting revenue-raising authority to local govern-ments has been dampened by inequalities, followedby attempts to rein in the tendency of local govern-ments to impose many new taxes. Nonetheless,declines in subsidies from the central governmentand emerging fiscal gaps have forced communitiesand schools to seek supplementary funding, oftenby raising user charges.Fiscal decentralization was a key feature of China's reform, with the central government reducing itssubsidies to local schools, and local governmentsintensifying their efforts to find alternative fundingfor basic education through taxes, community con-tributions, and income from enterprises (Hawkins2000; Tsang 2002). As the central government cutschool subsidies, the share of nongovernmentalsources rose from 19 percent in 1993 to 24 percent in2000 (Hawkins 2000). Reform documents suggestedsix sources of funding: urban and rural surchargeslevied by local governments, contributions fromindustry and social organizations, donations by indi-viduals and community organizations, tuition fees,income from school-run enterprises, and centralauthorities. In 1994, however, the central govern-ment reversed itself and removed certain tax author-ity from local governments, and has continued tofund teachers' salaries and certain capital expendi-tures, citing growing disparities across regions(Tsang 2002; West and Wong 1995). The practice ofcharging fees is prohibited by the central governmentbut encouraged by local governments, which usesome of these additional resources to fund a compen-satory mechanism. The local government defines thefee scale and collects a certain percentage from feerevenues. For example, district governments receive25-50 percent of fee revenues collected by schools.The revenues remitted to local governments are thenused to help other schools repair their school build-ings and improve their facilities (Wang 2004). Financing for education in Indonesia is also meant to be a \"shared responsibility\" of the centralgovernment, district governments, and communi-ties (Article 46), but legislation has sent mixed mes-sages about how autonomous local governmentsactually are in raising funds (Government ofIndonesia 2003; World Bank 2004a). On the onehand, laws have expanded the revenue-raising abil-ity of district governments and allowed them todetermine their own financial management,accounting, and procurement systems within broadguidelines. On the other hand, three design featuresof the reform limit local autonomy. First, a suppos-edly temporary hold-harmless component assignspart of the block grant to districts to cover thesalaries of existing teachers. Second, the reform ear-marks at least 20 percent of the national budget anda similar percentage of the regional budget (net ofsalaries) for education (Article 49 of the Education Education Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 187Law). Third, the funding mechanism for education is still too diverse and fragmented. Given thesefeatures, some regional education officials haveexpressed frustration at not knowing the total levelof resources actually available to them (World Bank2004a). Without information or transparency, theyfind it difficult to plan ahead, to develop coherentand effective educational programs, and to monitorand assess the flow of funds through the system. In the Philippines, education financing is more centralized because public education is not for-mally decentralized, but local governments spendtheir own resources for education nonetheless. 8 The sources of local government financing are theInternal Revenue Allotment (IRA), which the cen-tral government sends to each municipality andcity, and the Special Education Fund (SEF), whichis a 1 percent tax on assessed values of real proper-ties owned by a municipality or city. One-half ofthe SEF is spent at the municipality or city level andthe other half is remitted to provinces for educationprojects. The provincial Local School Board deter-mines the allocation of this fund among munici-palities. 9Because the Local Government Code devolved construction and maintenance of elemen-tary and secondary school buildings to municipali-ties and cities, the SEF also sometimes finances suchconstruction and repair, as well as equipment, edu-cational research, books and periodicals, and sportsdevelopment. Many local governments have alsoshown initiative in using the fund to establish newsecondary schools and hire more teachers, or to topoff the salaries of the centrally hired public teachers(Azfar et al. 2001; Manasan 2002). 10User charges have also boosted local funding: the share of schoolfees in education spending by households rose to17 percent in 1997 (Manasan 2002). 11Fearing that fees might reverse gains in enrollments, in 2001 thecentral Department of Education prohibited ele-mentary schools from collecting user charges. If the central government adopts a strong com- pensatory policy in distributing funds acrossregions, then local financing and modest usercharges can boost performance by allowing parentsand the community to exert greater control overschool operations. In the Philippines, schools thatrely more heavily on local sources\u2014includingcontributions from the local school board, munici-pal government, and parent-teacher associations\u2014are more efficient. A 1 percent increase in the shareof financing from local sources can lead to a 0.14 percent decline in total costs (Jimenez andSawada 1996). In Indonesia, local governmentspending and parental contributions boost schoolefficiency: cost per student falls as the local share offunding rises, though at a diminishing rate (Jameset al. 1996). In sum, if used with an eye towardequity concerns, local funding can improve effi-ciency without worsening inequality. The role of the central education agency .U n d e r decentralization, the central education authorityneeds to redefine its role and reform its structuresand processes so it can fulfill its new core functions.Lower levels of governments simply have no incen-tive to carry out some policies and programsbecause they cannot fully capture the returns, theyare unable to perform them well because of a lackof economies of scale, or they do not have enoughresources. These policies and programs includesetting goals and standards for service provision,experimenting when needed, rewarding innovationfrom other parts of the system, disseminatinginformation widely and regularly, establishing andenforcing a transparent regulatory framework, andensuring more equitable education spending. East Asian countries recognize these roles. The 1985 decision by the Central Committee of China'sCommunist Party on reforming the educationsystem retains a guiding and monitoring role for thecentral government on major policies, principles,and the general plan. In 1993, the State Councilissued the Program for China's Educational Reformand Development to address weaknesses in the edu-cation system and to emphasize the link betweenthe country's economic development and education.This policy guideline provided for local govern-ments to assume more responsibility for managingand financing basic education, and encouraged thegradual establishment of community-sponsoredschools, while retaining the central government'srole as the arbiter of rules and regulations (Hawkins2000). This mandate of local responsibility and dif-ferentiated levels of management was reinforced bythe State Education Commission in 1995 throughthe Education Law of the People's Republic of China(Wang 2004). Thailand's National Education Act of 1999 assigned administration and management functionsrelated to academic matters, budget, and personnelto \"educational service areas, educational insti-188 East Asia Decentralizestutions, and local administration organizations\" (Section 9) (Kingdom of Thailand 1999). However,this legislation maintains a large role for the centralauthority in designating standards and definingprocedures while supporting local governancethrough boards and committees. International experience illustrates the role of the central government in reducing educationinequalities within a decentralized setting. In bothSpain and Chile, the central government usedrevenue-sharing and transfer mechanisms toimplement this goal. Besides a block grant budgettransfer, Spain created the Inter-T erritorial Com-pensation Fund (FCI). As a result, in 1996 Andaluciareceived 38 percent of state redistributed incomeand 39 percent of the FCI, while Madrid receivedless than 1 percent of state redistributed income(Hanson 2000). In Chile, the P-900 programdesigned pedagogic support initiatives for ruralstudents and the least-advantaged 10 percent of theprimary school population. Chile used severalmeasures to improve equity in the 1990s: a capita-tion grant to rural schools; scholarships for indige-nous, low-income, and distinguished students;school feeding programs; and an expansion of pre-school education (Delannoy 2000). In 1998, theMexican government adopted a formula-drivensystem for allocating transfers to states. Underthe new formula, states receive at least the sameamount as the previous year, as well as budgetaryincrements based on the number of needed schoolsand teachers (Lopez-Acevedo et al. 2003). In Brazilin the mid-1990s, the Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional assigned the federal government the role of narrowing inequalities in access andfinance, and launched the Fund for the Mainte-nance and Development of Basic Education andT eacher Appreciation (FUNDEF) to equalizefinancing for basic education. This fund guaranteesa minimum per pupil expenditure in primaryschools throughout the country and partiallyequalizes per pupil funding within states. The Impact of Decentralization: Educational Dividends East Asia's experience with decentralization has been relatively brief, so it is too early to assess thereal impact of decentralization reforms on manymeasures of educational development. This sectionpresents two measures of such impact: the level of spending on education, and geographical dispari-ties in enrollment and literacy rates. The sectionfocuses on three of the five countries\u2014China, thePhilippines, and Indonesia, which have had slightlylonger experience with decentralization. The evi-dence is suggestive rather than conclusive, becauseit reflects not only the effects of decentralizationbut also those of other reforms and developments.Even if we could capture the direct impact ofdecentralization, the results would reflect its design,procedural and implementation capacity, andpolitical maturity more than its inherent flaws andbenefits. This section also presents the impact ofdecentralization on student performance, butfocuses on lessons from international experiencebecause of lack of data on East Asia. Greater but More Unequal Education Spending Has total spending on education grown as a result of decentralization? Are funding levels appropriate?Answers to these questions need to considerwhether a country has created an appropriate bal-ance between assigned expenditure responsibilitiesat various levels and allocated revenues (\"verticalequalization\"). In other words, local governmentsshould control resources commensurate with theirassigned responsibilities, and transfers from thenational government should supplement what theylack. Has the spending share of local governmentsexpanded relative to the share of the central gov-ernment? Has the type of government spending foreducation changed? Have central governmentstended to spend more on, say, capital investmentsthan recurrent items such as salaries and opera-tional expenditures? China . This country's share of education expen- ditures in total fiscal spending more than doubled\u2014from 6.7 to 18 percent\u2014from 1978 to 2001. Thecentral government devoted 16.3 percent of itsbudget to education in 2001 (People's Republic ofChina 2002). From 1986 to 1992, the budget alloca-tion and out-of-budget funds grew annually by3.5 percent and 19.7 percent in real terms, respec-tively, while per-student budgeted spending rose by9.6 percent at the primary level and 5.1 percent atthe secondary level. Y et because China's economygrew rapidly, the share of education spending ingross domestic product (GDP) fell from 2.9 percent Education Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 189ernments provide a financial subsidy to poor areas, the subsidy is small and an ad hoc instrumentrather than a regular part of financing for compul-sory education. The result is that teachers are notpaid on time, many schools are in poor physicalcondition, and the goals of the Universal Compul-sory Education program have been delayed. Despitethe program's efforts to raise the minimum provi-sion of education in poor regions, they provide lesseducation in terms of quantity and quality and passmore costs along to families. And, contrary to thelaw, some county governments are borrowing fromthe private sector to finance their schools (Tsang2002). In addition, although tuition fees in compul-sory education are forbidden by law, fees in publicschools are often collected in the form of a \"jointconstruction fee\" or as voluntary donations (Wang2004). Philippines . In this country, total public spend- ing on education as a percent of GDP rose at anaverage annual rate of 6 percent from 1987 to 2001(see figure 9.2). During this 15-year period, spend-ing declined only during times of fiscal adjustment(1990-94) and financial crisis (1998-99), mainlybecause of dips in central government spending.GDP grew by 4.1 percent in real terms, so this largershare of education meant a substantial rise in realspending for education. As a share of total spendingby local governments, education spending rose from 3.8 percent in 1990-91 to 7.8 percent in1998-2000, with the Special Education Fund (SEF)fueling a growing part of this local spending, rising190 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 9.4 China: Education as a Share of Total Fiscal Expenditures 1997 1998 1999 Hezheng County 17.3 14.3 13.3 Jinshishan County 19.0 18.4 18.3Linxia Prefecture 16.0 17.2 16.1Gansu Province 14.9 15.5 16.0CHINA 16.7 16.0 Source: World Bank 2000.

Note: Data for 1989 and 1997 pertain to total education expenditures by provinces; 2000 data pertain only to recurrent expenditures. In 1997, for which both total and recurrent expenditure data areavailable, the ratios of recurrent spending by the highest- and lowest-spending provinces are similar(9.4 and 7.1, respectively).in 1991 to 2.5 percent in 1997, and to 2.2 percent in 1999 (Tsang 2002). Even as a share of total govern-ment spending, education expenditures fell some-what from 16.7 percent in 1997 to 16.0 in 1999,such as other fiscal expenditures rose faster (seetable 9.4). Trends varied across counties, however.In some, as Hezheng and Jinshishan, education'sshare of total spending declined. In Gansu province,which began the period with a lower share for edu-cation, that share rose. Interprovincial disparities in per-student spend- ing have also widened. The highest-spendingprovinces spend many times more for primary andlower secondary education than the lowest-spend-ing provinces, and these gaps have grown, especiallyfor primary education (see table 9.5). Observersconclude that the lack of a clear equalizationscheme is a fundamental weakness of the system'sfinancing (Hawkins 2000; Tsang 2002; West andWong 1997). While the central and provincial gov-from 57 percent in 1992 to 79 percent in 1999. The result has been a shift in the shares of central andlocal governments in education spending. In 1991,the local government share was only 2.5 percent,rising to 7.4 percent in 2001. Meanwhile, the sharesof the central government in both capital expendi-tures and operating expenditures for educationhave declined. 12 Data on average SEF spending per pupil indicate wide variation across income classes of municipali-ties and cities (see table 9.6). The poorest munici-palities spend only 13 percent of the SEF per pupilresources of the richest municipalities, and only 3percent of the SEF resources of the richest cities.These numbers plainly show that transferringresponsibility for funding basic education to localgovernments leads to wide regional disparities inschool inputs. Indonesia . It is still too early to tell whether decentralization will raise overall public spendingon education in Indonesia, but early signs havebeen positive. Before decentralization, Indonesiawas spending the smallest share of GDP on educa-tion among East Asian countries: only 1.4 percent.This share rose to more than 4 percent in 2002\u2014asignificant expansion in resources for the sector.In 2001, district governments accounted for abouttwo-thirds of total education spending, whereasthe share of provincial governments was only4 percent.On average, district governments in Indonesia do have more resources at their disposal than in thepast, and the allocation formula stipulates thatpoorer districts should receive larger transfers.However, the central government expects districtsto mobilize more of their own resources to supple- ment the transfers. Herein lies the risk that inequal-ities among districts will grow, as in China and thePhilippines. 13Decentralization laws have given taxing authority to district governments if the cen-tral government authorizes the taxes and districtsabide by principles in Law 34 of 2000. 14The reality, however, is large inequalities in local revenue bases.Many district governments have limited capacityto raise taxes from land, buildings, and natural resources, which constitute only about 5 percentof their revenues. Provincial governments have alarger own-resource base but must share these rev-enues with district governments. For example, theper capita GDP (excluding oil and gas) of the rich-est province, Jakarta, is almost nine times largerthan that of the poorest province, East NusaT enggara (Akita and Alisjahbana 2002). Partly as aresult, per student allocations for recurrent andcapital expenditures vary widely, with districts atthe lower end of the range surely not meeting anykind of education standard (see table 9.7). Summary . The trends in education spending in China, the Philippines, and Indonesia show that totalEducation Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 191 TABLE 9.6 Philippines: Median Values of SEF Resources per PupilFIGURE 9.2 Central and Local Government Education Spending in the Philippines Source: Manasan 2002.00.51.52.5% GDP3.54.5 1.02.03.04.0 198719881989199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001 total government spending central government spending local government spendingIncome 40th classification Median percentile City class 1 590 450 City class 2 382 270City class 3 341 190City class 4 a140 City class 5a120 Class 1 2 65.7 3 50.2 40Class 4 32.5 17.6 Source: Manasan and Atkins 2004.

These numbers represent few observations.resources for education have grown under decentral- ization; yet whether these increases are larger thanthey would have been without reform is difficult tosay. It is also clear that the share of education spend-ing by local governments has grown, partly becausethe central government has devolved resources andresponsibilities for spending those resources to localgovernments, and partly because local governmentsare expected to generate their own resources to meetthose expenditures. However, local governments arefar from equal in their ability to mobilize their ownresources, and thus the gap in education expendi-tures per student between wealthier and poorer areascan only widen. Central governments clearly need toestablish a mechanism for equalizing educationresources across municipalities and cities. The block grant system\u2014which gives local deci- sion makers latitude to act on local goals with gen-erally unrestricted funds\u2014does not guarantee thatofficials will spend enough resources on education.On the one hand, local decision makers may chooseto finance budget items that promise a quicker andmore stimulating effect on the local economy. Onthe other hand, they may respond to the desire oflocal voters for more and better schools, or to thefact that schools provide local employment and canbe a source of prestige for the community and itsleaders. Greater local funding is expected to createpublic pressure to spend resources more wisely andthus make the sector more efficient, given anappropriate system of accountability. Reducing Educational Disparities within Countries As mentioned, developing countries in East Asia have generally made important progress in basic192 East Asia Decentralizes education. Enrollment rates at the primary level arehigh, and rates are rising even for post-basic educa-tion. These numbers hide large inequalities withineach country, however. These inequalities predatedecentralization reforms, but those reforms couldexacerbate them. Large inequalities in the distribu-tion of resources among geographical regions canproduce large disparities in education outcomes.Transferring fiscal responsibilities to local areas andrelying on local resources and expertise is likely towiden educational gaps between areas with a strongrevenue base and those that are less prosperouswhile weakening the central government's ability toclose these gaps. China. So how large are within-country dif- ferences in education outcomes, and have theyincreased or decreased since decentralization?China's overall enrollment rates in basic educationare high, but provinces differ widely in literacyrates and in enrollment rates at the secondarylevel. Literacy rates (for those aged 10 and above)rose significantly from 1982 to 1999\u2014in a fewprovinces by as much as 25 percentage points\u2014and inequality fell (see figure 9.3). The coefficientof variation for literacy rates declined from 0.19 in1982 to 0.13 in 1999. With the sole exception ofTibet, where literacy was only 35 percent in 1999,literacy rates across China exceeded 70 percent.Despite this progress toward equalization,undoubtedly the result of the national policyof universal basic education, provinces such asQinghai, Gansu, Guizhou, and Yunnan lag bynearly 20 percentage points behind the most liter-ate provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Tianjin. Tibet'sliteracy rate also improved, but its gain was one ofthe smallest.TABLE 9.7 Indonesia: Per Capita Education Spending, 2001-2 (in 2001 (actual) in parentheses indicate minimum and maximum values.Education of minority ethnic groups in poorer, interior rural regions has been a concern.Enrollment rates are 15 and 10 percentage pointslower for minority girls and boys than for Han girlsand boys, respectively (Hannum 2002). Secondaryenrollment rates are also unequal among provinces.In 2000, Shanghai and Beijing had enrollment ratesclose to 90 percent, while Tibet, Guizhou, Guangxi,and Hainan had enrollment rates one-third lower.But while the coefficient of variation of enrollmentrates is smaller (at 0.10) than that for literacy rates,the tendency is for provinces that had higherliteracy rates in 1982 to have higher secondaryenrollment rates in 2000, suggesting that laggingprovinces will continue to fall behind. Philippines. Similarly, in the Philippines, literacy rates and enrollment rates vary widely acrossprovinces. Literacy rates (for the population age10 years and above) increased substantially over thefive-year period from 1989 to 1994\u2014by as much asnearly 20 percentage points in Western Mindanao,and by almost 15 percentage points in threeother regions (see figure 9.4). With these gains, theliteracy gap narrowed among the regions, but by1994 literacy rates still ranged from 61 percent inthe Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao(ARMM) to 92 percent in the national capitalregion (metropolitan Manila). 15These trends do not indicate that decentralization has helpedreduce education gaps. Enrollment rates at the secondary level have also shown significant gains since decentralization, withincreases fairly equal across regions. 16The notable exceptions are the regions in Mindanao: NorthernMindanao is the only region in which secondaryenrollment rates declined, and the increases in theother Mindanao regions are smaller than in anyother region. In 2002, enrollment rates varied fromjust 32 percent in ARMM to 94 percent in theIlocos Region. The experience of ARMM is noteworthy because it is the region with the fullest autonomy, includingin managing its education system. 17Legislation passed in 2001 contains detailed provisions that theregion's schools will adopt the basic core courses,minimum curriculum, and textbooks required bythe national government, but will have the preroga-tive and responsibility to add other courses andinstructional materials that reflect Islamic values.With respect to the two indicators considered above,Education Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 193 FIGURE 9.3 Literacy and Enrollment Rates in China, by Province Source: People's Republic of China 2001.

Although the enrollment gap in primaryeducation between ARMM and the rest of the coun-try has narrowed since the 1990s, it remains sub-stantial: nearly 20 percentage points separateschool-age children in the poorest quintile inARMM and those in other regions (World Bank2003b). ARMM children begin school later and areonly about half as likely to continue through theelementary grades, and the transition to high schoolis particularly difficult. As a result, fewer than 2 of 10 children who enter grade one complete highschool. In sum, while at least two other factors mightexplain the region's poor education indicators\u2014high poverty and protracted armed conflict\u2014it isreasonable to conclude that greater autonomy hasnot produced better outcomes. Indonesia. Indonesia's enrollment rates, especially at the primary level, compare favorably with thoseof East Asian countries with higher per capitaincome. With decentralization relatively nascent inIndonesia, these overall gains cannot be attributed tothe reform. But differences among regions revealthe equity challenge for decentralization. In 2002, theenrollment rate of youths aged 13 to 15 (roughlythe junior secondary level) ranged from 68 percentin South Sulawesi to 94 percent in Y ogjakarta (seefigure 9.5). 18Increases since 1998 have been modest.194 East Asia Decentralizes FIGURE 9.5 Enrollment Rates in Indonesia, by Province Enrollment rates of 13- to 15-year-olds, 1998 and 2002 percent60 70 90 80 1001998 2002 Sources: Susenas 1998 and 2002.

Note: Provinces are arranged in descending order according to values in the more recent year.1991 20021989 1994Disparities within provinces are even larger than variation between provinces. Only about one-fourth to one-third of inequality in enrollmentrates in primary and secondary education is due todifferences among provinces\u2014the rest reflects dif-ferences among districts within a province. Thismeans that equalization among districts withineach province is a greater challenge than equaliza-tion among provinces. Overall, these changes in the levels and inter- provincial distribution of education expenditures,and in basic indicators, in China, the Philippines,and Indonesia point to both positive and negativeeffects of reform. However, the analysis is still at anaggregate level. Ultimately, the test of decentraliza-tion's effectiveness is whether schools are better andstudents are learning better. Decentralization lawsencourage greater local and community participa-tion in providing and financing education, but thisfeature exposes inequalities between prosperousand poor areas, and the inability of poor areas tomobilize adequate resources. Central transfermechanisms need to equalize resources acrossareas. Indeed, the push for greater local mobiliza-tion of resources in decentralizing countries riskswidening disparities between regions with a strongrevenue base and those that are less prosperous. Butimplementing an equalization scheme is a consid-erable political challenge. On the one hand is theissue of how much inequality in educational out-comes the political system can tolerate; on the otherhand is the question of to what extent the systemcan redistribute from richer areas to poorer areas,and from urban areas to rural areas. Improving the Quality of Education Good education is not only about quantitative targets, such as boosting the supply of classrooms,textbooks, and teachers, but also about incentivesthat lead to better instruction and learning. Thelevel and use of public spending for education isonly part of the educational story in East Asia. 19 East Asian countries do not yet have a record of theimpact of decentralization on student outcomes,especially on learning. There are several reasons forthis: Decentralization is a wide-ranging reform,encompassing and influencing school functions indifferent ways, so isolating its impact from otherchanges in the education system and the economyat large is difficult. Student-level data on national exam results are usually not available even toresearchers. Summary test results do not allowstudy of whether differences in test scores resultfrom changes in students' economic conditions orfrom aspects of the decentralization reform. Lastly,most East Asian countries have relatively briefexperience with decentralization. However, evalua-tions of the experiences of countries outside EastAsia provide lessons on the potential impact ofdecentralization on student performance. In the United States, two examples are illustra- tive. The 1995 Chicago School Reform AmendatoryAct modified a 1988 autonomy reform by estab-lishing stronger central support functions andrequiring external accountability mechanisms. 20 Although attributing causality to either the 1988 orthe 1995 reform is difficult because of their com-plementary nature, student scores in elementaryreading and math have improved consistently since1995. The percentage of students scoring at orabove the mean in elementary reading tests rosefrom 26.5 percent in 1995 to 36.1 percent in 1999. 21 In 1995, Memphis introduced a similar set ofreforms that differed in one important feature: cityschools received a menu of eight different restruc-turing models from which to choose. Before 1995,the schools that later became autonomous hadlower student achievement; two years later, theirscores were substantially higher than those in acontrol group (Ross et al. 1998). In Chile, two phases of reform appear to have produced significantly different results. One evalu-ation concluded that the first phase had either anegative effect on student performance or no effect.A confounding factor was that education expendi-tures declined during the same period. A later eval-uation concluded that the reform did not improvethe quality of public schools, and that test scores forthe majority of students declined. Another evalua-tion found that test scores were higher in privateschools, but concluded that this was largely becausethose schools chose better students. Y et anotherstudy found that teacher autonomy exerts greaterpositive effects on student performance whendecision-making authority Carnoy 1999; Urquiola2001; Vegas 2002). Evaluations of the second phaseshow more positive results, with an 18 percent riseEducation Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 195in language and math test scores on standardized tests. But again, isolating the effects of decentraliza-tion from other influences, such as the substantialrise in education expenditures throughout thedecade, is difficult. An evaluation of Nicaragua's 1991 school auton- omy reform shows that schools took some time toexercise the new functions and powers given toschool councils. Controlling for de jure and defacto autonomy, the results indicate that schoolautonomy\u2014especially in decisions related to staffingand monitoring of teacher activities\u2014improves stu-dent performance (King and Ozler 1998). Moreover,math and language scores were significantly higherin schools where teachers felt more empowered andinfluential in decision making. Brazil's reform remains to be evaluated at the student level, but researchers have already usedstate-level measures of educational performance toassess progress. While school councils and the directtransfer of resources are not significantly related tobetter student performance, the election of schooldirectors is positively associated with higher testscores. 22Rather than testing the reform as a whole, the researchers decided to break it down into threecomponents and analyze the impact of eachinnovation on educational performance. 23Among reform-minded Brazilian states, the most promi-nent is Minas Gerais, whose reform included schoolautonomy and dramatically schools' inter-nal structure of accountability (Guedes et al.1997). 24As in Nicaragua, however, qualitative stud- ies have shown that while de jure autonomy rarelyexerts any influence in most schools, de facto auton-omy appears to boost teacher motivation, and thusthe potential for improving student learning andparticipation in the classroom (Cordeiro Guerra2003). An evaluation of El Salvador's EDUCO reform found that parents in EDUCO schools participatemore actively in school affairs, feel they have moreinfluence over decision making in the school, andhave a more direct relationship with teachers thanparents in traditional public schools. This greaterlocal participation has had a positive effect on edu-cation outcomes. Controlling for school andstudent characteristics, a study found that studentsin EDUCO schools do not perform worse onachievement tests despite the fact that they comefrom poorer families, and that student absencesowing to teacher absences are significantly lower in EDUCO schools (Jimenez and Sawada 1999). In sum, international experience yields mixed evidence on the impact of decentralization on stu-dent performance. U.S. experience provides posi-tive evidence, but the experience in Latin Americayields ambiguous results. Reform-oriented schoolsin the cities of Chicago and Memphis have substan-tially higher test scores than schools in the controlgroup. In Latin America, whereas decentralizationappears to have improved student performance inNicaragua and Brazil, and to have reduced teacherand student absenteeism in El Salvador, evaluationsof Chile's long-running reform are inconclusiveconcerning the impact of greater local participationand school choice on student performance. Lessons about Decentralizing Education Experiences in the five East Asian countries are beginning to provide lessons for implementingdecentralization\u2014the factors that have affectedtheir experiences, the sources of resistance or sup-port they have encountered, and the risks and chal-lenges that have emerged. Actual practice oftendeviates from formal rules on decentralization, andit is important to understand why. As mentioned,China has had the longest experience with decen-tralization and thus offers valuable lessons. WhileIndonesia and Thailand previously tried to decen-tralize some functions, their formal decentraliza-tion reforms are recent. Cambodia's reform is moreaccurately characterized as deconcentration, whilereform in the Philippines is largely a side effect ofa broader decentralization that has formallybypassed education. Indonesia has chosen the rapidBig Bang approach, while Cambodia and Thailandare proceeding at a much more measured pace. Lessons from these experiences include: Strive to clarify the assignment of functions, sim- plify new processes and structures, and provide mech-anisms to coordinate and foster a shared understand-ing of reform at different levels of government, as wellas to adjudicate disagreements. Decentralizing education systems requires har- monizing a complex set of functions at each leveland type of education, and is a difficult reform todesign and implement. Central governments tend todevolve management of education to different levels196 East Asia Decentralizesof government, but devolution does not happen wholesale. The central government may retain indi-vidual decision areas that may or may not cut acrosslevels of education, or may devolve them even moredeeply. This complexity leads to confusion, redun-dant bureaucracies, and weak implementation.Mixed signals from legislation and policies make itdifficult for subnational governments and schools tofulfill their functions efficiently and effectively. Despite two decades of implementing decentral- ization in China, for example, the division ofresponsibilities between county and townships isstill unclear. The 1994 Guidelines for the Reformand Development of Education state that bothcounty and township governments are responsiblefor delivering compulsory education, although theformer manages education revenues and the lattersafeguards the right to compulsory education forschool-age children and adolescents. The legisla-tion is unclear on how these responsibilities differ,and also seems to conflict with the Budget Law,which clearly states that each level of governmentshould budget separately for its own jurisdiction(Hawkins 2000). In Thailand, implementation difficulties stem from vague compromises on the overall decentral-ization plan and time frame. Local governments arepoorly informed about their roles and responsibili-ties as well as the decentralization plan and timeframe. Legislation is itself unclear about the decen-tralization process. For example, the 1999 NationalEducation Act transfers authority from the centralgovernment's provincial and district offices to 175school districts or local education areas (LEAs),each with its own committee and office. This aspectof the reform, if implemented, would requirestaffing cuts and redeployment totaling half of alleducation administrators in various provinces(Mutebi 2003). 25In response, implementers of the National Decentralization Act argue that they havethe authority to transfer power to local govern-ments only after they fulfill a set of readiness crite-ria. The latter piece of legislation would seem toretrieve some of the autonomy delegated by the National Education Act. Parties have reached acompromise to merge both acts, which entailsadministrative deconcentration of central power toLEAs in the short to medium term, and gradualdecentralization of responsibilities from LEAs tolocal governments in the long term (World Bank2003d). 26Ironically, even this compromise suffers from vagueness on a time frame. In Cambodia, the initial framework for decon- centrating and decentralizing education is clearabout delegating authority to provincial and districtauthorities, but is much less clear about the roles ofthe school cluster system and commune councils.The Cluster School Policy, created in 1996, encour-ages decentralized management of resources, but isambiguous about what functions school clustersneed to perform. Similarly, commune councils,though endowed with new financing mechanisms,lack clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Thislack of clarity weakens the institutional structuresthat are closest to the community, ultimately weak-ening accountability as well. The central government plays important but different roles in a decentralized context, and needs totransform both its structure and skills. Though stripped of some traditional functions under decentralization, the central authority needsto step into its new roles quickly to facilitate successful reform. These roles include settingstandards and performance measures for usethroughout the education system; ensuring thatdecentralized units can meet the standards throughsystems development, training, and funding; andbrokering links between local governments to cap-ture economies of scale. The central governmentalso needs to perform overall system planning andforecasting and prioritize investment, including ofteacher supply and demand; design and implementan equalization scheme, fostering support fromwealthier regions; and stimulate experiments andspread lessons learned. The central government clearly has a critical role to play in designing and implementing equal-ization schemes. Decentralization laws encouragegreater local and community participation in pro-viding and financing education, but this featureexposes inequalities between prosperous and poorareas and the inability of poor areas to mobilizeadequate resources for education, and risks widen-ing those disparities. Appropriate transfer mecha-nisms can equalize resources across regions. How-ever, equalization efforts are not only about infusingmore money into local systems but also\u2014andmore importantly\u2014about changing incentives.Implementing an equalization scheme can be aEducation Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 197considerable political challenge, as efforts to redis- tribute from richer areas to poorer areas, and fromurban areas to rural areas, may meet resistance. Furthermore, the relative importance of the roles of the central government is likely to changeas decentralization matures, requiring the centralgovernment to boost its involvement in certainfunctions at certain times. For example, it makesmore sense for the central government to helpbuild capacity in countries like Cambodia than inthose like China, which have a larger national sup-ply of experts. Ultimately, redefining the centralgovernment's roles means distinguishing betweenfunctions requiring critical involvement through-out the process, those requiring periodic involve-ment at different stages, and those requiring one-time initiatives with frequent follow-ups. Decentralization puts the complex architecture needed to operate an education system\u2014personnel,finances, procurement, student assessment, and infor-mation management systems\u2014under pressure. Thissystem needs to be reorganized to reflect the newintergovernmental relationships and decentralizedfunctions, and capacity needs to be strengthened. In decentralized education systems, replacing inappropriate structures and building the capacityto work within new arrangements are key chal-lenges. A principal bottleneck is a lack of adequatetechnical and managerial experience among respon-sible parties. A lack of viable and coordinated man-agement systems linking central agencies to localgovernments and schools exacerbates problemsresulting from weak local capacity. Countries may be tempted to slow the pace of decentralization because of fears that district andprovincial governments do not have enoughcapacity to fulfill their newly assigned responsibil-ities effectively. Indeed, the traditional approachhas been to build local capacity before transfer-ring responsibility and authority because of con-cerns about irresponsible spending, local corrup-tion, regional inequities, and service collapse.However, although capacity building is important,local governments may have more capacity thanmost central policy makers assume. As decentral-ization proceeds, local talents and capacities arelikely to emerge and to improve with practice, as isbecoming clear in Cambodia, Indonesia, and thePhilippines. Furthermore, in China, the capacityof local governments to manage compulsory edu- cation seems to have improved substantially, inareas such as training personnel, collecting andusing information, expanding the use of technol-ogy, and incorporating research findings and con-sulting experts in the decision-making process(World Bank 2004c; Kerr 1999; Tsang 2002). For decentralization to exert a positive impact on student performance, information and evaluationsystems\u2014as accountability mechanisms\u2014must notonly be in place but must also function iterativelythrough participation. Information problems become much more acute in a decentralized context. Dramatic shifts inresponsibilities and powers often lead to the break-down of information and evaluation systems,which typically depend on the central governmentto extract information from lower levels of govern-ment and schools. In Spain, decentralizing admin-istrative functions to regions greatly underminedthe country's capacity to collect and disseminatenational statistics. Newly autonomous regionsbegan to produce their own statistics using incom-patible methods, and although the Spanish govern-ment took a strong stance on cooperation, it stillmet resistance. The Education Law in 1985 tried toovercome the lack of coordination across regionsthrough a Conference of Counselors which includedthe Minister of Education and autonomous com-munity counselors. Information on performance at all levels is key to accountability. Countries can use sample testing,national surveys, and the census to assess theimpact of programs, allocate resources, and iden-tify geographic areas requiring special attention(Asian Development Bank 1999). Local govern-ments, communities, and schools also need infor-mation and diagnostic tools to evaluate perfor-mance in specific subject areas, define learningchallenges in different communities, and comparedifferent pedagogical approaches and teachertraining mechanisms. School-level data can alsocommunicate results to parents and the larger com-munity. At the deepest level, information is instru-mental for greater accountability and control. Citi-zens rely mostly on frequent reports, magazines,and participatory workshops to gain informationon student performance. However, linking teacherpromotion to predetermined inputs and outputs 198 East Asia Decentralizescould create perverse incentives for transmitting information. Some analysts, including the Educa-tion Commission in the Philippines, argue that thegovernment should use incentives to make teachersand school heads directly accountable for studentoutcomes (see box 9.1 for an account of the infor-mation system of the Brazilian state of Paran\u00e1). One area that deserves monitoring and evalua- tion is the flow of funds through the system. InCambodia, the Department of Finance designedan improved system for monitoring financial per-formance in 2001. Supported by training and tech-nical assistance, new budget management forms forschools, districts, provinces, and central depart-ments, along with provincial and program reports,will feed into a computerized system. A fund track-ing system will monitor inputs and outputs andrelate them to strategic outcomes, and will includeincentives for transmitting information. Schoolinspection reports will now focus more on schoolperformance indicators, such as development plan-ning, financial management, community partner-ships, teaching and learning processes, the learningand school environment, and promotion rates. Accurate and timely information on enrollments, teachers, and school inputs is essential, especially forassessing the needs of remote areas and underservedpopulations. Widely conflicting statistics on thesevariables are still too common to support robustplanning and policy making. Most problematic ofall are student testing systems: the challenge is tomake national tests comparable over time to allowpolicy evaluation, and to ensure that they reflect existing or desired curriculum content. 27 To advance education outcomes, school stakehold- ers must have greater voice and exercise some controlover school operations. Decentralization is not just about increasing local management and technical skills, but alsoabout strengthening the voice of the community inthe delivery of public services. In many centralisticsystems, local communities are not used to govern-ing themselves, electing politicians who representtheir interests, and using their right to vote to maketheir will known. Breaking out of this mold imme-diately is difficult. Despite commune councils inChina, lack of popular representation persists at thelocal level. In Cambodia, the central governmentstill appoints provincial governors and districtheads. And in Indonesia, although the majority ofschools now have school committees, they hardlymeet and do not yet fulfill their designated func-tions (World Bank 2004a). Beyond strengthening voice, experiences in countries outside East Asia suggest that giving par-ents, teachers, and other stakeholders decision-making authority in key areas such as curriculum,training, and pedagogical approaches leads to bet-ter student performance. This occurs throughgreater commitment from teachers, more focus onlearning, stronger school leadership, and a sense ofresponsibility for results (King and Ozler 1998;Winkler and Gershberg 2000).Education Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 199 BOX 9.1 School Report Cards in Paran\u00e1: A New Incentive System In the state of Paran\u00e1 in Brazil, a new system of incentives at the school level entails producingschool report cards. These report cards\u2014knownasBoletim da Escola \u2014include three main sets of information. These are results from theStatewide Student Learning Testing (coveringPortuguese, math, and science), school censusdata (on student promotion, retention, dropoutrates, enrollment, teacher-pupil ratios, andteacher profiles), and surveys of school life (fromstudents, parents, and school managers). Thereport cards therefore focus on individual schoolperformance while allowing for cross-schoolcomparisons in the state and region. This wealth of information enhances competition acrossschools, thus strengthening incentives and over-all accountability at the state level. If appliedconsistently across time, this system will alsohelp schools assess the impact of their policieson student performance. One lesson from theseexperiences is that such systems are not sustain-able if they lack local ownership, and if schoolsdo not have the technical capacity to maintainand use them. Source: Vasconcelos-Saliba 2004.T op-down decentralization has largely precluded the involvement of teachers and teachers' unions indesigning education reform. 28Such limited agency reflects not only the impetus for decentralizationbut also political and unions' inability to mobilize.Unions have been less politically active (China) andhave had fewer opportunities to play a significantrole (Cambodia and Philippines) than in LatinAmerican countries, where teachers' unions havewielded more political power and played criticalroles in shaping education reform. 29The Latin American experience shows that these responsescan be diverse, including resistance (Mexico),negotiation (Bolivia and Chile in the 1990s),cooperation (Brazil), and inaction (Chile inthe 1980s). Decentralization inevitably drawsmany stakeholders\u2014namely, local authorities andassociations\u2014into the decision-making process ingovernment and schools. Fearing a loss of negotiat-ing power on critical issues such as salaries and thehiring and firing of personnel, unions have stronglyopposed efforts to decentralize (Gaynor 1998).These experiences foreshadow the extent to whichunions' political influence might affect both thepace and depth of decentralization in East Asia. A review of 83 studies of school-based manage- ment in North America and among members of theOECD revealed greater teacher commitment, morecollaboration and information sharing, and a change in classroom instruction. In India, studentdropout rates declined and teacher attendanceimproved\u2014from 33 percent to 78-86 percent\u2014after village education committees began participat-ing in schools and teacher monitoring (Leithwoodand Menzies 1998; Pandey 2000). In the Philippines,about 2,000 schools adopted school-based manage-ment on a trial basis in connection with a WorldBank-supported education project. Preliminaryresults show that greater involvement among teach-ers in planning and managing schools has greatlyimproved their motivation and enthusiasm, whileprincipals' efforts to fully involve teachers in identi-fying problems and needs, and to improve commu-nication, have helped yield solutions. Countries vary in the extent to which they have decentralized functions directly affecting teach-ers, such as recruitment, deployment, promotion,and salary scales. Nonetheless, underlying thesearrangements are incentives that influence thebehavior of teachers and ultimately affect the qual-ity of teaching and student learning. Research on teacher incentives has shown that teachers are notonly sensitive to incentives but also responsive.Designing targeted incentives that translate intoimproved classroom performance and studentlearning is extremely difficult because teacher effortis both difficult and costly to measure (Murnaneet al. 1991; Hanushek 1986; Waterreus 2003).Several countries in Latin America, in parallel withdecentralization, have implemented policy reformsaffecting teacher incentives, such as FUNDEF. Annex: Research and Data Collection Methods The 2003 World Bank study on which this chapter is based followed a method similar to that used inthe 1998 World Education Indicators survey byOECD-INES (Indicators of Education Systems).Y et the Bank study also differs in significant ways.What follows is a description and comparison ofour methodology and research approach, includingthe conceptual framework of the questionnaire,data collection procedure, and calculation of indi-cators. This annex also outlines the methods weused to make the two studies comparable. Conceptual Framework of the Questionnaire Decentralization focuses on the distribution of power between levels of government. The OECD-INES survey examined two dimensions of decen-tralization: the locus of decision making\u2014that is,the level of government with authority\u2014and themode of decision making, or the degrees to whichlevels of government are autonomous or shareauthority. The World Bank study examined the for-mer: the locus of decision making. While the OECD-INES survey distinguished six levels of government (central, state, provincial/regional, subregional/intermunicipal, local, andschool), the World Bank study focused on threemain levels of government: National/central: The central government consists of all bodies at the national level that make deci-sions or participate in different aspects ofdecision making, including both administrative(government bureaucracy) and legislative bodies. 200 East Asia DecentralizesState/provincial/local: The state is the first ter- ritorial unit below the nation in federal countries,or in countries with similar types of governmen-tal structures. The province or region is the firstterritorial unit below the national level in coun-tries that do not have a federal or similar type ofgovernment structure, and the second territorialunit below the national level in countries witha federal or similar types of governmentalstructures. The municipality or community isthe smallest territorial unit with governmentalauthority; the local authority may be the educa-tion department within a general-purpose localgovernment, or a special-purpose governmentwhose sole area of authority is education. School: This level applies to individual schools and includes school administrators and teachersor a school board or committee established exclu-sively for that individual school. The decision-making body or bodies for this school may be anexternal school board, which includes residentsfrom the larger community; an internal schoolboard, which could include headmasters, teach-ers, other school staff, parents, and students; andboth an external and an internal school board.The study considered parents and teachers as anelement of the school level. In practice, however, the decision-making process is not that simple. In determining at what level deci-sions are made, numerous unclear situations arise. Insome cases, a higher level of government may haveformal or legal responsibility for decision making,but in practice that level delegates its authority to alower level of government. In describing the actualdecision-making process, we identified the lowerlevel of government as the decision maker. Similarly,a higher level of government may provide a lowerlevel of government with choices in a particular area,such as the selection of textbooks, even though thehigher level establishes the framework for the deci-sion. In that case, too, we designated the lower levelof government as the actual decision maker. Finally,one level of government may have responsibility foran individual decision, but inaction results in a deci-sion by a lower level. If a decision is left to the discre-tion of a lower level through lack of determination athigher levels, then we chose the level that actuallymakes the decision. Although the OECD-INES survey included fewer indicators (35) than the World Bank study(53), both studies organized those indicators into four broad categories. The main items within thosecategories included: Organization of instruction: Decisions regarding which school students will attend ,school careers, instruction time, choice of textbooks,grouping of pupils, assistance to pupils, teachingmethods, and methods for assessing pupils'regular work. Personnel management: Decisions regarding the hiring and firing of the principal and teachingand nonteaching staff, their duties and conditionsof service, their salary scales, and their careers. Planning and structures: Decisions on creating and abolishing schools and grade levels, selectingand designing programs of study and subjectstaught at a particular school, defining coursecontent, setting qualifying exams for certificatesor diplomas, and credentializing students . Resource allocation and use: Decisions on allo- cating resources to a school for teaching staff, non-teaching staff, capital expenditures, and operatingexpenditures, and on using resources for staff,capital expenditures, and operating expenditures. Data Collection Procedure The OECD-INES approach to collecting data was similar to that of the World Bank, although the twostudies differed fundamentally in the composition ofexpert panels formed to assess decision makingat different levels. In the OECD-INES approach,researchers created a panel for each level of educa-tion, composed of one member from each of thethree decision-making levels. These groups com-pleted the questionnaire and arrived at a consensuson all questions. The researchers also composeda second panel for each level of education, againcomposed of one member from each of the threedecision-making levels, and repeated the process.The INES Network C representative or nationalcoordinator for the World Education Indicators sur-vey then compared the results of the two surveys.Where the responses differed, the INES Network Crepresentative used source documents and consultedthe national coordinator to reconcile disagreements. We conducted the World Bank study in two phases, relying on intermittent consultationbetween two different panels of experts. The firstpanel was composed of World Bank education Education Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 201202 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 9A.1 Cross-Study Comparison of Functions World Bank Study (2003) OECD-INES (1998) Pedagogical Organization of instruction Admissions criteria to enter school Decision on what school a child should attend Mode of grouping pupils/class size Mode of grouping pupilsNo. of periods of instruction/classroom hours Number of periods of instructionSelection of textbooks/teaching material Choice of textbooksDesign of programsDesign of program subjectsChoice of subject mattersDefinition of curriculumTeaching methods Teaching methodsProvision for extra help Assistance to pupilsExtracurricular activitiesEvaluation methods Methods of assessing pupils' regular workStudent promotion Decisions affecting pupils, streamingSetting of equivalenciesSetting of goals/targets for the school Administrative Planning and structure Opening/closure of school Creation and closure of a schoolSchool calendarCreation/abolition of grade(s) Creation and abolition of gradesDistribution of textbooks/teaching materialSetting of qualifying examinations Setting of qualifying examinationsCollection of student data (enrollment/exams)Community outreachAwarding of credentials Awarding of credentialsAccreditation of new schools Design of programs for a specific school type Definition of course content Personnel management Personnel management Hiring and firing of staff Hiring and firing of staff Head of school PrincipalsTeaching staff TeachersGeneral staff Nonteaching posts Terms of service and duties Duties and conditions of service of staff Head of school PrincipalsTeaching staff Teachers Nonteaching posts Fixing of salary levels/benefits/incentives Fixing of salary scales for staff Head of school PrincipalsTeaching staff Teachers Nonteaching postsexperts with knowledge and work experience within each of the countries. This group completedthe questionnaire and arrived at a consensus on allquestions. A second expert panel included WorldBank education experts located in the field inthe respective countries. This group reviewed theresults from the first round of surveys. Wherethe responses differed, this panel reconciled differ-ences with the first panel.Calculating the Indicators The OECD-INES study gave equal importance to the indicators within each of the four domains.Each domain contributes 25 percent to the results.Because each domain includes a different numberof items, each item is weighted by the inverse of thenumber of items in its domain. The World Bankstudy followed the same approach.Education Reforms in East Asia: Policy, Process, and Impact 203 World Bank Study (2003) OECD-INES (1998) Evaluation methods/supervision Head of schoolTeaching staff Promotion Influence over staff careers Head of school PrincipalsTeaching staff Teachers Nonteaching posts Training Head of schoolTeaching staff Certifying staff Head of schoolTeaching staff Allocation and use of resources Allocation and use of resources Allocation of resources to the school Allocation of resources to the school Salaries and benefits Teaching staff; nonteaching staffAdministrative/operating costs Operating Procurement and disbursement Use of resources in the school Salaries and benefits StaffAdministrative/operating costs Operating expendituresCapital expenditures (infrastructure) Capital expendituresScholarship/awardsSchool projects/activities Relationship with unions Sources: OECD 1998; World Bank study 2003. If a single item produced multiple answers, although the instructions for the questionnaire didnot specifically allow this, each answer received halfof the original weight of that item. The following table compares the indicators used in the two studies: Endnotes 1. Accountability means more than \"answerability\" or \"enforceability.\" It implies a precise set of relationshipsbetween principals and agents encompassing five mainfeatures: delegation, finance, performance, informationabout performance, and enforceability (World Bank 2004c). 2. This, however, is not different from what had occurred in other countries that had decentralized earlier, such as Spainand Chile (political reasons) and the United Kingdom and Australia (concerns about state finances). After Franco diedin 1975, a new Spanish Constitution promoting a transitionto democracy devolved central functions to regional gov-ernments (Hanson 2000). Through an opposite politicaltransition in Chile\u2014from a democratic to a militarygovernment\u2014newly empowered neoliberal economistsand social planners also pushed for more decentralization.In contrast, Australia's fiscal situation provided the princi-pal motives for public service reform. The VictorianCommission of Audit assessed public expenditures in keysectors as too high and pushed for incremental change(Pascoe and Pascoe 1998). 3. One impediment to further devolution of education func- tions is increased politicization of elections at the locallevel. In the Philippines, teachers serve on the Board ofElection Inspectors and thus play an important role incounting ballots (Manasan 2002).4. This was undertaken with the 2001 Decision on the Reform and Development of Basic Education by the State Council(Wang 2004). 5. Cambodia's policy goals for education reform are con- tained in the Education Strategic Plan (ESP) for 2001-5and implemented through the Education Sector SupportProgram and the Priority Action Program rather thanthrough a single piece of legislation. The ESP reiterates thecentral government's vision: \"The Ministry's vision of aninclusive education system also includes broad-based par-ticipation al all levels of Government and civil society intaking responsibility for planning and implementation ofeducation service s...A n associated goal would be to incrementally delegate greater decision-making and spend-ing authority to districts, possibly communes, and schools.In this way, all national stakeholders would also have toassume responsibility for frank and open evaluation of howthe system is performing and in taking steps to put thingsright\" (Royal Kingdom of Cambodia 2001, p. 1). 6. The OECD-INES method clearly distinguishes between de jure and de facto power: \"The aremade reflect the actual decision-making process. In somecases, a higher level of government may have formal orlegal responsibility for decision-making, but in practice,that level of government delegates its decision-makingauthority to a lower level of government. In describing theactual decision-making process, the lower level of govern-ment is identified as the decision-maker. Similarly, a higherlevel of government may provide a lower level of govern-ment with choices in a particular area of decision-making(e.g., the selection of textbooks for particular course). Inthat case too, the lower level of government is the actualdecision-maker, but within a framework established by ahigher level of government. Finally, there are cases in whichone level of government may have the responsibility for anindividual decision, but inaction by the higher level resultsin a decision being made by a lower level within the educa-tional system\" (OECD 1998, p. 407). 7. Although references are frequently made to state-level decentralization in Brazil, the process has progressed atsuch a rapid pace with FUNDEF's implementation that, asmunicipalities and mayorships are given responsibility forthe first four years of basic education, discussing decentral-ization at the state level does not fully reflect the nationalcontext. 8. Local government expenditures on education rose nearly 14-fold, from P =0.8 billion in 1991 to P =11.6 billion, in 2001 (Manasan 2002). 9. The Local School Board is cochaired by the local chief exec- utive and the division superintendent. Other membersinclude the chair of the education committee of the locallegislature, the local treasurer, a representative of the fed-eration of local youth councils, the president of the localfederation of teacher-parent associations, a representativeof the local teachers' organization, and a representative ofthe nonacademic personnel of the local public schools(Manasan 2002). 10. Because of a shortage of teachers at the local level, many local governments hire and pay supplementary teachersdespite the fact that this function is one of the primaryresponsibilities of the central Department of Education. 11. This high percentage may be due to the unclear distinction between fees and voluntary contributions.12. The share of central government spending in capital expen- ditures fell from 10.5 percent in 1990-91 to 4.6 percentin 1996-2000, and the central share of maintenance andoperating expenditures fell from 18.7 percent in 1990-91 to10.4 percent in 1996-2000 (Manasan 2002). 13. With the transfer of authority and management to regional governments in Indonesia, \"It is hoped that the local gov-ernments are capable of obtaining more funds in theirregions and in managing them more efficiently and effec-tively. It is expected that the local governments are able touse or exploit the sources of funds in the regions, such asthe private sector and other education stakeholders, infunding education\" (Government of Indonesia 2001). 14. Until recently, the national government retained 10 percent of total tax revenues for its own use and provided 9 percentto local tax offices to assist with collections, 16 percent toprovincial governments, and 65 percent to local govern-ments (Lewis 2002). 15. The coefficient of variation in literacy rates declined from 0.11 in 1989 to 0.08 in 1994. 16. There was no change in the coefficient of variation of enrollment rates across the regions. 17. The creation of ARMM was a direct result of the 1996 peace treaty between the national government and theMoro National Liberation Front. Republic Act No. 9054\u2014the law creating ARMM\u2014contains detailed provisions thatpertain to the governance, regulation, and funding ofhuman development sectors in the region. However, the1991 Local Government Code had already mandated devo-lution of many functions and responsibilities related tohuman development\u2014notably health and social welfareservices\u2014to provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays (World Bank 2003b). 18. These comparisons exclude a few provinces where the samples tended to be in urban areas. According to theSUSENAS Work Manual (Government of Indonesia 2002),\"Because of the unfavorable security situation, in the fol-lowing provinces/regencies SUSENAS 2002 is only and Jayapura (East Irian Jaya).\" Because thesamples were not representative, enrollment rates in theseprovinces appear to be surprisingly higher than in otherprovinces. 19. Education systems suffer from ineffective and substandard schools, persistent shortages of good textbooks, and unpre-pared and absent teachers. The nondelivery of publiclysupplied textbooks and chairs at the beginning of eachschool year in several of these countries deprives millionsof children of the chance to do better in school. In thePhilippines, this problem was estimated at 30-60 percentof total contracts with the education central agency(Chua 1999). The proportion of teachers who are absent from the classroom is too high, according to a recent survey of teach-ers in several countries. For example, in Indonesia, 17 per-cent of teachers in primary schools were not on the schoolpremises during school hours. And too many teachers donot know their subject matter better than their students, asindicated by the performance of teachers on tests con-ducted for a recent study of the quality of primary schoolsin Vietnam (World Bank 2004b). These problems are alsofound in a much wider set of countries for which policyand program evaluations do not point conclusively to gains 204 East Asia Decentralizesfrom higher per pupil spending or from investments in specific school inputs (Glewwe 2002). 20. The newly established Academic Accountability Council, along with the Office of Accountability, was jointly respon-sible for overseeing a system of review and analysis of schoolperformance, while local school councils lost some of theirindependence. 21. See the Chicago Public Schools website: www.cps.k12.il.us/. 22. Paes de Barros and Silva Pinto de Mendon\u00e7a (1998) con- ducted a broad evaluation of decentralization acrossmost Brazilian states. Their research base includes allgeographical units in the country except the Federal Dis-trict, northern states, and the state of Alagoas. The studyexamined data between 1981 and 1993 and included 220observations. 23. The measures of educational performance used included the repetition rate (school census); the proportion ofchildren outside school and two measures of grade-level lag(National Household Survey Sample, or Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic\u00edlios ); and student achievement (National Basic Education Evaluation System, or Sistema de Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do Ensino B\u00e1sico ). 24. Education Quality Improvement Project ( Pr\u00f3qualidade ) aimed to strengthen school auton- omy by providing managers in central and regional officeswith tools designed for information-based decision mak-ing; and help school directors assume their new roles asboth leaders and managers in a more decentralized stateeducation system. The project also aimed to increase teach-ers' access to training opportunities; deliver packages ofinstructional materials to public schools; and upgradefacility management to ensure equitable access of pupils toclassroom time as well as rational use of school space. 25. The LEAs were created according to population distribu- tion and density, number of institutions, geographic char-acteristics, sociocultural considerations, and the extent towhich planned areas overlapped with existing districtboundaries. 26. This act was supported by the National Decentralization Committee and part of the Decentralization Action Planpassed by Parliament in early 2002. 27. In China, the monitoring and evaluation system is quite comprehensive. Throughout compulsory education, stu-dents must take exams and tests following each semesterand school year to graduate. In primary schools, studentsmust pass tests in Chinese and mathematics, while tests inthe remaining subjects are usually used as checkup. In sec-ondary schools, exam subjects reflect the general subjectstaught to a given graduating class, while exams in theremaining subjects are again used for checkup (China Edu-cation and Research Network 2003). Junior secondaryschool graduates seeking promotion to senior secondaryschools must pass locally organized entrance exams priorto full admission. In Indonesia, final exams are set at both the national and school levels. While the national portion is based onmultiple choice, the school portion is based on laboratorywork, written portfolios, or demonstration of a given set ofskills. Students are tested on core knowledge in three mainsubject areas: mathematics, Indonesian, and English. At thecentral level, test results play a strong role in resource alloca-tion. At the school level, they provide comparable informa-tion on the relative strengths and weaknesses of individualschools. At the client level, parents and the community canuse exam results to hold providers accountable. However, the new exam system does not include primary school, anddoes not provide information about the performance ofchildren below the ninth grade. Confronted with this,provinces and districts can create their own complementarytesting system using guidance available from the NationalEvaluation Center. 28. Some have argued, however, that even when reforms involve quality issues, unions still oppose them, given thatsuch reforms require more effort and political sacrifices(Corrales 1999). Similar debates stem from the joint func-tion of unions as both professional organizations aiming topromote efficacy and public knowledge and agents of col-lective bargaining (World Bank 2004c). 29. In Mexico, given strong leadership by the teachers' union, the government quickly realized that it could neither con-front nor ignore it, and so openly included it in the processof negotiation on greater decentralization. Unions in Chileare also politically powerful and \"have systematically stoodin the way of true curriculum reform and teacher account-ability, and the political class has been unwilling to con-front them\" (Edwards 2003). Less contentious than inMexico and Chile, reform in Bolivia has shown progress innegotiating with teachers. Nonetheless, teachers' unionsare also extremely powerful and reform has stalled at sev-eral points. In contrast, unions in Brazil did not stallreform; union representatives were active stakeholdersin reform negotiations, and decentralization progressed tothe school level. And, finally, in El Salvador, teachers'unions took a strong stance against the EDUCO model,but government dissuaded them with evidence of innova-tion in teaching practices (Marques and Bannon 2003;Stavenhagen 1999).

Theprimary components are roads and transporta-tion services, water supply and distribution, andsanitation\u2014wastewater collection and removal, andsolid waste collection and removal. These servicesare often bundled together under the heading of\"urban services.\" However, parallel infrastructuresystems are found in rural areas, where roads, irriga-tion networks, and latrines are critical to life. Irriga-tion systems, in particular, are sometimes underesti-mated as infrastructure networks. In the Philippines,irrigation systems account for 80 percent of nationalwater consumption. Efforts to decentralize infrastructure services raise distinctive issues regarding policy design andimplementation. Because of their capital intensive-ness, these systems require decision making at sev-eral different stages: Preparing capital investment plans and setting priorities for individual capital projects. Operating a network system to provide services and maintaining facilities to sustain the physicalcapital. Financing the system by both mobilizing capital to pay for the initial investment and generatingrevenues to cover operations and maintenance\u2014that is, ensuring financial sustainability. 20910 Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services George E. Peterson and Elisa Muzzini Each of these decision-making points presents an opportunity for decentralization, and differentcountries have responded by decentralizing differentstages of the decision-making process. The issue isfurther complicated because infrastructure projectsare subject to spillover effects and economies ofscale. When this is the case, there are often substan-tial benefits to be achieved by coordinating projectsacross subnational governments. Accounting foreconomies of scale and externalities is especiallyimportant when decentralizing decision makingand responsibility to low levels, and when infra-structure projects cover multiple jurisdictions, suchas in managing water resources across large water-sheds or trunk roads that connect regions. Promot-ing equity, harmonizing standards, and ensuringefficient revenue collection may also argue for lim-iting decentralization. Infrastructure services are distinctive in another important respect. Because they are used so widelyand often, citizens are familiar with their benefitsand typically have strong opinions as to whichtypes of projects and service improvements shouldhave highest priority in their area. Choices amongpriorities for infrastructure investment oftenprovide local citizens with their first opportunity toparticipate in public decision making. Participatorychoice at the local level comes more naturally withsmall investment projects\u2014which often quickly210 East Asia Decentralizes yield local benefits\u2014than with school curricula and health services, which often require professionalexpertise and longer waiting times to producebenefits. Thus, decentralization strategies ofteninclude participatory choice in (small-scale) infra-structure investments, not simply to better respondto local service needs but as a deliberate seedbed fordemocratic participation in governance, with theintention of strengthening civic commitment tothe entire decentralization program. The payoff isjudged only partly by whether infrastructure serv-ices improve; equally important is whether mecha-nisms for public participation in decision makingstrengthen citizen involvement in governance. This chapter views decentralization in the infra- structure sector as a work in progress. The transferof service and investment responsibilities to thelocal level evokes an immediate response based onthe capacities and institutional practices of localgovernments relative to those of the central govern-ment. More important, however, this first round ofadjustment will reveal shortcomings in the newarrangements and stimulate responses by nationalagencies, local officials, local citizens, and interna-tional organizations supporting the decentraliza-tion process. The fact that East Asian countries haveexperience with both different strategies andimplementation periods for decentralizing infra-structure enhances the opportunity to learn fromcomparative results. A final introductory observation is appropriate. Decentralization tends to be seen as a transfer ofresponsibilities and revenues from higher-level tolower-level governments. Many decisions aboutinfrastructure services, however, occur in a broadercontext that consists of unbundling the vast powersof previously centralized agencies responsible forinvestment and service provision. Some of thisunbundling entails transferring authority to lowerlevels of government. Other elements may includetransferring investment or responsibility for servicedelivery to the private sector or to public-privatepartnerships, including partnerships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs); and restruc-turing the public enterprises traditionally responsi-ble for larger-scale infrastructure services, such asurban water supply and wastewater removal. Decen-tralization typically entails restructuring publicenterprises by making them accountable to localgovernments rather than central line ministries.This chapter has two purposes. The first is to review the status of efforts to decentralize infra-structure services in East Asia, with a focus oncountries that are more advanced in the process,namely, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines.The second purpose is to highlight the efficiencygains in providing infrastructure services achievedin decentralized settings, and to underline themain challenges to realizing the full benefits ofdecentralization. The next section examines the key features of strategies for decentralizing infrastructure adoptedby China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and out-lines the impact of decentralization on the level ofinfrastructure investment. The third section ana-lyzes the available evidence from East Asia on theefficiency gains from more decentralized formsof providing infrastructure services. The fourth sec-tion reviews East Asian experience in enhancingcommunity-level participation in managing infra-structure projects, and investigates the scope forscaling up the benefits of community participationwithin a decentralized government structure. Thefifth section compares the approach to financinginfrastructure adopted by China, Indonesia, and thePhilippines, given their different strategies for decen-tralizing infrastructure. The sixth section discussesthe critical role of higher tiers of government indecentralized infrastructure, drawing on the experi-ences of China and of Indonesia and the Philippines,with the drawbacks of a \"missing middle\" in thearchitecture of decentralization being particularlymanifest in the latter two countries. The last sectionhighlights key policy issues that have emerged fromthe analysis of decentralization in the region. Decentralization Strategies in the Infrastructure Sector East Asian countries have followed two broad strategies in decentralizing the infrastructure sec-tor. China exemplifies a principal-agent approach. The central government as principal has retainedand even strengthened its role in setting investmentpriorities across and within sectors, and has rein-forced this role by setting highly specific targetsand timetables for infrastructure coverage in differ-ent classes of cities. These targets and timetableshave extended beyond physical investments toinclude, for certain services, mandatory adoptionby all urban governments of specific guidelines for service charges, and, for all services, mandatoryseparation of asset ownership from service deliv-ery. In this respect, the infrastructure sectorremains highly centralized. At the same time, asagents for implementing centrally established poli-cies, local governments have full responsibilityfor actually executing investments and providingservices. They also have significant latitude in decid-ing how to mobilize funds to pay for capitalinvestment, which they now must finance entirelywithout central grant support. Local governmentsfurther have significant latitude in framing devel-opment plans, including where they will site majorcapital projects and how they will sequence invest-ments to meet nationally imposed standards mostcost effectively. Indonesia and the Philippines represent an alternative approach. As part of the Big Bang initia-tives launched in those countries, the central gov-ernments assigned virtually complete responsibilityfor urban and rural infrastructure services to localgovernments almost overnight. At the heart of thistransfer was local choice in investment priorities.Decentralization laws emphasize the importance ofcivic participation in making investment choices,and specify elaborate procedures designed toensure that citizens, as well as collective groups likeNGOs and civil society organizations, are repre-sented in the priority-setting process for capitalprojects. In fact, decentralization is clearly intendedto serve a dual purpose: to make investment choicesin the infrastructure sector more responsive tolocally perceived needs and thus more efficient; andto become a vehicle for introducing ordinary citi- zens to participation in governance. Cambodia and Vietnam are in incipient stages of decentralization, with broader policy drivenlargely by the design of infrastructure programs.Cambodia's Seila Program, introduced in 1996, hascreated commune development committees in morethan 1,000 villages and 100 communes, with theprogram expected to reach three-fourths of all com-munes by the end of 2004 and the rest shortly there-after (Royal Government of Cambodia 2003b). Theprogram provides government and donor funds forsmall infrastructure projects selected by citizens atthe most grassroots level, with mechanisms fortransmitting their priorities for slightly largerprojects up to the commune level. Seila is expresslyseen as a way of engaging the citizenry in participa- tory governance. In a country as poor and rural asCambodia, Seila now accounts for the bulk of localinfrastructure investment. Vietnam has passed legis-lation on grassroots participation as part of its publicadministration reform. However, the national levelcontinues to set investment priorities for most infra-structure services and certainly for urban services,with provincial and local authorities viewed prima-rily as agents implementing national choices. Investment Levels and National Standards How has infrastructure investment fared during decentralization, and what is the role of nationalstandards and investment targets in sustaininginvestments? Both China and Vietnam, which haveemployed the principal-agent model, have experi-enced extremely high\u2014almost unprecedented\u2014infrastructure expansion within the areas given toppriority. During the latter half of the 1990s, Chinaassigned top infrastructure priority to road build-ing, implemented primarily by provincial govern-ments for national and provincial highway net-works, and by local governments for urbannetworks (see tables 10.1 and 10.2). Both levelsattracted some private investment under the direc-tion of provincial and local authorities. Almost85 percent of China's road and highway investmentover the two decades ending in 2000 occurred dur-ing 1996-2000. Although national and provincialhighway networks\u2014that is, expressways and class 1highways\u2014expanded most rapidly, all classes grewat high rates, including major urban roads andclass 2 and other local roads. Vietnam has assigned priority to piped water dis- tribution in urban areas, with implementation inthe hands of provincial water authorities and, in the Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 211 TABLE 10.1 Road and Highway Investment in China Billions of Share of Period yuan total (%) 1981-1989 19 2 1990-1995 153 141996-2000 881 84 Source: Mitchell Stanfield & Associates, as reported in Bellier and Zhou 2003.largest cities, water enterprises attached to local gov- ernments. Despite high rates of urban populationgrowth, coverage rates have expanded remarkablyin a short time (see table 10.3). In 2000, 41.5 percentof the average urban water system was five years oldor younger. China's government has recently given especially high priority to urban wastewater collection andtreatment, reflecting heightened concern over thecondition of urban water bodies. Higher standardsimposed on local governments show how thecenter transmits signals to local authorities in aprincipal-agent relationship. In May 2000, China's Development Planning Commission\u2014under the Environment ProtectionAgency in the Ministry of Construction\u2014circulated\"City Dirty Water Treatment,\" which specified thatthe wastewater treatment rate in all towns and citieswould be at least 50 percent by 2010. The treatmentrate for cities would be at least 60 percent, andthat for provincial capitals and other major cities atleast 70 percent. The circular also defined treatmentquality standards for different types of cities(Government of China 2000). Given that the vastmajority of China's cities then had no wastewatertreatment of any kind, the targets imply a massive infrastructure investment program. 1Recognizing the need to mobilize capital for such an effort, theDevelopment Planning Commission in October2002 stated that \"cities with existing wastewater andgarbage treatment facilities shall start to immedi-ately charge a treatment tariff,\" and that all othercities should do so by the end of 2003. The tariff\"shall cover operations cost and a reasonable invest-ment return\" for wastewater treatment plants, togenerate revenue for raising commercial investmentfunds. Cities in better economic conditions wereurged to set tariffs high enough to cover the cost ofconstructing wastewater collection networks. In a system with strong upward accountability such as China's (and Vietnam's), local authoritiestake national investment targets seriously. 2Each municipality incorporates specific targets for infra-structure coverage into its five-year developmentplan, approved by the provincial government andultimately by the Development Planning Commis-sion. The political careers of local officials in theCommunist Party hinge on meeting or surpassingthe goals. As a result of either conscientious plan-ning or competitive zeal, local officials often set tar-gets that exceed national standards. This is true inthe wastewater area. Analysis conducted for CityDevelopment Strategies has found that the majorityof covered cities\u2014although located in the poorerwestern provinces\u2014are on their way to meetinginvestment targets that surpass state-mandated lev-els (Chreod Ltd. 2003). Local development plansemphasize these ambitions throughout urbaninfrastructure: municipalities have set targets evenfor square meters of green space per capita, trigger-ing local investment in parks and other green areas.212 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 10.2 Road and Highway Investment in China, by Type 1990 2000 Road type Billions of yuan Share Billions of yuan Share Express-ways 0.01 0.1% 56 28% Class 1 0.02 0.3% 4.0% 30%Class 28.1% 15 7.5% Source: Mitchell Stanfield & Associates, as reported in Bellier and Zhou 2003.

The next section discusses these impacts. China's intergovernmental system is gradually moving toward more sophisticated and meaningfulmeasures of infrastructure performance, such asoutcome measures. In the wastewater area, forexample, the national government now requireslocalities to test the quality of receiving bodies ofwater, which are subject to quality standards meas-ured along seven dimensions. Some cities voluntar-ily sample discharge quality from wastewater treat-ment plants and have included locally definedtargets in their five-year development plans. Thus,the principal-agent relationship has proved to bemore than a one-way street. The implementingagent not only incorporates mandated standardsinto its planning but may also set higher standardsthat become the basis for upward accountability. Lessons Learned. The strong investment perfor- mance of subnational governments in China reflectsmany factors. The same national investment priori-ties communicated to local governments have beentransmitted to the state-controlled banking system,clearing the way for lending that has financed muchof the expansion in infrastructure coverage. Com-mercial banks have lent these funds for three- to five-year periods, creating the need for municipalities toroll over short-term debt. Local governments aretherefore beginning to face high debt service bur-dens, which may exacerbate the uncertain credit-worthiness of loan portfolios in the banking system.China also has a tradition of strong policy directionfrom the center, coupled with a high degree of defacto freedom in local budget management notfound elsewhere. One lesson that can be generalized, however, is the power of performance measurement andaccountability in China .Measurable performance targets tied to upward accountability have drivenChina's infrastructure investment. The quantifiedstandards have sometimes proved unduly rigid,upward accountability has substituted for account-ability to clients, and national standards have cur-tailed local investment choice. But the effectivenessof infrastructure performance standards in steering budget choices at the local level is clear. \"Autonomous\" Decentralization Countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia have opted for political decentralization, with localauthorities formally recognized as autonomousbodies. Inherent in their powers is setting prioritiesfor local budgets, including capital budgets. Con-cern has arisen in both countries as to whether thistype of decentralization can sustain capital invest-ment and maintenance. In particular, the transfer oflarge numbers of central government employees\u2014subject to wage protection\u2014to local rolls, and thelegal and political difficulties of raising local rev-enues, subject subnational governments to budgetpressures. In the face of such pressures, local gov-ernments are thought more likely to maintainemployment levels rather than adjust their budgetsto sustain investment. Within capital programs,spending on maintenance and repair is believed tobe particularly vulnerable. Displacement of localinvestment has potentially serious consequences.The World Bank has estimated that, in Indonesiafor example, some 60 percent of total developmentexpenditures are now a local responsibility (WorldBank and Asian Development Bank 2003; WorldBank 2003b, 2003c). The Philippines has the longest experience with local budget allocations following decentralization.The share of capital spending in city and municipalbudgets surged in 1993, shortly after new revenueand expenditure assignments took effect (seetable 10.4). That occurred because initial revenueallocations exceeded the cost of transferred func-tions, leading to sizable local surpluses, which werethen drawn down by capital investment. Since1993, however, the share of local budgets devoted tocapital spending has fallen steadily, with declinestotaling more than 50 percent. These declines accel-erated in 1998 with the Asian financial crisis andthe consequent loss of public revenues before reviv-ing briefly the following year. Such spending doesnot tell the entire story, as central line ministriescontinue to pay for some capital projects at thelocal level, as do some congressional allocationsthat are treated off-budget. However, the overalltrend in local investment is clear. Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 213Indonesia's decentralization process is too young to draw comparable conclusions about its impact oninvestment spending. Development spending onroads and mainland transportation fell sharply dur-ing the Asian financial crisis\u2014from 15 percent oftotal development spending in 1994-97 to a littlemore than 5 percent in 1999-2001\u2014before recover-ing somewhat. Another potential factor affectingthis slowdown is significant deconcentrated spend-ing by line ministries, and the difficulty of adaptingthe DAK ( dana alokasi khusus, a conditional equal- ization grant) and providing funds within a decen-tralized environment. The World Bank has expressedconcern that road maintenance at the Kabupaten level has suffered from underfunding, and thatdecentralization may exacerbate neglect of roadmaintenance, with consequences that are not imme-diately visible (World Bank 2003d). Whether localmaintenance and repair budgets have actually suf-fered disproportionately from local budget adjust-ments under decentralization is unknown. However,protecting maintenance funds may require a greaterrole for professional planners and engineers, asopposed to local political officials and civic groups,inallocating expenditures. The apparent decline in local infrastructure spending in the Philippines, and concern over localinvestment levels in Indonesia, have generateddebate about the role of national standards and per-formance measures. This debate is occurring mostvigorously in Indonesia, where decentralization leg-islation calls for national agencies to develop guide-lines rather than mandatory standards promulgatedvia the provinces, whose capacity for oversight has greatly weakened. Upward accountability for complying with mandatory infrastructure standards seems funda-mentally at odds with strategies that place primaryimportance on local choice in investment projectsand priorities. The challenge is to capture the powerof performance measurement and accountabilitywithin a framework for political decentralization.The first step is agreement on performance meas- ures in the infrastructure sector. National guidelinescan establish a handful of basic measures reportedby all local authorities and monitored by centralinstitutions. Such measures would include funda-mentals such as: Hours per day or week of water provision. Coverage of road networks (kilometers per 1,000 persons, kilometers of road per squarekilometer of territory); quality of roads (percentin good condition, percent of all-weather roads). Wastewater removal rates. Expenditure on road maintenance as share of gross domestic product (GDP) or kilometersof roads. Affordability of transport services (freight rate per ton per kilometer, average bus fare per pas-senger per kilometer). The absence of such measures handicaps both national decisions about infrastructure prioritiesand local attempts to measure and improve invest-ment efficiency. Decentralization frameworks now provide ample opportunities for incorporating these measures intoan accountability system. At the national level, cate-gorical grants such as Indonesia's DAK alreadyrecognize performance measures, although so farthey do not actually take them into account. Wherenational authorities have clear investment prioritiesnot adequately captured by local decision making,they can introduce standards\u2014either absolute levelsor improvement from a baseline\u2014as a condition ofcapital grants. The ratio of matching grants canreflect both national priorities and local perfor-mance. Simple benchmarking of infrastructure per-formance and transparent reporting of performancemeasures can enhance efficiency. Individual localauthorities, for example, can cite the range of actualcosts per kilometer of standardized road construc-tion elsewhere in conducting competitive bidding 214 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 10.4 Capital Spending as a Share of Local Government Expenditure, Philippines 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 can compare basic output levels with those of other local authori-ties in setting up their own reporting systems. For other types of infrastructure projects and service delivery, formal accountability to thecitizenry through contractual agreements and per-formance monitoring appears to be the most effec-tive way to use standards under autonomous decen-tralization. Experience with 24 water utilities inIndonesia, known as PDAMs, shows that NGOscan monitor business plans that specify improve-ments in water coverage, quality, and reliability\u2014established after public debate as part of a socialcontract. Fulfilling these goals then becomes thebasis for raising service tariffs and supportingfinancial sustainability (Urban Institute 2003). Sev-eral local governments in the Philippines have sim-ilarly published performance goals and invitedmonitoring by the nongovernmental sector afterpublic participation in setting priorities for infra-structure services (World Bank and Asian Develop-ment Bank 2003). Lessons Learned. In the politically decentralized systems of East Asia, a lack of standardized perfor-mance monitoring severely hampers understandingof local infrastructure. No country now has a rou-tine monitoring and reporting system for the sector.Such systems can be built gradually and improved over time. However, national guidelines shouldquickly establish a rudimentary system of reportingthat can be built into budgeting at all levels. Upwardaccountability is more difficult to establish in politi-cally decentralized systems than in systems thatremain centralized. Decentralized systems need toincorporate performance goals into local budgets,local corporate plans for water utilities, and localdevelopment planning\u2014in a form that can be mon-itored by civil society organizations. Quantitativeaccountability to informed civic monitors can sub-stitute for traditional upward accountability, butonly if public agencies provide specific and verifi-able information. Efficiency Gains from Decentralizing Infrastructure A fundamental argument in favor of decentralizing infrastructure is that moving decision making oninvestment and implementation closer to clientswill yield efficiency gains. These gains can come from two sources. First, production efficiencyimplies that local entities can build and operate agiven infrastructure package less expensively. Costsavings may derive from cheaper local buildingmaterials, less expensive local labor, more efficientproject design, fewer layers of bureaucratic over-sight, and less corruption, among other sources.Sustainability is an important aspect of productionefficiency. Second, allocative efficiency implies thatlocal investment priorities will reflect the prefer-ences of citizens more than those of the centralgovernment, and that households will thereforevalue each unit of infrastructure spending morehighly. As this chapter later shows, governmentsneed to balance such efficiencies with possibleeconomies of scale (which for some infrastructuresectors can be significant) and externalities (bothnegative and positive) across local jurisdictions. Analysts have made several attempts to test, in East Asia, the hypothesis that decentralizationenhances the efficiency of infrastructure services.Rigorously evaluating the gains from productionand allocative efficiency is a demanding exercise.Evidence so far suggests efficiency gains, but it is farfrom conclusive, as it is drawn largely from casestudies (this differs from the health and educationsectors, where systematic monitoring and householdsurveys are far more common). As a result, we knowa good deal more about how to extract efficiencygains from decentralized infrastructure throughwell-designed implementation strategies than we doabout broad generalizations as to whether decentral-ized approaches, on average, are more efficient. Production Efficiency The World Bank has reported that village infra- structure constructed under Indonesia's Kecamatan Development Program, which involves community-level planning and implementation, \"cost signifi-cantly less\u2014on average about one-third but inmany cases more than half less\u2014than equivalentworks built through Ministry of Public Works con-tracts.\" Maintenance costs were also reportedlylower because communities provided the labor.Unfortunately, the analysis supporting this conclu-sion has not been published, leaving open the ques-tion of how the study compared costs. In particular,such comparisons often do not take into account Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 215the social infrastructure costs of supporting local project development (World Bank 2003e).4 In collaborating with 24 PDAMs in Indonesia, the Urban Institute reported that the PDAMsbelieved they could substantially reduce investmentcosts when they handled construction, land acqui-sition, project design, and scheduling, as opposedto complying with central specifications. Savingson projects that produced a given increment in thecapacity of the daily water supply reportedly run ashigh as 50 percent. Some PDAMs have expressedreluctance to accept low-cost loans from centralsources, should these become available, if they mustadopt centrally imposed project standards, believ-ing that the costs of complying with those ruleswould more than offset the savings from low-costcredit (Urban Institute 2003). Loehr and Manasan (1999) conducted one of the more ambitious attempts to compare productioncosts for standardized projects in the Philippines.Drawing on World Bank and other data, the authorsfound costs in the range of P =180,000-235,000 when local governments built their own schools, com-pared with P =305,000 per classroom for the central Department of Public Works and Highways. Alonzo(1998) has reported comparable differentials in thecosts of locally versus centrally built classrooms inthe Philippines, as well as local savings per kilome-ter of road construction. Corruption is a major source of cost escalation in infrastructure projects throughout East Asia.Azfar et al. (2000) have estimated that it adds20-40 percent to the cost of infrastructure projectsin the Philippines. Respondents to a 1999 surveyconducted by Social Weather Stations ranked thecentral Department of Public Works and Highways as the most corrupt organization in the Philippines(Azfar et al. 2000). Because a reduction in corruption costs is an express rationale for decentralizing infrastructureservices, the findings of household and other sur-veys asking respondents to compare the severity ofcorruption at local and central levels therefore holdspecial interest. In a survey of 468 respondents in13 randomly selected Kabupaten /Kotamadya in West Java, Indonesia, Azfar (2002) found that 29 percentpaid fewer bribes following decentralization, whileonly 5 percent reported that they paid more.Respondents attested to similar changes in the costof bribes, or \"unofficial payments\" (see table 10.5).At least in the eyes of citizens, corruption becomesmore widespread and costly the further removedgovernment agencies are from the local level. Although this evidence supports the hypothesis that decentralization reduces corruption, muchdepends on how reform is implemented. In thePhilippines, infrastructure projects selected by LocalDevelopment Councils but built by the Departmentof Public Works and Highways or other centralagencies tended to trigger a cascading effect ofunofficial payments at each layer of government(Hofman and Kaiser 2002). Analysts have alsoreported examples of corruption and rent seekingamong local councils, including cases where legisla-tors have voted themselves large salary increases andautomobiles, and where a local council has voted tosimultaneously approve an investment project andname the party to be awarded the contract. Thus,blanket generalizations about comparative corrup-tion are suspect. 216 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 10.5 Citizen Perceptions of Corruption in Different Layers of Government in Indonesia Rare/ Quite/very Corruption Never infrequent Common 7. Note: Percentages do not sum to 100 because the figures exclude \"don't know\" responses.Probably the strongest evidence for gains in pro- duction efficiency from decentralizing infrastruc-ture comes from studies designed to determinewhether latrines and small-scale water distributionprojects were still functioning and actually used byvillagers several years after installation. Studies inCambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's DemocraticRepublic, and Vietnam all concluded that projectsthat relied on community consultation on design,and community organizations for maintenance andoversight, were significantly more likely to be sus-tained than projects built from a central designwithout such consultation, or that relied on outsideexpertise for maintenance and management (Gross2003; Chanthaphone and 2002a). in allocative choice and community par-ticipation (discussed later in the chapter). RuralIndonesians, for example, were found to have astrong preference for pour-flush latrines, whichwere far more likely to remain in operation thanalternative designs. Women assigned a high priorityto small-scale water and sanitation projects, and community-scale water management organizationswith strong participation by women proved moresustainable than organizations operated solely ordominated by men. Such evidence tends to confirm that decentraliz- ing projects to the village or commune level allowscommunity involvement in support of sustainabilityto emerge. However, simply decentralizing invest-ment and management decisions does little to pro-mote sustainability unless primary users participatein maintenance and management decisions. On a larger scale, the efficient use of capital in municipal utilities relates directly to performancemeasures targeted and rewarded under nationalaccountability systems. One of the apparent para-doxes of China's investment in municipal waste-water treatment plants is that local governmentsare investing heavily in new plants while existingfacilities operate at 50 percent or less of designedcapacity because of lack of funds for operationand maintenance. This phenomenon has beenreported in Hunan province, among other loca-tions (Chreod Ltd. 2002). It reflects the fact thatinfrastructure targets initially included in localdevelopment plans and monitored by higher-levelauthorities were based on the treatment capacity ofcompleted wastewater treatment plants. Under this yardstick, localities met coverage targets whetheror not treatment plants were actually operating, asno one measured the volume of treated dischargeor the quality of receiving water bodies. Y et inChangsha, the capital of Hunan province, waste-water treatment plants operated at 50 percentcapacity for two years because the city simply shutoff intake valves and diverted incoming flowsdirectly into the river. Meanwhile, the municipalitywas planning large-scale construction of newplants. This experience reveals the power of per-formance measures tied to accountability proce-dures: poorly selected performance measures canfail to capture the intended effects. Similarly, cen-trally imposed cost targets may jeopardize produc-tive efficiency gains if they fail to account for localvariations in exogenous costs that are not underthe control of municipalities. When wastewater treatment facilities feed into the same body of water, coordinating projects acrosslocal jurisdictions can yield better water quality atlower cost. The top-down system in China, com-bined with strong decentralized authorities, how-ever, does not provide enough incentives for localgovernments to consider economies of scale andcoordination. In the Guangdong River delta, forinstance, each of 51 administrative districts has awastewater treatment facility, although cooperativeagreements based on economies of scale could haveyielded significant savings. In Vietnam, in contrast,flexibility in local management and timing of waterdelivery has resulted in significant drops in wateruse per hectare, revealing the gains from productionefficiency that can result from decentralizing ruralirrigation systems (see box 10.1). Allocative Efficiency A full argument for gains in allocative efficiency from decentralization would marshal several linesof evidence. First, central and provincial officialsfail to correctly identify the spending priorities oflocal citizens. Second, choices on spending priori-ties made by local officials, as well as choices madeby citizens themselves through participatory proce-dures, better reflect true local preferences. Forexample, reliance on central quality standards, as inthe Chinese model, may significantly reduce the Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 217218 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 10.1 Vietnam's Red River Delta: Efficiency Gains from Decentralizing Irrigation The Red River Delta (RRD) in Vietnam has one of the highest-density rural populations in theworld. The delta depends on irrigation for cropproduction. Experience shows the efficiencygains that can be obtained from decentralizingmanagement of an infrastructure network, aswell as links between gains from production andallocative efficiency. Since Vietnam decollectivized its agricultural sector in the 1980s, two types of institutionshave provided irrigation in the RRD to farmers.One is state-owned Irrigation and DrainageManagement Subsidiary Companies (IDMSCs),which centrally manage pumping stations andirrigation networks. The other is cooperatives,which operate on a smaller scale through jointmanagement and localized pumping stations.Cooperatives entered the irrigation business inresponse to inflexibilities in water provision fromthe centrally managed state companies, whichscheduled uniform water flows in advanceregardless of local conditions or planting pat-terns. Cooperatives obtain raw water suppliesthrough contracts with regional irrigation man-agement companies. The cooperatives are, ineffect, decentralized alternative suppliers of irri-gation services to farmers. In the RRD, IDMSCsand cooperatives each serviced about half ofthe land, facilitating comparisons between theinstitutions.Cooperatives have improved allocative effi- ciency by making water delivery more flexible inresponse to farmers' demands. Empirical obser-vations over an irrigation season found that, onaverage, cooperative pumping stations providedwater flows within 2 days of a request, comparedwith 11.5 days for centrally managed systems,which work off a predetermined rotational sched-ule. The shorter delivery time and greater flexi-bility of cooperative supply give farmers morechoice in cropping patterns, rice varieties, andgrowing conditions. Production efficiency can bemeasured in terms of water use per hectare\u2014table 10.1B below shows observed differences inwater use for comparable paddy fields. Part of the observed differential in water use reflects the shorter canal networks of local coop-eratives, which reduce water losses and presentfewer opportunities for diversion to illegal users.Part of the savings comes from managementefficiency motivated by the desire to save oncontracted costs for water supply. An importantpart of the savings, however, comes fromreduced corruption. Staff of the state-ownedcompany reportedly made illicit agreements tosell water on the side, adding to the amountspumped per eligible hectare. Sources: Fontenelle and Molle 2002; Fontenelle 2000.

Analysts have collected evidence on parts of this argument. For example, Azfar et al. (2000) foundthat Filipino households strongly favor spendingincremental funds on roads, but that householdpreferences vary substantially across locations, pre- sumably reflecting differences in both local valuesand conditions. Municipal officials had a statisticallysignificant ability to identify local preferences, whileprovincial officials had no ability whatsoever toidentify local preferences\u2014with a negative correla-tion between their predictions and actual householdpreferences. In particular, provincial officials vastlyunderestimated local demand for spending on roads and other local infrastructure. Household surveys in Indonesia and Cambodia have also found strong preferences for road con-struction as the top investment priority. Interna-tionally funded programs that involve communitychoice report a significantly higher level of invest-ment in roads than among projects whose outputsare negotiated at the central level. Local develop-ment projects that incorporate citizen participa-tion in project selection appear to more accuratelyreflect both the general preference for roads andvariations across communities. For example, duringthe first two years of the Kecamatan Development Program in Indonesia, road projects were by far themost popular local investment choice (62 percent),compared with bridges (10 percent), irrigation(8 percent), and clean water (7 percent). Follow-upsurveys found that even given these percentages,households felt that too much had been expendedon clean water. Evidence from these and other stud-ies, in short, is that citizens have clear-cut prioritiesfor spending, and that distant representatives andbureaucrats do not grasp these priorities or assigngreat importance to local priorities. Moreover,local demand for simple infrastructure projects\u2014primarily roads\u2014is high compared with alternatives.Of course, how much deference central governmentsshould pay to household preferences in allocatingspending across sectors is an open question, espe-cially when sectors like education and health generatepositive externalities not fully captured by local resi-dents. Nonetheless, for spending assigned to localinvestment choice, evidence supports the conclusionthat decentralization is closing the gap between localpreferences and project selection. Lessons LearnedMore important than the first-round impacts of decentralization on the efficiency of infrastructureservices are the lessons that can be learned to betterextract potential gains. Because the costs of corruption are high in pro- viding infrastructure, countries should take practi-cal steps to reduce corruption and other inefficien-cies under decentralized management. In most EastAsian countries, central authorities have tradition-ally handled infrastructure procurement, even forlocally selected projects supported by significantlocal funding.Meanwhile,however,decentralizationhas given local authorities responsibility for defining their own procurement rules. This situation has notonly created confusion and inconsistency across thelocal government landscape, but has also led to pro-curement abuses, such as lack of competitive bid-ding and technical evaluation of proposals, steeringof contracts to particular firms by elected officials,and extensive price renegotiation after contracts areawarded. Adoption of a uniform local procurementcode should be a top priority for decentralization, tobuild in competition and transparency. The Gov-ernment Procurement Reform Act of 2003 in thePhilippines offers a model of such support. An over-sight and regulatory board empowered to investi-gate and punish procurement abuses needs to sup-plement formal procedures. Best-practice local examples suggest other steps for improving procurement. Naga City in thePhilippines, for example, now publishes in the news-paper and on the Internet winning per unit pricesfor all procurement contracts. This simple actionboth supports transparency and encourages pricecompetition among suppliers (World Bank andAsian Development Bank 2003). In administeringtheKecamatan Development Program in Indonesia, the World Bank has found that the simple expedientof requiring that an independent (local) third partyas well as contracting principals sign off on all con-tracts and procurements, however small, saves fundsand fosters a culture of transparency. Excess capacity in infrastructure design is a major source of cost inefficiency. Paradoxically, at a time of large infrastructure backlogs, a number of projectssuffer from substantial overcapacity, raising costsunnecessarily. In some cases, excess capacity hasresulted from centralized application of standardproject designs or per capita use estimates thatdo not take local conditions into account. SomeIndonesian PDAMs are operating at only one-thirdof designed capacity because abundant groundwa-ter sources are available and households prefer tocontinue pumping their own water rather than payfor connecting to the piped water system. Many Chinese cities suffer from overestimated water demand because authorities failed to antici-pate the drops in demand that would occur with full-cost water tariffs and the rapid decline in state-owned firms\u2014often the most inefficient water users.This situation has left some local governments with\"take or pay\" contracts with private companies, Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 219which require governments to either purchase more water than consumers will use or displace lower-costmunicipal water with higher-cost supplies. As inall countries, grant and low-cost loan financing alsopromotes excessive scaling of infrastructure facili-ties. When investment appears to be free to localauthorities, they tend to base estimates of futuredemand on the most optimistic assumptions. Com-parable projects financed from own-source fundsreflect more realistic growth projections and thetime and cost entailed in tying up funds. Again, thepractical lessons are straightforward. Whereverpossible, major infrastructure projects should occurat the local level after reforms in user prices, so offi- cials can estimate the impact on demand more accu-rately. Uniform per capita projections of use shouldbe scuttled in favor of demand studies based on localconditions. All infrastructure projects of significantscale should require substantial own-source financ-ing, to create incentives for realistic cost projectionsand savings. Predicting a country's optimal infrastructure capacity compared with its long-term investmentneeds is admittedly complex, given the \"lumpiness\"of investments and the uncertainties associated withlong-term planning. Hence, whereas today's use ofinfrastructure facilities points to overcapacity, theextent to which that overcapacity is likely to persist isdifficult to gauge. Gains from Citizen Participation For countries pursuing autonomous decentraliza- tion, the hallmark of reform has been the promise ofgreater citizen participation in local budget deci-sions, investment choices, and development plan-ning. Such participation is supposed to yield greatercitizen satisfaction with basic services and more cov-erage for previously excluded groups\u2014particularlythe poor, ethnic minorities, and women\u2014while lay-ing the groundwork for broader democratic partici-pation in national government. Cambodia's 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy illustrates the weight of expectations placed ondecentralization as a tool for achieving participation: \"Decentralization has three objectives in Cambodia: Promote pluralist participatory democracy at local level ...b y c r e a t i o n o fp o p u larly mandatedand autonomous local governments that are responsible to the citizens . . . and make deci-sions over delivery of public goods and services. Promote the culture and practice of participatory development (planning, management, resourcemobilization) at local level. Contribute to reduction of poverty in the country through improvement of service condi-t i o n s... and [service] improvement to poor and deprived ones\" (Royal Government ofCambodia 2003a, p. 108). Countries have introduced autonomous decen- tralization primarily through grants to local com-munities that allow citizens to directly choose smallinvestment projects and provide for communitymanagement of the projects once installed. The SeilaProgram has brought citizen choice over small infra-structure projects to Cambodia; the Kecamatan Development Program has done the same for sub-districts in Indonesia; as have barangay investment programs in the Philippines for urban subdistricts.Several other programs follow the model of provid-ing communities with investment resources thatthey can allocate among eligible projects. Suchprograms have typically won strong support fromthe World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, theUnited Nations Development Programme, andother international organizations seeking to imprintlocal citizen choice as the bedrock support fordecentralization. Experience with citizen participation in East Asia raises two critical questions. First, does participa-tion in fact improve sustainability and coverage ofbasic infrastructure services at the village, urbansubdistrict, and neighborhood scale? Second, canexperience in direct participation be successfullyscaled up to larger political units and infrastructurenetworks? As the following evidence reveals, theanswer to the first question is yes, while the jury isstill out on the second question. Despite some prom-ising local experience, scaling up has proved moredifficult than optimistic advocates of participationforesaw. Community-Scale Participation A large body of evidence supports the importance of community-scale participation in infrastructurechoices and management. This evidence also 220 East Asia Decentralizesprovides guidelines on specific responsibilities that communities can handle to extract the maximumvalue from participation. For example, in a studyof 88 community-managed water supply projectsworldwide, Gross et al. found that: Community-based water supply projects which were more demand-responsive\u2014that is, thosethat involved greater community choice in thetype of water supply, households to be covered,and the method for paying for operations andmaintenance\u2014were more likely to be sustainedand better maintained. The more broadly participatory and gender rep- resentative the decision-making procedures, thehigher the rate of cost recovery. Communities that set up water management organizations (WMOs) had better project sus-tainability records than communities that par-ticipated only in initial project selection; themore equitably WMOs represented women andthe poor, the greater their sustainability. Household contributions to construction were significantly associated with better-sustainedwater supply services only if the communityactively participated in project selection and sub-sequent management (Gross et al. 2001). Hopkins' study of 33 sites in Flores in the Philip- pines found higher rates of sustainability whereplanning included both women and men, as wellas poor households. The World Bank has reportedhigher rates of sustainability of locally selected in-frastructure projects when project choice reflecteddirect community participation (Hopkins 2003;World Bank 2003d). Some of the benefits to be reaped from local participation and choice require careful listeningby outside experts, whether national officials orinternational advisors. In 2001 Lao PDR adopted anew policy of allowing communities to choosetheir hygiene solutions and influence their design.Follow-up work found that villagers primarily val-ued the \"comfort and convenience\" of latrinesrather than the health benefits, which were fore-most in the minds of external experts (Meadley2003). This finding influenced both the design ofthe latrines and the strategy for disseminating theprogram, which relied on \"champion families\"respected by other families. After the championfamilies receive latrine facilities, photos showing their convenience and the families' pride in owningthem are used to engage the widely dispersed ruralcommunity in discussing the benefits of latrinesand gain support for their adoption. The literature on decentralized fiscal choice has emphasized the gains from allowing clients tochoose among a wide array of project options, con-strained by either a fixed budget or the requirementthat users pay for the service they choose. ManyEast Asian experiments in decentralized projectselection have followed this model, offering localresidents a broad initial choice of investment prior-ities. The Seila Program in Cambodia and the Keca- matan Development Program in Indonesia are two examples that offer relatively open-ended choice. However, some national programs have defined community choice and participation differently,particularly those that retain strong roles for gov-ernmental planners and service providers. In thepoor rural province of Guizhou, China, for exam-ple, prospective township clients can choose toreceive private water connections at a tariff levelthat covers operating costs plus some 75 percent ofcapital costs, including all debt service. Less expen-sive alternatives, such as public stand posts, are notoffered, nor does the community have a voice intariff policy or technology. Community consulta-tion consists of carefully explaining to residents thekind of water service they will receive, the tariffcosts, and the procedures for collecting the tariffs,which entail house-by-house collection (Zhixiong2003). The community may then embrace the pro-gram and its rules or, in principle, express reluc-tance to pay for it. Village committees identifydelivery problems and exert collective pressure oncitizens to pay water bills. However, the plant man-ager remains in control of all aspects of manage-ment. A portion of his salary is deducted if tariffcollection rates fall below 90 percent. Scaling Up Participation The difficulties of scaling up successes in community participation are widely recognized (World Bank2003b). Ironically, scaling up community and ruralvillage projects has proved easier in some respects ina centralized rather than a decentralized environ-ment, where many levels of government exertauthority. Scaling up means multiplying the number Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 221of villages and urban subdistrict communities reached using the same implementation principles.Such scaling up is constrained primarily by theresources of a program and the central government'swillingness to support it through its own resourcesor agreement with international donors. If the finan-cial and human resources are replicable, projects canbe reproduced throughout the country. Seila inCambodia is an example of a community participa-tion program that is rapidly scaling up to reach theentire country with direct central support, withoutmuch interaction with other levels of government.The Kecamatan Development Program in Indonesia is another program that has spread quickly by repli-cating the same neighborhood approach, with cen-tral government and donor support. Only now, in itsthird generation, is the program attempting themore difficult task of integrating priority setting atthe community level with the formal planning pro-cedures of the decentralized system. Scaling up community-identified priorities within a decentralized government structure requiresfinding ways to transmit community preferences oninfrastructure investments to successively higherlevels of government. Community \"demand\" mayinclude both community-scale projects that needhigher-level financial support and communityviews on the priority of village, district, and munici-pal investment projects that affect the community.The transmission of community preferences aboutcapital projects to higher levels of government hasproved problematic. Part of the difficulty stemsfrom distrust of representative government and sus-picion of the willingness of municipal officials torespect community investment priorities. This dis-trust has been compounded by the difficult interfacebetween top-down national investment planningand bottom-up community and local planning.Both the Philippines and Indonesia have attemptedto address this challenge by directly involving com-munity groups in progressively higher levels of deci-sion making. Indonesia illustrates the complexity of transmit- ting community preferences. 5The urban planning process begins with village development meetingsattended by the village representative council, NGOs,and a representative of the subdistrict ( Kecamatan ). A major objective is to submit project proposals tothe Kecamatan subdistrict level. There officials review and weed out community proposals and addnew proposals, and then submit a priority list to the next level of government ( Kabupaten /Kota ), which adds proposals from technical officials. The projectpreferences of the Kabupaten parliament also become part of the mix and may override other rec-ommendations. Finally, an umbrella system is sup-posed to coordinate local investment priorities withprovincial and national priorities. As part of thisstructure, the Indonesian government has promul-gated general guidelines for participatory planning attheKabubaten andKota level, including open meet- ings that bring together representatives of communi-ties, NGOs, and technical bureaus as well as munici-pal elected officials. The entire process\u2014facilitatedby a government-provided scoring sheet\u2014shouldyield a consensus list of local priorities. Case studies reveal that this process plays out differently in different locations. Municipal parlia-ments, technical agencies, and NGOs typically havedifferent priorities (Pratikno 2002; IndonesianPartnership on Local Governance Initiatives 2002).Negotiations leading to final project prioritizationat the municipal level depend on the relative cloutof these parties and the role the mayor chooses toplay. Most case studies have concluded that thepreferences of local elites, the municipal parlia-ment, and technical agencies tend to drown out thepreferences of community groups. The mandatedparticipation of NGOs has not resolved this issue,because\u2014instead of representing a consensus oflower-level priorities\u2014NGOs have more oftenproved to be splintered advocacy groups for partic-ular priorities. A similar system of planning andpriority setting operates in the Philippines, includ-ing the mandated participation of communityNGOs in local development councils. Similar diffi-culties in sustaining grassroots participation inmunicipal priority setting have been reported. A realistic reassessment of what community par- ticipation in infrastructure decision making meansat the municipal scale is in order. Intermediation isplainly required in scaling up from the communitylevel to the municipal level. Elected representativesin the municipal parliament provide one form ofintermediation; NGOs provide another. In themost successful examples of public inclusiveness insetting infrastructure priorities, NGOs have playedthe role of intermediary between community andgovernment. This has required continuous involve-ment by NGOs, starting with community-level222 East Asia Decentralizesmeetings and extending to collaboration with the technical agencies of municipal government.Against this preparatory background, structuredmeetings on investment priorities and budget allo-cations, such as citizen forums, can succeed. Theconditions for success, however, are demanding:NGOs must be willing to see themselves as partnerswith local government rather than antagonists,and local officials must be open to input from insti-tutions outside the political and governmentaltechnical sphere. Clear examples of successfulimplementation of this vision do exist. Theseinclude the involvement of the Indonesian Partner-ship on Local Governance Initiatives with bothmunicipal government and communities in urbanforums in Indonesia, and the culture of partnershipin all decision making in Naga, the Philippines.Efforts to include community expression under theKecamatan Development Program and ordinary decentralized priority-setting procedures inIndonesia are other examples. Whether scaling updirect community participation in setting invest-ment priorities is widely workable remains to beseen, however. Many communities have reported apublic stalemate that gives rise to the older patternof nontransparent decision making by elites. Lessons Learned Community participation is essential to the success of infrastructure projects at the village and subdistrictlevel. Participation is required at the point of project selection as well as in continued projectmanagement. Meaningful participation requiresthe involvement of a cross-section of project users,especially women and minority groups, who areoften excluded from project management. Scaling up participation in infrastructure choice has proved difficult. Other mechanisms, such as genuinely representative municipal governments,and NGOs willing to serve as intermediaries toboth municipal government and local communi-ties, are needed to make the process work. The most promising approach involves NGO par- ticipation from the start of the priority-setting processthrough the municipal meetings that establish localinvestment priorities. Only NGO involvement at the last stage\u2014such as through the Local DevelopmentCouncils prescribed by Filipino law\u2014has provedunsuccessful.The idea that community participation in setting infrastructure priorities will breed a national cultureof democratic decision making has seen a modestamount of empirical support thus far. Just as scaling up infrastructure priorities can be difficult, so canscaling up expectations about democratic partici-pation in governance. The experience of allocatingbudgets to communities undoubtedly empowershouseholds and raises their expectations aboutresponsive government. Whether such participa-tion helps consolidate national democracy remainsto be seen. Paying for Infrastructure Services Infrastructure services must be financed at two levels. Capital resources must be mobilized to payfor the initial investment in facilities. Then recur-ring revenues must cover the annual cost of opera-tions and maintenance, plus contributions to serv-icing the debt incurred to finance the initialinvestment. In an economically efficient world, thefull cost of infrastructure facilities, including depre-ciation, would be recognized and recovered throughuser fees and\u2014given positive externalities\u2014explicitsubsidies from government, in the form of capitalgrants or targeted subsidies. Much of the institutional unbundling of large infrastructure utilities in East Asia has been moti-vated by a desire to generate more reliable financingstreams, and to make infrastructure services moreattractive candidates for commercial investment orlending. The latter goal has sometimes conflictedwith the goal of making monopoly utilities moredirectly accountable to local governments. Asia faced a formidable infrastructure pricing challenge at the beginning of this decade, as it hadthe lowest water and sanitation tariffs\u2014both inabsolute terms and as a percentage of the costs ofproduction\u2014of any other region (see annex 10.1).The median urban tariff for water supply report-edly covered less than 85 percent of operating andmaintenance costs, with no contribution to the costof capital. The median tariff for sanitation coveredan even lower portion of operating and mainte-nance costs. If anything, the tariff ratios reportedby governments are likely to underestimate the truecost gap. In examining financing approaches, we can extend the distinction introduced at the beginning Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 223of this chapter between China and (in incipient terms) Vietnam, on the one hand, and the Philip-pines, Indonesia, and (in incipient and less clear-cut terms) Cambodia, on the other. Aided by strongeconomic growth, China has devised a broadmodel for self-financed infrastructure investmentand market-based capital financing. Both thePhilippines and Indonesia have been handicappedby a stronger impact from the Asian financial crisisand less robust economic growth. However, theyhave compounded the difficulty by retaining cen-tral control of lending to local authorities for infra-structure investment\u2014an anomaly in their other-wise sweeping embrace of decentralization. China's Infrastructure Financing Strategy China has pursued a clearly defined sequential strat- egy for financing local infrastructure. Although themodel has important weaknesses, it contains les-sons for the rest of the region. T o finance the firstwave of investment in local infrastructure net-works, the government relied primarily on localtaxes and fees, supplemented by borrowing frominternational donor agencies and capital grants andbudget assignments from central government. Start-ing in 1998, the government began to borrow heav-ily from the domestic market to finance infrastruc-ture. Between 1998 and 2002 it issued \u00a5 660 billion(US$79.5 billion) in infrastructure bonds\u2014some30 percent of which was then transferred to localgovernments, half as subloans and half as grants.Along with this use of the domestic bond market,the government communicated the priority of localinfrastructure lending to China's banks, all ofwhich are publicly owned. Short- to intermediate-term loans from banks have been a principal sourceof capital financing for local governments investingin infrastructure. One undesirable effect of the surge in local bor- rowing to finance infrastructure investment hasbeen a high and rising level of municipal indebted-ness. Under existing arrangements, municipalitieshad to repay outstanding debt from their generalbudgets, placing a high degree of strain on theirfinances. This was especially true in light of theinadequate structure for service fees, which did notrecover operating and maintenance costs, muchless the costs of debt service. Further squeezingmunicipal budgets was the short maturity ofinfrastructure bank loans\u2014typically three years, sometimes five years. In response, the central government took three important steps designed to ready local govern-ments to further finance local infrastructure withina fiscally responsible framework. First, it announcedthat most local governments would be responsiblefor obtaining capital financing for infrastructureinvestment from the market. State onlending andgrants from the proceeds of state infrastructurebonds would be limited to the economically laggardwestern provinces\u2014other local governments hadto be self-financing. Second, to support this self-sufficiency, the government decreed that municipal-ities should adopt full-cost tariffs for water supply,solid waste, and wastewater treatment, on a highlyaccelerated timetable. Full-cost pricing was definedto include all operating and maintenance costs plusdebt service and a competitive return on newlyinvested capital. Better-off municipalities were sup-posed to set tariffs to allow for full recovery of sys-temwide capital costs. This regime was designed toprovide adequate revenue streams to cover debtservice and attract private-sector capital into thelocal infrastructure sector, via either direct invest-ment or lending. In a third\u2014and in some respects most interesting\u2014initiative, the government decreed thatlocal government should be restructured to separatethe ownership of infrastructure and other assets fromoperating responsibilities. This last initiative had twogoals. First, it was intended to yield more efficientmanagement of municipal assets, following so-calledNew Government trends established in Australia, New Zealand,and other countries,in which the asset-owning institution levies a capital charge on users toallocate costs more efficiently. In China's case, how-ever, a more important motivation was to placeunder a single institutional umbrella assets used ascollateral for municipal loans.As part of governmen-tal restructuring, only the asset-holding institutions,known as Urban Development Investment Corpora-tions (UDICs), may now borrow on behalf of munic-ipal government. The restructuring was supposed toensure that municipal borrowing did not exceed thecollateral capacity of the municipality's asset base.Moreover, as only UDICs are legally authorized toborrow, the restructuring was supposed to insulatethe general municipal budget from debt serviceclaims while providing a powerful incentive to 224 East Asia DecentralizesUDICs to implement fees that would cover the cost of capital. In some respects, China's infrastructure finance reforms are less sweeping than they may at firstappear. Although municipalities are prohibitedfrom direct borrowing, they continue to providecomfort letters to local UDICs. These in effect com-mit a municipal government to use general budgetrevenues or income from municipally owned prop-erty to help meet the UDIC's debt service obliga-tions, should such support become necessary.Although UDICs tap the general corporate debtmarket, their debt instruments are a form ofmunicipal borrowing. The change in the institu-tional name of the borrower does not relieve localpublic institutions of the debt service burden cre-ated by short-term borrowing to finance long-terminfrastructure projects. From the banking sector'sperspective, the large amount of local assets held inthe form of loans to local governments represents acredit risk of unknown magnitude. No defaults onmunicipal borrowing from banks have beenreported. However, banks routinely roll over short-term loans as they come due. Questions remain asto whether banks will continue this policy as for-eign competition enters the banking sector underWTO rules, how much of their outstanding debtmunicipalities could actually pay under existingschedules, and how politically feasible and eco-nomically rewarding it would be for banks to fore-close on assets offered as collateral. One finding of potential significance to other East Asian countries has emerged from UDICrestructuring, however, especially for periods ofstrong economic performance. Municipal govern-ments in China possess undeveloped or redevel-opable land with great market value, which couldfinance a substantial proportion of the local infra-structure investment burden. Changsha, the capitalof Hunan province in China's interior, illustratesthis situation. The municipality holds title to some1.33 million hectares of land, valued at the munici-pality's minimum long-term leasing price in 2001 atsome \u00a5 105 billion. Of this total, about \u00a5 85 billion(more than US$10 billion) corresponds to land notoccupied by the municipality itself that could beleased. Changsha officials estimate that some 60 per-cent of the gross price of leased land represents costsfor land that must be set aside as matching openspace under planning regulations, resettlementcosts, and revenues that must be shared with higher levels of government. Still, with 40 percent of thegross value representing net profit, the net value ofChangsha's land inventory is some \u00a5 34 billion,which could finance a large part of the municipality's10-year capital investment plan. The potential for converting Chinese land values into infrastructure assets is even greater if one con-siders that a large share of local infrastructureinvestment is capitalized into the value of munici-pally owned land, and that municipalities' land-holdings are far from static. As population growthpushes the urban boundary outward, more andmore land reverts from collective rural ownershipto municipal ownership, providing a continuingbasis for capturing land value. Rural land at theedge of urban centers is indeed seriously under-priced, as the replacement cost of rural land isbased on its agricultural use without the premiumreflecting proximity to urban centers. This givesmunicipalities strong incentives to convert landfrom rural to municipal ownership. And munici-palities are in fact converting land values into infra-structure investment throughout China. In somemunicipalities studied under the City DevelopmentStrategies (Cities Alliance), land has financed asmuch as 70 percent of local infrastructure invest-ment, either directly through proceeds from leasesor indirectly by serving as collateral for infrastruc-ture loans. 6However, concerns are growing that reliance on revenues from periurban land may leadto unsustainable urban planning and degrade thequality of urban life, calling for the development ofand integrated approach to land use and urbanplanning at the municipality level. The combination of full-cost tariffs for water supply, sanitation, and solid waste, coupled withincrements in land value created by road construc-tion and expansion of urban boundaries, providesa potentially sound basis for financing municipalinfrastructure. Infrastructure Financing in the Philippines and Indonesia The structure of lending to local governments for financing infrastructure has become an importantbottleneck to decentralization in both the Philip-pines and Indonesia. Despite plans to graduatecreditworthy municipalities and local utilities to theDecentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 225competitive credit market, the central government remains in control of credit channels in both coun-tries, acting as a monopoly intermediary betweenloans provided by international financial institu-tions and local governments. This position hasfrustrated development of sustainable sources ofdomestic financing while allowing central govern-ment institutions to restore\u2014through loan condi-tions and discretionary loan approvals\u2014some con-trol over the local infrastructure sector formallyrelinquished in the decentralization process. The local credit market in the Philippines illus- trates the unequal playing field established by thegovernment. The Development Bank of the Philip-pines and the Land Bank of the Philippines obtainfinancing from international organizations andfrom the National Bank at below-market rates.Their onlending to local governments is securedby the authority to intercept intergovernmentalrevenue-sharing allotments\u2014authority that is notavailable to private lenders. Reliable local loanrepayment to government financial institutionswas intended to introduce commercial banks tomunicipal lending as a creditworthy activity. How-ever, commercial banks cannot match the cost offunds of the government financial institutions, asthey are prohibited from serving as depositoryinstitutions for municipalities, which wouldstrengthen their ties to municipal budgets and pro-vide a lower-cost source of financing. As a result,commercial bank lending to municipalities forinfrastructure has yet to get off the ground, despitethe formal policy of promoting creditworthymunicipalities to the private credit market. Indonesia illustrates the legacy power of bad loans in thwarting development of a local creditmarket. As of March 31, 2000, 63 percent of theborrowing accounts of water utilities through sub-sidiary loan agreements and the Regional Develop-ment Account were reportedly in arrears (WorldBank 2003b). Although the country has launched aprogram of debt restructuring, it has made littleheadway in straightening out legacy borrowing.Resolution of the inherited debt runs straight to thefundamental issues raised by political decentraliza-tion. If central authorities made past investmentdecisions and mandated loan agreements, should adecentralized water utility be required to honorthat debt, and, if so, how will it recover the debt ifmunicipal governments are unwilling to imposethe required tariff increases? On the other hand, writing off these loans implies a substantial fiscalloss to the central government as well as an unde-sirable precedent for future onlending. These con-ditions seem to lay the groundwork for loanrestructuring, but reaching comprehensive agree-ment has proved difficult. Lessons Learned A self-sustaining local credit market is essential for successfully decentralizing the infrastructure sec-tor. National government, as the original onlenderto municipal governments and utilities, needs tohave a strategy for developing a domestic localcredit market from the outset. This strategyrequires three components: Establishing a track record of timely debt repay- ment by local authorities . The injection of politi- cal considerations into debt repayment to gov-ernment financial institutions creates a creditrisk in local lending that can set back marketdevelopment for decades. The institutionalweight of bad loans deters entry by privatefinancial institutions into the subnational creditmarket. A policy that promotes replacement of government lending by private lending as quickly as feasible . This, in turn, requires a level playing fieldregarding revenue intercepts, depository func-tions, and other regulations. In other regions,internationally sponsored municipal develop-ment funds have proved successful by onlendingto municipalities through commercial banks,which fully accept the credit risk. This strategyintroduces commercial banks to municipallending while giving them access to longer-term,lower-cost funds than are available on thedomestic market. This approach requires a will-ingness on the part of government financialinstitutions to introduce decentralization to thefinancial sector by eliminating their monopolis-tic role as sole municipal lenders. A policy of substantial capital cost recovery through service tariffs . For services such as water supply and wastewater removal, which cannotdirectly generate gains in land value, the onlyreliable recurring source of revenue is servicefees. One of the most useful standards that 226 East Asia Decentralizesnational government can set in the infrastructure sector is model tariff agreements between munic-ipal authorities and water utilities. Under these,the municipality agrees to sanction cost-recoverytariffs if the water utility meets performancetargets for service delivery and coverage. How Far to Decentralize? Decentralization requires unbundling the functions associated with providing infrastructure servicesand allocating them among different tiers of govern-ment. The optimal level of decentralization will varywith government's policy goals and the types ofinfrastructure. This section discusses the mandate ofhigher tiers of government in the context of decen-tralized services. The Role of Higher Tiers of Government Even with aspects of infrastructure that are essen- tially local, an argument can be made for allocatingspecific functions to tiers of government higherthan the municipal level given one of the followingconditions: Spillover effects. Interjurisdictional spillovers\u2014or externalities\u2014arise when the activities of one juris-diction affect the welfare of people in surroundingjurisdictions.If municipal services produce spilloverbenefits or costs, service provision will be inefficientwithout intervention by higher-level government, as local governments would ignore these impacts. Forexample, local decisions on regulating effluent dis-charges into rivers have implications for users inother jurisdictions that are part of the same catch-ment area. Similarly, spillover effects occur whenmunicipalities are responsible for managing feederroads whose benefits accrue to more than onejurisdiction. T o correct for such spillover effects, the tier of government whose jurisdiction encompasses all theusers benefiting from such services should decide oninvestment priorities and allocate resources.For example, managing environmental resourcesaccording to water basins is becoming more com-mon to correct for externalities in shared waterresources. The functions entrusted to water basinauthorities include managing and conserving water-sheds, controlling floods, reducing pollution, andlicensing water extraction. On the other hand, over-use and degradation of natural resources may occurwhen an intermediate tier of government does nottake responsibility for integrated water resourcemanagement (see box 10.2). Spillover effects simi-larly call for devolving management of secondaryroad networks to intermediate tiers of government. Economies of scale. A municipality responsible for providing basic infrastructure services may besmaller than the minimum scale required to ensure Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 227 BOX 10.2 Vietnam: Watershed Management In Dak Lak, Vietnam, groundwater is in high demand to feed the expanding cultivation ofcoffee plantations. Groundwater resources in theEa Tul and Quang Phu catchments have so farbeen freely accessible, leading to overuse anddegradation of the natural resource base. Grow-ing competition in water use has led to conflictsbetween upstream and downstream users. Local agencies have failed to mediate these conflicts. For example, attempts by irrigationofficers to introduce irrigation calendars failedbecause communes could not consolidate theircropping calendars to fit the desired schedule.Under the new Water Law, Water Users Associa-tions have emerged to make decisions and coor-dinate water resources. At the provincial level,the Province People's Committee established aParticipatory Irrigation Management SteeringCommittee to provide guidance to the WaterUsers Associations, along with supporting com-mittees at the district level. The water associa-tions, which cooperate with local line agencies,have encouraged farmers to view watershedproblems more holistically and mobilized newforms of collective action to address overuse anderosion. The focus on participatory irrigation manage- ment is seen as a starting point for a more envi-ronmentally integrated approach to managingwater resources. However, even in the new insti-tutional landscape, no effective regional institu-tions regulate access to and use of groundwater. Source: Dupar and Badenoch 2002.technical efficiency, especially for services that are local in nature but require large capital invest-ments, such as water supply, electricity distribu-tion, and public transport. 7When excessive frag- mentation of service provision is a concern,clustering municipalities to provide regionalservices can boost efficiency. 8However, regional utilities require an institutional interface at a higherlevel of government in charge of setting investmentpriorities and regulating services. Spontaneouscoordination across municipalities is indeed diffi-cult to achieve and may be unsustainable when nohigher tiers play a coordinating role. As an example,in Caracas, 23 municipalities agreed to cooperate toaward a single water concession. However, theresulting agreement lacked credibility to investors,and the group received no responsive bids fromprivate operators (Triche et al. 1993). Scarcity of human resources. A scarcity of specific skills may also make multiplying the number ofservice providers undesirable. In such a context,fewer larger entities may be in a better position toattract the minimum required skills than morenumerous, smaller service providers. A similar argu-ment can be made for limiting the number of regula-tory entities to enhance their capacity when humanresources are scarce (see, for example, Smith 2000). Equity considerations. Fiscal decentralization may conflict with equity goals if the poorest regionshave limited leeway to mobilize financing and raiseown-source revenues to meet their infrastructureneeds, such as through local taxation, user fees, andaccess to capital markets. This may argue for limit-ing fiscal decentralization to allow higher tiers ofgovernment to redistribute resources to areaslagging behind in economic development. In this context, intergovernmental transfers are instru-mental in ensuring that all localities can afford toinvest in infrastructure. As an example, the govern-ment (or regulatory authority) may impose a levyon all firms operating in a market, and redistributethe revenues to companies connecting new users inpoor regions that cannot afford steep user charges.Higher tiers of government may also need to retainsome discretion in setting investment priorities toensure that local projects contribute to nationaland regional strategies for reducing poverty. Distortion of interjurisdictional trade. Local regu- lation of basic infrastructure services may affectinterjurisdictional trade, adding transaction costsfor operators. For instance, local regulations gov-erning transportation safety may conflict and thuslimit or distort opportunities for trade. When localregulations impede trade across jurisdictions, thereis an economic argument for setting homogeneousquality standards throughout the area. As an ex-ample, in catchment areas cutting across severalmunicipalities, water basin authorities may play arole in harmonizing environmental standards andregulating inland waterways. Higher tiers of gov-ernment could similarly be entrusted with respon-sibility for setting quality standards for secondaryroad networks (see box 10.3). Destructive competition. Decentralization may increase efficiency by promoting competitionamong local governments. However, devolution ofdecision-making powers to the lowest tiers of gov-ernment may turn the potential for competition intoa \"race to the bottom,\" where competition amonglocal governments to attract foreign investment in 228 East Asia Decentralizes BOX 10.3 Indonesia: When Transport Regulations Distort Trade One area where transport regulations may dis- criminate against outsiders is the introduction oflicenses for use of roads within a certain region.TheIzin Trayek rule in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, for example, requires that all transport truckscarry one of three specific licenses: for inter-provincial transport, for intraprovincial trans-port, and for entering the regencies ( Keca- matan ). The first two licenses are issued at the provincial level in accordance with gubernatorialdecree ( Keputusan ) No. 10 1996, while local governments issue the third type of license.Trucks not carrying licenses are typically finedRp 35,000. This regulation clearly discriminatesagainst trucks from other areas, particularlybecause licenses are not available outside SouthSulawesi. Source: Goodpaster and Ray 2000. infrastructure can prompt municipalities to bid down taxes or other regulatory obligations (or bidup subsidies or regulated rates of return). 9Excessive competition may induce inefficient allocation ofresources and overinvestment, with municipalitiesbuilding or upgrading ports or other infrastructurefacilities in their own areas to enhance their prestige,rather than relying on facilities in adjacent regions. Efficiency of revenue collection. The scope for decentralizing financial powers may be limitedwhen the central level can collect budgetary rev-enues more efficiently, and when there is littleopportunity for collecting cost-covering charges atthe point of service. This is often the case in the roadsector, for example, where financing comes largelyfrom fuel taxes and vehicle operating fees, which aremore efficiently collected by higher tiers of govern-ment. Higher levels need to redistribute those rev-enues to lower tiers where services are provided. Anexample is dedicated road maintenance fundsfinanced by user charges collected at the nationallevel (mainly through fuel taxes). Sophisticated cost-sharing formulas can allocate these funds among dif-ferent road networks (and corresponding levels ofgovernment), and robust accountability mecha-nisms can oversee use of the funds. Interjurisdictional Coordination in China In China, sustained economic growth is spurring a few major cities to develop into metropolitan areasthat cut across more than one jurisdiction. Theseareas include the Pearl River Delta region (centeredaround Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong),the Lower Y angzi Delta region (centered aroundShanghai), and the Beijing-Tianjin region. Coordi-nated development has started to emerge, asmunicipalities have begun to see the benefits ofregional integration. For example, a pilot exercise inthe Pearl River Delta region, led by the Ministry ofConstruction, aims to establish a metropolitanplanning model to be replicated in other regions.An even more ambitious project is the plan to develop a Pan-Pearl River Delta Regional Coopera-tion and Development Area, which would encom-pass almost one-fourth of China's territory, includ-ing nine provinces, Hong Kong, and Macau. Themain goal of this regional initiative is to facili-tate the management of highway and railway proj-ects, which are expected to generate significantexternalities. The trend toward regional integration is therefore an important step toward more effi-cient infrastructure service provision. On the other hand, examples of interjurisdic- tional management of shared water resources,where spillover effects also call for the involvementof higher tiers of government, are still rare in China.The main exception is the recent attempt to pro-mote shared environmental infrastructure in thePearl River Delta (PRD), one of the most complexurban systems in Asia. Many sections of the PRDhave extremely poor water quality. The municipali-ties of the Guangdong province are the highest con-tributors to PRD pollution, and the provincialgovernment\u2014through its Environmental Protec-tion Bureau\u2014has recently announced an eight-year,US$5 billion program to invest in wastewater treat-ment facilities. The plan is based on the recognitionthat investment in environmental infrastructureshould be guided by a regional development strat-egy that reflects sound environmental managementand fiscal sustainability. A pilot project will promotedevelopment of environmental infrastructure forthree groups of two or more municipalities, dis-tricts, and towns. A key parallel activity is the PRDCleanup Campaign, which has set phased targetsfor meeting water quality standards. One of thegoals of the campaign is to enhance intermunicipalcollaboration. In China, more effective regional coordination in setting investment priorities and allocatingresources is also needed to help avoid excessivecompetition among municipalities in the provisionof infrastructure services. Amid economic transi-tion and decentralization, local investment policiesare indeed driven primarily by a growth and com-petitiveness agenda. As a result, municipalities tendto compete excessively to attract outside invest-ment in businesses and infrastructure projects.Their competitive tools are mainly preferentialpolicies such as tax holidays, free land, and dis-counted land concessions. In this context, lackingcoordination at higher tiers of government, such adhoc policies may unduly distort resource allocationbetween municipalities, as well as between stake-holders within a municipality. The Missing Middle: The Case of IndonesiaIn Indonesia, Law 22 of 1999 accords provinces two roles: as deconcentrated representatives of the Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 229center, and as autonomous regions. While provinces can officially coordinate regional policies andperform joint tasks on behalf of local governments,the legislative framework provides no hierarchicalrelationship between provinces and local govern-ments. This has jeopardized the ability of provincesto facilitate cooperation among local governments and establish their authority in regional functions.As a result, sectors with large externalities and sig- nificant economies of scale, such as watershed man-agement, have consistently underperformed. More-over, decentralization has resulted in a multiplicityof standards at the municipal level, which may dis-tort trade across jurisdictions (see box 10.3). The resulting efficiency losses from the \"missing middle\" are compounded by the small size of somelocal entities, which suggests diseconomies of scaleand points to consolidation of regions. 10The narrow administrative boundaries of local govern-ments, combined with the limited role of pro-vinces, have led to suboptimal investment decisionsfrom a regional and national perspective. The argu-ment for strengthening the role of provinces inmanaging road networks, whose benefits accrue tomore than one local jurisdiction, is especially com-pelling. Secondary road networks have been largelyunderfunded compared with the need (the countryconfronted an estimated 15-20 percent fundingshortfall in 2000) (World Bank 2004). In this con-text, giving provinces greater financial authoritycan broaden their influence on local governmentsand thus increase investment efficiency. Oneapproach is to link provincial and national roadfunds, and assign the provincial government strate-gic oversight of all roads (provincial and kapub- aten) in the province, as well as responsibility for assessing investment needs and allocatingresources. The provincial road funds would financemaintenance and rehabilitation of local networks,provided that the kapubaten adopt sound road management practices. In Indonesia, the central government retains significant control in allocating resources betweenjurisdictions. Limited decentralization of revenue-raising powers can help reduce regional inequality,given redistributive mechanisms. The intergovern-mental transfer system includes two equalizationgrants (the DAK and the DAU, or dana alokasi umum ) to fund investment in infrastructure, espe- cially services that generate externalities. However,in practice, these grants have tended to exacerbate rather than reduce regional inequality. 11 The Philippines: Another Example of the Missing Middle In the Philippines, the national government is responsible for providing primary infrastructure,including backbone transmission grids in the powersector and primary road networks, while cities andmunicipalities are responsible for tertiary infrastruc-ture such as roads and water. However, it is unclearwhich tier of government is responsible for planninginvestment and coordinating development of sec-ondary networks that serve more than one local gov-ernment and involve common resources such asriver basins.While in principle provinces play a coor- dinating role among cities and municipalities, theylack the technical and financial resources to do so. As a result, no intermediate tier is capable of managing water resources shared by several localgovernments. Without a regional body to coordi-nate investment, local governments often argueover river basin planning and management, alloca-tion of water rights, and pollution control, andwater-stressed municipalities have had troublenegotiating water rights outside administrativeboundaries. For example, Cebu City reportedly hadgreat difficulty convincing Bohol province to sup-ply the water-starved city even though the marginalvalue of water consumption in the city was high. A similar situation arises in managing secondary road networks. While road density in the Philippinesis among the highest in the region, only 20 percent ofthe road network is paved. Provincial roads accountfor only 13 percent of total roads, with more than 70percent consisting of city, municipal, or barangay roads. Moreover, in 2000, only 21 percent of provin-cial roads were paved\u2014a rate much lower than thatfor national roads (62 percent), city roads (77 per-cent) and even municipal roads (34 percent)(Department of Public Work and Highways 2003).Under the institutional framework, volunteer coop-eration among local governments is the only mecha-nism for coordinating management of the secondaryroad network (see box 10.4). Provinces also suffer from an acute lack of finan- cial resources. This is due largely to the fact thatdecentralization has significantly shifted own-sourcerevenue from provinces to cities and municipalities.230 East Asia DecentralizesNot only are the taxing powers of provincial govern- ments inferior to those of city and municipal govern-ments, but cities do not have to share their tax rev-enues with provinces. As a result, provinces dependmostly on the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA)\u2014amechanism for transferring funds from the center. Regional Development Councils (RDCs) could play a role in integrating regional and local infra-structure plans with the country's overall infra-structure plans. 12However, the majority of RDCs are weak and ineffective in planning and coordinat-ing infrastructure projects. The perception is thatRDCs merely act as endorsers of projects initiatedby regional offices of line ministries or local gov-ernments, which require international funding or aguarantee from the national government. Thus,rather than playing a coordinating role, RDCs areseen as more concerned with monitoring nationalprojects implemented at the local level (Llanto andLasam 2003). In the Philippines, as in Indonesia, the IRA is sup- posed to correct the mismatch between revenue andexpenditure assignments across different levels ofgovernment. Although local governments have be-come more and more dependent on the IRA, thetransfer system has not contributed to increaseequity. On the contrary, the IRA formula favors big-ger and richer local governments at the expense ofpoorer and smaller ones, as it is based on land areaand population. Hence, cities and municipalities thatare more populous and have larger land areas enjoy astrong advantage, and richer local governments withlarger tax bases receive a bigger share of the IRA. Lessons Learned This section has discussed the role of higher tiers of government in decentralized infrastructure bydrawing on the experiences of China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The need to strengthen therole of higher levels of government in providinginfrastructure services appears particularly com-pelling in Indonesia and the Philippines, wherethere is clear evidence of a missing middle in thearchitecture of decentralization. The experiences ofall three countries suggest the following lessons onhow far to decentralize infrastructure services: Partnership between national, provincial, and municipal governments is crucial to maximizing theefficiency gains from decentralization. Infrastructure services entail a broad set of functions. The extentto which higher levels of government performsome of these functions often depends on the char-acteristics of a particular industry. For example,when the main economic argument for involvingprovincial authorities is the presence of spillovereffects, higher levels of government need to retain aplanning and coordinating role, while municipali-ties may be better positioned to build and operatefacilities. When the main concern is excessive frag-mentation, decentralization of service provisiononly to the regional level can retain economies ofscale. Clearly defining responsibilities and provid-ing mechanisms for coordinating all tiers of gov-ernment are essential to maximizing the benefits ofdecentralization. A progressive approach to decentralization has merit. Developing countries may need to build or strengthen institutions at intermediate and lowerlevels of government to coordinate responsibilities\u2014institutions that are often the norm in mature infra-structure industries. This implies that countries mayneed to phase in decentralization while buildingcapacity. Another argument in favor of a progressiveapproach is that once functions are decentralized toDecentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 231 BOX 10.4 The Philippines: Toll Road Management The construction of a circumferential road across Cabanatuan City and adjacent municipalities is agood example of cooperation in planning invest-ment and implementing a project. CabanatuanCity signed a memorandum of agreement withthe municipalities of San Leonardo and Sta. Rosathat defined their contributions and obligationsto this project. The toll road, financed by contri-butions from the local governments, is expectedto raise revenues once it is operating. The coop-eration reflected strong leadership from the chiefexecutives of the three local governments andtheir understanding of the benefits of a jointapproach to combating rising urban congestion. Source: Gilbert Llanto, mayor of Cabanatuan City, field interview.the lowest tiers, creating a role for higher tiers of gov- ernment can be very difficult, as municipalities maybe reluctant to relinquish decision-making andrevenue-raising powers. However, political consider-ations often play a critical role in designing a decen-tralization strategy. For example, while a more grad-ual phasing-in may have been warranted in thePhilippines and Indonesia, political imperativescalled for a Big Bang approach, under which localgovernments assumed responsibility for providingbasic infrastructure services almost overnight. Given economies of scale, decentralizing infra- structure to the lowest tiers of government may leadto excessive fragmentation. The risk of excessive fragmentation is particularly high when decentral-ization is not conceived as a response to specificproblems but rather as a byproduct of widerreform. The result could be an industry structurethat is far from optimal from an economic pointof view. Careful design of intergovernmental transfer mechanisms is needed to meet equity objectives. While central intervention may be warranted to redressregional inequalities, experiences in Indonesia and the Philippines show that limiting fiscal decentral-ization has not produced the expected results interms of income redistribution. On the contrary,intergovernmental transfers have exacerbatedregional difference in income, jeopardizing the abil-ity of the poorest regions to finance their infrastruc-ture needs. Countries need to improve the efficiencyof their equalization mechanisms to address fiscalimbalances across regions. Key Issues for Policy Makers Several key issues stand out from this review of East Asia's experience in decentralizing infrastructure.Perhaps the most important is the coherence andalignment of administrative, financing, perfor-mance measurement, and incentive policies andprograms. Where alignment exists, anticipatedresults will be forthcoming, as in the case of theprincipal-agent arrangements of China andVietnam. Of course, this can be a doubled-edgedbenefit. If the goals make sense, performance willyield desirable outcomes. On the other hand, doingthe wrong thing well is also a possibility. Thus, it isas important to ensure that coherence and align-ment favor appropriate local decision making,control of results, and accountability for results. This lesson is elaborated in detail below. Performance measurement opens the door to effi- ciency gains from decentralized infrastructure because it permits meaningful accountability. At the local level, standardized cost comparisons, such ascost per kilometer of road construction, can imme-diately translate into savings when used as aguide for competitive procurement. Performancecontracting\u2014in which a municipality commits toauthorizing tariff increases if a utility meets well-defined performance goals\u2014can upgrade perfor-mance while breaking the deadlock over settingtariffs high enough to recover service costs, whichhas handicapped local investment. NGOs and citi-zens gain the power of accountable oversight only ifthey can measure performance against quantifiedtargets. The power of upward accountability is evident in the case of China, where measurable perfor-mance against state-determined investment targetshas driven the infrastructure sector. On the otherhand, in politically decentralized systems, perfor-mance measures are almost totally lacking in theinfrastructure sector. This is in striking contrast tothe health and education sectors, where client sur-veys and output measures are far more common.Simple, transparently reported measures of infra-structure performance tracked locally and used forlocal management would enable countries to go farin realizing the potential of decentralization. Community participation at the project level is critical. A large body of evidence supports the importance of community-scale participation ininfrastructure choices and management. Commu-nity water supply and latrine projects have provenmore sustainable\u2014longer lasting, more fully used,and more financially self-sufficient\u2014when designedin partnership with the community and managedby community organizations. The participation of across-section of users in management has beenfound to be particularly important. Women and thepoor are most likely to be excluded from manage-ment, undermining project sustainability. The economic literature on decentralized fiscal choice has emphasized the gains from allowingclients to choose among an array of projectoptions. On the other hand, some East Asian coun-tries offer communities a much smaller range ofchoices. Rural water projects in China, for example, 232 East Asia Decentralizesgive communities the opportunity to sign on to standardized arrangements. Community consulta-tion consists of explaining to residents the servicesthey will receive and the tariff costs they will beresponsible for, if they participate. Such projectshave high sustainability in China despite the closednature of the initial choice. Scaling up community participation in municipal- level capital planning is difficult. Decentralization in the infrastructure sector has been premised on thevalue of community choice. Both Indonesia and thePhilippines have attempted to incorporate commu-nity participation in higher-level choices by includ-ing NGOs in efforts to set municipal investment pri-orities. The results of this experiment have beenmixed, at best. The presumption that NGOs repre-sent community consensus rather than advocateparticular points of view has often broken down inpractice. Urban forums open to all have proved valu-able in stimulating public debate over investmentpriorities, but a difficult vehicle for actually estab-lishing capital budgets. Whether direct communityparticipation in investment decision making over-comes skepticism about local representative democ-racy remains to be seen. Substantial differences inthe information available to stakeholders remain asignificant problem, as such asymmetry contributesto the greater influence of elites in decision making. Efficiency in capital investment is important. Paradoxically, at a time of great pressure on infra-structure investment budgets, large portions ofexisting capital remain unused. In China, waste-water treatment plants in some provinces are notfunctioning for lack of operating and maintenancefunds while expensive new treatment plants arebeing built. In Indonesia, some water utilities havemuch excess capacity because they failed to takeinto account ample free water from householdwells. In politically decentralized systems, commu-nity participation in initial project design andrequired local cost sharing can reduce excess capac-ity. In upwardly accountable systems, performancetargets need to measure relevant outputs ratherthan merely the capacity of capital facilities. A well-functioning local credit market is an essential ingredient of a decentralized infrastructuresector. The supply of credit for local investment has become a bottleneck to decentralizing infra-structure. In both Indonesia and the Philippines,central authorities retain control over the channelsfor local credit, frustrating development of a self- sustaining domestic credit market that meetsmunicipal needs for financing infrastructure.Government financial institutions can encouragethe emergence of a municipal credit market byremoving regulations that give them preferenceover commercial banks and other lenders. Onlend-ing of international funds to municipalities viacommercial banks, rather than government finan-cial monopolies, would likely speed developmentof such a market. Higher tiers of government play a critical role in the architecture of decentralization . A partnership between national, provincial, and municipal gov-ernments is crucial to maximizing the benefits ofdecentralization, even in infrastructure industriesthat are essentially local. For example, empower-ing provincial governments to perform a planningrole is essential to correct for interjurisdictionalspillovers, while limiting fiscal decentralizationmay be warranted on equity grounds to allow forcross-subsidies between geographic groups. Theneed to strengthen the role of intermediate tiersof government is compelling in Indonesia andthe Philippines, where the missing middle hasresulted in poor coordination between jurisdic-tions. The consequences are particularly evidentin the transport sector, where secondary roadnetworks have suffered from severe maintenancebacklogs as a result of poor interjurisdictionalcoordination. Annex: Comparing Water Coverage in Different Countriesand Regions Truly comparable data across countries on infra- structure coverage, investment levels, and tariffs aredifficult to produce and generally not available.Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment2000, prepared by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, providesprobably the most standardized reporting, but eventhe data in that volume are imperfect. Coveragerates reflect access to \"improved\" water and waste-water systems. Tariff and investment ratios arereported as averages for the decade 1990-2000 andtherefore do not take into account recent changes.Nonetheless, the data do provide a general compar-ative baseline for East Asian countries: Decentralizing Basic Infrastructure Services 233Through the Millennium Development Goals, all the East Asian countries have set far more ambitioustargets for coverage during the period 2000-5.Because of decentralization, local governments willbe the primary instruments for implementing andfinancing this accelerated coverage. Investing in the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector During the decade 1990-2000, Asia lagged behind other developing regions in the share of govern-mental investment devoted to water supply and sanitation. This probably implies, as Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 concludes, that Asian countries gave the water and sanitationsector lower priority, but the situation also reflectsthe higher shares of public sector budgets devotedto investment in Asia. Investment shares in East Asia in this sector have climbed recently as countries have focused on meet-ing their coverage targets. China has also set ambi-tious targets for treating wastewater before discharge.234 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 10A.1 Water Supply Coverage Rates (percent of population covered) Country Year Urban coverage Rural coverage Total Cambodia 1990 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2000 53% 25% WHO and UNICEF 2000.

Asia faces a particularlychallenging task in raising tariffs to commerciallevels. Endnotes 1. As of 2001, only 200 of China's 667 cities treated any waste- water before discharge (Murray 2003). 2. Local officials are evaluated based on their contribution to economic growth, which is often interpreted as reachinginvestment targets. 3. The city of Naga in the Philippines makes similar use of comparative disclosure at the local level. The city publishesall per unit costs from different bidders for local construc-tion contracts on its website. 4. In the case of the Kecamatan Development Program, 30,000 villagers were hired and trained in project develop-ment and 2,000 community facilitators were also hired andtrained. 5. This discussion follows Usui and Alisjahbana 2003.6. A city development strategy is an action plan for equitable growth in cities and their surrounding regions, developedand sustained through participation, to improve the qualityof life for all citizens. See Chreod Ltd. 2002. 7. For example, Tynan and Kingdom 2004 proved economet- rically that smaller water utilities, particularly those servinga population of 125,000 or less, could reduce per customer operating costs by increasing their scale of operation. 8. However, there is often a trade-off between efficiency gains and loss of local accountability, which efforts to identify theoptimal area of service provision would need to take intoaccount. 9. This argument is made, for example, in Smith 2000. 10. Local governments range in population from 24,000 to 4.1 million. The per capita wage bill of local governmentsseems to suggest that efficiency falls sharply at the level ofabout 500,000 people. 11. In Indonesia, revenue disparities are significant at all levels of government. These inequalities are most extreme at thelocal level, where the richest region accounts for 46 timesthe revenues of the poorest region. The richest province alsohas 32 times the per capita revenues of the poorest province. 12. There are nine RDCs, including those in the Cordillera Administrative Region and the Autonomous Region ofMuslim Mindanao.

The case is rooted intwo powerful intellectual traditions: the critique ofeconomic centralism (especially central planning),and the perceived economic advantages of federal-ism. The first tradition posits that decentraliza-tion aligns government decision making moreclosely with local preferences, largely because of theinformation advantages associated with smallerjurisdictions. 1The second tradition emphasizes the competition among regions sparked by decentral-ization, as local governments have incentives toengage in a \"race to the top\" to attract capital andlabor, or simply to build their political reputations. 2 Both strands argue that decentralization will makelocal officials more accountable to constituents fortheir performance. Though these arguments are deeply rooted in theory, surprisingly few empirical studies haveexamined the direct relationship between decen-tralization and governance. And the majority ofstudies that have been done tend to dispute theexpected governance gains from decentralization. 3 Though case studies often trumpet the successes of 23711 Governance Gone Local: Does Decentr alization Improve Accountability? Jose Edgardo Campos and Joel S. Hellman particularly innovative local governments, we hear much less about the impact of decentralization ongovernance in the median region, beyond theseshining stars. As attractive as the theoretical foun-dations of decentralization may be, the relationshipbetween decentralization and governance in prac-tice is still very much a matter of debate. Moreover, the decision to pursue decentralization is largely political, with the underlying economicrationale secondary, if not marginal. In many cases,the decision to decentralize is sparked by strongreactions to a prolonged period of highly authoritar-ian rule. This has certainly been the case for the twocountries on which this chapter focuses\u2014Indonesiaand the Philippines. Nevertheless, the development community has generally welcomed decentralization with someenthusiasm, and has responded by shifting a signif-icant share of development assistance to local gov-ernments, and to support for the decentralizationframework. 4As decentralization projects in East Asia are still under way or in the early stages ofimplementation, an assessment of lessons from theregion on the relationship between decentralization238 East Asia Decentralizes and governance is not yet available. Y et there is a certain urgency for learning more about theimpacts of decentralization. Experience so far hashighlighted a range of governance risks that appearto threaten the promised accountability gains fromdecentralization. This chapter describes five key governance risks that could mitigate the posited advantages of decen-tralization: capture, clientelism, capacity constraints,competition over the balance of power betweenlevels of government, and weaknesses in the interre-gional information flows that are critical for effectivecompetition. T o be sure, some of these risks canaffect all levels of government. But this chapterargues that they may be more prevalent at thelocal level than at the national level. The chapteralso argues that decentralization itself\u2014if poorlydesigned\u2014could exacerbate these governancedistortions, undermining any positive gains inaccountability. This is not to suggest that the con-ventional arguments about decentralization andgovernance are wrong. Rather, these experiencesraise challenges that need to be addressed in design-ing decentralization, assessing its appropriateness indifferent political contexts, and assisting the process. The chapter is organized in four parts. First, to help guide the analysis, we present a conceptualframework for governance building on the WorldBank's World Development Report 2004 . Second, we discuss the implications of decentralization forgovernance. Third, within this framework, we ana-lyze the limited experience of East Asian countrieswith decentralization, given the above-mentionedrisks. And fourth, we suggest possible avenues forminimizing these risks, given the numerous con-straints that these countries face. The Foundations of Governance The World Development Report 2004 presents a sim- ple triad to illustrate the multiple relationships thatconstitute a framework for thinking about account-ability in delivering public services. The triadfocuses on three basic relationships: between citi-zens and policy makers, between policy makers andthe bureaucracy (those responsible for providingpublic goods and services), and between the bureau-cracy as delivery agents and the citizenry as clients. 5 The first leg of the triad deals primarily with howpolicy makers acquire authority and thus power.The second and third legs address how they exercise that authority, such as by formulating policies, pro-grams, and projects (see figure 11.1), and by delegat-ing implementation to the public bureaucracy, civilsociety organizations, or the private sector. The key idea of the triad is to show that citizens\u2014as clients of public services\u2014have tworoutes by which they hold providers accountable forservice quality. The first is a \"long route,\" wherebycitizens give feedback to policy makers about theirpreferences, who then control the providers of pub-lic services. The second is a \"short route,\" wherebyusers give direct feedback to service providers, creat-ing pressure and providing information that helpspolicy makers hold them accountable for theirperformance. Decentralization adds an alternative route to this accountability framework by shortening the linkbetween policy makers on the one hand and citizensand public service providers on the other. Decentral-ization, proponents argue, brings politicians closerto the people, by giving them better informationabout constituents' preferences and making it easierfor constituents to monitor politicians' perfor-mance. At the local level, citizens can more easilylearn of the activities and programs that their localleaders have promoted and supported, discern howmuch effort they have devoted to improving publicservices, and confirm whether they have delivered oncampaign promises. In other words, the informationthat citizens need to make judgments is more readilyaccessible under decentralization. Hence, it strength-ens political accountability (see figure 11.2). 6 Similarly, local politicians, being much closer to the action and having more direct interactionswith the local bureaucracy, are potentially better ableto monitor the performance of local agencies. Localleaders can more easily find out whether doctors arearriving at work at local health clinics and whetherFIGURE 11.1 The Accountability Framework Policy makers Source: World Bank 2004c.Poor people Providers teachers are showing up at community elementary schools. Leaders can also more quickly receive alertson security problems that arise in different partsof the locality. In other words, decentralizationimproves bureaucratic accountability as well. Finally, local communities are potentially better endowed with social capital, and thus face lowercosts in organizing into groups. Client power at thelocal level is therefore likely to be much greater, andcitizens are better able to communicate the natureand location of problems to local politicians. Thisinduces improvements in the compact betweenlocal politicians and the local bureaucracy. However, this simple approach includes some important untested assumptions. First, it assumesthat proximity breeds accountability, and thataccountability is largely a function of information.Y et a range of other political factors also determinesaccountability\u2014factors that may not necessarily bemore prevalent at the local level. Second, the stan-dard approach assumes a frictionless relationshipbetween levels of government, and thus that localgovernments can respond effectively to the con-cerns of their constituents and exercise effectiveauthority over service providers. Y et competitionbetween policy makers at the center and in thelocalities could constrain the responsiveness oflocal governments to constituent pressures andweaken their capacity to control service providers.And third, the simple model does not incorporateinterregional dynamics and asymmetries that couldalter the responsiveness of local governments totheir own constituencies and influence their con-trol over service providers. Even more importantly, this approach ignores the importance of capacity constraints. Governmentofficials need to have enough training, experience, and professional skills to competently make andexecute responsive public policies. If officials do nothave adequate capacity, then they cannot implementtheir designated tasks effectively. Capacity in this context refers to the skills public officials need todeliver on various mandates, the resources (capitaland financial) they require to support their efforts,and the systems (such as budgeting systems)that enable large numbers of bureaucrats to worktogether effectively. Obviously, the same considera-tions hold for members and staff of civil societyorganizations. Accountable government generally requires a certain degree of institutional capacity. In particu-lar, participants need information for auditing, eval-uation, reporting, investigations, and prosecution.They also need processes, skills, and resources toprovide the infrastructure and create the incentivesto produce the right information. Accountability isthus circumscribed by both institutional and indi-vidual capacity. The Risks of Decentralization In practice, decentralization does not occur in a vac- uum. Many factors\u2014including historical trends,institutional inertia, and class cleavages\u2014mayundermine the simple links between decentraliza-tion and improved governance. The next sectionexamines some of these risks. State Capture at the Local Level At every level of government, state capture may distort political accountability between citizensGovernance Gone Local: Does Decentralization Improve Accountability? 239 FIGURE 11.2 Decentralization and the Accountability Framework Short routeLong route Medium route Paths of accountabilityCentral government Providers Citizens /clientsLocal government Source: Author.and policy makers. State capture refers to \"actions of individuals, groups, or firms either in the pub-lic and/or private sectors to influence the forma-tion of laws, regulations, decrees and other gov-ernment policies to their advantage through theillicit and nontransparent provision of privatebenefits to politicians and/or civil servants\" (WorldBank 2000: xv). 7State capture distorts the chain of accountability between politicians, serviceproviders, and constituents through asymmetriesof political influence. Analysts have only recentlystudied the dynamics of state capture at the locallevel (Bardhan and Mookherjee 2000; Zhuravskaya2000). The question is: are local governments moresusceptible to state capture than their nationalcounterparts? The limited empirical studies sug-gest that they are. First, state capture thrives in an environment where highly concentrated interest groups\u2014especially powerful firms and families\u2014dominatethe market for political influence, and where politi-cal competition is weak. Local economies tend to bemore homogeneous, more concentrated, and lesscompetitive than the national economy, creatingfertile ground for dominant economic actors toengage in state capture. This is particularly true inresource-rich regions in developing countries,where local economies depend on a particular statemonopoly or powerful firm. In such cases, theboundary separating the interests of the region andthe firm can be murky at best, and local politicaland economic elites are closely intertwined inpromoting state capture. Second, many of the institutions normally expected to serve as checks on state capture areweaker at the local level than at the national level,especially in developing countries. Local legisla-tures in most East Asian countries typically do notyet serve as a significant countervailing force on theexecutive. Even more than their national counter-parts, these legislatures lack technical and supportstaff, resources, experience, and training. For the same reasons, local judicial systems tend to be less effective (and more incompetent and cor- rupt) in rendering fair judgments in the face of sub-stantial asymmetries of power among contestingparties. 8As a result, the executive branch tends to dominate local polities in decentralized countries,with local representative and judicial institutionsoffering weak constraints.Third, countervailing powers representing a broader range of public interests, such as the mediaand nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), aregenerally less developed in local jurisdictions. Evenin large, geographically and linguistically diversecountries such as Indonesia, the main media out-lets are highly concentrated in the capital city.At best, an emerging but still loose network oflocal newspapers and television stations resorts to\"selling news for cash\" to survive, regardless of itsveracity. In most East Asian countries, years of authoritar- ian rule have systematically weakened the develop-ment of an NGO sector. Though the number ofNGOs is growing, they still tend to not only concen-trate in the capital city but also depend on donorsupport. Some are even government-sponsored andthus cannot conduct their activities at arms length.Local NGO networks in most East Asian countries\u2014while expanding\u2014therefore remain quite weak.With limited resources, low capacity, weak links tonational networks, and significant governmentinterference in their activities, local NGOs still tendto play a restricted role in holding local governmentsaccountable. In many East Asian countries, the question of who captures whom at the local level is lessstraightforward than in other parts of the world,where the private sector is more autonomous. Theproblem of local state actors using their power tocapture ownership of local businesses or de factocash flow rights is particularly serious. This hasbeen a longstanding issue in China. In Indonesia, apreliminary study of regional legislation (known asperdas ) showed surprisingly frequent references to local pemda companies\u2014those wholly owned by district governments, with control exercised bylocal executive officials. Whether local governmentsare seizing opportunities to expand their control overlocal businesses, or businesses themselves are usingtheir influence to capture local officials, the impactis generally the same: the exercise of state powerfavors particular firms, often at the expense of theregion's broader welfare. Expanding Clientelist Roots Clientelism\u2014in which politicians distribute publicly funded goods to selected members ofthe electorate in return for votes and political240 East Asia Decentralizessupport\u2014systematically weakens political account- ability in a variety of ways.9It narrows the range of constituents to whom politicians are responsive.Through the distribution of \"reversible\" goods\u2014those that can be withdrawn\u2014to exclusive net-works, clientelism also gives politicians a mecha-nism to punish voters who do not providecontinuous support. Clientelism also creates disin-centives for groups to develop collective forms ofrepresentation and therefore weakens interestgroup competition. Like state capture, clientelism iscommon to many different types of political sys-tems and at all levels of government. However, itmight be more pervasive at the local level, forseveral reasons. With smaller jurisdictions, local politicians are more likely to engage in clientelist forms of \"retail\"politics to win elections and maintain political sup-port networks. In such jurisdictions, politicians canmore effectively identify individual voters for clien-telist networks and more easily monitor their polit-ical linking policy makers, providers,and clients. Rather than citizens holding local offi-cials accountable, clientelist politics allows politi-cians to shape constituencies to their own advan-tage by selectively providing public services andother benefits. For example, discretionary distribu-tion of front-line service jobs to political support-ers systematically weakens the potential linksbetween clients and service providers, as jobrecruitment and promotion have little to do withperformance. Moreover, local elites in more homogeneous communities tend to be bound together by a densenetwork of familial, ethnic, social, and cultural tiesthat encourage clientelist behavior and, more gen-erally, corruption (Tanzi 1995; Prud'homme 1995).The continued presence of aristocratic lineages inthe sugar-producing provinces in Central Luzonand Western Visayas in the Philippines; the networkof tribal leaders in Papua New Guinea; and thesystem of ulama in East Java, Indonesia, are all ready-made local clientelist networks that build onpredemocratic legacies. These legacies have provenquite adaptable to new modes of political competi-tion. Such exclusive patron-client networks are farmore difficult to build and maintain in a morediverse and competitive national playing field. As aresult, clientelism is generally a phenomenon of local politics. Where clientelism is prevalent, decentralization can seriously exacerbate inefficiencies and inequal-ities in public services. Clientelist governmentstend to favor investments that generate jobs, whichthey can then distribute to build patronage net-works. In a common example, newly empoweredlocal governments may favor investing in newschools as opposed to improving existing schools.As a result, each school is underresourced, under-mining any positive impact on educational levels.Indeed, clientelism can distort a range of decisionsabout public services\u2014from the service mix, to thelocation of facilities, to standards discriminating infavor of particular constituent groups at theexpense of more overall community welfare. Amplifying Capacity Constraints Decentralization shifts the responsibilities of local government from purely implementing policy toboth formulating and implementing policy. Thisrequires a wider range of skills and experience,which local politicians and bureaucrats may have todevelop. Hence, at least in the initial stages ofdecentralization, local skill levels and policy-making processes are likely to lag behind those atthe national level. 11 Besides skills and processes, capacity also implies appropriate management systems\u2014accounting,budgeting, procurement, tax administration, audit-ing, reporting, and personnel management. Inmany developing countries, national governmentscontinue to struggle with reforming these systems.Given their relative inexperience and more modestresources, local governments are likely to find estab-lishing such systems and processes even morechallenging. 12(See chapter 7 for more on the prob- lems East Asian countries face in creating personnelmanagement systems.) Resources are often a forgotten or underesti- mated aspect of capacity. T o train personnel,develop systems and processes, strengthen account-ability, and ultimately deliver public goods andservices, local governments need funds. Otherchapters discuss funding issues\u2014in particular,intergovernmental transfers and local taxation\u2014inmore detail. Suffice it to say that efforts to fundlocal government present complex considerationsGovernance Gone Local: Does Decentralization Improve Accountability? 241and challenges with which newly decentralizing countries\u2014including most East Asian countries\u2014are only starting to grapple. Capacity problems are not limited to institu- tions and processes within the executive branch;the same constraints affect other actors in theaccountability framework. The accountability oflocal governments\u2014like that of the nationalgovernment\u2014depends largely on the strength ofcountervailing institutions, such as the legislatureand judiciary and civil society groups, to provideeffective inputs and monitor policies. Here againare reasons for concern that capacity among theseactors is not as strong at the local level as at thenational level. As suggested, local legislatures inEast Asia generally have limited access to indepen-dent policy expertise and analysis and therefore aremuch more dependent on local executives. Local courts generally remain embedded in centralizedhierarchies even in the most decentralized coun-tries. As a result, patterns of career advancementdraw court officials to the center, leaving localcourts with less capacity. Comparing the capacity of civil society between the center and the regions is more difficult but alsoessential to determine the foundation for localaccountability. As mentioned, the local civil societyinstitutions regarded as key checks to prevent statecapture and clientelism are not well developed inmany East Asian countries, especially those in tran-sition from previously authoritarian systems, wherethe legacy of public participation is particularlyweak. With a few exceptions, NGO penetration atthe local level is also lower than at the nationallevel. Though no systematic quality comparisonsexist, it is widely agreed that the quality of themedia beyond the national level drops substantiallyin most developing countries. In sum, it is not onlylocal governments that face capacity constraintsrelative to their national counterparts, but also theother institutions and actors whose participation isessential to holding local governments accountable. Creating Intergovernmental Tension Regardless of the initial enthusiasm with which many countries have embraced decentralization,when it comes to actual dividing power and author-ity across different levels of government, decentral-ization generally remains contested terrain for aprolonged period. While the initial impetus for decentralizing power in East Asia has been broaderpolitical transitions from highly centralized regimesor within such regimes, implementation has con-fronted a variety of fiscal and administrative chal-lenges. These challenges often generate conflictingincentives at different levels and within differentbranches of government. The result is that theshape of decentralization is constantly evolving,reflecting changing political and economic realities,conflicting interests, and shifting priorities. This changing landscape has a number of poten- tially serious implications for the impact of decen-tralization on local governance. First, contests overthe extent and contours of decentralization betweenlevels of government tend to constrain local auton-omy. The shifting relationship between local politi-cians and service providers and their nationalcounterparts blurs lines of accountability. This canreduce the responsiveness of local governments andweaken their authority over service providers, whomay be responding to incentives from nationalhierarchies. Second, contests across levels of government often lead to what might be called imbalanceddecentralization\u2014especially between power andfinancial responsibility, distorting incentives atlower levels. In Indonesia, for example, local gov-ernments have considerable control over expendi-tures for basic public services but little control overthe civil servants that provide those services. Thus,these governments cannot downsize the workforce,alter remuneration packages, or introduce new(and perhaps more meritocratic) recruitment andpromotion to coincide with changing expenditurepriorities. In many countries local governments also face strong constraints on raising revenues, limiting anyautonomy they receive over local services. Suchimbalances might not only constrain local govern-ments but also create incentives for them to makeinefficient investment decisions, especially if theycan shift costs to central budgets (see chapters 5and 6). Both of these factors generate substantial uncer- tainty regarding the distribution of functions andresponsibilities, the extent of autonomy, and thebalance of power between levels of government.Such uncertainty can weaken accountability atevery leg of the triad, as it affects the expectations 242 East Asia Decentralizesof all actors in the framework. Such uncertainty can also stifle investment and thus interregionalcompetition. Stifling Rather Than Promoting Interregional Competition The view that competition among jurisdictions can enhance governance has been an important justifi-cation for decentralization. The basic foundation ofthis idea is simple: officials who steal or wasteresources, or fail to provide essential public goodsrelative to other regions, will lose residents andbusinesses, thus reducing the tax base. This argu-ment has taken on greater weight with the growingfocus on the investment climate. Given mobility ofcapital among countries as well as within countries,businesses can seek out jurisdictions where regula-tion is not overly onerous, infrastructure is sound,and trust relationships can be forged with localofficials. This kind of competition for investment isseen to discipline local governments, strengtheningtheir incentives for delivering transparent andaccountable governance. Recent literature has stressed that competition among regions could also have a host of negativeimplications for governance. Competition for capi-tal and residents could become too intense, pushinggovernments to overshoot in cutting tax rates andexpenditures and providing public goods (Keenand Marchand 1997). Such competition could alsohave negative spillover effects, such as exportingtaxes or pollution to neighboring regions (Gordon1983; Oates and Schwab 1988). More generally,competition for investment could lead regionalgovernments to distort the investment climate tofavor particular firms through preferential regula-tions and protectionism, or, even worse, by shelter-ing firms from tax policies and regulations of thecentral government. In the latter event, competi-tion among regions could weaken the capacity ofthe central government to collect revenue, enforcelaw, and regulate interregional competition toensure welfare-enhancing outcomes. This scenariohas been called \"state-corroding\" decentralization(Cai and Treisman 2002). The risks of state-corroding decentralization are particularly high in countries where centrallaw enforcement and respect for the constitutionare still quite weak. In such contexts, regionalgovernments can undermine national laws and reg- ulations without likelihood that these actions will besubject to central review and potential revocation.This allows regional governments to entice firmswith tax evasion strategies, legal exemptions,regional protectionism, and even shelter from courtactions, further undermining the center's regulatoryand enforcement capacity. Interregional competi-tion thus becomes not a race to the top but anescape route by which firms avoid the reach ofnational authorities. In East Asia, we see this partic-ularly in the justice sector, where complex and high-profile legal challenges are often deliberately shiftedto remote regional courts, where the opportunitiesfor undue influence may be greater. Such a phenom-enon is also evident in regional regulations that pro-vide preferential tax and regulatory regimes for spe-cific firms in contradiction to national legislation. The Early Experience in East Asia Few empirical studies of the impact of decentral- ization on governance in East Asian countries existso far. This is partly because most countries in theregion began the decentralization process onlyrecently: the Philippines and Vietnam in the early1990s, Thailand and Indonesia in the late 1990s,and Cambodia at the turn of the century. Of these,Indonesia and the Philippines have gone the fur-thest in implementing comprehensive programs,and thus offer modest empirical evidence on theimpact of decentralization on governance. Whilethe experiences of each country are undoubtedlyunique, these two nations can provide a glimpse ofthe potential benefits, risks, problems, and chal-lenges to governance as a country decentralizes. Empirical evidence on these two countries comes from perception-based surveys; no system-atic analysis based on objective indicators is yetavailable, at least for East Asia. Indonesia Because Indonesia implemented its Big Bang decentralization only in 2001, it is still quite early toexpect reliable estimates of the impact of complexand slow-moving institutional changes on percep-tions of governance. Though the reform did rapidlytransfer control over a significant share of publicresources and direct authority over nearly 2 million Governance Gone Local: Does Decentralization Improve Accountability? 243civil servants to the local level, the institutional changes are still in flux and the lines of authorityare unclear in many areas. Moreover, the countryhas recently revised the basic laws defining decen-tralization, so considerable uncertainty remainsabout its ultimate extent and shape. T o expect thisfluid environment to exert a clear impact onperceptions of governance\u2014which generally lagbehind institutional changes\u2014is premature. A number of empirical studies have attempted to measure governance trends across districts inIndonesia, but few provide a benchmark for com-paring governance indicators before and afterdecentralization. As a second best\u2014one thatfocuses on how the perceptions of firms changeover time\u2014the World Bank's Productivity andInvestment Climate Survey (PICS) explicitly askedfirms to identify the direction of change on a varietyof governance dimensions before and after decen-tralization. Though these data are preliminary, theyprovide some basis for exploring these issues. The PICS survey asked firms directly about the impact of decentralization on key aspects of gov-ernance and the investment climate. Firms per-ceived decentralization as having a negative impactin four areas: labor regulations, licenses, policyuncertainty, and corruption (see figure 11.3).While just under 30 percent of the firms felt thatdecentralization has made licensing and laborregulations worse, nearly 50 percent think policy uncertainty and corruption\u2014two broad indicatorsof accountability\u2014have worsened. The survey results suggest that greater proximity to the client\u2014in this case, in the business arena\u2014does not necessarily lead to perceptions of greateraccountability. The survey also asked firms to ratethe extent to which a number of standard problemsaffect their business. In customs, labor regulations,licenses, and corruption, firms see little differencebetween the constraints imposed by national gov-ernments and those imposed by regional govern-ments (see figure 11.4). Indeed, in some areas suchas licenses and corruption, firms rate local govern-ments worse than the national government, despitethe greater proximity of the former. Corruption appears to be a particular problem under decentralization in Indonesia. Over one-third of firms stated that informal paymentshad grown under decentralization, while less than15 percent cited some improvement (see figure 11.5).Moreover, firms pay 64 percent more in informalpayments as a share of annual revenues to localgovernments than they do to national level officials,on average (see table 11.1). Firms also spend 15 per-cent more of their time dealing with local regu-lations than with national regulations.

Instead,decentralization is linked with a general decline inperceptions of government accountability at thelocal level. These perceptions are consistent with analyses of the fiscal performance of local governments underdecentralization. Several recent studies have pointedto a widespread trend in which regional govern-ments have imposed numerous nuisance taxes andcharges\u2014levies that cost more to administer thanthey reap in revenues\u2014on small-scale economic activity. Many of these levies contradict nationalguidelines on the tax authority of local govern-ments. Annual studies by the Jakarta-based moni-toring organization Regional Autonomy Watchhave emphasized the negative impact of these nui-sance taxes and charges on regional investment cli-mates. Studies of the legislative processes underwhich the taxes and charges have been formulatedshow little citizen consultation or participation(Lewis 2003; Regional Autonomy Watch 2004).Moreover, they tend to be poorly designed, with noclear links between service delivery and charges.Despite a requirement that national authoritiesreview all regional legislation authorizing new taxesand charges within 30 days, a recent estimate sug-gests that some 60 percent of these regulations havenot been reviewed, and that regions never sent alarge share to the center for review (Lewis 2003).Though many regional governments have indeedintroduced innovative programs to improve publicservice delivery and strengthen the transparency oflocal processes, little empirical evidence so farreveals a race to the top to improve regional invest- ment climates. In conjunction with World Bank projects that aim to invest in communities committed to gover-nance reform, detailed case studies have examinedgovernance dynamics at the district level (WorldBank 2004b). These studies point to common fac-tors distorting the potentially beneficial impact ofdecentralization on governance. First, these studiesemphasize weak development of local \"accounta-bility infrastructure\": institutions that constrainthe authority of the executive branch. The heads ofdistricts in Indonesia\u2014 bupatis and walikotas \u2014are still appointed by local legislatures, rather thanelected, with a strong role played by national par-ties. Removing district heads requires the approvalof national authorities. The local legislatures them-selves are extremely weak and ineffective: they havevirtually no technical expertise, and rely entirely onthe executive branch in key areas such as legaldrafting, budget analysis, and public accounting.Moreover, case studies of elections for local legisla-tures have shown that the chosen candidates haveweak accountability ties to their constituents. Can-didates routinely pay national party organizationsfor ballot slots, and their selection is closely linkedto elite village networks. Voters are also stronglyGovernance Gone Local: Does Decentralization Improve Accountability? 245 FIGURE 11.5 Informal Payments after Decentralization, as Cited by Firms inIndonesia 01020406080100 3050% respondents7090 Source: World Bank 2005.Share of revenue predictability effect on informal payments strongly increased increased moderately stayed the samedecreased moderately decreased strongly TABLE 11.1 Regulatory Burdens on Firms in Indonesia National Local government government Time spent dealing with regulations 7.1% 8.2% (percent of total time) Informal payments 1.35% 2.1% (percent of total sales) Source: World Bank 2005.influenced by direct payments and other transfers. As a result, the local governance environment ishighly susceptible to clientelism and capture. Local legal and judicial institutions play only a minor role in the accountability infrastructure. Adetailed study of 37 cases where public officialsstole or misused local development funds con-cluded that most communities could not overcomelocal power structures and elite networks to gainaccess to justice through formal and informal dis-pute resolution mechanisms. Only in cases whereexternal actors such as national civil society groups,outside media, and representatives of a nationalproject management structure intervened werecorrupt local officials successfully prosecuted. Civil society groups and other external con- straints on government such as the media remainweak in most districts. Efforts to promote localplans to address poverty have been hampered bylow levels of participation, except in districts nearmajor universities or technical institutes. Thoughcommunity radio is developing rapidly, printmedia do not penetrate far beyond the provincialcapital. According to a recent poll, more than85 percent of Indonesians obtain their politicalinformation from television (International Foun-dation for Electoral Studies 2004). Provincial andnational media devote minimal attention to districtnews. Interviews also suggest that it is standardpractice for local governments to pay provincialand national journalists for positive stories on a perstory basis. As mentioned, a major factor weakening the impact of decentralization on governance is uncer-tainty about the proper role of different levels ofgovernment and the resulting conflicts. In Indone-sia, despite recent revisions to the main decentral-ization laws (formerly Laws 22 and 25 of 1999; nowLaws 32 and 33 of 2004), the roles and responsibili-ties of district governments have not been fully clar-ified. The role of provincial governments in decen-tralization is also poorly defined. Moreover, theoversight functions of different central ministries\u2014especially the ministries of Home Affairs andFinance\u2014remain unclear. This has led to constantconflict, as different levels of government and com-peting agencies stake their claims over vaguelydefined roles and powers. This conflict is reaching acrescendo with recent proposals to further revise themain decentralization laws. The boundaries ofdecentralization in Indonesia have thus been in a permanent state of renegotiation since Big Bangdecentralization began in 2001. Not surprisingly,decentralization has exerted its most negativeimpact on policy uncertainty. The World Bank's engagement in decentralization has highlighted the lack of information on regionalperformance, which is essential to promoting arace to the top among regions. Decentralization\u2014especially the initial shift of control over civilservants to local governments\u2014has underminedIndonesia's regional information systems. Theproblem is particularly severe in key decentralizedpublic service sectors such as health and education.Minimum service standards mandated in thedecentralization laws have not yet been developed.Only a small minority of districts have submittedthe required performance self-assessments basedon annual and five-year plans. Districts send only asmall share of laws and decrees to the center forofficial review, and the Ministry of Home Affairsdoes not have a system for analyzing and catalogingthis material. While several civil society groupshave begun to develop systems for comparing per-formance across districts, especially regarding theinvestment climate, these efforts do not yet serve asa reliable basis for monitoring districts. As a result,little information about regional performance isavailable to stimulate competition and disseminategood and bad practices. 13 The Philippines In contrast to Indonesia, which is still in the very early stages of decentralization, the Philippines hasseveral years more experience, having launched itsmajor reform in 1992-93 under the mandate of itspost-Marcos democratic Constitution of 1987. 14 Given more than a decade of experience, analyzingthe long-term impact of decentralization on gover-nance outcomes might indeed be possible. How-ever, empirical analysis in the Philippines is nearlyas sparse as in Indonesia, and no direct surveymeasures have explicitly examined the impact onperceptions of governance or related indicators.Existing evidence comes from an extensive study bythe Center for Institutional Reform and the Infor-mal Sector (IRIS) at the University of Marylandand the World Bank, based on surveys of house-holds and public officials at different levels of246 East Asia Decentralizesgovernment.15The study presents a mixed picture of the impact of decentralization on governanceand concludes that \"the results do not match themost optimistic theoretical expectations.\" The au-thors find that while perceptions of corruption aremuch lower at lower levels of government, localgovernments are no more accountable to local pref-erences than the central government, given a vari-ety of constraints on responsiveness. Perception-based measures of corruption in the Philippines have shown significant and consis-tent improvement since decentralization, thoughestablishing a clear causal connection is difficult.According to most international rankings of cor-ruption, the Philippines began to show progressin the early 1990s and maintained this progressthroughout the decade. Moreover, surveys of publicofficials revealed that respondents in every categorysaw corruption as more prevalent at the nationallevel than at lower levels of government (seetable 11.2). While municipal officials have obviousbiases, the pattern is the same among teachers atprivate schools, suggesting that the responses mayin fact reflect reality in the ground. These differences in perceptions of corruption may reflect different sources of information aboutlocal and national levels that may be even moreimportant in explaining the dynamics of accounta-bility. The IRIS-World Bank survey asked respon-dents whether they had seen or heard reports oflocal and national officials engaged in corruption.Among the sample of over 1,100 households,49 percent had seen or heard reports of national officials engaged in corruption, while only 27 per-cent had seen or heard reports of local officialsengaged in corruption (Azfar et al. 2000). A deeper probe into the sources of information on politics among Philippines respondents led to aninteresting result (see table 11.3). While nearly98 percent of respondents rely on the media\u2014especially radio and TV\u2014for their information onnational politics, these sources are far less prominentwith regard to local politics. Instead, 42 percent ofthe respondents used personal networks as their pri-mary source of information on local politics andcorruption, relying on community leaders or localofficials rather than the media. This reflects the weakpenetration of local media and their generally weakcapacity to cover local politics. Thus, the media mayplay a much weaker role in monitoring local officialsfor corruption, and information on local politicscould be more susceptible to manipulation throughclientelist networks and state capture. The IRIS-World Bank survey also explored local accountability by asking both households and offi-cials to identify their funding priorities. Except forinfrastructure (roads, canals, bridges), the professedpreferences of municipal officials failed to matchthose of households. In the critical area of health,the correlation is in fact negative (see table 11.4). 16 T o supplement this finding, the survey asked public officials how they learned of householdpreferences. All the officials attested to makingsome effort to understand such preferences. AboutGovernance Gone Local: Does Decentralization Improve Accountability? 247 TABLE 11.2 Perceptions of Corruption in the Philippines (mean statistics, scaled from 0 to 100) Type of respondent Municipal Municipal Municipal Teachers Teachers health administrative official at public at private Survey questions official official at DECS schools schools Corruption in the national government 74.00 69.23 62.77 66.35 of Education, Culture, and Sports.30 percent consult with community leaders and local civic organizations, while 15 percent also con-duct surveys and make other inquiries (Azfar et al.2000). However, neither method significantlystrengthened the relationship between the fundingpriorities of households and municipal officials. Despite this apparent mismatch, assessments of decentralization's impact on public service provi-sion in the Philippines are mixed. For example,experts express concern about the deterioratingquality and administration of public health pro-grams, but most people express more positive views.According to a June 1999 survey by Social WeatherStation (a nonprofit organization specializing insurvey-based research), 58 percent of respondentssaid health care had improved with decentraliza-tion, while only 8 percent said it had worsened(USAID 1999). A more quantitative measure ofservice quality is administrative delays in hiring andpaying staff, which are significantly more severe ineducation than in health (see table 11.5). This isrevealing, as the education sector has seen far less decentralization than the health sector, even thoughthe Local Government Code requires devolution ofbasic education to local governments. Althoughperformance measures before and after decentral-ization are not available, devolved services seem towork better on some dimensions.248 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 11.3 Sources of Information on Politics, as Cited by Households in the Philippines T-test for difference Local politics National politics between the two al. 2000.

Significant at the 1 percent level.Some aspects of governance and service deliv- ery standards have improved under decentraliza-tion, although whether these changes are due toenhanced accountability at the local level is muchless clear. Surveys have shown that, as in Indone-sia, key institutions in the local accountabilityframework\u2014such as an independent media, andlegislative and judicial branches to check thepower of local executives\u2014are weak. However,unlike Indonesia, the Philippines has seen civilsociety groups mushroom at the local level. A num-ber of studies reveal that NGOs have indeedbecome actively involved in the decision making ofthe local government. 17In 1986, when the country restored democracy, 27,100 NGOs had registeredwith the Securities and Exchange Commission.After passage of the Local Government Code,this number quickly doubled to 50,800 in 1992.T oday more than 95,000 NGOs exist, with some 7,000 operating at the grassroots level (Alonzo2003). One study concluded that \"NGOs operatingat the local level often found themselves in directconfrontations with local elites who, understand-ably, feel threatened when NGO members buildalliances, muster funds and other resources for useby local people outside the control of traditionalpatrons, and gain the moral high ground in theprocess\" (Alonzo 2003: 17). 18 However, these surveys suggest that the respon- siveness of local governments to the new layer ofNGOs has been limited, owing to legal and proce-dural constraints on decentralization and fearsamong central officials that they will lose controlover the regions. While boosting local taxingauthority, the Local Government Code also con-strains local revenue collection through rules onrates, assessments, appeals, and administrativeresponsibilities (USAID 1999). The code also regu-lates earmarked funds such as the Special Educa-tion Fund, specifying the property levies throughwhich these funds are raised and the rules for dis-tributing the proceeds. These requirements signifi-cantly compromise local revenue autonomy. In fact,whenever fiscal (deficit) problems have becomeserious, the central government has conjured upschemes to reduce mandated, formula-based trans-fers, further limiting the flexibility and responsive-ness of local governments (Azfar et al. 2000; Alonzo2003). Not surprisingly, as in Indonesia, the hypothe- sized race to the top among local governments hasnot emerged. But unlike in Indonesia, and perhapsbecause of longer experience, reliable informationon performance is beginning to develop, spurringsome competition among local governments. Thepower of information in fostering competition isperhaps best illustrated by the success of the GalingPook Awards. These awards, first introduced in1993 in response to the Local Government Code,were patterned after awards to U.S. local govern- ments for notable achievements in improvingservice delivery and public welfare. Since theirinception, a total of 2,339 programs have competedfor these awards, with just 175 selected and 8 con-sistently cited for excellence and elevated to theHall of Fame. The awards carry no monetary com-pensation; they simply provide a credible signal toGovernance Gone Local: Does Decentralization Improve Accountability? 249 TABLE 11.5 Responses from Facilities on Administrative Delays in the Philippines Health facility Index How often has there been a delay of more than one month in getting a new health worker on a payroll? 3 In the last year, were there any nonpayments or delay of more than two weeks in the payment of your salary? 17 In the last year, were there any nonpayments or delay of more than two weeks in the payment of your allowances? 7 Primary school How often has there been a delay of more than one month in getting a new teacher on a payroll? 26 In the last year, were there any nonpayments or delay of more than two weeks in the payment of your salary? 20 In the last year, were there any nonpayments or delay of more than two weeks in the payment of your allowances? 17 Source: Azfar et al. 2000.

A strongbody of theory posits governance gains fromdecentralization, but recognition of how decentral-ization can go wrong has grown. The expectedgains are based on assumptions about the politicsof accountability at the local level and the nature ofinterjurisdictional competition that need to beexamined closely, especially in developing coun-tries. Using an accountability framework that linkscitizens, policy makers, and service providers, thischapter examined the potential risks in each linkthat threaten to undermine the expected gover-nance gains from decentralization. The chapterthen applied that framework to the two East Asiancountries with the most significant decentralizationprograms: Indonesia and the Philippines. Not surprisingly, in neither country has decen- tralization fulfilled the governance goals predictedby the most optimistic theories. In Indonesia, whichis still in the early stages of its reform, the initialimpact on perceptions of governance and selectedoutcomes has not been positive. There is a widelyheld view that decentralization has exacerbated cor-ruption and significantly increased policy uncer-tainty across different levels of government. Decen-tralization has also led to a greater regulatory burdenon firms and questionable financial managementpractices. These problems have contributed to ageneral weakening of the investment climate, whichhas harmed Indonesia's growth prospects. In thePhilippines, which has a longer record of decentral-ization, the picture is more mixed. Overall, percep-tions of corruption have declined, and service deliv-ery standards have improved somewhat. However,the link between these outcomes and improvementsin the accountability of local politicians is weak. In both countries, surveys and case study research suggest that the most serious problem isthe weakness of local institutions intended to play amajor role in the accountability framework, includ-ing local legislatures, judicial institutions, and themedia. Local officials\u2014even more than theirnational counterparts\u2014are subject to the risks of capture and clientelism. Countervailing institu-tions at the local level generally lack the indepen-dence and capacity to check these risks. This doesnot suggest that decentralization in such contextsshould be avoided. Indeed, experience in thePhilippines shows that decentralization can encour-age the development of a vibrant local civil societynetwork. Y et more needs to be done to support theother key institutions in the accountability frame-work that guarantee and sustain the expected gov- ernance gains from decentralization. The case studies also reveal the risks associated with sustained uncertainty about the division ofroles and responsibilities across levels of govern-ments. In Indonesia, in particular, decentralizationis hotly contested terrain. The enabling legislation isoften inconsistent and leaves many issues unre-solved. These inconsistencies have set the stage forserious political conflicts across levels of govern-ment and among agencies, further exacerbatingthese uncertainties. Even after a decade of decentral-ization, the Philippines suffers from similar prob-lems. Such an environment constrains the ability oflocal officials to respond to the demands of theirconstituents, and shifts their focus to bureaucraticstruggles to preserve their powers. Uncertaintyblunts the impact of decentralization on accounta-bility at the local level. Finally, the case studies emphasize the critical role of information in spurring interregional com-petition, yet these systems have largely been over-looked in the context of decentralization. Thedecentralization process itself tends to fragmentand weaken information flows from the local levelover the short term. Significant efforts are neededto preserve these channels and develop new stan-dards and instruments for measuring and dissemi-nating information on regional performance.These flows expand the range of information avail-able to local voters, who surveys have shown stilllargely depend on social networks for information,which can encourage clientelism and capture.These flows are also essential to enabling investors,donors, and others to compare the performance ofdifferent regions, and to widely disseminate goodand bad practices to maximize their impact. The analysis in this chapter suggests a strategy for enhancing the impact of decentralization on 250 East Asia Decentralizesgovernance. Such a strategy should rest on three pillars: Frame decentralization within national rules that weaken the ability of local governments to engagein capture or clientelism. T o combat local cap- ture, national authorities need to enforce strongrestrictions on the ability of local governmentsto offer tax and regulatory privileges to specificfirms and groups. Local legislation often codifiessuch privileges, and needs to be subject to someform of central administrative review. T o combatclientelism, countries also need to link decentral-ization to national civil service reform, stipulat-ing meritocratic recruitment and advancementwith appropriate central oversight and appeals.The political and economic incentives for thecenter to enforce such standards in regions maybe stronger than the incentives for the center toadhere to the same standards. Focus on strengthening local countervailing institu- tions and collective associations, not only throughbottom-up participation but by linking themto national networks, which can help these insti-tutions counterbalance entrenched local elites.T o enhance local accountability, countervailinginstitutions and collective associations may needto marshal resources outside their localities toenhance their power and influence. Capacity-building programs should therefore focus onforging closer links between local institutionsand national networks. Local legislatures may bemore effective at checking the executive branchif they are allied more closely with a nationallegislative network. Local civil society groupsmay be more effective in promoting accounta-bility if they can rely on the capacity and powerderiving from their national networks. Strengthen a national framework for encouraging competition among regions, so local capture andclientelism entail reputational costs and lower exter-nal investment. Providing information on regional performance measures and the quality of gover-nance is particularly important, as such informa-tion can counterbalance the powerful local pres-sures supporting capture and clientelism. Overall, this strategy entails using national struc- tures and networks to enhance the ability of localorganizations to promote greater political accounta-bility under decentralization.This approach comple- ments community-driven development (see chap-ter 12) by strengthening countervailing institutionsand building local demand for good governance.

Achievingthis goal, however, depends on a variety of condi-tions, including establishing mechanisms to pro-mote broad civic participation and more responsiveand accountable local governments. These goals areespecially relevant for East Asian countries pursu-ing large-scale decentralization programs. Onemechanism intended to make development planningand management more responsive and account-able arises from what the World Bank has calledcommunity-driven development (CDD). A great deal of empirical evidence reveals that decentralization will not always achieve the goal ofmaking local governments more responsive andaccountable. They are often susceptible to elite cap-ture: that is, public decision making often reflectsdisproportionate influence by well-off and well-connected groups. In many countries, officialsexploit the opportunities offered by decentraliza-tion to promote their own commercial activities.Standard mechanisms for accountability, such aselections, audits, and performance benchmarking, 25312 Community-Driven Development: Decentralization's Accountability Challenge Susan Wong and Scott Guggenheim often do not work well in environments where information is scarce, open elections are unfamiliaror rare, and clarity about performance standards islacking. Decentralization can also aggravate exist-ing social problems. Polarized local environmentscan erupt into open conflict when decentralizationleads to the exclusion of one group from govern-ment. Marginalized groups, particularly the poor,often fare worse under decentralization when localgovernments do not see redistributive or highly tar-geted social programs as priorities\u2014particularly ifthe primary beneficiaries of such programs are peo-ple least likely to vote. A great deal of work is neededto introduce transparency, consultation, participa-tion, and accountability mechanisms that can linkpublic administrations with their surrounding com-munities and give the poor a greater voice. Decentralization and CDD are inherently politi- cal reform processes. Nevertheless, because devel-opment programs channel significant resourcesinto the existing administrative structure, donorchoices can help determine to what extent decen-tralization promotes healthier links between com-munities and governments.254 East Asia Decentralizes The challenge of finding mechanisms to promote more responsive and accountable local governmentsis especially relevant in East Asian countries under-going large-scale decentralization. China, for exam-ple, has quietly but effectively pursued a nationalprogram for village elections, and is developing apackage of programs that provide new village gov-ernments with investment resources. Indonesia, asthis chapter will show, is similarly concerned withfostering more effective, adequately funded localgovernments that can pursue a range of invest-ments, and with encouraging communities to feelthey have a stake in local government and the meansto change it. CDD programs are one mechanism for making development planning and management moreaccountable. Although community development isa well-established idea in the literature, large devel-opment agencies such as the World Bank firstbecame involved with significant CDD programs inthe late 1990s. This chapter defines CDD as an approach that gives communities or locally elected bodies controlover the decision making, management, and use ofdevelopment funds. 1CDD differs significantly from an earlier generation of community-basedrural development projects in emphasizing the rolethat communities play in driving the developmentprocess rather than acting as passive beneficiaries. The long-term goal of CDD projects, especially in East Asia, has been to reduce poverty by improv-ing local governance and empowering local people.While varying somewhat in design, CDD programsgenerally consist of a participatory planning processat village and commune or subdistrict levels, leadingto funding and implementation of priority activi- ties. CDD programs emphasize giving communitiesand locally elected bodies the power, information,and skills to determine the best use of developmentresources. CDD approaches are especially relevant in coun- tries where the priorities of central and local govern-ments with respect to poverty are weak, and wheregovernments will respond more readily to poverty ifthere is strong demand emanating from society. Thedemand side is as important and fundamental inpolitics as in the realm of economics. CDD hypoth-esizes that the community demand-side approach\u2014if well designed and implemented\u2014will exert mul-tiplier effects in broader decision-making processesat the local level.The growth of CDD programs has occurred in parallel with a general trend toward decentraliza-tion and democratization in countries within theregion over the last decade or so, driven by varyingpolitical motivations. Given these trends, what hasbeen the relationship between the portfolio of CDDprograms and decentralization reforms? How havethese programs worked within evolving decentral-ization frameworks? This chapter describes some ofthe dynamics behind these two trends and focuseson three main issues: CDD's role in improving the quality of decentral- ization by promoting greater civic participation,voice, and accountability in local governance. CDD's role in delivering cost-effective and timely services within a decentralized context. CDD's role in informing and formulating decen- tralization regulations. Based on the above analysis, this chapter argues that in a decentralized environment, CDD programscan improve the quality of the decentralizationframework by promoting greater civic participation,voice, and accountability in local governance; pro-viding an effective means of delivering much-neededservices in a decentralized context in a cost-effectiveand time-efficient manner; and directly informingand shaping decentralization regulations. WhileCDD projects are too new to allow definitive state-ments about their overall success or failure, prelimi-nary evaluations point to tangible contributions inthese areas. The chapter also discusses challenges thatlie ahead for CDD in decentralized environments. CDD as Public Sector Heresy: CDD Works in Practice but Does It Work in Theory? Specialists in public administration are often wary of CDD for understandable reasons. CDD financialflows bypass formal intergovernmental transfersystems, and CDD sits outside integrated govern-ment planning. But are there persuasive counter-arguments as well? One is that CDD can improve the way local gov- ernments function and thus help them work betterfor their citizens. The decentralization literature sayslittle about the role of nonstate actors in makinglocal governments work in transparent and account-able ways. CDD aims to strengthen that role. By pro-moting demand, competitive pressure, and the flowof information between governors and the gov- erned, CDD programs introduce a range of account-ability mechanisms and participatory processes thatimprove local governance, especially in a decentral-ized environment. CDD encourages the creationand strengthening of community groups, and forgesnew norms regarding civic behavior and expecta-tions regarding the relationship between govern-ment and the people. Whereas reforms of public administration tend to focus on the government side of the governanceequation, CDD emphasizes the other half of theequation: strengthening citizen participation anddemand. These two efforts are not mutually exclu-sive, but the starting points are quite different.CDD approaches governance from the bottomup by helping poorer communities make theirdemands more audible and visible, thus influenc-ing local planning and decision making. CDD also responds to an efficiency problem. East Asian subnational bureaucracies are alreadyoverburdened trying to meet routine district-levelrequirements. All too often, faced with limited timeand resources, these governments simply delay newefforts to meet the development needs of villages,or collapse them into existing programs that mayor may not reflect local development priorities.Thus, for example, a 1997 review of 48 villages inIndonesia found that fewer than 3 percent of villagedevelopment requests proposed through thegovernment's development planning system everreceived funding (Evers 1998). CDD programs have the potential to eliminate some of these problems. CDD projects do not haveto follow cumbersome or leaky procedures for transferring funds or develop complicated mecha-nisms for coordinating and delivering services.Community groups can fulfill many of these func-tions instead. And, for certain types of infrastruc-ture and services, preliminary evidence suggeststhat delivering funds directly to communities com-plements investments of district governments withno loss of quality, and allows large-scale provisionof productive investments that would otherwisenot have occurred. This chapter examines how CDD approaches have been designed to operate in different decentralizedenvironments. As other chapters explain, the forms,dimensions, and degrees of decentralization\u2014political, administrative, and fiscal\u2014vary across theregion. CDD programs also show wide variation indesign, management, and closeness to local gov-ernments. These variations relate to historical andstructural factors within specific country contexts, aswell as to different strategic approaches to CDD. A note of methodological caution is needed. Large-scale CDD programs at the World Bank arerelatively new, with the large majority having beenin effect for less than three years. Within such a lim-ited time frame, it is premature to draw conclu-sions, whether positive or negative, about criticalaspects of CDD, such as their impacts on povertyand local government, evolution, and sustain-ability. Furthermore, CDD projects have proved nomore immune to the general lack of rigorous evalu-ation than other development projects.

The lack of comparable evaluations precludes any conclusive statements about the overall impactsof CDD. Y et it is possible to draw some preliminaryconclusions about CDD performance. Projectsalready under way collect a great deal of usefulinformation, and several older projects are yieldinga growing body of evidence, including evaluationsof their technical quality, audits, cost-benefit analy-ses, case studies, and information on types andlevels of participation. This chapter draws on thatinformation while noting that a full assessment ofCDD will have to wait several years. Given the diversity of CDD, this chapter addresses general approaches while honing in onthree countries where specific large-scale CDD pro-grams intertwine with significant decentralizationreforms: Indonesia, Cambodia, and the Philippines.While all these CDD programs are housed withingovernment ministries or interministerial commit-tees, they differ somewhat in terms of their design,links with local government entities, and historicalevolution. The Indonesian Kecamatan Development Pro- gram (KDP) gives communities planning anddecision-making power over development resources.KDP initially built on the government's bottom-upplanning structure while introducing a broad rangeof reforms to make that system more participatoryand efficient. KDP channels funds outside the usualgovernment disbursement mechanisms, allowingfinancing to flow directly from the national level tokecamatan and village-level bank accounts con- trolled by communities. Since Indonesia's decentral-ization in 2001, the second and third phases(2002-7) of KDP have emphasized greater oversightfrom district parliaments, government monitoring,links with sectoral agencies such as education andhealth, district matching grants, and local involve-ment in drafting formal decentralization regula-tions on village autonomy. The Kapit Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan -Compre- hensive Integrated Delivery of Social Services(KALALHI-CIDSS) in the Philippines began in2002. Its design is similar to that of KDP , exceptthat community-funded plans are more closelyintegrated with municipal development plans. This partly reflects the country's more evolved decen-tralization process, in which local governments playa more significant role than in Indonesia. The Seila Program in Cambodia is rather differ- ent. 2It began as a postconflict government experi- ment in alleviating poverty through decentralizedsystems for planning, financing, and implementingdevelopment at the province, commune, and vil-lage levels. The program has evolved considerably,and in its second phase (2001-5) has supportedfurther design and implementation of deconcen-tration and decentralization reforms and workedmore closely with locally elected bodies, with fundsflowing through official intergovernmental fiscaltransfer systems. This chapter also highlights a sectoral CDD project to show how they operate. Sectoral CDDprojects generally work within line ministries andprovide block grants to community organizationssuch as school committees, health managementcouncils, and farmer or irrigation organizations,which decide how to use the grant funds. The Cam-bodia Education Quality Improvement Project(EQIP) provides block grants directly to schoolcluster committees for use as they see fit to improveeducational quality (see box 12.1). We chose these case studies for two reasons. First, they represent the latest thinking on CDDdesign and approaches in the East Asia regionand are considered the most successful of theCDD portfolio. While not without significantproblems and challenges, they afford a glimpse ofsome of the trends and issues facing CDD.Second, the CDD projects in these three countriesare intricately linked to their national decentral-ization reforms. Thus, they illustrate concreteways in which CDD projects can interact withand influence reforms within a decentralizedframework. How Does CDD Strengthen the Decentralization Framework? Promoting Civic Participation in Local Planning and Decision Making In theory,decentralization facilitates participation by local populations. In actuality, the legacy of decadesof authoritarian rule and embedded hierarchicalstructures and behavior in many countries subvert256 East Asia Decentralizesbroad-based participation and the idea that people can hold local government officials accountable. Insuch contexts, CDD projects can provide mecha-nisms to accelerate participation and accountabilitythrough broad-based planning, decision making,and implementation. CDD can help design the plan-ning cycle to engage the poor and other marginalizedgroups, thus moving toward more inclusive gover-nance. In most cases, the CDD community planningprocess begins with participatory appraisals thatinclude social mapping, wealth-ranking exercises,and, in Indonesia, separate meetings for women. The local planning process varies from country tocountry. In Indonesia and the Philippines, it takesthe form of a list of development priorities. In thePhilippines, local governments agree to include theCDD list of projects in municipal developmentplans. Activities that appear in those plans qualify forfunding through donor assistance or other sources. Under CDD, decisions on allocating resources occur in a decentralized, participatory manner\u2014incontrast with the first generation of social funds,Community-Driven Development: Decentralization's Accountability Challenge 257 BOX 12.1 CDD Projects in Three East Asian Countries Indonesia: The Kecamatan Development Program (1998-2007)Begun in 1998, the government's KDP aims toalleviate poverty by raising rural incomes,strengthen local government, and communityinstitutions, and improve governance. KDPrecently completed its first phase, funding morethan 50,000 infrastructure and economic activi-ties and benefiting some 35 million poor people.Field studies and audits show that KDP projectsdelivered a broad range of services at lower-than-normal cost with greater community involve-ment. KDP is now entering its second and thirdphases, which emphasize building villagers' tech-nical skills and strengthening local governmentinstitutions as part of the country's overall decen-tralization process. The program encompassessome 28,000 villages\u2014almost 40 percent of thecountry's total. Cambodia: Seila/Rural Investment and Local Governance (RILG) ProjectRILG Project aims to contribute to rural develop-ment and reduce poverty by supporting the pro-vision of priority public goods and services at thecommune level, and to promote good gover-nance by enhancing participation at the com-mune and provincial levels. RILG works throughCambodia's Seila Program, a mechanism formobilizing and coordinating aid that supportsthe government's decentralization and decon-centration reforms. Together, RILG and Seilaprovide grants for rural infrastructure andrelated public goods identified through theplanning process. The two programs also pro-vide technical assistance for strategic studies toinform deconcentration reforms, and to reviewand strengthen the regulatory framework fordecentralization.While the RILG Project began only recently, Seila started in 1996. The first phase (1996-2000)enabled the government to formulate and fullytest in five provinces provincial and communesystems for budgeting, planning, financing, andimplementing development. Seila initially sup-ported elected commune and village develop-ment councils and emphasized participatory localplanning and financing. The program has sinceevolved with the country's deconcentration andlocal election process to work with the 2002elected Commune/ Sangkat Councils. The second phase (2001-5) supports the implementationand further design of decentralization and decon-centration reforms. Cambodia: Education Quality Improvement Program (1999-2004)EQIP aims to develop a model for a participatoryapproach to improving school quality and pursu-ing performance-based management ofresources. The project has two main compo-nents. The first finances grants to provincial com-mittees, quality improvement grants to schoolclusters, and monitoring and evaluation activities.The second component supports the NationalCommittee on Effective Schooling, policy studies,and provincial and district education offices. Philippines: KALAHI-CIDSS Project (2002-6) This project aims to strengthen participation invillage governance and develop communities'capacity to design, implement, and managedevelopment activities that reduce poverty. Theproject was influenced by Comprehensive Inte-grated Delivery of Social Services, the country'sprevious poverty alleviation program, as well asby Indonesia's KDP. The project will encompasssome 5,300 villages in the country's 40 poorestprovinces.which typically relied on external parties at the national level to make such decisions. Forums com-posed of elected community representatives makedecisions at intervillage and subdistrict levels. InIndonesia, quotas ensure that women participate inthe decision-making process, thus broadening thescope of civic participation. Cambodia's Rural Investment and Local Gover- nance (RILG) Project under the Seila Programillustrates the and CDD. Begun in 1996, Seila piloted amodel for decentralized planning, financing, andmanaging development activities at the provinceand commune levels. At the time, the country hadno formal decentralization policy. In its earlystages, Seila supported participatory planning anddecision making through community, village, andcommune development councils, with local plansfunded outside normal government channels. Asdecentralization reforms slowly evolved and com-mune elections were held in 2002, the program wasintegrated into local government institutions andprocesses. Scaled up from an initial five provinces to a nationwide program, the Seila pilot experienceon participatory planning and decision making feddirectly Development Planning\u2014the regulation governing the preparation and imple-mentation of a commune development plan\u2014incorporates lessons from Seila on how to prepare acommune development plan, a commune invest-ment plan, and an annual budget. The regulationand accompanying guideline encourage local gov-ernments to open budget discussions to the public.These guidelines also highlight the need to set upappropriate mechanisms to facilitate the directinvolvement of beneficiaries in the detailed designand supervision of all projects in the communedevelopment plans. 3 In the Philippines, the KALAHI-CIDSS Project is designed to promote community participation anddevelopment within existing government struc-tures. 4Communities and local governments engage in a demand-driven, bottom-up process of planningand problem solving that leads to grants for commu-nity investment programs. The emphasis is on ensur-ing that decision making and management of publicresources are participatory and demand-driven.Local governments play an important role by provid- ing technical services for planning projects, to ensuretheir feasibility. Municipal development plans auto-matically include all the activities selected under thisprocess, and therefore so do the annual budgets oflocal governments, safeguarding the sustainability ofthese investments. These CDD processes are not without their challenges and limitations. First, many struggle tointegrate village and subdistrict planning withplanning at the district and provincial levels. Thesubvillage or village level may not be appropriatefor choosing the location of certain public facilitiesor forms of service delivery, such as health clinicsand schools. \"Supralocal\" or interjurisdictionalcooperation is needed to achieve economies of scaleand pool limited resources. Local planning cannotsupplant the need for improved regional and inte-grated multisector planning. Countries need to bet-ter link small, dispersed investments occurring at community levels with larger investment projects toachieve technological sophistication and economiesof scale. As a second challenge, a community-driven planning process may overlook some needs. Effortsto address violence against women and assistwidows and female heads of household, respond tohealth needs, and conserve the environment oftendo not survive a participatory, competitive commu-nity planning process. Greater advocacy is needed tohighlight concerns such as immunization programs,accompanied by special funding windows, quotas,and vertical programming so the local planning andbudgeting process can address them. Giving Citizens a Voice One of the main apprehensions regarding decen- tralization has been the extent to which local elitesmay dominate local decision making just as easily as\u2014if not more easily than\u2014central authori-ties. Particularly in highly stratified societies, localelites may capture the benefits arising from adecentralized planning and financing system.Dropping funding to provincial or local levelswhere, for decades, people have not been allowedto develop broad civic decision-making institu-tions or accountability mechanisms hardly seemswise. What can be done to counter these inequalities? Decentralization needs to be accompanied by258 East Asia Decentralizesreforms that increase the transparency and accountability of local government. CDD programsbuild on the premise that gradually broadeningparticipation in policy making and resource alloca-tion can enhance accountability and transparencyand improve equity in service delivery. CDD programs encourage citizens to exercise voice and demand accountability and transparencythrough several mechanisms: A strong emphasis on information disclosure and transparency, especially related to project bud- gets, financing, contracting, and procurement.Financial and contract information is discussedpublicly and displayed on village informationboards. In Indonesia's KDP , village committeesmust report back to the general village assemblyat least twice during subproject implementationto discuss progress and financial status. A grievance mechanism (Indonesia and the Philippines) that channels anonymous com-plaints to project authorities and encouragesefforts to address grievances. Strong community monitoring mechanisms. In Indonesia and the Philippines, each villageforms an independent committee responsiblefor overseeing contracts, procurement, finances,and implementation of development projects.These committees must report on financial sta-tus and physical progress at various stages.Provincial journalists and NGOs are also invitedto act as watchdogs over the proper use of publicdevelopment funds. T ogether these mechanismsprovide a system of checks and balances to helpkeep local governments accountable. Studies and preliminary evidence highlight two other features of the CDD process. First, CDDprojects generally include a decentralized financingmechanism that operates more quickly than compa-rable disbursements from line agencies. Second, theservices delivered are cost-effective compared withthe delivery of small-scale works by public agencies. Decentralized Financing Mechanisms The pitfall of many decentralized planning processes worldwide has been a lack of resources toimplement the resulting plans. CDD projects tacklethis problem by providing finances directly fromthe national level to local levels to implementcommunity-identified priority projects. Several CDD case studies, in the region as well as globally,show that one of the main reasons for the popular-ity of CDD projects is that they do in fact disbursefunds quickly. Why did the governments of Indone-sia and the Philippines initially choose a CDDmodel when they had traditional line agency pro-grams to combat poverty at their disposal? Thoseprograms were not disbursing funds fast enoughand were not reaching the poor. In Indonesia, for example, KDP's ability to pro- vide quick, high-volume disbursements of develop-ment funds from the national level straight downto the local level was the main reason that the gov-ernment chose to launch the program in 1997-98.The traditional methods for disbursing fundsthrough line ministries had failed, as shown by thepoor track record of the $1.2 billion national socialsafety net program, which was canceled halfwaythrough implementation because of poor targeting,leaks, and limited effectiveness. Moreover, the direct financing mechanism cleared up decision-making bottlenecks caused bycentral efforts to plan and control activities. KDP'sdisbursement system takes an average of two weeksbetween the time when a village places a requestand when funds arrive in the village account. Evenduring the East Asian financial crisis, KDP dis-bursed funds nearly twice as fast, on average, asagriculture, health, and education projects imple-mented through line departments (see figure 12.1).Bypassing intermediate levels of governmentenabled KDP to move quickly to respond to village-level demands. Furthermore, as these CDD programs evolved, they opened windows of opportunity for additionalfinancing from government and private sources aswell as communities. Under KDP , communitiescontribute 17 percent of project costs, on average,and these contributions often equal or surpass thegrant amount. Among participating districts,40 percent provide matching grants from their ownresources to contribute to capital costs. Community-identified projects do not have to be financed by CDD: officials can establish linkswith many potential sources of financing. Forexample, in the Philippines, all projects identifiedthrough the CDD process are included undermunicipal development funds, so the local budgetcovers recurrent costs. This also helps attract fund-ing from other government and nongovernmental Community-Driven Development: Decentralization's Accountability Challenge 259Cost-Effective Service Delivery Studies of Indonesia's KDP and the Urban Poverty Project, its urban counterpart, as well as preliminaryestimates from KALAHI in the Philippines, showthat infrastructure projects cost some 25 to 56 per-cent less than similar small-scale works delivered byother public agencies. These cost savings are consis-tent with estimated savings from CDD projects inother regions. For instance, a case study of CDDprojects in Brazil cites savings of 30 to 50 percent. All these CDD programs have delivered demand- responsive public investments in infrastructure andeconomic and social activities. Because CDD plan-ning and financing is decentralized, small-scaleinfrastructure projects are usually funded and imple-mented within three to four months. Under the firststage of KDP , villages completed more than 50,000infrastructure, economic, and social subprojects.T echnical reviews and external evaluations show thatthese projects were popular with communities andgovernment officials alike. A sample of infrastruc-ture projects showed that they yielded high internalrates of return ranging from 33 to 83 percent. Theseprojects generated 25 million workdays, with2.8 million villagers gaining short-term employmentthrough labor-intensive works (World Bank 1998).260 East Asia Decentralizes FIGURE 12.1 Project Disbursement in Indonesia by Ratio, Fiscal Years 2000-2 percent Source: World Bank Indonesia disbursement reports.rural dev.

Cambodia's Ministryof Education, Youth, and Sports (MoEYS) hasemphasized decentralization in its EducationStrategic Plan 2001-2005. Projects such asEQIP, as well as several other donor-fundedschool grants and cluster programs, show whatcan happen when governments devolve respon-sibilities and funding to local schools andcommunities. Funded in part by a World Bank credit of US$5 million, EQIP began in 1999 and supportsclusters of schools in three provinces. Theproject allocates grants based on priorities iden-tified through school committees composed ofrepresentatives from communities and eachmember school. The project is highly popularwith participating schools and communities.According to one evaluation:There was widespread enthusiasm for EQIP among those interviewed, and a desire to buildon the progress already made. Decentraliza-tion issues featured prominently. Stakeholderswelcomed the opportunity EQIP provided formaking decisions at local levels. Being able todecide what to purchase for a cluster through acooperative process at that level was greatlyappreciated. It was recognized that the actualprocess of making decisions at provincial,district and cluster levels was developingskills in prioritizing, planning, budgeting andreporting . . . When asked what was the mostimportant achievement of EQIP, the most pop-ular answer was that it gave finances for prior-ity needs in a timely and predictable manner.Enormous value was placed in this achieve-ment. Previously there had been no resourceflow from the MoEYS to schools and little if anyto the provinces. Source: Turner 2002. sources. In Cambodia, under the RILG Project, district integration workshops provide a forum forother government and nongovernmental actors tofund projects identified through the local planningprocess.The national size and scope of these CDD programs have allowed governments to deliver essential publicgoods and services in a demand-responsive waywhile relieving overburdened national and sub-national bureaucracies of the need to manage thou-sands of small village projects and byzantine finan-cial sign-offs at multiple levels. Technical Assistance in Formulating Decentralization Procedures Increasing Public Engagement with Local Governments In both Indonesia and Cambodia, CDD programs evolved as national decentralization reforms beganto play out at local levels. In Indonesia, KDP incor-porated greater roles for district parliaments, mon-itoring and supervision by local governments, andcost-sharing arrangements with district govern-ments. In Cambodia, the Seila Program was adaptedto work through the newly elected Commune/Sangkat Councils in place of the early Commune Development Councils. Financial transfers now flowto Commune/ Sangkat Funds as well as provincial investment funds. The CDD programs in both countries have built on lessons from participatory, decentralized plan-ning and financing to shape decentralization regu-lations. The institutionalization of participatory,transparent mechanisms in decentralization proce-dures and frameworks has been a key aim. Bothgovernments had passed legislation and decreesoutlining decentralization frameworks but werestill formulating implementation guidelines, mak-ing them amenable to community contributions. A further benefit is that national ministries responsible for creating decentralization guidelineshave implemented CDD programs. In Indonesia, theMinistry of Home Affairs, with guidance fromBappenas, the national planning agency, is responsi-ble for issuing the implementing guidelines fordecentralization. In Cambodia, the Ministry ofInterior and the Ministry of Economy and Finance are key members of the Seila Task Force, and the SeilaProgram has provided financial and technicalresources to new departments in these two ministriesthat regulate and support subnational authorities. Drawing on lessons from the first and second phases, the third phase of KDP will assist districtand village authorities in crafting 13 regulations(perdas ) for village autonomy under Decentraliza-tion Law 22. Building on the KDP platform, the Initiatives for Local Governance Reform Project isdesigned to support district policies related toinformation disclosure, procurement, revenue gen-eration, budget planning, and allocation, leading tohigher pro-poor expenditures (World Bank 2004a). Similarly, the Seila Program in Cambodia has channeled five years of experience with participa-tory planning and financing into helping govern-ment working groups complete the country'sdecentralized regulatory framework, draft support-ing guidelines, and revise and strengthen regula-tions. For example, technical advisors from Seilahave advised the government in developing themanual of financial management and procurementprocedures for commune funds. In contrast to Indonesia and Cambodia, where central governments are still formulating decentral-ization reforms and regulations, the Philippines hashad a Local Government Code for some 12 years,and local governments are already well established.From the outset, the KALAHI-CIDSS project hasworked within the decentralization law and engagedwith formal institutions such as the Barangay Development Council and the Municipal Develop-ment Council to make the process for planning andallocating local development resources more par-ticipatory. Furthermore, to strengthen coordina-tion with local governments and enhance sus-tainability, the Philippines project works withmunicipal committees chaired by the mayor andcomposed of the heads of all local departments.Local representatives of national agencies, NGOs,and donor institutions also participate. These mul-tiagency committees meet every two weeks to dis-cuss progress and determine needed contributionsto KALAHI projects, including staff, salaries, and other recurrent costs (World Bank 2002). Conclusions and the Challenges Ahead for CDD Community-driven development projects aim to influence and strengthen local governance, with theintention that the participatory approach will spillover into broader decision-making processes at thecommunity level. For CDD sectoral programs, suchas those in health, education, and water and sanita-tion, the aim is to institutionalize mechanismswhereby users of services can engage in decisionmaking and monitor investments and services. Community-Driven Development: Decentralization's Accountability Challenge 261CDD has improved decentralization frame- works by: Promoting greater civic participation, voice, and accountability in local governance. CDD intro-duces mechanisms for participatory planningand decision making, as well for monitoring and transparency, into the local governance equation. Providing an effective means of service delivery within a decentralized context by deliveringneeded services in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.262 East Asia Decentralizes TABLE 12.1 Points of Local Government Engagement in CDD Projects Indonesia Philippines Cambodia KDP KALAHI-CIDSS Seila EQIP Project implementingagency Laws and regulations Local planning Financing Cofinancing Monitoring and oversight Capacity buildingMinistry of Home Affairs and NationalCoordination Team.

CDD entails challenges, too. As noted, CDD projects are too new to allow definitive statementsabout their overall success or failure. Neverthe-less, preliminary evaluations point to somechallenges ahead, especially in decentralizedenvironments. First, can CDD become an overall development strategy, or will CDD projects provide a relativelynarrow way to fulfill numerous small, discretedevelopment investments? Existing reviews showthat communities can build village roads, watersupplies, schools, and clinics. However, suchreviews do not reveal how village projects will tie inwith efforts to plan road networks, protect water-sheds, train teachers, and supply needed drugs.Experiences in Cambodia and the Philippines sug-gest how to coordinate local government input intodiscrete CDD investments and address recurrentand operational costs, but this area needs moreexploration. Expansion to this higher level requires that CDD programs engage more effectively with sectoralagencies to help them become more demand-driven and responsive. As CDD projects such asSeila and KDP become better established, tech-niques for integrating the CDD platform withhigher-level planning and sectoral agencies becomeclear. As the Cambodia EQIP Project has shown,helping the Ministry of Education, Y outh, andSports move responsibilities for planning andfinancing down to school clusters can yield signifi-cant benefits for schools and communities. Thechallenge will be to strengthen accountability andparticipation in service delivery. Second, can CDD improve links with private sector service providers? CDD projects tap suchsuppliers for construction materials and someforms of specialized technical assistance, but fewhave explored the use of private markets to procurebooks and teachers, qualified health services, andspecialized training. Local procurement of goodsand services sacrifices economies of scale, and iden-tifying qualified service providers in poorly regu-lated professional environments is difficult. Never-theless, some scope for promoting private sectorservice supply may exist. Third, can governments better integrate CDD projects into their budgeting and planning processto address recurrent costs, operations and mainte- nance, and sustainability? As countries graduallyintegrate CDD capital and operating costs intointergovernmental fiscal systems, they need toensure that these systems and financial flows remaintransparent and easily tracked by the public. When Is CDD Appropriate and When Is It Not? Community-driven development programs are not always structures, conducivelocal social environments, and mechanisms thatallow direct fiscal transfers to reach communitiesand be accounted for with reasonable accuracy.CDD projects in postconflict areas, where few ofthese conditions apply, seem to work reasonablywell within limits, but involve significant qualitytradeoffs. Other conditions for success relate to the spe- cific design of each CDD program. KDP assumesthat private markets can provide qualified technicalassistance. Seila assumes that local markets forcontractors are reasonably competitive and canprovide quality services. KALAHI relies on thecompetence of municipal governments. Programsthat cannot assume that such conditions exist mustadjust their design accordingly. A subtle but important risk is that CDD projects may be asked to do more than their design can sus-tain. A good example is the challenge of linkingCDD operations to district planning and budget-ing. The solution lies in complementing CDDapproaches with projects and strategies directedtoward district- and province-level reform, not intransforming CDD operations into two-headedbeasts that must perform both local and districtplanning and budgeting. The need to supplement CDD with a broader reform strategy for local government is fundamen-tal. CDD can be seen solely as a low-cost way toprovide basic infrastructure and services. In certainenvironments, particularly postconflict and transi-tional countries, where virtually all standard sys-tems and normal activities have been disrupted,CDD projects may be the only way to operate. Butfor most countries, CDD will work best if it is onepart of a broader reform strategy intended toimprove the quality and efficiency of governmentservices.Annex: CDD Portfolio Breakdown Global Trends For fiscal years 2001 to 2003, World Bank lending in support of CDD has totaled nearly $2 billionannually, and averaged approximately 11 percent of264 East Asia Decentralizes FIGURE 12A.1 Bankwide CDD Lending Years 2000-3yearly commitment (US$m) Source: World Bank CDD briefing note for Mr. Shengman Zhang, July 14, 2003, SDV.200005001,0001,5002,0002,500 2001 fiscal year2003 20021,027.42,301.3 12A.2 Regional Trends\u2014CDD Fiscal Yearyearly investment (US$m) Africa East Asia andPacificEurope and Central Asia Latin America for Mr. Shengman Zhang, July 14, 2003, SDV.all Bank investments.

The content of the CDD portfolio has been the subject of wide debate within social and human development circles.This chapter adheres to the broad definition used by theWorld Bank's social development network: \"Community-driven development (CDD) gives control of decisions andresources to community groups. These groups often workin partnership with demand-responsive private sector,NGOs, and central government agencies.\" This definition raises two issues. First, who decides how to allocate resources? CDD projects are distinguished fromearlier Social Funds by the fact that local communitiesor local elected bodies make such decisions. The earliergeneration of Social Funds\u2014and even many to this day\u2014involve communities in planning, preparing proposals,and implementing projects. However, Social Fund staffat national or regional levels actually make decisions onproposals. CDD projects, on the other hand, retain decision mak- ing within communities through village-elected forums orelected local government. Thus, for the last several years,Social Funds that do not involve communities in decisionmaking on resources have been considered separate fromthe CDD portfolio. The second issue relates to the role of locally elected governments. Traditionally, CDD projects have focused oncommunity organizations and forums that are not part ofthe formal government decision-making structure. Overthe last two years, however, the World Bank has definedCDD to include both locally elected community organiza-tions and democratically elected government bodies work-ing in partnership with community groups. Thus, debatesabout whether CDD is outside or inside the usual politicalchannels have blurred. 2. Seila is a Khmer word meaning \"foundation stone.\"3.
