Such an epic experience will confirm my connection to and energize my relationship with Spirit, God, Consciousness, Universal Intelligence, Life Force both within and around me. Do I not need sounds, lights, color, images or a major internal shift to declare my spirituality - my experience as a spiritual being? Does this mean I am not AS spiritual as others? I wait patiently for my day of \"anointing\"... Reflective Capacity One of the many gifts of living a long life is to develop what I call the \"reflective capacity\" - the ability to understand the meaning of the incidences and the relationships in our life. The stories we create about the happenings and interactions describe who we are and how we see the world and others in it. Reflections are significant reminders of what IS and what CAN BE. I am aware that who I am as a spiritual being on my human journey becomes more significant for me as I age. Is my reflection on the energy of Spirit - Life Force, God, Consciousness, Universal Intelligence - an invitation to know my life stories more deeply, appreciate their wisdom, and share my learning with others? What about .... The evening when I was seven years of age, laying with my friend Jean on the front lawn of her house. We are describing to each other what might be \"up there\" watching us and keeping us safe. OR noticing we were not as good as we could be? And this one... In my early teens sitting with my Baba, my grandmother. I do not speak Ukrainian. She cannot speak English. We spoke though with our eyes and I felt our hearts connect. I understood her loneliness as I felt she did mine. We were both hurting in our emotional pain. Guido, my grandfather, had left her with my father as a one-year-old to work as a coal miner in Alberta. She and my father joined him 12 years later. Even then, she remained isolated at home with few friends. We connected in our pain while creating a space of peace and empathy. More reflection... [Riding my bicycle in the summer from early morning until dusk. From the Latin \"Spiritus\" meaning breath - I felt the wind blowing on my face and through my hair like the Spirit breathing. I did not know this then; however now, so grateful am I for that closeness to the Universal Breath seeming to guide me forward...](https://thewisdomofworth.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/03/david-marcu-125458.jpg) Further confirmation... Yes, Spirit was present with me in the room of a conference presentation I attended about 10 years ago. I was attracted to the theme of a universal light that shines uniquely in each of us. Leaving the tiered university classroom, I tripped on a step, and fell heavily on my knees. From the loud thud and the attention I got, I was sure both knee caps were broken. Not so! I took a deep breath and felt calm. To this day, I am convinced that the \"fall to my knees\" was a message for me to honor the protective, loving Spirit Energy, present in curious ways. More reflections... Sitting in a cathedral in Germany while music played from both organs at the front and the back. The sound resonated in the vibrating floor boards and came up through my whole body. I closed my eyes and felt a gentle flutter in my heart as the invitation to an awareness of my inner energy connected with that all round. Weeping at the deaths of my father, my mother, my step-son and knowing what sensitivity and compassion mean for me. Moving on in the grief, now knowing the valuable lessons of pain and loss. Blessed with the healing energy that recognizes what connects and supports us. [Satisfying my curiosity with meditation. Almost 40 years ago, I heard co-workers describe this new practice that helped with stress. Yes, I was stressed with a constant fear of rejection, a desire to belong and feel safe. Daily meditation of being in the moment without judgment and appreciating the solitude of silence creates an energy to heal, learn and grow in Spirit.](https://thewisdomofworth.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dingzeyu-li-773.jpg) Current experiences... Sharing conversation now on what it means to age, to relate to the challenges and open to the life-affirming possibilities of advancing years, to be WISE - in the Wonder, Intention, Struggle and Energy of it all. How would it be to know the ageless Energy of Spirit, to use it in the Life journey of giving, receiving and sharing? As I reflect on my life experiences that seemed insignificant at the time, I now see the beauty and truth of the messages that they sent me. All through my life I have been guided. No big \"anointment\" was ever required. The universal energy moves with us in every moment - no matter how big or small that moment may seem. I invite you to notice what I describe as your \"universal mirror\" as it reflects the thoughts, feelings, and actions that either move you forward as you would want or block that movement. Call on your Spirit Energy to clarify and communicate your reflections and their messages. How grateful we are, yes, for this opportunity and its life-affirming possibilities!
