SPOTLIGHTS FACULTY SPOTLIGHT: Stephanie Winn, MD Stephanie Winn founded and is the Clinical Director of the Grady Women's Mental Health Program for women in pregnancy, postpartum and breastfeeding. The clinic began with the opening of 10 Park Place almost ten years ago. Over the years, she has helped train residents, medical student, psychology interns, psychology post-doctorates and physician assistant students in caring for this special population. She also serves as an attending psychiatrist at the Grady Mental Health Clinic. Stephanie was a public school teacher before going into medicine, so she always knew she wanted to continue teaching. In both clinics she has have the privilege of supervising and teaching both medical students and residents. Her passion is in caring for pregnant women and new moms with psychiatric challenges. It is truly rewarding to work with these women because she is caring for two patients. They want nothing more than to become healthy and happy moms, and it is her life's work to help them achieve these goals. Stephanie is an advocate for emotional support animals and in particular dogs. She has also volunteered at animal shelters. She finds it so rewarding to see a person in need of support and unconditional love to connect with a loving animal. She encourages her patients to find these companions. Stephanie spent many years caring for her mother during her late stages of dementia. She feels just as she prepared her for her professional life in many ways, her profession prepared her to have the compassion needed for this role. Stephanie's future goal is to expand the Women's Mental Health Clinic at Grady so it can serve many more women in need. She also endeavors to educate the community about the importance of recognizing and treating psychiatric illnesses in the perinatal period. Stephanie's greatest joy outside of work is having adventures with her family, especially her two young grandsons. She feels she learns about life all over again by experiencing it through their eyes. TRAINEE SPOTLIGHT: Nicholas (Nick) Thompson, MD As a third-year psychiatry resident, Nick Thompson works in psychopharmacology clinics at the VA and Emory, where he supports individuals with mood and anxiety disorders, psychosis and PTSD with medication management. He is also on the psychotherapy track, so he spends a fair amount of time learning and treating patients with different modalities of psychotherapy including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy and existential humanistic therapy. Finally, Nick is a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Chief Resident in the psychiatry residency program. In this position, he is part of creating programming for psychiatry residents and other members of the department to have meaningful discussions about diversity and equity topics, provide opportunities for community engagement, support diversity-related recruitment efforts and convene accountability groups to help residents address implicit biases. Outside of Emory, Nick volunteers for Physicians for Human Rights to conduct psychiatric evaluations and advocate for individuals who are applying for asylum and/or are in ICE detention. Nick most enjoys utilizing different modalities of psychotherapy, as it has helped him understand his patients and their challenges from a variety of perspectives. This has personally made his patient interactions feel much more rich and fruitful, in ways he didn't appreciate when he was just learning mechanisms of medications. He enjoys taking an integrative approach in therapy with his patients to help find the best tool for the patient in front of him to have them reach their highest level of functioning and meet their goals, especially when he uses these therapy principles in his medication management visits. Key highlights of his career trajectory include working with underserved populations, as this is something he highly values and aims to make a central point of his career, so many of his professional highlights thus far have been working with diverse underserved populations. After graduating from college, he worked at the intersection between medicine and public health through the Luce Scholars Program in Cambodia, in which he helped individuals with HIV in rural areas create small businesses to support their livelihood and overall health. After coming back to the US, Nick joined the Grady Trauma Project to be involved in research investigating the risk factors for PTSD among African Americans in the aftermath of trauma. He then went on to complete his MD and MPH at University of Wisconsin-Madison where he participated in the Training in Urban Medicine and Public Health program, which emphasized treatment of underserved urban populations and how to recognize and address the social determinants of health that affected them. He chose to come to Emory for his psychiatry residency training for the opportunity to support a diverse group of urban underserved populations (in particular at Grady) and receive high quality training in both psychopharmacology and psychotherapy. Nick is hoping he can create a career in which he can combine many of his interest areas of psychiatry including consult liaison psychiatry, collaborative care (to help expand access to mental health services in a primary care setting) and individual outpatient treatment and psychotherapy. He also aims to continue treating underserved populations, as well as work with learners and trainees. Outside of the workplace, Nick's three-month-old baby Elijah is giving him a crash course in fatherhood! Besides spending much of his time with Elijah and partner Liz, he also enjoys spending time with other residents in the program and going hiking, playing board games and rock climbing. ADJUNCT FACULTY SPOTLIGHT: Kendle Jenkins, LPC Kendle Jenkins is a psychoanalyst in private practice treating adults with depression, anxiety disorders, relationship challenges, self-esteem and emotional regulation issues, providing analytic treatment, as well as psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychotherapy. She is one of the Co-Associate Directors of the Emory Psychoanalytic Institute and an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the EUPI and a Fellow of the American Board of Psychoanalysis. Since 2016, Kendle has taught classes in Case Conceptualization, Ego Psychology and Technique, Phases of Psychoanalysis and The Clinical Use of Dreams, as well as being a guest lecturer on dreams for the Emory University Psychoanalytic Studies Program. Since 2010 she has served on numerous institute committees and currently the Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy Progression Committee Chair in addition to being one of the Co- Associate Directors of the EUPI. In 2017 - 2019, Kendle served as president of the Atlanta Psychoanalytic Society and as an Executive Coach in the Goizueta Business School Delta Executive Leadership Program. From 2010 - 2012, she coordinated the Movie Mania series, which promoted discussions about psychoanalytic thinking in the community and led a movie mania discussion on the movie The Shape of Water in 2018. Recently, she was awarded the Mickey J. Nardo Excellence in Teaching Award by the EUPI. While Kendle very much enjoys all aspects of being an adjunct faculty member, including teaching and supervising candidates, and participating in administrative decisions for the EUPI, she most enjoys advising EUPI candidates and helping them to conceptualize and navigate their training and career possibilities. Even before Kendle's psychoanalytic training, she devoted a lot of time and energy to studying the meaning of dreams. She has taught numerous workshops on dreams and run several dream groups. In 2020, when everyone was quarantined due to COVID restrictions, she decided to share what she has learned about dreams to help people \"go in\" since they could not \"go out,\" she made a series of YouTube videos to teach dream interpretation to anyone who wanted to learn. The videos teach basic Freudian and Jungian dream theories and ways to apply them to one's own dreams. Lifespan, an organization for senior adults, offered the series as one of their online group activities. Kendle's love of working with dreams continues and she is always looking for new ways to share this fascinating and transformative work with others. STAFF SPOTLIGHT: Amirah Clarke As Project Co-Coordinator for the Nia Project, Amirah Clarke oversees the day-to-day administration, such as serving as the face/voice of the Nia Project for the participants (e.g., send email communications from the Nia team to participants), supervising approximately twenty undergraduate post-baccalaureate research practicum students each semester and assisting the director in writing proposals for grants directly benefitting participants and the program. She serves in an administrative capacity related to research projects focused on interpersonal violence, suicidal behavior and substance abuse in the African American community. Amirah also participates in all aspects of referral, recruitment, measure selection and assessment for a project funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention focused on adverse childhood experiences and suicidal behavior in African American women. She participates in the clinical services offered under the auspices of the Nia Project, such as being the helper for the survivors group, a therapy group focused on patients that have experienced childhood trauma built on the Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation Narrative Therapy (STAIR-NT) model, and co-facilitate a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) group focusing on skill development in the following areas: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness. In addition to Amirah's position as Project Co-Coordinator at The Nia Project, she is also a Graduate Assistant for the Office of Residence Life at Agnes Scott College. In this role, she performs live-in paraprofessional duties for resident assistants, residents of the college and the professional staff of the college. She supervises resident assistants in roommate mediations, hall meetings and emergency support for students. Additionally, Amirah plays a significant role in the life and operations of the residential campus at Agnes Scott by providing staff-level on-call emergency support, student support, facilities management, residence hall programming, resident assistant training and supervision and administrative projects. Amirah most enjoys seeing the growth and healing amongst Nia participants. The knowledge and insight they have about their own journeys is remarkable and being able to witness and facilitate that is an honor itself, and she recognizes not many people get this opportunity in their post-baccalaureate years. Additionally, it is amazing working in such an integrated healthcare team, and she thoroughly enjoys working alongside the team members in all capacities, from team meetings to therapy groups, and of course at the holiday events. Some of the key highlights of Amirah's career trajectory is submitting a paper to Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy. The paper is currently under review, and is titled \"Self-Esteem: Mediator between daily hassles and depressive symptoms in African American women?\" Working alongside other clinicians and research assistants to write this paper only expanded her passion for research in African American women. This thought-provoking research has focused a spotlight on Black women and the everyday struggles they experience and emphasizes that more culturally responsive, accessible, psychosocial and biological interventions should be implemented. It also highlights the need for more funding to be allocated toward providing quality housing for individuals to improve their self-esteem, sense of community and prevent the loss of more lives. Another key highlight is her transition from serving as DBT group helper to a coleader. She loves interacting with participants as they learn mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness skills. Each group she engages in and supervision she attends, Amirah sees her clinical judgement and expertise expanding and finds herself increasingly invested in honing her clinical competence. Amirah is in the process of applying to graduate programs. After earning her PhD, she plans to work in an integrated healthcare setting providing holistic trauma-based interventions to underserved and minority populations with a history of interpersonal trauma. She is eager to be part of these services that employ team-based, client-centered, whole-person approaches to preventative healthcare that aim to improve patients' overall health outcomes and quality of life. She has loved being a member of the Nia team, which emphasizes such a model of care, and has delighted in the positive effects of this approach in Black women's lives. From being a patient herself to interacting with and supporting others in research, clinical and community contexts, Amirah has gained an intricate appreciation of culturally responsive and trauma-informed care. Amirah's interests outside of the workplace include doing yoga and practicing mindfulness through meditation and journaling. She is a huge plant mom and owns close to thirty-five plants, and an avid lover of candles and enjoy spending time with her loved ones. WELCOME NEW FACULTY Kara S.

She also serves as the Site Director for the Emory Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowship since 2012. Prior to starting her new role at Emory Clinic, she was at the VA Medical Center Outpatient Mental Health Clinic as a psychologist and lead of the Mood Disorders/Depression Treatment team for 10 years. During her tenure at the VA, Kara was the founder and leader of the Atlanta VA Family/Couples Services Committee, which aimed to enhance family/couple services across VA and connect providers who have training and/or interest in couples/family work. She also co-created and led the Family/Couples Intervention team, which sought to provide consultation and family/couples services to Veterans and their families.

Her clinical and professional areas of specialization and interest include parenting/family systems; resilience mechanisms in response to complex trauma; program design and quality improvement of treatment delivery; and supervision/training. DISC UPDATES Transgender Day of Remembrance - Erica D Marshall - Lee, PhD, ABPP, Associate Professor Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDOR) is an annual observance on November 20 that began in 1999 as a vigil to honor the memory of Rita Hester, a transgender woman killed in 1998. The vigil, originally coordinated by Gwendolyn Ann Smith, commemorated the transgender people whose lives were lost in acts of anti-transgender violence and eventually became the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance. TDOR is a day to raise awareness about violence and hate crimes against transgender people. 375 transgender people were killed in 2021, 25 more murders than 2020, making 2021 the 'deadliest year' of violence against gender diverse people since records began. The majority of the murders happened in Central and South America (70%) with the most deaths in a single country occurring in Brazil (33% of global deaths). In fact, the number of trans people murdered in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2017 and 2021, a 93% increase in tracked homicides. In 2021, 56 people were killed, compared to 29 reported deaths in 2017. Despite the fact that only 13% of the transgender community is estimated to be Black, Black trans women accounted for nearly three-quarters of the known victims. There has been a call to commit to protect trans people year-round, especially Black transgender women and Trans Women Of Color, and move beyond memorializing on one day. There are a number of ways to observe TDOR: holding vigils, participate in marches supporting the transgender community, attend/create fundraising and awareness, and supporting transgender rights groups. National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month - Erica D Marshall - Lee, PhD, ABPP, Associate Professor National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month originally began in 1976 as Native American Awareness Week and became a month of observance in November by President George HW Bush and Congress in 1990. It is a time to honor and celebrate the rich culture, tradition, history and diversity of Native individuals. Before European settlers came to America, the nation's indigenous population was nearly 10 million. Currently there are 6.79 million Native Americans in the United States according to the US Census Bureau. In the U.S. there are about 574 federally recognized Native American tribes. Native Knowledge 360\u00b0 (NK360\u00b0) provides educational materials inclusive of Native narratives, accurate information and comprehensive histories about Native America. NK360\u00b0offers unique perspectives that challenge assumptions about Native peoples regarding their culture, their contribution to the arts, sciences, and literature, and their role in US and world history. Wellness Committee We would like to thank the co-chairs of the department's wellness committee since its formation in 2017, Wendy Baer, MD and Chanda Graves, PhD.

Refugee and Immigrant Mental Health Contributions In October 2022, the Adjunct Faculty Workgroup sponsored the Third Annual Adjunct Faculty Gathering. Several adjunct faculty members presented their work with the refugee community: Sarah Juul, MD, Yassar Kanawati, MD, Maite Silva, PsyD, and Jane Yates, PhD. Sarah Juul - Sarah presented on her work conducting mental health evaluations for asylum seekers through the Georgia Human Rights Clinic at Emory (and previously with the Atlanta Asylum Network). These evaluations can make a significant difference in the legal outcome for asylum seekers applying to remain in the United States. All mental health professionals can conduct these evaluations, and training is available for anyone interested. If you would like to learn more, the contact information is available online and via email. Jane Yates - As a Clinical Psychologist, and an Adjunct Associate Professor, Jane is associated most closely with the Psychoanalytic Institute. Early in her career as a nurse, she spent two years in Gaza working in a hospital serving Palestinian refugees. This experience was life changing for her and since that time she has had a heart connection with refugees and immigrants. For example, she volunteers through the Clarkston Community Health Center (CCHC), a non-profit clinic whose mission is to provide quality healthcare to those who would not be able to afford it; those who are uninsured or underinsured. It was cofounded in February of 2015 by Dr. Gulshan Harjee (an alumnus of Emory School of Medicine and Internal Medicine Residency, and Dr. Saeed Raees, a Pharmacologist. They founded the clinic after witnessing first-hand the undeniable prevalence of uninsured residents in the Clarkston area who had limited access to medical care. Since its inception, the health center has expanded from providing solely primary medical care, to now providing dental care, specialized women's healthcare, ophthalmology, dermatology, and mental health services. The expansion of services has been made possible by a multitude of volunteers who provide medical and mental health services as well as administrative services. Strong partnerships exist with Emory School of Medicine, Mercer University, Agnes Scott College, Clayton State University, and the University of North Georgia. Jane began volunteering one Saturday per month in the mental health clinic in October of 2021. During the pandemic, patients have been seen in-person with a COVID protocol. She typically sees from 3-to-6 patients for \"talk therapy\" on those days. They experience range of symptoms, diagnoses, and life circumstances. Although a significant number of those she treats are refugees or immigrants, not all of them are. Some live in Clarkston and others live in the wider metropolitan Atlanta area. This presents transportation problems, so when needed and not contraindicated, they may use the telephone. Grady translation services are available to them via telephone, and sometimes family members translate. Both options are less than ideal. Psychiatrists and Advanced Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners provide medication evaluations and regular medication monitoring. Being separated from families-of-origin who still live in one's homeland are frequent areas of concern to our patients. Some have experienced psychological as well as physical trauma. Many have worries about family members who are still in their homeland, especially if there is continuing conflict or experience persecution (e.g., Myanmar, Ethiopia, Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo). Even for those who have been here for years and have adjusted as well as could be expected, employers often pay less than minimum wage and less than what they might pay someone else. Referrals for legal, financial, and housing assistance are often needed. Respect for individual and cultural difference is important to keep in mind, especially as related to cultural traditions, religion, family relationships, work, and women's issues. The work is very rewarding to Jane and to others who volunteer their services. Clinical approaches often include more supportive features, psychoeducational elements and referrals to community services. Her experience is that those whom they serve are very appreciative and despite the infrequency of treatment encounters, are motivated for treatment and engage in a therapeutic alliance. Mental health clinics are held on the third Saturday of each month 9 am to 2 pm; first and third Tuesdays of each month from 1 pm to 3 pm; and Wednesdays from 9 am to 1 pm. If you are interested in volunteering your services please email your interest directly to the following address. Yassar Kanawati, MD - Since the beginning of the Uprising in Syria, in March/2011, it was confronted with utter violence and brutality, which caused sheer suffering and pain among the Syrians. Most of the families have suffered tremendously and about half of the Syrian population had to leave Syria to be safe. Those refugees have settled in neighboring countries to Syria. Yassar established with the assistance of SAMS (Syrian American Medical Society) which is an American medical non-profit organization, several Psychosocial clinics for the Syrian refugees in Amman/ Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and inside Syria for the displaced population. Services provided at those clinics include: In-home assessments of vulnerable households to determine the most critical health, MHPSS, and GBV (Gender Based Violence) needs. Referrals for beneficiaries to receive essential medical, legal, and social services Medication management by a psychiatrist Individual therapy sessions with a qualified psychologist Group sessions on specific topics for those struggling with Gender-based violence awareness raising sessions (e.g., child marriage, Psychoeducation workshops on a range of informative topics for the general population. Capacity building trainings for staff at the Ministries of Health and Social Development Capacity building trainings for staff at local community-based organizations. Maite Silva - In the state of Georgia, approximately 97% of applications for individuals seeking asylum are rejected; however, individuals with attorneys who are able to advocate for mental health and country condition experts to get involved in a case are far more likely to be granted asylum despite the odds. As mental health professionals, we have the opportunity to help the Court understand an individual's background history and context as well as their projected life circumstances in the event that they should be deported.
