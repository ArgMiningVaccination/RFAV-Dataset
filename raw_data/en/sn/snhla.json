As a medical intuitive and scientist he began collecting both intuitive information and extensive scientific and medical research about the nature of long-haul Covid. Integrating his intuitive impressions with other protocols and support group success stories, he developed this comprehensive healing guide for successful recovery options from long Covid. The author discusses the primary symptoms and predispositions of long Covid and outlines the basic steps for dealing with each of them, including brain fog, tinnitus, loss of smell and hair, debilitating headaches, hormonal dysregulation, immune malfunction, limbic system dysfunction, gut issues, mental instability, sleeplessness, and intolerance to certain foods. Backed up by more than 350 scientific references, he presents medicines and methods for healing long Covid, ranging from pharmaceutical, herbal, and homeopathic remedies to breathwork practices, detox therapies, lymph drainage exercises, gut biome restoration, neuroplasticity retraining, immune modulation, and shamanic techniques as well as meditations and mantras for calming the limbic system and the PTSD that can accompany chronic illness. Detailing the art of \"intuitive access,\" the author teaches how to discover your own unique remedies and presents a guide for incorporating these intuitive therapies with modern medical treatments and other healing strategies. He also explores the deeper significance of disease and how the \"disease\" may be teaching us something greater: a way to reclaim our power.
