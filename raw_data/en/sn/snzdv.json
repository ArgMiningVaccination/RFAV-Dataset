Personal information includes, but is not limited to: (a) social security number; (b) name; (c) contact information; (d) driver's license number; ( e) financial account numbers; (f) medical or health information; (g) state or fed eral tax information; or (h) state identification card number. Indiana Navigators and AOs must abide by the Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 19 of 291 IDOI privacy and security agreements to ensure the confidentiality and protection of consumers' personal information. 38. Privacy and Security Agreement refers to either the Indiana Navigator Privacy and Security Agreement or the Indiana Application Organization (AO) Privacy and Security Agreement (two separate documents ) published by the Indiana Department of Insurance ( IDOI ), by which all Indiana Navigators and AOs must comply. The agreement defines what constitutes a consumer's \"personal information\" and establishes the privacy and security standards and procedures that all Indiana Navigators and AOs must follow in order to protect a co nsumer's personal information. As part of the application pr ocess for Indiana Navigators a nd AOs, the Indiana Navigator and AO must sign and submit the agreement to the I ndiana Department of Insurance . 39.

State -Based Marketplace is a health insurance m arketplace developed and operated by a state to make qualified health plans (QHPs) available to qualified individuals or qualified employers in accordance with the Patient Protecti on and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, or ACA) . Indiana does not follow this marketplace model, but rather operates as a Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM, or Federal Marketplace) at healthcare.gov . C. Introduction to Consumer Assistance When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in 2010, it not only introduced many of the changes coming to Medicaid and private insurance marketplaces, but also introduced the concept of navigators. Navigators are individuals or entities who serve as unbias ed, knowledgeable resources to Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 20 of 291 help reduce consumer confusion about options for healthcare coverage through outreach, educati on, and enrollment . In State-based Marketplace states, navigators are selected, funded, traine d, and monitored by the state. In Federally -facilita ted Marketplace s (FFMs) and Partnership Marketplaces , navigators are instead selected, funded, trained, and monitored by the federal government. In addition to federal Navigator s, states may have a variety of other consumer assistants, including non- Navigator Assistance Personnel , Certified Application Counselors (CACs ), Authorized R epresentatives , presumpt ive eligibility (PE) Qualified Providers , insurance brokers and agents , and others that may be nam ed and defined by the state. It is possible that not all of these consumer assistants will exist in every state . The requirements for certification of different consumer assistant s may vary fro m state to state based on the m arketplace model and specific policy o ptions the state has selected. For example, all m arketplaces (regardless of the model) are requir ed to have n avigators that meet the federal definition, but each state may choose to implement additional standards for n avigators , as long as those additional state -specific requirements do not prevent the implementatio n of the federal requirements. Another example of consumer assistant variation between states is that of non-Navigator Assistance Personnel , which are required for states that have chosen a Partnership Marketplace model, and are optional in State -based Marketplace states and Federally -facilitated Marketplace s. The similarities and differences between these consumer assistants and the roles they play in Indiana's Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) will be explained in greater detail in this chapter . D. Federally -Mandated Consumer Assistants There are three prima ry types of federally -mandated consumer a ssistants offering outreach, education, and enrollment assistance to consumers : federal Navigator s, Certified Application Counselors (CACs) , and non-Navigator Assistance Personnel . While these entities have many of the same roles and responsibilities, there are so me subtle differences explained on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) website at www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs -and-Initiatives/Health -Insurance - Marketplaces/assistance.html . Additional information about the different consumer assistants can also be found in the following sections. 1. Federal Navigator s a. Definition and Purpose of Federal Navigator s Of all of the consumer assista nce types, federal Navigator s (a term that can refer to both individuals and organizations) have been the most th oroughly -defined. Established under the Section 1311(i) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA) (42 U.S.C. 18031(i) ) and 45 CFR 1 55.210 , this type of consumer assistant was designed to provide unbiased and accurate education, outreach, and insurance enrollment assistance on a marketplace . The ACA began by laying out basic roles and requirements for these consumer assistants, and fur ther guidance has continued to define the title. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 21 of 291 b. Federal Navigator Roles and Responsibilities The original ACA text prescribed a minimum number of types of organizations to be represented as federal Navigator s in each m arketplace ( see Table 1 ), as well as the primary duties they must fulfill in order t o be federal Navigator s (see Table 2 ). The ACA also established basic training guidelines, stating that the training was to ensure, among other things, competency to address the needs of underserved and vulnerable populations (including emphasis on accessibility for a variety of cultures, languages, and types of disabilities), eligibility and enrollment procedures, the range of public progra ms and qualified health plan (QHP) options available, and proper handling of tax data and personal information. In addition to these federal requirements for federal Navigator s, the ACA introduced state authority to establish state licensing , certification , or other standar ds, regardless of the m arketplace model selected . Table 1: Possible Types of Federal Navigator s Community and c onsumer -focused nonprofit groups Trade, industry , and professional associations Commercial fishing industry organizations, ran ching and farming organizations Chambers of commerce; unions Resource partners of th e Small Business Administration Licensed agents and brokers Other public or private entities that meet the requirements ( i.e., Indian tribes, tribal organizations, u rban Indian organizations, and s tate/local human service agencies) Source s: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010), Section 1311(i) Navigators, 42 U.S.C. 18031(i) Code of Federal Regulations, Navigator Program Standards, 45 CFR 155.210 . Table 2: Primary Duties of Federal Navigator s Comply with non -discrimination standards Demonstrate relationships/potential relationships with qualified health plan ( QHP )-eligible populations Maintain expertise in eligibility, enrollment, and program specification and conduct public education activities to raise awareness about the Exchange Provide information and services in a fair, accurate, and impartial manner Facilitate selection of QHP Provide referrals for enrollees with a grievance, complaint, or question Make consumers aware of the tax implications of their enrollment decisions Provide information about costs of coverage Inform consumers that assistance can result in eligibility determination for insurance affordability programs Assist consumers with applying for premium tax credits (PTC) and cost -sharing reductions (CSR) Sources: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010), Section 1311(i) Navigators, 42 U.S.C. 18031(i) Code of Federal Regulations, Navigator program standards, 45 CFR 155.210 . c. Becoming a Federal Navigator In order to be considered a federal Navigator - and thus be held to the standards and requirements listed above - organizations or individuals in Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) or Partnership Marketplace states must apply and be selected to receive cooperative agreement funds from the Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 22 of 291 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ). The federal Navigator coop erative agreement application i s available at www.grants.gov1 and must be submitted by the deadline stated for the year in order to receive consideration. CMS notified applicants of their selection on September 2, 2015. The amount of the award varies by state and by applicant, as each Federally -facilitated and Partnership state is eligible for a different award total, based on the number of uni nsured residents in the state. 2015 Navigator grants were awarded through September 1, 2018 \u2014a three year project period . Once approved to receive the CMS federal Navigator designation and grant funding, federal Navigator s must complete the CMS training a nd certification requirements. The CMS training and presentations for federal Navigator s, as well as Certified Application Counselors (CACs), can be found on CMS's . While other individuals and organizations may perform the same functions as a federal Navigator , they will only be considered federal Navigator s in FFM or Partnership states if they receive the funding and certification .2 Other comparable entities ( i.e., non-Navigator Assistance Personnel) may be held to identical role and responsibility requirements and may also receive compensation for the consumer assistance work they perform (except CACs - they cannot collect compensation) , but as they have not received the federal Navigator funding, they are considered different types of consumer assistant s. d. Federal Navigator s Serving Hoosiers - State Requirements In addition to meeting any federal training a nd certification requirements, federal Navigator s serving Hoosier consumers are also required to fulfill the certification and registration requirements of Indiana Application Organi zatio ns (AOs) and Indiana Navigato rs discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Federal and s tate training and certification requirements are not interchangeable. In order to operate as a navigator in the state of Indiana, a n individual who is a federal Navigator must also become a certified Indiana Nav igator and an entity that is a federal Navigator must also become a registered Indiana Application Organization (AO) . While the federal Navigator program is an optional program for entities and individuals to participate in, in order to provide application and enrollment assistance in a qualified health plan ( QHP ) through the Federal Marketplace (www.healthca re.gov ) or in an Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) , entities must be registered as AOs and individuals must be certified as Indiana Navigators. 2. Certified Application Counselors a. Definition and Purpose of Certified Application Counselors Like the federal Navigator program, the ACA requires marketplaces to establish a Certified Application Counselor (CAC) program to assist consumers through unbiased and accurate education and application assistance . CAC organizations apply to and are designated by the marketplace , and those organizations are responsible for training their staff and volunteers as individual CACs . Organizations may apply to 1 See also https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs -and-Initiatives/ Health -Insurance -Marketplaces/assistance.html for more information on Federal Navigator funding opportunities and a lists of past recipients 2 The selection and funding process may differ in states with a State -based Marketplace, as the states exercise fu ll oversight of the program. However, while the selection and funding process may differ, the basic minimum duties are the same across all states. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 23 of 291 become CAC organizations through the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) websit e at https://marketplace.cms.gov/technical -assistance -resources/assister -programs/cac.html . Similar to federal Navigator s, in Federally -facilitated Market place (FFM) states like Indiana, CAC organizations and their individual CACs receive train ing and certifi cation materials from the federal government (CMS). CAC organizations are monitored by the federal government and are responsible for monitoring the in dividual CACs they train and certify . Participation in both the federal Navigator and CAC programs are optional. Individuals and organizations are not required by federal law to be certified as federal Navigator s or CACs in order to provide consumer health coverage education and application assistance . In Indiana, individuals wishing to participate in either of these programs must do so through a federally -designated organization, as the FFM only designates organizations and not individuals. Unlike federal Navigator s, CAC organizations do not receive federal grant awards to act as CAC organizations and are not required to provide public education and outreach services to the same extent as federal Navigator s. b. Certified Application Counselors - Roles and Responsibilities Federal rules have prescribed the primary duties that CACs must fulfill (see 45 CFR 155.225 ). CAC primary duties include all of the following (see Table 3 ): Table 3: Primary D uties of Certified Application Counselors To provide information to consumers about the full range of QHP options and insurance affordability programs for which they are eligible. To assist consumers in applying for coverage in a QHP through the Marketplace and for insurance affordability programs. To help to facilitate enrollment of eligible individuals in QHPs and insurance affordability progr ams. Disclose to consumers any relationships the CAC or sponsoring CAC organization has with QHPs or insurance affordability programs, or other potential conflicts of interest.

Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 24 of 291 c. Becoming a Certified Application Counselor In order to be considered a CAC organization, organizations in a FFM or Partnership Marketplace state must apply and be designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) as a CAC organization. Organizations may apply via CMS's website at https://marketplace.cms.gov/technical - assistanc e-resources/assister -programs/cac.html . Other organizations and individuals may perform the same functions of a CAC, but they will only be considered a CAC if they receive the designation. Standards for training and certification are available for indiv idual staff and volunteers working on behalf of designated CAC organizations. Marketplace -approved training for CACs must cover qualified health plan ( QHP ) options available to eligible consumers, insurance affordability programs, eligibility, and benefits rules and regulations governing all insurance affordability p rograms operated in the state. CMS training and presentations for federal Navigator s and CACs may be found through CMS's To become certified as CACs, CA C applicants must do each of the following (see Table 4 ): Table 4: Requirements for Designation as Certified Application Counselor Complete Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) -approved training and pass all FFM - approved certification examinations. Disclose to the designated CAC organization, or to the FFM if directly certified by the FFM , and to potential applicants , any relationships the CAC or sponsoring CAC organization has with QHPs or insurance affordability programs , or other potential conflicts of interest . Comply with privacy and security standards and applicable authentication and data security standards. Agree to act in the best interest of the consumers assisted. Either directly or through an appropriate referra l to a federal Navigator or non -Navigator assistance personnel, or to the FFM call center, provide information in a manner that is accessible to individuals with disabilities. Enter into an agreement with the designated CAC organization regarding complianc e with federal standards.

Certified Application Counselors Serving Hoo siers - State Requirements Federal and s tate registration, training, and certification requirements are not interchangeable, and designated CAC organizations must also be registered as Application Organizations ( AOs) with the State of Indiana and certifie d individual CACs serving Hoosier consumers must also fulfill Indiana Navigator certification requirements under Indiana Code 27 -19 and 760 IAC 4 (see guidelines on IDOI website at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm ). Indiana AO registration and Indiana Navigator certification requ irements are outlined in the Application Organizatio n section and Indiana Navigato r section later in this chapter. While the Federal CAC program is an optional program for entities and individuals, in order to provide application and enrollment Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 25 of 291 assistance through the Federal Marketplace or Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) a pplication , in the state of Indiana, entities must be registered as AOs and individuals must be certified as Indiana Navigators. 3. Non -Navigator Assistance Personnel a. Definition and Purpose of Non -Navigator As sistance Personnel Non -Navigator Assistance Personnel has been called many different things, starting as an \"assister\" in the ACA , then re -named \"in -person assister\" in CMS guidance3, occasionally referred to as \"in-person counselor,\" and fin ally designated \"non -Navigator Assistance Personnel\" in the CMS April 2013 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and subsequent final rule . In spite of the changing names, there has been a relatively consistent expec tation for the role this group serve s. Intended to exist in Partnership Marketplace states, this group is to be a consumer assistance program developed by the state to c omplement the federal Navigator program while remaining \"distinct and apart from the Navigator program .\" CMS describe s the non-Navigator Assistance Personnel program as a way for state s to be creative in their management of state -specific consumer assistance needs while adhering to the same standards and requirements ( e.g., meeting conflict of interest standards, cultural and linguistic standards, access standards for persons with disabilities, training topics, etc.) applied to federal Navigator s. In spite of the similarity in training topic standards , the January 2012 guidance from CMS states that non-Navigator Assistance Pers onnel should also coordinate with the federal Navigator s to avoid duplication of efforts in consumer assistance. Although non-Navigator Assistance Personnel will share training and a mission of consumer education, outreach, and enrollment assistance with federal Navigator s, the true size, scope, selection, and state -specific components of this program will vary by state . While it was originally discussed solely in the context of Partnership Marketplace states, the non - Navigator Assistance Personnel optio n is also extended to State-based Marketplace states that have such a program funded through federal Excha nge Establishment grant funds. As State-based Marketplace states are restricted from using Exchange Establishment grant funds to pa y for their federal ly-mandated N avigator programs, the development of the non -Navigator Assistance Personnel option allows more states to utilize federal funds for consumer assistance efforts. CMS has issued guidance that non -Navigator Assistance Personnel will not be availa ble in states that have chosen the FFM model , as Indiana has . b. Non -Navigator Assistance Personnel Roles and Responsibilities While the specific roles and responsibilities of non -Navigator Assistance Personnel may vary by state, the general role of all non-Navigator Assistance Personnel is to provide consumer education and support in the insurance affordability program eligibility and enrollment process. 3 See \"Guidance on the State Partnership Exchange,\" Center of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) (Jan. 3, 2013) , https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact -Sheets -and-FAQs/Downloads/partnership - guidance -01-03-2013.pdf Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 26 of 291 c. Becoming Non -Navigator Assistance Personnel The process of becoming non -Navigator Assistance Personnel will vary by state, but their federal training standards and requirements will be the same as those of federal Navigator s. d. Non -Navigator Assistance Pers onnel serving Hoosiers - State R equire ments Currently, Indiana does not anticipate the development of a non -Navigator Assistance Personnel program, as it is not a Partnership Marketplace state and is not receiving federal funds to establish such a program. As a result, the individuals most likely to be designated for this role will be in other states. If out-of-state non-Navigator Assistance Personnel also serve Indian a residents , Indiana requires that these out-of-state consumer assistants also meet Indiana Navigator certification and Application Organization (AO) registration standards. The specific process for registration of AOs and certification of Indiana Navigators will be reviewed in the Indiana Application Organizatio n section and Indiana Navigato r section to follow . E. State of Indiana - Roles and Responsibilities with Consumer Assistance There are federal training and certification requirements for federally -designated consumer assistants (e.g., federal Navigator s and Certified Application Counselor s (CAC s)), but these requi rements do not include the state -specific policy and operational changes taking place in the Medicaid and privat e and federal insurance market s in Indiana. In order to provide a basic and standard understanding of these state -specific programs and markets, the State of Indiana has developed the Indiana Navigator certification and Appl ication Organization (AO) registration . With an understanding of how these insura nce affordability programs work in the state, Indiana Navigators and AOs will be better -prepared to assist Hoosier consumers in understanding their health coverage options. This certification and registration creates new roles and responsibilities for state agencies, as well as organizations and individuals helping consum ers apply for health coverage. These responsibilities surround the development of the certification and reg istration, its day -to-day operations, and the monitoring and oversight of certified Indiana Navigators and registered Application Organizations. Further information on the Indiana Navigator certification an AO registration proce sses can be found on the In diana Department of Insurance (IDOI) website at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm . 1. State Role in the C ertification /Registration and R e-certification /Re -registration Processes The Indiana Department of Insurance ( IDOI) plays a primary role in the initial certification and annual rene wal process es, as it receive s and review s all Indiana Navigator and AO initial applications and annual renewal applications , found on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm . The IDOI also developed the initial and annual renewal applications and navigator examination in consultation with the Family and Social S ervices Administration (FSSA). Indiana Navigat or precertification education (PE) and continuing education (CE) course providers , criminal background check s, Conflict of Interest d isclosu re forms , and Privacy and Securi ty agreements are also assess ed by the IDOI for po tential disqualifying events. One primary focus of the Indiana Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 27 of 291 Navigator certification and AO registration process is consumer protection, therefore the state will scrutinize any information or situation that may jeopardize Hoosier consumers. a. State Monitoring and Oversight The state will rely largely on two primary mechanisms for monitor ing Indiana Navigators and AOs: complaints an d internal tracking. Complaints from consumers or their family members, other individuals or organizations, or other state agencies , will trigger an I DOI investigation of the incident. Complaint forms can be completed either online or printed from IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2552.htm . Internal tracking of health coverage application submissions will also be a way for the state to monitor the quality of the applications submitted with Indiana Navigator and AO assistance . Approved Indiana Navig ators and AOs will be issued unique certification number s to use on all application s for health coverage with w hich they assist . The quality of the health coverage applications will be particularly important for hospitals qualified to perform more robust presumptive eligibility (PE) assessments, as they will be held to state quality standards in order to retain th e ability to assess PE for Medicaid. See the Hospital Presumptive Eligibility section for more information about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) provisions that allow hospitals to make PE determinations. b. State Enforcement Actions As an Indiana Navigator or AO, there are certain things that an individual or organization can and cannot do, as defined by Indiana laws and regulations, the Conflict of Interest Policy , and the Privacy and Security Agreements. If an Indiana Navigator or AO violates an established rule or standard issued by the state, the state has a number of en forcement actions it may take. Those enforcement actions include one or more of the following : Reprimand, Civil penalty, Probation, Suspension, Temporary revocation, Permanent revocation, and/or Cease and desist order. These enforcement actions will vary based on the severity of the incident and are at the discretion of the Commissioner of Insurance in consultation with the Secretary of the Family and Social Services Administration. 2. Indiana Navigator and Application Organization Requirements for Completing Certification and Registration In order to maintain an active registration or certification , all Application Organizations ( AOs) are required to renew their registration each year, and all Indiana Navigators are required to complete continuing education (CE) requirements and renew their certif ication application each year. The Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 28 of 291 processes and applications for annual renewal can be ac cessed via IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm . Failure to complete these renewal requirements will result in the termination of registration or certification. Indiana Navigators and AOs are given a late period for the thirty (30) days following their license expiration date. During this time they may complete the renewal process and pay a higher renewal fee in order to renew the registration or certification. I f the individual or organization fails to renew within the late period, that individual or organization will need to reapply as a new Indiana Navigator or AO and complete all of the initial application steps. Federally -designated Navigators and Certified Application Counselors (CACs) are requir ed to complete the Indiana Navigator certification and AO registration requirements in add ition to federal requirements through the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). These consumer assistants will be responsible for meetin g federal re quirements, and failure to do so may make the consumer assistants subject t o federal enforcement actions. The failure to meet state requirements will not only result in potential enforcement action in the state, but may also have consequences with r egard t o federal certification. a. Requirements in State Legislation Within Indiana Code 27 -19 there are lists of required and prohibited actions to which Indiana Navigato rs and AOs must adher e. Those items are detailed in the following table ( see Table 5): Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 29 of 291 Table 5: Required and Prohibited Actions by Navigator s and Application Organization s Required Actions Prohibited History Prohibited Actions Complete Continuing Education requirements Disclose all conflicts of interest to the Commissioner during application and for any conflicts arising after application Comply with administrative or court order imposing child support obliga tion Pay state income tax or comply with administrative or court order directing payment of state income tax Inform IDOI of change in legal name or address Verify that each associated Indiana Navigator has been certified and not committed any act that woul d be grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation Holds/held an insurance producer license, Indiana Navigator certification, AO registration, or equivalent license, certification, or registration that has been denied, suspended, or revoked Conviction of felony or ot her crime determined by IDOI in consultation with FSSA Admission or conviction of unfair trade practice or fraud in the business of insurance Provides incorrect, misleading, incomplete, or materi ally untrue information in the application Obtains or attempts to obtain license, certification, or registration through misrepresentation or fraud Violates: o Insurance law or regulation, o Subpoena or order of Commissioner, o Rule of federal Marketplace, o Rule adopted under IC 27 - 19-3-3(d), and/or o ACA and regulations developed under ACA Intentionally misrepresents terms of actual/proposed insurance contract or application Uses fraudulent, coercive, or dishonest practices, or demonstrates incompetence or untrustworthiness in acting as Indiana Navigat or or AO Cheats on navigator examination Receives consideration from health insurance issuer in connection with enrollment of individual into a health plan Sour ce: Indiana General Assembly (2013) , Indiana Code 27 -19; see also 760 IAC 4 b. Consequences for Not M eeting Requirements For Indiana Navigators and AOs that fail to meet s tate requirements, by either failing to do what they are required to do or by doing what they are prohibited from doing, there is a range of possible enforcement actions the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) may take. Those actions are detailed in the following table ( see Table 6): Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 30 of 291 Table 6: Possible IDOI Enforcement Actions against Navigators and Application Organizations Enforcement Action Implementation Reprimand The IDOI may notify the Indiana Navigator and/or AO of a potential issue that requires entity application and behavior modification. If the Indiana Navigator and/or AO makes appropriate modifications, further enforcement action may not be needed. Levy a civil penalty The IDOI may impose fees for requirement violations. The fee amounts and conditions under which they are issued may vary based on the severity of the case. Suspend certification The IDOI may determine that a violation is severe enough to merit the temporary or permanent suspension/revocation of certification/registration. During the time in which a certification or registration is suspended or revoked, an individual or organization is not to act as an Indiana Navigator/Application Organiza tion. If the violation is believed to be a risk for consumers and the Indiana Navigator and/or AO has shown that it intends to act in spite of the suspension/revocation, the IDOI may also need to issue a cease and desist order. Failure to comply may then have other financial and litigious implications. Revoke certification for a limited time Revoke certification permanently Issue cease and desist order Source: Ind iana General Assembly (2013) , Indiana Code 27 -19; see also 760 IAC 4 F. State -certified Consumer Assistance Not all organizations and individuals working with Hoosier consumers are subject to the state laws regarding Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations (AOs) . The following table (see Table 7 ) may help clarify what activities and designations require an individual or organization to receive th ese state designation s. 1. Who needs to be certified as an Indiana Navigator or Application Organization? Based on the activities one perform s, an individual or organization may need to be certified as an Indiana Navigator or registered as an Application Organization with the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI). To help determine whether an individual or organization needs to obtain the certification or registration, an individual or organization may r efer to the followin g table (see Table 7 ).

Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 32 of 291 2. Application Organizations a. Application Organization Roles and Responsibilities Application Organizations (AOs) , established under Indiana Code 27 -19-2-3, are organizations that have employees and/or volunteers assist ing Hoosier consumers to complete health coverage applications fo r the Feder ally-facilitated Marketplace (FFM) or state -based health coverage programs (e.g., Medicaid, Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0), Children's Health Insurance Plan (CHIP )). They are defined in Indiana Code 27 -19 and 760 IAC 4 , which also establishes the standards and re quirements of AOs, including registration and reporting requirements with the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) . Examples of AOs may include: hospitals, health centers, community -based social service agencies, and Medicaid Enrollment Centers. Organizations that have been selected and funded as federal Navigator s, or designated as federal Certified Application Counselor (CAC) organizations, are also included in the definition of Application Organizations. In order for AOs to be in compliance with Indiana state law, AOs must do each of the following : (1) Register with the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) . (2) Be in good standing with the Indiana Secretary of State (SOS) . (3) Renew registration with the IDOI annually . (4) Abide by all state reporting , conflict of interest, privacy and security, and other standards . Application Organizations have a number of options when it comes to the application, training, and certification process for associated Indiana Navigators. For example, AOs may help their associated Indiana Navi gators financially by helping to cover the cost of the application , background check, education, and navigator examination fee, or it may offset costs by performing a criminal background check or by offering pre-licensing education (PE) internally instead of having the Indiana Navigator applicant utilize a third party vendor for training. Details of requirements and responsibilities for AOs as well as optional activities are detailed in the following table (see Table 8 ): Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 33 of 291 Table 8: Requi rements and Responsibilities of Applicant Organizations Requirement Option Application4 Register with the IDOI (complete online application and pay nonrefundable application fees) Be in good standing with the Indiana Secretary of State Complete and submit the AO Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form and AO Privacy and Security Agreement Disclose any actual or pot ential conflict of interest defined by Conflict of Interest Policy Submit contact list of each physical location o f the AO , if more than one location Have n o prohibited conflict of interest Designate a lead Indiana Navigator Report all associated Indian a Navigators working on the AO's behalf Perform criminal background check on individual Indiana Navigator(s) Pay application fee on behalf of Indiana Navigator(s) Pre-certification Education (PE) Attest that all individual Indiana Navigators have completed pre-certification education (PE) Become an approved Navigator pre -certification education (PE) provider5 with IDOI and provide PE training to Indiana Navigator s IDOI Navigator Examination 6 Attest that all individual Indiana Navigators have passed the Indiana Navigator certification examination Pay for the certification exam ination on behalf of each Indiana Navigator Annual Continuing Education (CE) and Renewal7 Complete annual online renewal application and p ay non -refundable renewal application fee Complete and submit Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form , if a new conflict of interest has arisen sin ce last application Disclose any new actual or potential conflict of interest ( as defined by the Conflict of Interest Policy ) not previously disclosed Disclose additional or deletions to associated Indiana Navigators within 30 d ays of a change Submit updated contact list of each physical location of the AO, if more than one location Abide by all other state reporting, conflict of interest, and privacy and security standards Become a certified Navigator continuing education (CE) provider8 with IDOI to provide CE to Indiana Navigator s Pay renewal application fees on behalf of Indiana Navigators Sour ce: Indiana General Assembly (2013) , Indiana Code 27 -19.

Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 34 of 291 b. Becoming an Application Organization A list of steps and requirements for submitting an initial or renewal Application Organization (AO) application is posted on the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) website at www. in.gov/idoi/2823.htm . An organization with one or more physical locations may submit one initial online AO application and annual renewal application , pay one nonrefundable application and annual renewal fee, submit one AO Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form and one AO Privacy and Security Agreement for the organization when initially applying and renewing registration each year . An organization with multiple locations must also submit to the IDOI the name, address, telephone, email and/or website, and c ontact person for each physical location within the Application Organization. The organization may also include all counties a particular location covers to be included on the Indiana state healthcare reform website at www.in.gov/healthcarereform/2468.htm . There are some organizations that assist consumers with health coverage applications that would not need to become Application Organizations. This may be the ca se for two primary reasons: (1) if the organization does not meet the definition of an AO under Indiana Code 27 -19 and 760 IAC 4 or is exuded under the law because it only provides a ssistance in a limited capacity; or (2) if the organization cannot become an AO because it has a prohibited conflict of interest defined by the Conflict of Interest Policy for Navigators and Application Organizations . An organization might fall into the first category if it only provides general information about health coverage applications and not actual application assistance. For example, social service agencies that provide consumers with information on where to go to assess eligibility and enroll in Medicaid or health plans , may not need to register as Application Organizations. The law also provides exclusions for certain organizations , such as state agencies, or employees that do only presumptive eligibility (PE) determinations or submit Medicaid applications as an Authorized Representative (AR) through the AR agreement with the Indiana Family & Social Services Administration (FSSA). An organization might fall into the second category if it receives compensation from health insurance issuers for consumer enrollment into health plans . For example, insurance agencies that receive compensation from health issuers when their agents enroll c onsumer s into health plans would not register as Application Organizations . i. Becoming an Application Organization - Online Application If an organization meets the definition of an Application Organization (AO) under Indiana Code 27-19 and 760 IAC 4 , it will register with the state by filing an online application with the Indiana Departm ent of Insurance (IDOI) at www.in.gov/idoi/2825.htm . The application consists of questions about the organization and its activities , its owner(s), and it 's associated Indiana Navigators. An authorized representative of the organization will: (1) provide contact in formation and other identifying information for the organization; ( 2) designate a designated/ responsible /lead Indiana Navigator9 to serve as the primary contact for the organization ; (3) provid e the names of those individuals who have 9 While the number of associated Indiana Navigators may grow and change over time, the organization will only need to designate one lead Indiana Navigator on the application in order to meet application requirements. All other associated Indiana Navigators may be added over time. Since the organization will need to attest to the fact that the designated lead Indiana Navigator has been certified, the organization will need to coordinate with that lead Navigator to ensure he or she is certified before the orga nization completes its application. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 35 of 291 ownersh ip interest in the organization; (4) answer background questions on behalf of those with ownership interest to ensure compliance with Indiana law; and (5) attest to abide by the laws, regulations, and other requirements pertaining to Application Organizations . The organization will submit the completed application along with the nonrefundable application fee. For resident businesses in Indiana, the application fee is $50 per year plus an online processing fee. For businesses residing outside of Indiana, the application fee is $100 per year plus an online processing fee. The fees are subject to change based on the discretion of the Commissioner of Insurance . The most accurate, up-to-date fee information may be found on the IDOI website at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm . After the online AO application, fee, and other required information are submitted, the application will be reviewed b y the IDOI for completion and potential disqualifying information. If there are questions about the application , IDOI may contact the organization with a reque st for additional information. Once all concerns are addressed, the IDOI will either ap prove or d eny the application. If the application is approved, an automated email notification of the approval will be sent to the AO. If the organization's application is denied, a letter will be mailed to the organization contain ing information about the reason for denial and the organization's appeal rights. ii. Becoming an Application Organization - Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form As a part of the application process, the authorized representative completing the application on behalf of an organization must review the Conflict of Interest Policy . This policy is identical to that reviewed and agreed to by all Indiana Navigators; but the representative will not only attest to any of his or her personal conflicts of inter est, but also the potential or actua l conflicts of interest of the organization's other owners, officers, partners, board members, or directors , as well as any conflicts of interest related to th e mission and operations of the organization. Described in greater detail in the Indiana Navigator section , there are two primary types of conflict s of interest that may exist: a \"financial interest \" or a non-financial \" conflicts of loyalty.\" Regardless of the type of conflict of interest and whether it is an actual or potential conflict of interest , the representative must report an actual or potential conflict of interest to the IDOI by completing the associated Conflict of Interest Disclosure F orm. The Commissioner will review these conflicts of interest to ensure that none are prohibited by existing state laws or regulations . iii. Becoming an Application Organization - Privacy and Security Agreement As a part of the application process, the individual completing the application on behalf of the organization must submit a completed AO Privacy and Security Agreement. This agreement will be similar to that reviewed and agreed to by all individ ual Indiana Navigators. The organization as a whole will agree to abide by the privacy and security standards, including its owners, partners, board members, officers, directors , certified Indiana Navigators, or other employees . By signing the AO Privacy and Security Agreement, the organization generally agrees to each of the following , stated in more detail in the agreement : That personal information the AO receives from consumers for purposes of assisting with application for and enrollment in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) or public health insurance program is confidential and should be maintained and protected. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 36 of 291 To follow all state and federal laws governing the confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information. To comply with the safeguards outlined in the ag reement to maintain and protect the confidentiality of personal information. To properly report to the consumer and IDOI and mitigate damages when a security breach or improper disclosure of personal i nformation occurs. To make available their internal pr ivacy practices and policies to the IDOI upon request. To be subject to enforcement action by the Commissioner of Insurance if in noncompliance with the Agreement. iv. Becoming an Application Organization - List of All Locations (for Multi -Location AOs) As part of the Application Organization (AO) application process10, if an organization has more than one location at which the organization will conduct AO/Navigator services , the AO must submit a list of each location. The list must include the following information for each location: 1. Name of location; 2. Address; 3. Telephone number; 4. Email; 5. Website (if applicable ); and 6. Main contact person for the f acility . The list may also include the Indiana counties that a particular location services, if the locati on services one or more counties outside of the location's address. Lists will be used to publish an AO's locations and contact information by county on the \"Find a Navigator\" tool on the Indiana Healthcare Reform website at www.in.gov/healthcarereform/2468.htm . c. Obtaining and Maintaining Application Organization Registration - Reporting Requirements Application Organization s (AOs) must follow all reporting requirements with the State of Indiana . On the initial AO online application and annual renewal application, the organization must report the following to the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) : All owners with 5% interest or voting interest, partners, officers, and directors of the Application Organization .

Maintaining Application Organization Registration : Renewal An A O's approved registration will remain active for one year, given there are no findings of misconduct, prohibited conflicts of interes t, or other disqualifying factors during that time. Approximately 60 days before the one year expiration, the IDOI will email a reminder notice to the business email provided by the AO in the AO application that it is t ime to renew the registration. At that point up through the expiration date , the AO must complete the renewal application, which is located on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2934.htm . While the AO should update any essential contact informatio n11, inform IDOI of any associated Indiana Navigator or location changes and of any changes in conflict s of interest12 throughout the year, the completion of the renewal application is primarily a confirmation that the existing records are complete and accurate. The AO must also disclose any changed or new C onflict s of Interest not previously disclosed to the IDOI through the AO Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form , and provide an updated contact list of all locations of the AO if the AO has more than one location providing AO/Navigator services. Upon submitting the renewal application, an updated Conflict of Int erest Disclosure Form (if applicable) , and list of locations (if applicable), the AO's application will be renewed by the IDOI and the AO will receive a notice of approval or denial as appropriate. The AO will have a 30 -day late/extended period following the expiration date in which to comp lete the renewal application and pay a higher non-refundable renewal fee. If the organization does not complete 11 An Application Organization (AO) may make updates to any contact information, or update its locations or associated Indiana Navigators through the Navigator/AO Service Request Form located at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm under both the Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations boxes, or at www.in.gov/idoi/2935.htm . 12 An Application Organization (AO) may update any actual or potential Conflicts of Interest through the AO Conflict of Interest Dis closure Form posted online at http://www.in.gov/idoi/2935.htm .

If the AO fails to renew its registration within the 30 -day late period, the associated Indiana Navigators will maintain their Indiana Navigator status as long as there is no reason to take enforceable acti on against the individual ( e.g., no credible consumer complaints) , and individual renewal requirements are satisfied . Additional information on the process for annual renewal of AOs can be found on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2934.htm . 3. Indiana Navigators a. Indiana Navigator Roles and R esponsibilities Indiana N avigators , established under Indiana Code 27 -19 and 760 IAC 4 , are individuals certified to help Hoosier insurance consumers complete insurance affordability program applications - namely Medicaid , the Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ), the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) , and qualified health plans (QHPs) through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM)/ www.healthcare.gov . These individuals may be associated with an Application Organization (AO) , also established under IC 27 - 19 and 760 IAC 4 , but do not have to be in ord er to be an Indiana Navigator. Individuals who must be certified as Indiana Navigators , include , but are not limited to: Federally -funded and certified federal Navigator s Federally -designated Certified Application Counselors (CACs) Medicaid Enroll ment Center staff or volunteers Staff or volunteers of other organizations helping with insurance affordability program application s All individuals meeting the definition of an Indiana Navigator will be required to complete certification with the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) , but those also designated by the federal government (for example, those receiving federal Navigator cooperative agreement funds and those designated as CACs ) may need to meet additional federal requirements , such as training and certification. In th ese case s, the federal and state training and certification requirements are not interchangeable, and the individual s must complete both trainings in order to be compliant with not federal and state law. There are some exceptions provided in the Indiana Navigator definition for certain individuals that are not required to obtain the Indiana Navigator certification. Individuals that may, but are not required to, obtain the Indiana Navigator certification , include, but are not limite d to: Presumptive eligibility (PE) hospital staff assisting with only PE dete rminations for health coverage and not also assisting with the full ap plications for health coverage An employee or contractor of a state agency, division, or s ubdivision thereof acting as an Indiana N avigator as part of their job function 13 The initial application steps for Application Organizations (AOs) is posted online at www.in.gov/idoi/2825.htm .

For example, i ndividuals who receive considerat ion from health insurance issuers for the enrollment of individuals in health plans are prohibited from becom ing Indiana Navigators. This includes licensed health insurance producers (agents or brokers) that sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance products on behalf of insurance issuers . Such licensed health producers are prohibited from acting as both health producers and Indiana Navigators. While the federal training and certification requirements may vary based on the type of consumer assistan t, all individuals meeting the definition of an Indiana Navigator will need to complete the same series of steps in order to obtain Indiana Navigator certification. These steps are listed in the following table (see Table 9 ), as well as online at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm , and are detailed in the following sections. Table 9: Steps to Obtain and Renew Indiana Navigator Certification 1) Complete the initial Indiana Navigator online application and pay the nonrefundable application fee ($50 for Indiana resident, $100 for non -resident ) and online processing fee 2) Review the Conflict of Interest Policy , then complete and submit the Indiana Navigator Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form to the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI)14 3) Review, sign and submit the Indiana Navigator Privacy and S ecurity Agreement to IDOI 4) Complete Navigator P recertification Education (PE) with an IDOI -approved training provider15 5) Pass IDOI Navigator Examination16 6) Once certified, complete annual Navigator Continuing E ducation (CE) requirement (two hours each year)17 7) Complete annual online renewal application and pay the nonrefundable renewal fee ($50 for Indiana resident, $100 for non -resident) and processing fee 8) Abide by all Indiana Navigator reporting requirements18 with the IDOI 14 All application documents may either be attached electronically to the online application, or emailed, faxed, or mailed to the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) at: navigator@idoi .in.gov (email), 317 -234-5882 (fax), or 311 West Washington Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46204 (mail). 15 A list of all Navigator Precertification Education (PE) providers open to the public is posted on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2826.htm . 16 Information on registering/scheduling the navigator examination, as well as other examination procedure and guidelines, is available on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi /2836.htm . 17 Approved Navigator Continuing Education (CE) providers may be viewed through IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2826.htm . 18 A list of Indiana Navigator reporting requirements is posted on IDOI's w ebsite at www.in.gov/idoi/2931.htm .

Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 43 of 291 After the application and fee are su bmitted, the application will be reviewed by the IDOI for completion and potential disqualifying information. If there are questions about the application , the applicant may be contacted by the IDOI with a reque st for additional information. The applicatio n will remain \"Pending\" or \"Under State Review\" until all information is received for the application and the Navigator precertification education (PE) and navigator examination are completed successfully. If the application is approved, an automated email notification of approval will be sent to the Indiana Navigator. I f the individual's application is denied, a letter will be mailed to the individual contain ing the reason for denial and the individual's right to appeal the decision . c. Becoming an Indiana Navigator - Precertification Education and Navigator Examination All applicants will need to complete Navigator precertification education (PE) prior to taking the navigator examination . In order to complete the education , individuals will need to locate a training provider that has been approved by the IDOI to provi de Navigator PE. A list of approved Navigator PE providers can be found on the IDOI website at www.in.gov/idoi/2826.htm . The cost of Navigator PE may vary, based on the source of the training. The topics of the Navigator PE will include information on consumer assistance, different marketplace models ( such as the Federally - facilitated Marketplace (FFM) and Federally -facilitated Marketplace -Partnership ( \"Partnership\" )), and Medicaid; including basic information and state -specific application. Additional information on Navigator PE training criteria and resources can be found on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2937.htm . Following th e training, individuals will need to register and schedule the navigator examination with the Performance Assessment Network (PAN) ,20 the organization selected by the IDOI to administer the Navigator examination . Ind ividuals may register and schedule the assessment at the following website powered by PAN: https://secure.vitapowered.com/idoi/login.screen . PAN will provide a variety of times, dates, and loca tions from which the individual will be able to select. The cost to register and schedule the Navigator examination is $84.75 (as of May 1, 2013 - amount subject to change). The individual must score at least a 70% (42 out of 60) on the assessment in order to be considered for certification. If individual does not receive a passing score, the individual may take the assessment again until the sooner of: the individual receiving a passing score or no later than 90 days after the initial application submission date. Additional information on the Navigator examination can be found on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2836.htm . When the Navigator examination is passed successfully, and all other applicatio n materials are received and approved by the IDOI, the Indiana Navigator will receive a n email notice of approval. In addition to the email approval notification, the Indiana Navigator will receive a unique certification ID number that the Indiana Navigato r must use wh en helping consumers complete insurance affordabi lity program applications. The Indiana Navigator may obtain a copy of the certificate as proof of s tate certification.21 Also, each Indiana Navigator will be listed on the \"Find a Navigator\" webpage of the Indiana state 20 Assistance with registration and scheduling of the navigator examination may be obtained from PAN at either idoi_support@panpowered.com (email) or 877 -449-8378 (telephone). 21 Currently, Indiana Navigator certificates may be obtained by emailing a request to navigator@idoi.in.gov .

If the individual does not pass the Navigator examination , the certification process is not complete, and the IDOI will neither app rove nor deny the application. Once a year has passed from the initial submission of the Indiana Navigato r application, the application will be considered null and void, and the individual will need to complete a new application for consideration to serve as an Indiana Navigator. d. Maintaining Indiana Navigator Certification - Continuing Education and Re porting Requirements In order f or Indiana Navigators to maintain their certificati on, they must complete the minimum Navigator continuing education (CE) requirement and maintain updated information with the IDOI. In order to maintain current knowledge and understanding of consumer assistance , the federal ly- facilitated or Partnership Marketplaces , and Medicaid changes and implementation, all Indiana Navigators must annually complete at least two (2) hours22 of continuing education. Approved Navigator CE providers may be viewed through www.sircon.com ,23 much like the pre - certification education (PE) . An individual may use an associated AO or a third party training entity as a source for CE, as long as the entity has had its CE course approved by the IDOI. The training entity will download all completions of CE credits to the Indiana Navigator's transcript, which may be verified at www.sircon.com .24 In addition to keeping education current, it is also important that an Indiana Navigator maintain up -to- date contact information and abide by all reporting requirements with the IDOI posted online at www.in.gov /idoi/2931.htm . Indiana Navigators must inform the IDOI of any changes to legal name, business or personal contact information , criminal or administrative actions , conflict s of interest, breached in privacy/security of a consumer's personal information, an d delinquent state tax or child support payments , within thirty ( 30) days of such change. Failure to abide by reporting requirements could lead to an IDOI enforcement action taken against the individual pursuant to Indiana Code 27 -19-4- 3 and 760 IAC 4 . 22 The two -hour Navigator continuing education (CE) requirement is subject to change. To verify the requirement, go to the Indiana Department of Insurance website at www.in.gov/idoi/2930 .htm . 23 To search for an approved Navigator CE course: Go to www.sircon.com , select \"Lookup Education Courses or Transcript\" under Quick Start, select \"Approved Courses Inquiry,\" from the dropdown select \"Indiana\" and click Submit, leave Education Type as \"Continuing Education\" and under Course Category select \"Navigator CE\" and click Submit.

Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 45 of 291 e. Indiana Navigator Certification Renewal Every year, an Indiana Navigator will be required to renew25 the Navigator's certification. The Navigator will receive an email remi nder notification approximately sixty ( 60) days prior to the certification expiration date to the business email on file wit h IDOI for the Navigator , and within that time, the Navigator will need to complete the online renewal application, noting any changes that have not already been reported to the IDOI and submitting the non -refundable renewal fee ($50 for Indiana residents and $100 for non -residents). If there have been changes to the Navigator's conflict of interest status under the Conflict of Interest Policy since the Navigator's last renewal or conflict of interest disclosure, the Navigator will need to sign and submit a new Navigator Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form disclos ing all actual or potential conflicts of interest . The Navigator must have also completed at least two (2) hours of Navigator continuing education (CE) with an IDOI -approved Navigator CE provider. Navigators do not need to complete Navigator pre - certification ed ucation (PE) or another Navigator examination . Following the completion of th e renewal application, IDOI will review the information and will request any supplemental information as needed. After the renewal application is processed, the IDOI will send the Indiana Navigator a n otice with approval or denial. If the individual is approved, the individual will retain the original unique certification ID number and will be able to obtain a new certificate26 to prove current certification. If the individual is d enied, the individual will receive a letter explaining the reason for denial and right to appeal the decision . While the Indiana Navigator should complete the renewal prior to the certification expiration date, the Navigator will have a 30-day late/reinst atement period after the expiration date to complete the renewal process . A higher , non-refundable late/reinstatement fee27 will be accessed during the 30 -day late/reinstatement period in addition to the renewal fee . If the renewal is not completed and submitted by the end of th e late/reinstatement period, the Indiana Navigator certification will no longer be valid , and the individual will have to begin the entire initial certification process again as a new applicant. f. Application Organization's Opt ions for Assisting Indiana Navigators in Applying and Renewing Certifications Not all aspects of the Indiana Navigator certification process need to be borne solely by the individual applying for certification. If the individual is associated with an Application Organization (AO) , that organization may choose to be involved in the process. The AO's options for assisting its Indiana Navigators with the certification process are detailed in the following table (see Table 11 ): 25 The annual Navigator certification renewal steps are posted on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2930.htm . 26 Currently, Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations (AOs) may obtain copies of their certificates by emailing the IDOI at navigator@idoi.in.gov . IDOI will respond with an electronic/PDF version of the certificate. IDOI does not issue paper copies of certificates. 27 The fees for a Navigator renewal application submitted within the 30 -day late/reinstatement period include the renewal application fee ($50 for Indiana residents and $100 for non -residents) PLUS the reinstatement/late fee of three times the renewal fee ($150 for Indiana residents and $300 for non -residents).

State L imitations for Indiana Navigators Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations ( AOs) have specific parameters w ithin which they must operate. Several of these parameters relate to the forms Indiana Navigators and AOs complete when they apply to becom e Indiana Navigators and AOs . The forms include the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form28 and Privacy and Security Agreement29. In addition to these forms, there are 28 There are two separate Conflict of Interes t Disclosure Forms - one for Indiana N avigators and one for Application Org anizations . 29 There are two separate Privacy and Security Agreements - one for Indiana Navigators and one for Application Organizations . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 47 of 291 expectations surrounding consumer fraud, waste, and abuse, receipt of compensation, as well as advice given on plan selection. i. Conflict of Interest Policy For Indiana Navigators and AOs, conflicts of interest are defined in the Conflict of Interest Policy as personal or business interests that may influence the advice and assistance the Indiana Navigator or AO provides to a consumer. These conflicts may be financial or non -financial, direct or indirect. Some conflicts may be addressed by simply reporting them to the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) on the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form and disclosing them in writing to each consumer assisted , while other conflicts will disqualify an individual or organization from being able to serve as an Indiana Navigator or Application Organization . aa. Financial Conflict of Interest The Indiana Conflict of Interest Policy begins with an acknowledgement of the purpose of the Indiana Navigator c ertification, which is to provide fair , accurate, and impartial information and assistance regarding health insurance plan and product options, enrollment, as well as eligibility for public health insurance programs (Medicaid, CHIP, HIP 2.0), QHPs, PTCs , and cost-sharing reductions . While the Conflict of Interest Policy recognizes that certified individuals and organizations may have dual interests, they must recognize that it is their responsibility to always act in the best interest of the consum er. For this reason, financial conflicts of inter est are of particular concern to the State . Some of these conflicts may be addressed through a disclosure to the IDOI on the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form and a written disclosure to each consumer assisted, while other financial conflicts of interes t may prohibit individuals or organizations from certifi cation as Indiana Navigators or registration as Application Organizations . A prohibited conflict of interest occur s when an individual or organiz ation receives compensation from an insurer for the enrol lment of an individual into a health plan. If an individual or organization is disqualified due to a prohibited financial conflict of interest, it does not necessarily mean that the individual or organization cannot help c onsumers, but it does mean th at they must help those consumer s in a different capacity. Perhaps the most direct example of a prohibited conflict of interest is with regard to licensed health insuranc e producers (agents or brokers) who receive compensatio n from health insurers for enro llment of individuals into the insurer's plans. Though such individuals may not be eligible to be come Indiana Navigator s, the health insurance producer s will still be able to serve in the same capacity that they had prior to the implementation of the Patie nt Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA) and Indiana Navigator law ( Indiana Code 27-19). Should a licensed health insurance producer wish to serve as an Indiana Navigator, the producer must not sell, solicit, or negotiate health insurance products on behalf of particular insurance carriers in order to be in compliance with Indiana state law. Although this direct financial conflict of interest is prohibited for Indiana Navi gators and AOs, there are other possible financial conflicts of interest that may be permissible at the discretion of the Commissioner of Insurance . Permissible finan cial conflicts of interest may include some indirect financial incentives for Indiana Navigators or Appli cation Organizations. One example may be someone who is a partial owner in an insurance agency. The individual may benefit financially when the insurance agents associated with the agency are selling a large number of health insurance plans, but does not receive direct reimbursement for consume r enrollment into those plans. There is concern that, if that individual should become an Indiana Navigator, the individual may direct consume rs to the insurance agency for Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 48 of 291 final plan selection and enrollment, thus providing biase d information to the consumer. For this reason, such an individual wo uld need to disclose the conflict of interest to the IDOI and to all consumers the Indiana Navigato r assists . If the individual attests to not allow the financial conflict of interest to bias or influence his or her assistance of consumers and to abide by the Conflict of Interest Policy , the IDOI may approve the application. However, if the IDOI receives consumer complaints about the Indiana Navigator steering consumers to the insurance agency or plans represented by the agency with whi ch he or she is part ow ner, the IDOI may take enforcement action against that individual pursuant to Indiana Code 27-19-4-3 and 760 IAC 4 . bb. Conflict of Loyalty In order to address non-financial conflicts of interest , the Conflict of Interest Policy lays out the idea of a Conflict of Loyalty. By Indiana definition, a conflict of loyalty occurs when an individual or organization has - directly or indirectly, though business or family - an interest or relationship with a third party that prohibits or i nhibits the individual or organization from exercising independent judgment in the b est interests of the consumer. For example, a conflict of loyalty may o ccur with individuals or organizations that have a business relationship with an insurance carrier un related to plan enrollment but related to reimbursement rates. An example of this type of relationship may be a hospital that has an interest in enrolling consumers in specific plans that provide the hospital wi th higher reimbursement rates for treatment o f patients. B ut the hospital does not receive direct compensation from the ins urance carrier for enrolling an individual in the carrier's plan. If a conflict of loyalty exist s, the Indiana Navigator and AO must notify the IDOI of the conflict on the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form , detail ing the nature of the conflict. Even if no personal conflict prevents an Indiana Navigator or AO from providing fair and impartial information, the potential for such a confl ict does exist and must be reported to th e Indiana Department of Insurance . In addition to disclosure to the IDOI, Indiana Navigators and AOs must disclose in writing any actual or potential conflicts of loyalty to consumers prior to providing assistance. Once these conflicts of loyalty are discl osed, it is the responsibility of the Indiana Navigator and AO to provide fair, impartial, and accurate information in the best interest of ea ch consumer receiving assistance. cc. Changes in Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest It is possible that conflicts of interest (financial interests or conflicts of loyalty ) will change over time, so if new actual or potential conflicts arise during the term of certification or registration , the Indiana Navigator or Application Organization (AO) must report th ose new conflicts to the IDOI on the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form within 30 days of the change, and must update the written consumer disclosure to reflect these changes as well. dd. Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form If an Indiana Navigator or Application Organization ( AO) has an actual or potential conflict of interest (financial interest or conflict of l oyalty) as defined in the Conflict of Interest Policy , the Indiana Navigator or AO must disclose the actual or potential conflict to the IDOI on the Conflic t of Interest Disclosure Form. The Indiana N avigator Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form and AO Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form are posted throughout the IDOI Indiana Navigator/AO website at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm . The form is very basic, requiring acknowledgement that the individual or organization has read, understands, and agrees to t he Conflict of Interest Policy. The form also requires a detailed descrip tion of any Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 49 of 291 potential or actual conflicts of interest that the Ind iana Navigator or AO may have. This form is to be updated within 30 days of a change in conflict of interest status . ii. Additional R equirements for Federally -Designated Consumer Assistants While Indiana requires that all Indiana Navigators confirm and disclose any actual or potential conflict s of interest, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) may have additional conflict of interest requirem ents for Indiana Navigators also designated as consumer assistants with CMS (e.g., federal Navigator s or Certified Application Counselors ( CACs )). Individu als and organizations that have or seek both the state and federal certifications must abide by both the state and federal conflict of interest standards. Individuals a nd organizations that only have or seek the state certification may not be required to meet federal conflict of i nterest standards pertaining directly to federally -designated consumer assistants . iii. Receiv ing C ompensation One of the primary concerns addressed in the Indiana Conflict of Interest Policy for Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations ( AOs) is the receipt of compensation from a health insurance issuer in connection with enr olling consumers in to health plans . Receiving compensation from a health insurance issuer in connection with the enrollment of consumers into health plans is a prohibited conflict of interest und er both state and federal law. Compensation that is not in connection with the enrollment of consumers into health plans is generally not a pr ohibited conflict of interest. C ompensation is defined as anything of value, including mon ey or other in -kind ben efits of any type ( e.g., paid commission, grants, credit, loans, gifts, free or discou nted travel or prizes). However, compensation does not include tangible goods or other advertisement with an aggregate value of less than $100 per year per issuer. Therefore, Indiana Navigators and AOs may receive limited amounts of promotional material from health insurance issuers without a disqualifying conflict of interest. Indiana Navigators and AOs are not prohibited by Indiana law from receiving compensation from consumers they assist with health coverage applications . However, federal law prohibits federal Navigator s and Certified Application Counselors ( CACs ) from receiving compensation from the consumers they assist . Therefore, indivi duals and organizations only certified as Indiana Navigators and AOs may receive compensation from the consumers they assist, while individuals and o rganizations also certified as federal Navigator s, CAC organizations, or CACs may not receive compensation from the consumers they assist with health coverage applications. iv. Privacy and Security Agreement and Confidentiality Standards In working with consumers, Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations ( AOs) may have access to personal information including , but not limited to , personal identifying information, income inform ation, and health information. Due to the sensitivity of this information, individuals and organizations must sign and submit to the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) the I ndiana Navigator or AO Privacy and Security Agreement , agree ing to maintain the confidentiality of any information provided by the consumer (or Authorized Representative acting on behalf of the consumer) in the process of applying for and enrolling in a qu alified health plan (QHP) on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace or Indiana Health Coverage Program . There are two separate Privacy and Security Agreements \u2014one for Indiana Navigators and one for Application Organizations \u2014that must be signed and submitted to the IDOI as part of the initial application . Both the Indiana Navigator Privacy and Security Agreement and the AO Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 50 of 291 Privacy and Security Agreement are posted on the IDOI Indiana Navigator/AO website at www.in.gov/idoi/2823.htm . By agreeing to meet the privacy and security requirement s, an Indiana Navigator or AO agrees to protect consumers' personal information with operational, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized or inappropriate access, use, or disclosure of t hat information. The Indiana Navigator and AO also agree to follow all state and federal laws governing the privacy and security of consumers' personal information. Indiana Navigators may refer to Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a7 24-4-14 and 24-4.9 for a greater understanding of existing [albeit not comprehensive] state requirements regarding information protect ion and reporting in the event consumer information is inappropriately disclosed. Also , for t he sake of consumer privacy and security, there are actions that an Indiana Navigator or AO should take, and there are actions they should encoura ge consumers to t ake in order to reduce the risk of personal information being inappropriately accessed. Several of these actions are listed in the following table (see Table 12 ) and reflect the required actions stated in the Privacy and Security Agreement s. Table 12: Steps to Protect a Consumer's Personal Information Entity Responsible Recommended or Required ? Action Consumer Recommended Only disclose personal information to individuals or entities autho rized to view or receive person al information Only disclose the minimum amount of personal information required to accomp lish the intended purpose ( e.g., to complete an application for health coverage) Indiana Navigator or Application Organization Required When sharing the consumer's personal information with an authorized individual or entity, only provide the minimum amount of personal information needed to accomplish the intended purpose ( e.g., to complete an application for health coverage) Protect the consumer's personal information against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to confidentiality, integrity, and availability ( e.g., do not leave unattended a computer screen displaying person al information ) Protect the consumer's personal information against an reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures that are not perm itted or required by law ( e.g., do not hand information over to a third party u nless required by law or authorized by the consumer) Per Ind. Code \u00a7 24-4.9-3.5, consumer personal information must be securely destroyed or disposed of in a way that will make the information unusable Per Ind. Code \u00a7 24-4.9-3, if the Indiana Navigator or Application Organization becomes aware of a security breach or improper disclosure of personal information, the consumer must be informed Source s: Federal Trade Commission , Consumer Information: How to Keep 24 -4.9; see also Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 51 of 291 Indiana Department of Insurance Indiana Navigator Privacy and Security Agreement and Application Organization Privacy and Security Agreement v. Advice on Plan Selection One primary r estriction placed on Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations (AOs) is the ability to advise consumers on h ealth coverage plan selection. Currently, health insurance producers licensed in the State of Indiana are the only individuals authorized to provide advice on specific plan selection . Without this licensure, Indiana Navigators do not have the training, expertise, or authorization required to offer this very specific type of recommendation. Though Indiana Navigators cannot provide the same level of advice licensed health insurance producers can, they are able to provide consumers with valuable information to help the consumer make the best personal choice. Selecting a health insurance plan is complex and highly individualized, so identifying som e of th e key components the consumer should consider is valuab le for the consumer. General questions regardin g doctor preferences and health care use could help direct consumers as they consider their plan selection . Avoiding direct plan recommendations will keep the Indiana Naviga tor from overstepping their boundaries in providing application assistance . 4. Health Insurance Producers ( Agents , and Brokers ) In the course of a consumer's search for heal th insurance coverage, the consumer may be confronted by a range of different terms referring to individ uals selling health insurance. Producers, a.k.a. insurance agents or b rokers , are the most common t erms consumers will encounter. The following table (see Table 1 3) explains the differences and similarities between these titles. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 52 of 291 Table 13: Similarities and Differences between Agents and Brokers (Producers) Producer Agent Broker (Captive) (Independent) Is also known as... ...an Agent ...a Broker ...a Producer ...a Producer ...an Agent ...a Producer Definition General term Refers to anyone selling insurance products Individual selling insurance products for a single carrier; obligated to only represent products from that single insurance carrier Individual selling insurance products for one or more insurance carriers Individual providing broad knowledge and recommendations on available insurance plans for multiple insurance carriers Purpose - Focused on timely and accurate processing of forms, advising on carrier's products Focused on timely and accurate processing of forms, finding best quotes Focused on advising on carrier plan selection , finding best quotes , customer service Advantage - Tend to have deeper knowledge of carrier plans May be able to offer lower premiums or other features/ services May have acce ss to plans that better fit consumer's individual needs Tend to ha ve broader knowledge of offerings from multiple carriers Tend to have hig her level of education and experience Disadvantage Will only provide information on plans for single insurance carrier Tend to have access to less carrier offerings than a brokerage May charge administrative fee or higher premiums Any person who sells, solicits , or negotiates health insurance products in the state of Indiana is required under Indiana Code 27 -1-15.6 to be licensed as a health insurance producer through the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI). This includes individuals who sell, solicit, or negotiate health insurance through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) /www.healthcare.gov or products off of the Marketplace. Information on Indiana insurance producer licensing requirements is available on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2446.htm . In addition to being licensed with the state , insurance producers wanting to assist on the FFM/ www.healthcare.gov must also complete any federal training and registration requirements with the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS). Information on training and registration requirements, and additional resources for producers, is available on CMS's website at www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs -and-Initiatives/Health -Insurance -Marketplaces/a -b-resource s.html . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 53 of 291 G. Ethics for Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations (AOs) The purpose of state and federal consumer assistants is to improve consumer access to fair, accurate, unbiased information regarding a ran ge of health coverage options. Although p ersonal bias is a challenge, it is important to recognize that each consumer asking for help has a different set of needs and priorities, and what may be best for one person is not what wil l be best for another person. In addition to considering indi vidual needs, it is important that both state and federal consumer a ssistants adhere to a certain set of ethical standa rds as they work with consumers. Those standards may include commitment to clients, s elf-determination, informed consent, competence, c ultural co mpetence and social diversity, conflicts of interest, privacy and confidentiality, a ccess to reco rds, and professional conduct. The application of thes e standard s is explained briefly in the following table (see Table 14 ): Table 14: Standards of Ethical Behavior DO: Be honest regarding any personal bias or conflict of interest Give complete and accurate information Admit when one does not know an answer Protect the personal information of the people being assisted Be sensitive to different cultures Use professional language DO NOT : Do not m ake up or guess an answer to a question Do not a sk anyone for more informati on than absolutely necessary Do not j oke about sensitive physical, social, or cultural differences Do not u se derogatory or profane language toward or about a consumer Do not b e afraid to refer a consumer to someone else if they have needs outside of the Indiana Navigator scope of training 1. Ethical Standard: Commitment to C lients The primary responsibility of all co nsumer assistants is to identify and address the needs of the consumer. This means listening to the consumer, using best judgme nt to determine the type of assistance the individual needs, and working within the Indiana Navigator's scope of knowledge and training in order to address those needs. It is possible t hat consumer needs may exceed an Indiana Navigator's ability to help. I n this case, commitment to the client means referring the consumer to another resource that may be better equipped to help the consumer . 2. Ethical Stand ard: Self -Determination Another primary role of Indiana Navigator s is to assist the consumer in making more informed choices in their best interests when shopping for health insurance coverage . This is done b y presenting complete and accurate information on all of the health coverage options available to a particular consumer and answering the consumer's q uestions about the details of those coverage s. Armed with more information, the goal is to empow er the consumer to make more informed choices that reflec t the consumer's needs, priorities, and goals. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 54 of 291 3. Ethical Standard: Informed C onsent There is a great deal of public confusion surrounding the implementation of the ACA , how it impacts health coverage, and what resources are ava ilable to help understand it. Many of the individuals utilizing Indiana Navigator services will not understand the differenc es between the different types of consumer assistants, the limitations in consumer assistants' ability to he lp, and the extent to which the consumer is entrusting a possible stranger with very s ensitive personal information. For this reason, it is imperati ve that Indiana Navigators ensure that consumer s are informed of what to expect of the process prior to addressing questions of need. Indiana Navigators may a void future anger and frustration by briefly explaining what an Indiana Navigator can and cannot do, what types of questions the Indiana Navigator may need to ask as a part of the a pplication process, and any actual or po tential conflicts of interest of the Indiana Navigator or the Navigator's Application Organization. This should help the consumer d ecide if the Indiana Navigator is someone with whom the consumer feels comfortable working, and should help prevent the consume r from getting upset and submitting a complaint later, feeling as though the Indiana Navigator was not helpful (when it was reall y just a matter of his or her need being outside the Indiana Navigator scope), asked too many personal questions (when such questions were really just necessary to complete the appl ication), or steering the consumer into an inappropriate plan. 4. Ethical Standard: Competence Within the first several years of ACA implementation , there may be several changes to federal and state laws and regulations. For this reason, it is vital that all Indiana Navigators strive to remain up -to-date on any changes as they occur. While not every change is going to impact every consumer, it is particularly important to know which changes will impact a consumer's program eligibility and enrollment, and to share that information. It is also important for Indiana Naviga tors to realize that, while they may know significantly more about ACA implementation than the average consumer, overloading a consumer with all of the information may just ma ke the consumer more confused. Competence is not a matter of sharing all of the information, but rather identifying what information would be helpful to share while staying within the boundaries of training and expert ise of the consumer assistant. For example, a n Indiana Navigator may study the plans available on the Federal Marketplace and understand the similarities and differences between them . This knowledge may be helpful to the consumer, b ut understanding the plan characteristics alone does not give the Indiana Navigator authority to adv ise on which plan s to select . 5. Ethical Standard: Cultural C ompetence Indiana Navigator s may assist a diverse range of individuals. Regard less of the type of consumer, an Indiana Navigator has made a commitment to help the consumer understand the consumer's health coverage options, and should do so in a culturally sensitive manner. Questions, languages, an d priorities may vary based on the consumer's culture, and it is the role of the Indiana Navigator to work with in the context the individual's cu lture to address the individual's needs. Some elem ents that may impact culture include : age, gender, religion, race, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, political belief, socio -economic status, or mental or physical disability. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 55 of 291 6. Ethical Standard: Conflicts of I nterest Financial and non -financial conflicts of interest recognized by the state of Indiana are discussed in greater detail in th e Conflict of Interest section of this manual , but in general, a conflict of interest is any actual or potential condition that could interfere with a n Indiana Navigator's ability to provide fair and impartial information to the consumer. The primary r ole of the Indiana Navigator is to serve the best interests of the consumer. Therefore, t he Indiana Navigator shoul d work to limit any actual or potential conflicts of interest on the consumer. Since some conflicts of interest may not b e completely elimina ted, it is required that the Indiana Navigator disclose in writing those conflicts of interests first to the IDOI on the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form30 and then to each consumer prior to providing assistance. Some conf licts of interest may seem obvious, but it is still necessar y to report them for the benefit of consumer s. 7. Ethical Standard: Privacy and C onfidentiality Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations (AOs) must abide by the terms of the Privacy and Security Agreement s31 and respect a consumer's right to privacy and security of personal information. This means that the Indiana Navigator should not ask the consumer any questions that are not necessary to ad dressing the individual's needs, and the Indiana Navigator should keep a ll information shared by the consumer confidential. Any information is only to be shared at the authorization of the consumer, or by the consumer's Authorized Representative. This is the case for applications for health insurance coverage as well as for in formation shared wi th the family of the consumer . It is also importa nt to be aware of where a consumer shares personal information and , to what extent possible, help a consumer identify private and secure locations and methods of communi cation and application. For example, if a consumer plans to complete an application at a public library, discuss strategies for communicating in a way that will allow the greatest privacy and limit public exposure of perso nal information. Ideally, consumers will retain copies of any documents completed at the end of a meeting . This prevents the Indiana Navigator from having to properly destroy the documents in a way that will protect the consumer's personal information. 8. Ethical Sta ndard: Ac cess to R ecords Some Indiana Navigators may have access to consumer records and applications, but should only access records at the request or permission of the consumer. To access consumer records for the sake of curiosity is an invasion of consumer priv acy and a serious ethical violation that could result in enforcement action taken against the Indiana Navigator . As with the Privacy and C onfidentiality section , Indiana Navigators must also maintain the privacy and security of cons umer records, only sharing information from the records with the consumer or the consumer's Authorized R epresentative, unless th e consumer requests otherwise. Other family members 30 There are two separate Conflict of Interest Disclosure Forms - one for Indiana N avigator s and one for Application Organizations . 31 There are two separate Privacy and Security Agreements - one for Indiana Navigators and one for Application Organizations . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 56 of 291 may call to inquire, but it is important to speak directly with the consumer to obtain consent for information to be released to other individuals. 9. Ethical Standard: Professional C onduct As an Indiana Navigator serving the general public, it is important to act in a profession al manner. This means that Indiana Navigators are to avoid entering into sexual, harmful, abusive, or other inappropriate physical relationships with consumers or their family members, as this relationship may be seen as a way to exploit or harm the consumer. Even if the relationship is consensual, it i s the Indiana Navigator that holds the risk if such a relationship is reported. I t is in the best interest of both the Indiana Navigator and the consumer to set clear, appropriate, and culturally -sensitive boundaries at the beginning of the interaction. Altho ugh it is natural for individual s in a relationship to want to help each other, Indiana Navigators with a relationship with the consumer may want to consider referring the consumer to another Indiana Navigator as a way to ensure the preservation of ap propriate professional boundar ies and impartial assistance. In addition to physical relationships, it is also necessary to act in a professional ma nner with regards to language. Telling jokes or using derogatory or foul language a re to be avoided. Jokes about personal characteristics like race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, physical appearance, etc. may be funny to one individual , but it is difficult to know what m ay be hurtful or offensive to someone else. Consumers are coming to Indiana Na vigators for help, and unprofessi onal language undermines Indiana Navigator credibility . H. Vulnerable and Underserved Po pulations Vulnerable and medically -underserved populations may be defined by age, race or ethnicity, language, gender, socioeconom ic status, geographic location, or other factors that have historically limited or currently restrict the ability to access healthcare. The characteristics of these groups can vary from state to state and county to county. In order to improve access to care for all populations, and particularly those that have traditionally struggled the most, the ACA has established standards for federal Navigator s to target vulnerable and underserved populations in their o utreach, education, and enrollment efforts. As a condition of receiving federal Navigator cooperative agreement funds, organizations must first demonstrate that they have existing relationships or the direct potential to develop relationships with underserved and vulnerable populations i n their declare d service area. While federal Navigator s are required to help anyone requesting assistance, their primary focus is to seek out those tha t may not have access to health care or health coverage assistance and ensure they receive the information and resource s they need to make informed decisions about their health coverage opt ions. Individuals with non -mainstream cultural and language needs and those with phy sical and mental disabilities. have received particular federal attention for their lack of health coverage access and the sensitivity surrounding their education and enrollment in health coverage programs . These populations have been singled out for particular federal requirements, with \"the National Standards for Culturally and Lingu istically Appropriate Services Standards in Health and Health Care\" ( the National CLAS Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 57 of 291 Standards ) developed to address cultural and languag e differences, and comparable guidelines regarding how to work with persons with disabilities. 1. Serving Different Cultures and Languages - the National CLAS Standards One particular area of focus for federally -mandated consumer assistants ( federal Nav igator s, non - Navigator Assistance Personnel, and Certified Application Counselors (CACs) ) is that of cultural and linguistic access and sensitivity. While these elements were addressed at a basic level within the ACA legislation, they were addressed in gre ater d etail in the July 2013 final rule released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is codified in 45 CFR 155.215 . Drawing from the National CLAS Standards (see Table 15 below), 45 CFR 155.215 states that consumer assistants operating in under the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) must develop and maintain general knowledge about racial, ethnic, and cultural gro ups in the ir service area. They must also be able to provide the following: Provide i nformation and assistance in consumer's preferred language (only using consumer ; family may translate if consumer prefers this over other methods) Provide oral and written notice of availability of language assistance services Recruit, support , and promote staff that represents demographic characteristics of service area Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 58 of 291 Table 15: National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (the National CLAS Standards) Principle Standard: 1. Provide effective, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy, and other communication needs. Governance, Leadership and Workforce: 2. Advance and sustain organizational governance and leadership that promotes CLAS and health equity through policy, practices, and allocated resources. 3. Recruit, promote, and support a culturally and linguistically diverse governan ce, leadership, and workforce that are responsive to the population in the service area. 4. Educate and train governance, leadership, and workforce in culturally and linguistically appropriate policies and practices on an ongoing basis. Communication and Language Assistance: 5. Offer language assistance to individuals who have limited English proficiency and/or other communication needs, at no cost to them, to facilitate timely access to all health care and services. 6. Inform all individuals of the availability of language assistance services clearly and in their preferred language, verbally and in writing. 7. Ensure the competence of individuals providing language assistance, recognizing that the use of untrained individuals and/or minors as interpret ers should be avoided. 8. Provide easy -to-understand print and multimedia materials and signage in the languages commonly used by the populations in the service area. Engagement, Continuous Improvement, and Accountability: 9. Establish culturally and linguistically appropriate goals, policies, and management accountability, and infuse them throughout the organization's planning and operations. 10. Conduct ongoing assessments of the organization's CLAS -related activities and integrate CLAS - related measures into measurement and continuous quality improvement activities. 11. Collect and maintain accurate and reliable demographic data to monitor and evaluate the impact of CLAS on health equity and outcomes and to inform service delivery. 12. Conduct regular assessme nts of community health assets and needs and use the results to plan and implement services that respond to the cultural and linguistic diversity of populations in the service area. 13. Partner with the community to design, implement, and evaluate policies, practices, and services to ensure cultural and linguistic appropriateness. 14. Create conflict and grievance resolution processes that are culturally and linguistically appropriate to identify, prevent, and resolve conflicts or complaints. 15. Communicate the or ganization's progress in implementing and sustaining CLAS to all stakeholders, constituents, and the general public. As HHS develops informational tools for consumers, it acknowledges the importance of developing written and spoken resources in English a nd Spanish, with the potential for information in other languages available online and through the use of language lines for callers. In Indiana, English is th e most commonly -spoken language, but following English, the language Indiana Navigators can expe ct to encounter the most often will be Spanish (see Figure 1 below ). Indiana Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 59 of 291 Navigators and Application Organizations (AOs) available to assist Hoosiers in Spanish are marked with an asterisk ( *) on the Indiana Healthcare Reform website at www.in.gov/healthcarereform/2468.htm . Of the more than 100 languages spoken in the state, Spanish is the second most common language in most counties, followed by German (in Adams, Blackford, Crawford, Daviess, Martin, Perry, and Rush counties) and Chinese (in Monroe County). These language demographics will likely continue to change as the demographics of the state continue to change. As seen in Figure 1, the number of individual German speakers has declined since 2000 while the number of Chinese -speakers has doubled and the number of Pennsylvania Dutch speakers has more than doubled in the same amount of time. Figure 1: Most Comm on Non -English Languages in Indiana, Changes between 2000 and 2010 2010 2000 Spanish 262,198 185,555 German 35,439 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Source: Modern Language Association, (2010) , MLA Language Map Data Center , www.mla.org/map_data Although Indiana Navigators will obviously not be required to speak all of these languages, it is helpful for them to know what resources are available for translation services . One option is r eferring consumers to Indiana Navigators and AOs providing assistance in Spanish. Another such resource is the CMS call center, which the federal agency is to offer to consumers 24 h ours a day, seven days a week. The call center is to offer immediate consu mer assistance in English and Spanish, and will utilize a language line for t hose speaking other languages. The contact information for the federal call center is 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) . 2. Serving Persons with D isabilities The ACA provides requirements that any consumer assistant would be required to have some basic level of competency in working w ith persons with disabilities. There are a broad range of possible difficulties and disabilities that an Indiana Navigator may encounter . Some of these potential disabilities include: Number of speakers Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual I. Consumer Assistance IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 60 of 291 Hearing disability Visual disability Cognitive disability Ambulatory disability Self-care disability Independent living disability In order to further address the n eeds of this diverse group, 45 CFR 155.215 provides that consumer assistants established under a Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) are required to: Ensure consumer edu cation materials, websites, and other resources are accessible to those with disabilities . Provide auxiliary aids and services for individuals with disabilities at no cost (only using consumer family if consumer prefers this over other method s). Provide assistance in a location and in a manner physically accessible to individuals with disabilities . Ensure authorized representatives are able to assist individual with disability make informed decision s. Be able to refer people with disabil ities to local, state, and federal support services . Be able to work with individuals regardless of age, disability, or culture . In Indiana, it is most likely that consumer assistants will work with individuals that have either a cognitive disability or physical challenges in the form of ambulatory or in dependent living disabilities. The following table (see Table 1 6) shows the different categories of disability and the percentage of Hoosiers that report experiencing that disabil ity. Table 16: Percent of Hoosiers with Disabilities, b y Type Type of D isability Prevalence in Indiana in 2013 Hearing D isability 4.1% Visual D isability D isability 5.8% Total Disability Prevalence 13.9 % Source: Cornell University (2015 ), 2013 Disability Status Report: Indiana , www.disabilitystatistics.org/StatusReports/2013 -PDF/2013 -StatusReport_IN.pdf Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 61 of 291 II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs A. Chapter Objectives 1. Understand the Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) (e.g., Medicaid, Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) 2.0, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)) eligibility factors and be able to a ssess whether a consumer might be eligible for an I ndiana Health Coverage Program. 2. Understand what information a consumer need s to provide as part of the Indiana Application for Health Coverage (IAHC) . 3. Understand a consumer 's options for apply ing for IHCPs through the s tate of Indiana . 4. Understand what a consumer should expect after the I AHC is filed . B. Key Terms 1. 1115 (c) Waiver is a vehicle by which the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) may waive certain Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) regulations, allow ing a state to test new or existing way s to deliver and pay for health care services under these two programs . In Indiana, the Healthy Indiana Plan ( HIP) 2.0 operates under an 1115 (c) waiver. 2. 1634 Stat us is a federal designation given to states for determining Medicaid eligibility for the aged, blind, and disabled populations. Under this program, recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) through the federal Social Security Administration (SSA) ob tain automatic Medicaid enrollment and need not complete a separa te state Medicaid application.

It provides free or low -cost health insurance cover age to individuals meeting the s tates' eligibility criteria which are developed within the parameters established by the federal government. In general, Medicaid coverage was available to low-income children, pregnant women, families and the aged, blind and disabled. In 2015 Indiana elected to expand HIP 2.0 to cover all non -disabled adults. Eligibility criteria such as income, resource or age limits vary by eligibility category. Income l imits for eligibility groups which are based on the federal poverty l evel (FPL) are adjusted yearly when the federal government publishes revised federal poverty levels . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 68 of 291 Indiana Medicaid operates several different programs which have been developed to address the medical ne eds of the target populations. These programs are collectively referred to as the Indiana Health Coverage Programs (IHCPs). Each program has different criteria for eligibili ty. Following is a high - level overview of current Indiana Hea lth Coverage P rograms. D. Overview of Indiana Health Coverage Programs 1. Hoosier Healthwise Hoosier Healthwise (HHW) is Indiana Medic aid's program for pregnant women and children under 19 years old . Enrollees excluded from mandatory enrollment in HHW include: Individuals in nursing homes and other long -term care institutions Undocumented individuals who are eligible only for emergency services (Package E - see Table 29) Individuals receiving hospice or home and community -based waiver services Individuals enrolled in Medicaid on the basis of age, blindness or disability Wards of the court and foster children Hoosier Healthwise covers children in both Medicai d and the Children's Health Insurance Program . Individuals eligible for and enrolled in HHW selec t a managed care e ntity (MCE). Hoosier Healthwise MCEs operate similarly to insurance companies in the commercial market and are responsible for managing enrollee's care within a fixed, per -mem ber per -month capitation rate. More information on MCEs can be found in the Medicaid Managed Care Entities - Hoosier Healthwise & HIP 2.0 section . Further information on HHW can be found on at http://provider.indianamedicaid.com/provider -specific -information/managed -care/hoosier - healthwise.aspx . 2. Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) The Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) is for Hoosier non-disabled adults 19-64 years of age (including low - income parents and caretakers previously covered under HHW ) whose family incomes are less than approximately 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and who are not eligible for Medicare or another Medicaid category. HIP 2.0 is authorized through an 1115(c) waiver with CMS32 under Section 1115(c) of the Social Security Act . On January 27, 2015, CMS approved HIP 2.0 as an extension of the original Heal thy Indiana Plan (HIP). In addition, HIP 2.0 was signed into law in Indiana on March 21, 2016 under Publ ic Law 30 . From 2008 -2014, the s tate of Indiana operated the original Healthy Indiana Plan. HIP 2.0 preserves the core principles of t he original HIP , but does make several changes , including the following : In the new HIP 2.0 program, the first $2,500 of m edical expenses for covered benefits are paid with a special savings account called a Personal Wellness and Responsibility (POWER) account. 32 See Indiana waiver submissions, CMS responses, and other correspondences and presentations for Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) approval at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2336.htm . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 69 of 291 This is an increase from $1,100 in the original program. The plan deductible is also increased to $2,500. There is n o longer any limit to the number o f Hoosiers who can enroll in the Healthy Indiana Plan . Any person between the ages of 19 and 64 who has an income under approximately 13 8% FPL and who is otherwise eligible can be a member of HIP 2.0. The new program also includes additional benefits such as maternity coverage without any cost sharing, and dental and vision coverage for HIP Plus members. New features provide options for families to be covered by the same health plan and for members t o participate in their e mployer' s health insurance plans. There are now multiple program options , with significant incentives for all members to participate in the premium HIP Plus program. A new feature of the program is \"Gateway to Work, \" which helps connect HIP members to Indiana' s workforce training programs, work search resources and potential employers. The goals of the original HIP are to: Reduce the number of uninsured low -income Hoosiers Reduce barriers and improve statewide access to healthcare services for low -income Hoosiers Promote value -based decision making and personal health responsibility Promote primary prevention and preventive care services Prevent chronic disease progression with secondary prevention Provide appropriate and quality -based healthcare services Assure state fiscal responsibility and efficient management of the program Through goals of HIP 2.0 are to preserve the core principals of the original HIP while working to: Replace t raditional Medicaid in Indiana for all non -disabled adults Provide new coverage choices for Hoosiers Promote employer -sponsored coverage and family coverage options Improve the health status of Hoosiers Provide health coverage to low-income Hoosiers and ensure an adequate network for both HIP 2.0 and Medicaid enrollees Empowe r participants to make cost -conscious and quality -conscious health care decisions Create pathways to jobs that promote independence from public assistance Ensure that the HIP 2.0 expansion is fiscally sustainable Individuals can be kept apprised of the status of HIP 2.0 through the IHCP s bulletins, banners and newsletters available at http://provider.indianamedicaid.com/news, -bulletins, -and-banners.aspx . Individuals may also consult the HIP 2.0 web site at www.in.gov/fssa/hip . a. Eligibility for HIP 2.0 HIP 2.0 covers Indiana residents bet ween the ages of 19 and 64 whose family incomes are l ess than approximately 138% FPL and who are not eligible for Medicare or another Medicaid c ategory. A calculator may be accessed at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2352.htm that can help someone determine if they are eligible for HIP 2.0 and can estimate what their monthly POWER account contribution would be . For individuals just joining HIP 2.0, they want to make sure to choose a health plan (Anthem, CareS ource Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 70 of 291 Indiana, MDw ise, or Managed Health Services (MHS)) that includes their doctor. They may call 1-877- GET-HIP-9 or email HIP2.0@fssa.in.gov to discuss their options. Once a member's eligibility starts, they may not change their health plan until redetermination of eligibility occurs 12 months after enrollment (EXCEPTION: pregnant women and Native Americans may change plans) . Plans may be changed prior to paying a POWER account contribution or before beginning full eligibility as a HIP Basic member . b. POWER Account Contributions and Preventive Care In the HIP 2.0 program, the first $2,500 of medical expenses for covered benefits are paid with a special savings account called a Personal Welln ess and Responsibility (POWER) a ccount. If annual health care expenses are more than $2,500, the first $2,500 is covered by the member's POWER account, and expenses for additional health services over $2,500 are fully covered at no additional cost to the member (except in the HIP Basic program wh ere the member is responsible for any required copayments). If the member's annual healthcare expenses are less than $2,500 per year, they may rollover their remaining contributions to reduce their monthly payment for the next year. The state will pay most of this amount, but the member will also be responsible for paying a portion of the member's initial healthcare costs based on their income. Monthly POWER account contributions are determined by income and family size and are approxim ately 2% of annual family income with a minimum contribution of one dollar . Income ranges and contribution amounts for all family si zes can be calculated using the tool at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2352.htm . HIP 2.0 empowers members to make important decisions about the cost and quality of their healthcare. As an incentive, members who remain in the HIP Plus program can reduce their POWER account contribution amounts after a year in the program based on the amount remaining in their accounts. If they receive recommended preventive care services throughout the year, the discount will be doubled. Members in the HIP Basic plan also have a POWER account, but since they are not making contributions the potential amount of their disc ount for receiving preventive care is lower. In HIP 2.0, employers and non -profits can contribute any amount up to the full contribution amount. In addition, the health plans may implement a rewards program that allows members to \"earn\" additional dollar s in their POWER account. Total contributions may not exceed the members required contribution to their POWER account. If a HIP 2.0 member choose s to leave the program early, the member's contributions not spent on health care costs may be returned to the member. Since contributions are based on a projected annual amount, leaving the progr am early may also result in the member being required to pay the contributions for the remaining months of the enrollment period. This may occur if the member had significant health care expenses before leaving the program. As long as members make their required monthly POWER account contributions, they will have no other costs. The only exception to this is a charge of up to $25 if a member goes to the hospital emergen cy room for a non -emergency. Each month, the member's health plan will send a monthly statement showing how much is left in their POWER account. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 71 of 291 Members who make POWER account contributions on -time each month participate in HIP Plus where they have better benefits and predictable costs. Members with i ncomes above the FPL that choose not to make their POWER account contributions will be removed from the program and not be allowed to re-enroll for six months. This enrollment lockout will not apply if t he mem ber is medically frail, residing in a domestic violence shelter or in a state -declared disaster area (not in policy), obtained and subsequently lost private insurance coverage, has a loss of income after disqualification due to increased income, or took up residence in another state and later returned to Indiana. Members who have incomes below the FPL who do not make their contributions will be moved to the HIP Basic plan. HIP Basic does not cover vision and dental coverage and could be more expensive. The Basic plan requires members to make a small payment, called a copayment, each time they go to the doctor or hospital except for preventive ca re or family planning services. Unlike POWER account contributions, which belong to the member and could be return ed if the member leaves the program early, copays ca nnot be returned to the member. POWER account contributions are paid directly to the member's health plan (Anthem, CareSource Indiana, MDwise, or Managed Health Services ( MHS )). Members will receive information from their health plans about the various ways POWER account contributions can be paid. These include by mail, over the phone, online and via payroll deduction through the member's employer. Each health plan also has des ignated retail locations around the state where you can make your payment in person. Members may call their health plan for details abo ut these options and locations. c. Pathways to Coverage - HIP Plus, HIP Basic, HIP Employer Link , HIP State Plan HIP 2.0 has four \"pathways to coverage\" \u2014HIP Plus, HIP Basic, HIP Employer Link , and the HIP State Plan \u2014discussed further in the following sections. The following table (see Table 17) shows the distinctions between these pathways to coverage: Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 72 of 291 Table 17 : HIP Plus, HIP Basic, HIP Employer Link , and HIP State Plan - Comparison Chart HIP Plus HIP Basic HIP Employer Link HIP State Plan Who Is Eligible?

HIP Plus The initial plan selection for all HIP 2.0 members is HIP Plus , which offers the best value for members. HIP Plus has comprehensive benefits including vision and dental. The member pays an affordable monthly POWER account contribution based on income. There is no copayment required for receiving services with one exce ption: using the emergency room wh ere there is no true emergency. HIP Plus provides more benefits than the HIP Basic program, including vision and dental services. It also allows more visits for physical, speech and occupational therapy, and covers additi onal services like bariatric surgery and Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMJ) treatment. With HIP Plus, members can get 90 -day refills on prescriptions and receive medication by mail order. Members also receive medication therapy management services tha t are designed to work closely with their doctors and pharmacies to provide additional assurances that prescription therapies are safe and effective. HIP Plus also has the option for member's to participate in \"Fast Track.\" Fast Track is a payment option that allows eligible Hoosiers to expedite the start of their coverage in the HIP Plus program. Fast Track allows a member to make a $10 payment while the member's application is being processed. T he $10 payment may be made on the application or to the MCE a fter applying and g oes toward the first POW ER account contribution. If the member make s a Fast Track payment and is eligible for HIP 2.0, the member's HIP Plus coverage will begin the first of the month in which the member made the Fast Track payment or the first payment of their POWER account contribution . To learn more about Fast Track payments, visit the HIP 2.0 website at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2501.htm . Members can only get into HIP Plus at initial enr ollment, for 60 days after redetermination , or if they become ineligible for HIP Basic due to an increase in income. Once a member pays they cannot change managed care entities. A provider bulletin regarding selecting a HIP 2.0 health plan is available at http://provider.indianamedicaid.com/ihcp/Bulletins/BT201581.pdf . There is also a provider bulletin regarding start dates available at http://provider.indianamedicaid.com/ihcp/Bulletins/BT201607.pdf . ii. HIP Basic HIP Basic is the fallback option for members with household income less than or equal to 100% of FPL who do not make their POWER account contr ibutions. HIP Basic coverage begins the firs t day of the month after the 60 -day payment period expires for HIP Plus. Individuals with income under 100% FPL who do not make a POWER account contribution will move to HIP Basic coverage after 60 days of non - payment. The benefits are reduced. E ssential health benefits (EHBs) are covered but not vision or dental services , bariatric surgery or Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMJ) . HIP Basic benefits also allow fewer visits to physical, speech and occupational therapists. Unlike HIP Plus, HIP Basic has more limited options for getting medication. Members are limited to 30 -day prescription supply and cannot order medications by mail. HIP Basic also does not provide medication therapy management services. The HIP Basic member is also required to make a copayment each time the member receives a health care service, such as going to the doctor, filling a prescription or staying in the hospital. These Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 74 of 291 payments may range from $4 to $8 per doctor visit or prescription f illed and may be as high as $75 per hospital stay. The following table (see Table 18 ) shows the HIP Basic copayment am ounts: Table 18: HIP Basic Copayment Amounts Service HIP Basic Copayment Amounts Outpatient services, including office visits $4 Inpatient services, including hospital stays $75 Preferred drugs $4 Non -preferred drugs $8 Non -emergency ER visit $8 for the first occurrence, $25 each time thereafter* *Also applies to HIP Plus Source: Family and Socia l Services Administration , www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2457.htm HIP Basic can be much more expensive than HIP Plus. Members in the HIP Basic plan will still use the POWER account to cover their $2,500 annual dedu ctible, but the funds in the account will be contributed entirely by the s tate. HIP Basic plan members will still receive POWER account statements to assist them in managing the account and to increase their awareness of the cost of the healthcare services they receive. HIP Basic coverage begins the first day of the month after the 60 -day payment period expires for HIP Plus. Individuals with income under 100% FPL who do not make a POWER account contribution will move to HIP Basic coverage after 60 days of non-payment. iii. HIP Employer Link HIP Employer Link is an option for eligible HIP 2.0 members who work an d have access to their employer' s health p lan. HIP Employer Link members have a POWER account and contribute to their coverage like other HIP 2.0 members. But with HIP Employer Link , the POWER account can be used to pay the insurance premiums and out -of-pocket medical expe nses associated with the member' s employer -sponsored plan. The employer must choose to participate in HIP Employer Link and be reg istered with the state. Employers also mu st contribute 50% of the member' s premium. Members can receive counseling on whether their employer plan would be best suited for them. Individuals with access to employer -sponsored health insurance do not have to use their employer's plan and will be given the option to choose based on which plan is b est for their individual health care needs. All HIP -eligible adults with access to employer -sponsored insurance will receive options counseling through an enrollme nt broker regarding whether enrollment in HIP 2.0 or their employer plan would be best suited to their individual needs and situation. Individuals with employer -sponsored insurance can request HIP Employer Link when they file their application or, if they are already enrolled, can report a change with DFR and request to transfer to HIP Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 75 of 291 Employer Link . HIP Employer Link coverage may begin as soon as the month of application, but will not overlap with any existing HIP or Medicaid coverage. Individuals who ch oose to enroll in employer -sponsored insurance will still have a POWER account and will be required to m ake monthly contributions. The s tate will fund the POWER account to the average amount that an individual covered by an employer -sponsored plan may be e xpected to spend for premium an d other out -of-pocket expenses. Individuals in HIP Employer Link receive a premium reimbursement from their POWER account on a monthly basis to help cover the costs of employer - sponsored insurance. Individuals with employer -sponsored insurance can request HIP Employer Link when they file their application or if they are already enrolled can report a change with the DFR and request to transfer to HIP Employer Link . HIP Employer Link coverage may begin as soon as the month of application but will not overlap with any existing HIP or Medicaid coverage. More information about HIP Employer Link is available at www. hipemployerlink.in.gov . iv. HIP State Plan Enhanced HIP 2.0 benefits are available to low-income parents and caretakers, transitional medical assistance (TMA) individuals, and individuals whose health status qualifies them as \"medically frail. \" As defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an individual will be consider ed medically frail if the individual has one or more of the following: Disabling mental disorder; A chronic substance abuse disorder; Serious and complex medical conditions; Physical, intellectual or developmental disability that significantly impair the individual's ability to perform one or more activities of daily living; or A disability determination based on Social Security Administration (SSA) criteri a. A list of conditions that ma y qualify someone as medically frail is available on the HIP 2.0 website at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2465.htm . The process for determining whether someone qualifies as medically frail is available at http://provider.indianamedicaid.com/ihcp/Bulletins/BT201619.pdf . The HI P State Plan benefits grant the individual comprehensive coverage including vision, dental, non - emergency transportation, chiropractic services and Medicaid Rehabilitation Option services. These HIP State Plan benefits will continue as long as the eligibility status or health condition, disorder or disability status continues to qualify the person as medically frail. For individuals found to be medically frail, the HIP State Plan benefits will begin the first of the month following the frail determination. The MCE (Anthem, CareS ource Indiana, MDwis e, or Managed Health Services ( MHS )) may contact the member annually to review their health condition. It is important to answer their questions to maintain HIP State Plan benefits. If the member fails to verify the member's condition at the r equest of the health plan, the member could still have access to comprehensive coverage including vision and dental, by participating in HIP Plus, but would lose access to the additional HIP State Plan benefits including Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 76 of 291 coverage for non -emergency transportation and ch iropractic services. If the member has questions about or changes in the member's health condition, the member should contact the health plan directly. d. Becoming Pregnant While on HIP 2.0 In the original HIP program, members were required to leave HIP a nd transfer to Medicaid when they became pregnant. Under the new HIP 2.0 program, maternity services are covered. HIP 2.0 members who are pregnant may keep their coverage for the duration of their pregnancy or until their annual redetermination (whichever comes first). Pregnant members who stay in HIP 2.0 will have all cost sharing suspended and will receive additional benefits during their pregnancy including non -emergency transportation. A pregnant HIP 2.0 member must promptly report her pregnancy. After reporting a pregnancy, pregnant mothers will initially have a choice to stay in t heir HIP Basic/HIP Plus plan or transfer to HIP Maternity. HIP Maternity coverage is under Hoosier Healthwise and is more like a traditional Medicaid program. The member will not have a POWER account or receive monthly statements to track heal thcare costs. Neither choice will result in a noticeable difference in benefits. All pregnant women will receive additional benefits such as vision, dental, non -emergency transportation a nd access to additional smoking cessation services designed specific ally for them. Before deciding which pregnancy coverage option is best for them, pregnant members should talk to their doctor s and make sure the doctor is in the health plan's network. If a pregnant member's annual red etermination occurs during pregnancy, federal guidelines require that she be moved to HIP Maternity. Again, she will not notice any changes in her benefits or cost -sharing. At the end of pregnancy, the member's additional pr egnancy benefi ts will continue for another 60 -day post -partum period. The member will continue to not have any cost sharing responsibilities during this period. However she should promptly report to the state that her pregnancy has ended to prevent any breaks in coverage. At the end of the post -partum period, her cost -sharing will resume. She must begin paying her POWER account contribution at this time to mai ntain HIP Plus benefits. If she fails to promptly report the end of her pregnancy and/or pay her PO WER account contribution, she could face a gap in co verage. e. Gateway to Work Gateway to Work is a new feat ure of HIP 2.0 that helps connect HIP 2.0 members to Indiana's workforce training programs, volunteer work, work search resources , hiring events, and potential employers. HIP 2.0 members who are unemployed or working less than 20 hours per week will be referred to available employment, work search and job training programs that will assist them in securing new or potentially better employment. Gateway to Work is a voluntary program. HIP 2.0 members will be notified if they have been referred to the program. Eligibility for HIP 2.0 coverage is not affected if a mem ber chooses to not participate. Those interested in participating in Gateway to Wor k should call 1 -800-403-0864 and select Option 1 for the health coverage menu and the n Option 6 for Gateway to Work. More information about Gateway to Work may be found at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2466.htm . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 77 of 291 f. How to Apply for HIP 2.0 HIP 2.0 a pplications are available online at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov , by mail or by visiting your local Division of Family Resources (DFR) office - listed by county at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov . Applicants can call 1-877-GET-HIP-9 to find more information about the appl ication process or to find their local DFR office. Once an applicant submits the application with all required information, a pplications are processed within 45 business days. After you r application is processed, the applicant will rece ive a letter by mail stating whether the applicant qualifies for the program. Once approved for HIP 2.0, the new member will be assigned to the health plan33 the member chose on the application. If the member does not choose a health plan , one will be selected for them. Then the health plan will mail the member a welcome packet. An invoice for their POWER account contribution will also be received. Coverage for HIP Plus members begins in the month when their first POWER account contributions or Fast Track payments are received and processed. HIP Basic coverage begins the first of the month af ter the invoice payment period. All HIP 2.0 members will receive a letter informing them when coverage starts and how to get the most out o f their HIP 2.0 benefits. g. Payment of the POWER Account Invoice Once the POWER account invoice or $10 fast track prepayment is made, the i ndividual cannot change managed care entities (MCEs) . The individual gets 60 days to pay from the date of the initial $10 fast track invoice and does not receive additional time to pay after being found eligible for benefits and receiving an invoice for their actual POWER account amount. Individuals may choose an MCE on the application or call the enrollment broker at 1-877-GET-HIP-9 (1- 877-438-4479) to make an MCE change. The enrollment broker will only make a plan change if the individual has not yet paid their POWER account contribution. Making a fast track payment or a POWER account prepayment is the only way to get into HIP Plus, if an individual want to change plans and has not received an invoice to pay they should call their preferred health plan (see Table 19 ) to make a payment as soon as possible to make sur e they can enroll in HIP Plus. The enrollment broker can also help individuals find the plan that works best for them and includes their preferred doctor in their network. Individuals should call the enrollment brok er with questions about plans, or to change plans prior to enrolling or at their annu al eligibility redetermination. If an individual wants to change plans for the next year they must do so 45 days prior to the end of their benefit year. h. Hoosier Healthwise and HIP 2.0 Managed Care Entities The s tate of Indiana contracts with managed care e ntities (MCEs) to provide a variety of services to Hoosi er Healthwise and HIP 2.0 enrollees. The same MCEs are available for both programs with the goal 33 As comparison of the three available HIP 2.0 health plans in 2016 (Anthem, MDwise, and Managed Health Services (MHS)) is available at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/files/IN -HIP-PlanChartSmmry_41MAX_031015.pdf .

Managed care entities provide the following services and functions: Developing a network of contracted providers from whom enrollees receive covered services Case management Disease management Operating a member services helpline to address all enrollee questions, complaints and concerns Screeni ng enrollees for special hea lthcare needs and coordinating the provision of necessary healthcare services as a result of the screening outcomes Operating a 24 -hour nurse call l ine, which is available to provide around -the-clock medical advice from trained medical professionals Provid ing member handbooks to enrollees outlining covered benefits, available services, etc. Managing member grievances and appeals Utilization management (processing prior authorizations in accordance with medical management criteria and practice guidelines, et c.) Operating member incentive programs to encourage appropriate utilization of health services and/or health promoting behaviors Provider claims payment Quality management Indiana currently contracts with four MCEs ou tlined in the following table (see Table 1 9): Table 19: HIP 2.0 and Hoosier Healthwise Managed Care Entities (MCEs) MCE Member are given the opportunity to select an MCE on their applicati on. Those that do not select an MCE are auto -assigned to one, according to a state designed auto -assignment methodology. The auto - assignment methodology is designed to promote continuity of care for enrollees and considers factors such as previous MCE enrollment and enrollment of family members. All applicants should be encouraged to select an MCE at the time of application to facilitate member choice versus auto - assignment. Some factors for benefic iaries to consider when selecting an MCE include the following: Provider network o If an individual has an established relationship with the doctor, is that doctor available in the MCE network? o Are the locations of network providers easil y accessible for th e enrollee? Are the locations convenient to the individual's work, home or school? Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 79 of 291 Special programs and enhanced services o MCEs offer disease management, wellness programs, educational p rograms and enhanced benefits. Is there a service or program offered by the MCE that is particularly important or attractive to the enrollee? Individuals that need assistance in selecting an MCE can contact the following helplines (see Table 20) administered by the state's enrollment b roker, MAXIMUS .

Current members are exempt from this requirement until their next MRT scheduled progress report, at which time they will be required to submit an application to SSA for a disability determination. If no progress report is due, the SSA application requirement is waived, and th e individual will continue to meet the disability requirement based on the SSA determination. If this SSA application has not been submitted within 45 days of the MRT progress report due date, the member will be rendered ineligible. If the member has not f ully recovered, the member will continue to be eligible. Applicants seekin g eligibility under the MADI (M .E.D.

This includes facilities operated by the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA), Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA), and Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH). The 590 Program does Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 84 of 291 not cover incarcerated individuals residing in Department of Corrections (DOC) facilities. 590 Program enrollees are eligible for Package A benefits with the exception of transportation which is provided by the facility. The 590 Program differs from traditional Medicaid and Hoosier Healthwise in the following ways: If a member enrolled in the 590 Program receives services that have a total billed amount per claim of less than $150, the 590 Program facility where the member resides is responsible for payment of the service. Prior authorization (PA) is required for all services equal to or greater than $500 per service per claim provided to members enrolled in the 590 Program. The 590 Program covers only services rendered outside the 590 program facility. Transportation is not a covered service. Transportation must be p rovided by the facility where the member resides. Identification cards are not issued to members enrolled in the 590 Program. An IHCP member who resides in a state -owned facility may have a Hoosier Health Card, but IHCP eligibility is terminated upon entry into the facility unless the member is younger than 21 years old or older than 65 years old. All providers must verify that the member enrolled in the 590 Program resides in a state -owned facility. All members enrolled in the 590 Program must be chaperone d to off -site providers. Individuals who are on probation or incarcerated are not eligible for the 590 Program. The 590 Program does not cover targeted case management (TCM) services.

Presumptive Eligibility Presumptive eligibility (PE) allows individuals meeting the eligibility requirements described in this section to have services covered and paid for by Medicaid pending the outcome of a full Medicaid determination. Prior to January 1, 2014, Indiana only o perated PE for pregnant women. Beginning in 2014, states were required to allow hospitals to make PE determinations for Medicaid, regardless of if the state opts to offer PE for other populations. The PE application process entails a simplified application in which individuals attest to basic information such as s elf-declared income and basic demographic information. Verification documents are not required duri ng the PE application process. Individuals must know their gross family income and citizenship status at the time of application for presumptive e ligibility . The PE period extends from the date an individual is determined presumptively eligible until: When an Indiana Application for Health Coverage (IAHC) is filed: Day on which a decision is made on that application or the first of the month after the decision is made on the application , for example: o Denials - coverage ends the day the decision was made on the application o Approval s for non -HIP - the day th e decision was made on the applicat ion o Approvals f or HIP - 1st of the month after the decision was made on the application When an Indiana Health Coverage Application is not filed: Last day of the month following the month in which the PE determination was made Individuals do not have appeal rights for PE determinations. If a PE individual is subsequently determined Medicaid ineligible after the IAHC is processed, the provider still receives reimbursement for the services provided during the PE period.

General Medicaid Factors of Eligibility Each Medicaid assistance (or aid) category (described in further detail in the Eligibility Groups section has specific eligibility requirements such as age, income, pregnancy status and resource limits (resource limits apply to non -modified adjusted gross i ncome (non -MAGI) populations only). In addition to these aid category specific requirements, to be eligible for Medicaid, an individual must meet the following gene ral eligibility requirements de scribed in the following sections . This section is intended to provide a general overview of the eligibility requirement s.

Residency To be eligible for Medicaid, an applicant must be a res ident of the state of Indiana. For non - institutionalized individuals over the age of 21 and emancipated or married individuals under the age of 21, the state of residency is where the individual is living and intends to reside, inclu ding without a fixed address or has entered the state with a job commitment or seeking employment, whet her or not currently employed. Homeless individuals and residents of shelters located in Indiana m eet the residency requirement. For non -institutionalize d individuals not capable of stating intent and individuals under 21, the state of residency is where the individual is living. An individual is considered incapable of stating intent if any of the following applies: Has an intelligence quotient (I.Q.) of 49 or less, or a mental age of seven or less Is judged legally incompetent; or Is found incapable of indicating intent based on medical documentation obtained from a physician, psychologist, or other person licensed by the state in the field of mental retardation Prior to 2014, federal regulations included in the definition of state residency the individual's intention to remain in the state permanently or f or an indefinite time period. This requirement no longer applies effective January 1, 2014. For institutionalized individuals, the following residency rules apply: For individuals under the age of 21 o Parent's (or guardian's) state of residence at the time of institutional placement o Current state of residence of parent, guardian or person who files application for child if the child is institutionalized in that state For individuals ages 21 and over o The state where the individual is living and intends to reside o If the individual became incapable of indicating intent at or after age 21, the stat e in which the individual is physically present (except when another state makes an Indiana placement) For individuals who became incapable of indicating intent before age 21 o Parent's (or guardian's) state if they live in a separate state o Parent's (or guar dian's) state at time of institutional placement o Current state of residence of parent, guardian or person who files application for individual if the individual is institutionalized in that state Residency will be determined based upon the address provide d on the Indiana Application for Health Coverage (IAHC) and electronic data sources. When electronic data sources indicate potential residency in another state, paper documentation verifying residency is requested (see Verifying Factors of Eligibility section for additional information). There is not a required minimum time period for state residency to be Medicaid eligible and individuals are permitted to be temporarily absent from the state without losing eligibility. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 101 of 291 2. Citizenship/Immigration Status To be eligible for Medicaid, a n individual must be a U .S. citizen or a U .S. non-citizen national or an immigrant who is in a qualified immigration status. The individual attests to citizenship/immigration status on the Indiana Application for Health Coverage . Electronic data sources through the Federal Hub are reviewed and if the individual's status is not verified electronically, paper documentation is required (see the Verifying Factors of Eligibility section for additional information). During the time period when the discrepancy is being resolved (except in cases where the individual attested to citizenship/eligible immigration status and the electronic data sources indicate non - citizenship/non -eligible immigration status), if a n individual otherwise meets the eligibility requirements, the individual is provided Medicaid benefits in accord ance with federal regulations. This is referred to as the \"r easonable opportunity period.\" The reasonable opportunity period begins on the date the individual receives the written notice regarding the agency's inability to verify citizenship or immigra tion. Date of receipt is considered to be five days after the date on the notice. The reasonable opportunity period ends 90 days from the date of r eceipt ( i.e., 95 days from the date on the notice). The following individuals are exempt from the citizenship verification process: Individuals receiving Social Security Income ( SSI) or Social Security Disability Income ( SSDI ) Individuals enrolled in Medicare Individuals in foster care and who are assisted under Title IV -B of the Social Security Act (SSA) and individuals who are beneficiaries of foster care maintenance or adoption assista nce payments under Title IV -E of the SSA Newborns born to a Medicaid enrolled mother ( i.e., deemed newborns) Individuals who are not citizens of the U .S. may qualify for Medicaid base d on th eir immigration status. The following statuses are eligible (see Table 30): IMPORTANT NOTE : Indiana Navigators should always confirm whether or not a consumer is a U.S. citizen in order to answer the U.S. -citizen question correctly on the Indiana Application for Health Coverage and provide any supporting documentation (if applicable). Navigators must never state that a non -citizen is a citizen, or vise -versa. Also, a permanent resident may be considered a citizen if he or she has been in the U.S. for at least five years.

Requirement to Provide a Social Security Number Each Medicaid applicant must supply a social security number (SSN) on the Indiana Application for Health Coverage (IAHC) with the following exceptions: Individual is not eligible to receive a SSN Individual does not have a SSN and may only be issued one for a valid non -work reason Individual refuses to obtain one due to well -established religious objections Individual is only eligible for emergency services due to immigration status Individual is a deemed newborn Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 103 of 291 Individual is receiving Refugee Cash Assistance and is eligible for Medicaid Individual has already applied for SSN If necessary, the state Division of Family Resources (DFR) will assist the applicant in obtaining a social security number . The DFR will also request the SSN of other household members whose income is counted in the eligibility determination. However, these individuals are not required to provide. 4. Requirement to File for Other B enefits Individuals must apply for all other benefits for which they may be eligible as a condition of eligibility, unless good cause can be shown for not doing so. Benefits that must be applied for include, but are not limited to: Pensions from local, state, or federal government Retirement benefits Disability Social Security benefits Veterans' benefits Unemployment compensation benefits Military benefits Railroad retirement benefits Workmen's Compensation benefits Health and accident insurance payments I. Assignment of Medical Rights Medicaid applicants must cooperate in identifying and providing information about responsible third parties who may be financially liable for care and services unless good cause is established for n ot providing such informati on. This includes cooperating in establishing paternity and obtaining medical support and pa yments from the absent parent. Any circumstances in which cooperation would result in serious physical or emotional harm to the individual or is against the best interests of the child for whom medical support is sought or paternity is being established is considered good cause. As of July 1, 2011, in support of P.L. 153-2011 , the assignment of medical rights be came operational by s tate law. This means that no separately executed assignment of rights is required for Medicaid eligibility. J. Access to Other Insurance Individuals can have other insurance (often referred to as \"third liability \") and be enrolled in Medicaid. However, individuals cannot have other insurance and enroll in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP ) or Healthy Indiana Plan ( HIP 2.0). Individuals are required to provide information on their application regarding any other insurance t hey have . Pursuant to state and federal law, Medicai d is the payer of last resort. Therefore, if a Medicaid enrolled individual has third party liability, th e other insurance serves as the prim ary payer. Medicaid is responsible for the payment of the member's coinsurance, deductibles, copayment s and other cost-Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 104 of 291 sharing expenses up to Medicaid's allowed amount. Medicaid's total liability must not exceed the state's allowed amount minus the amount paid by the primary payer. Medicaid recipients are responsible for reporting all changes in insurance to the Division of Family Resources ( DFR) via a phone call to 1 -800-403-0864, by mail to the FSSA Document Center (P.O. Box 1810, Marion, IN 46952 ), online through the FSSA Benefit s Portal or at a local office (listed at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov ). K. Eligibility Determination and Enrollment Standard Changes under the A ffordable Care Act Beginning in 2014, t he Affo rdable Care Act (ACA) implemented changes in how Medicaid eligibility is determined . Income eligibility determination for children, pregnant women, non -disabled adults under the age of 65, and parents and caretaker relatives was replaced by a methodology referred to as modified adjusted gross i ncome (MAGI). Former financial methodologies remain in place for individuals who are ex empt from MAGI . Additional changes include d a new application, referred to as the Indiana Application for Health Coverage (IAHC) ,37 methods under which applications will be accepted, verification policies , and redetermination standards. 1. Medicaid Modifi ed Adjusted Gross Income Methodologies Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) methodologies were implemented for eligibil ity effective January 1, 2014. In accordance with federal regulations , states have begun utilizing MAGI methodologies since the initial Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) open enrollment peri od, which began on October 1, 2013. Individuals who are found potentially eligible for premium tax c redits (PTC s) and cost -sharing r eductions (CSR s) will have their IAHC and electronic account transf erred to the FFM for final determination of eligibility for those programs, if the Medicaid denial was based on income ineligibility versus procedural reasons ( e.g., failure t o submit required information or withdraw al of application ). MAGI methodologies will be used for determining Medicaid eligibility for parent and caretaker relatives , children and pregnant women. MAGI methodologies also app ly to CHIP and HIP 2.0. Indiana's eligibility categories which will be dete rmined based on MAGI are outlined in further detail in the Eligibility Groups section . MAGI is a methodology based on federal tax rules for income counting and determining household size and composition for the purposes of determining whose income will be counted in an individual's Medicaid or C HIP eligibility determination. While based on tax rules, MAGI is not simply a number found on an individual's tax return. MAGI household income is the sum of the MAGI -base d income (defined in the figure below) of every individual included in the individual's household. If an individual is found ineligible, a 5% FPL disregard is then applied to determine if the application of this disregard renders the individual eligible. Under MAGI there is no asset test. Income disregards as they are applied t oday are no longer implemented. Deductions that can be filed on taxes such as alimony paid and student loan interest are deducted from countable income. Generally, taxable income is counted for Medicaid & CHIP eligibility 37 The Indiana Application for Health Coverage (IAHC) may be accessed online by going to www.dfrbenefits.in.gov , selecting \"Apply for benefi for Health Coverage . . .\" Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 105 of 291 and non -taxable income is not counted under MAGI. Modified adjusted gross income is calculated as follows (see Figure 2 ): Figure 2: Modified Adjusted Gross Income (M AGI) Calculation Source: 26 CFR \u00a71.36B-1 While tax return data will not be used in Indiana to calculate MAGI (with the exception of self -employed individuals who will be required to provide a tax return or current business records), adjusted gross income referred to in the figure above is calcula ted based on the tax rules that generate Adjusted Gross Income on an individual's tax return (Line 37 on U.S. Individual Income Tax Return - Form 1040). MAGI income counting methodologies for Medicaid are generally aligned with Premium Tax Credit (PTC) income counting rules, with the following exceptions: Lump sum payments are counted as income only in the month received Scholarships, awards or fellowships used for educational purposes and not for living expenses are excluded Payments or distributions re lated to American Indian/Alaska Native designation are excluded In determining household size and composition under Medicaid MAGI rules, for a tax filer, the individual's household includes the tax filer and all tax dependents. A tax dependent's household is the same as that of the tax filer that claims the dependant . If an individual is not a tax filer or is claimed as a dependent but: Is other than a spouse, biological, adopted or step child of the tax filer Is under 19 and living with both parents who do not file a joint return Is under 19 and claimed as a tax dependent by a non -custodial parent o Custodial parent is determined based on a court order or binding separation, divorce or custody agreement establishing physical custody controls. If there is n o such order or agreement or in the event of a shared custody agreement, the custodial parent is the parent with whom the child spends most nights. Then the household size consists of the individual and the following other individuals with whom the individual lives: The individual's spouse The individual's biological, adopted or step -children under 19 If the individual is under 19 - the individual's parents and siblings under 19 (including biological, adopted and step) Adjusted Gross Income Tax Excluded Foreign Earned Income Tax Exempt Interest Tax Exempt Title II Social Security Income MAGI Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 106 of 291 Married couples living togeth er are included in the same household regardless of tax filing status ( i.e., regardless of if a joint tax return is filed or one spouse is claimed as a dependent). A child's incom e is not counted when the child lives with a natural, adopted, or step parent and is not expected to be required to file a tax return. A tax dependent that is not expected to file a tax return for the year in which eligibility is being determined is not included in the household income o f the taxpayer whether or not such a tax dependent files a return. For a pregnant woman under MAGI rules, her unborn child(ren) is counted in determining her household size for Med icaid eligibility. In determining the household size for other household mem bers' eligibility, the unborn child(ren) is not counted. The figure below illustrates the household composition rules under MAGI (see Figure 3 ).

In Medicaid, unborn children are included in household size for pregnant women.

That is, Medicaid eligibility is determined based on current monthly income and family size. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II.

The following are key changes: Child support received is no longer counted as income Veterans benefits no longer counted as in come Worker's compensation no longer counted as income Self-employment and farm income after depreciation and deduction of capital losses is counted Income Disregards The state disregards (or does not c ount) certain types of income. Disregards vary somewhat by eligibility category but examples include a $50 disregard of monthly child support and disregard of expenses for dependent's care. Income disregards no longer appli ed (were c onsidered in MAGI conversion). General 5% FPL disreg ard applied when consumer ineligible. Expenses that are tax deductible are deducted from income. Household Composition Rules Household composition rules vary somewhat by eligibility category but the following generally applies: Stepparents and stepsiblings are excluded Children's income counted for parents'/ siblings' household income and family size, but if this causes ineligibility of family, a second step is performed for individual determinations to ensure eligibility is not caused by children/sibling income Adult c hildren not included in household Stepparents, stepchildren and stepsiblings are now included in the household The income of children & siblings who are required to file a tax return is counted Adult children claimed as a tax dependent are now included in the household of the tax filer Source: 42 CFR \u00a7435.603 Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 108 of 291 a. MAGI Conversion Process As part of the transition to MAGI -based me thodologies in 2014, states were required to convert income eligibility standards to a MAGI equivalent . This is referred to a s the MAGI conversion process. The goal of the MAGI conversion process is to establish a MAGI -based income standard that is not less than the effective income eligibility standard for each eligibility group as applied on the date of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enactme nt. As a result o f this process, the income standard for some eligibility groups have changed effective January 1, 2014. Under pre -MAGI rules, the state applied various income disregards to a Medicaid applicant's gross income. Income disregards varied somewhat by elig ibility group and income type. Examples of income disregards applied by Indiana pre -MAGI include a $90 earned income disregard, $50 disregard of monthly child support income received and disregards for expen ses for dependent's care. Under pre - MAGI rules these income disregards were deducted from an individual's or family's gross incom e to determine the net income. If the individual's resulting net income was below the income standard for the applicable eligibility group, the individual was found Medicaid eligib le. As described previously, under MAGI rules, income disregards will no longer be allowed with the exception of a general 5% FPL deduction in certain cases and the application of deductions that can b e filed on taxes. Therefore, the MAGI conversion proce ss is intended to determine a MAGI -based income eligibility standard for each MAGI -based eligibility group that is equivalent to the income standard for each eligibility group under pre -MAGI rules. To calculate the MAGI equivalent for each eligibility group, the federal government implemented a standardize d MAGI conversion methodology. Under this standardized methodology, an average disregard amount was calculated for each eligibility group and added to the pre -MAGI income threshold to determine the MAG I equivalent standard. Following is a high level overview of the standardized MAGI conversion process: 1. Calculate the average size of the disregards for individuals whose net income falls within 25% of the FPL below the net income standard 2. Add this average disregard amount to the net income eligibility standard 3. Step 1 + Step 2 = MAGI eligibility standard for the eligibility group The following table (see Table 32) outlines the income standards for Indiana's eligibility groups that will utilize the MAG I equivalent income threshold. Because CHIP eligibility prior to 2014 was based on gross income, a MAGI equivalent calculation was not required and the income standard will remain at 250% of the f ederal poverty level.

Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 109 of 291 Table 32: Indiana' s Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Equivalent Thresholds Eligibility Group Pre-2014 Income Standard MAGI Equivalent Standard Parents and Caretaker Relatives * & 19-21 Residing in Inpatient Psych Facility Eligible for TANF if Living at Home & Children Aged 19 -20 Who Meet Low Income Families Medicaid Income Standard Family Size Monthly Income 1 $139.50 2 $229.50 3 $288.00 4 $346.50 5 $405.00 6 $463.50 7 $522.00 For each additional family member add $58.50 Family Size Monthly Income 1 $152.00 2 $247.00 3 $310.00 4 $373.00 5 $435.00 6 $498.00 7 $561.00 For each additional family member add $63.00 Pregnant Women 200% FPL 208% FPL Children under Age 1: Medicaid Coverage 200% FPL 208% FPL Children Ages 1 -18: Medicaid Coverage 150% FPL 158% FPL Independent Foster Care Adolescents 200% FPL 210% FPL Family Planning Services 133% FPL 141% FPL *These are now covered under HIP 2.0. Source: Family and Social Servic es Administration, Modified Adjusted Gross Income ( MAGI ) In sum, due to the MAGI conversion process, the income standard for some groups appears higher than the pre -2014 income stan dard for Medicaid eligibility. However, because income disregards were previously applied when determining an individual's eligibility, effectively increasing the income standard for eligibility, at the aggregate level these income standards should be comparable. b. Non -MAGI Populations Certain populations are exempt from MAGI methodologies and former Medicaid eligibility rules w ill continue to apply . These exempted populations include: Individuals aged 65 or older when age is a condition of eligibility Individuals being determined for eligibility on the basis of blindness or disability Individuals a pplying for long -term services and supports fo r which a level -of-care (LOC) need is a condition of eligibility ( e.g., Home and Community -Based Services (HCBS) waivers, nursing home LOC) Individuals whose eligibility does not require an income determination to be made by the Medicaid agency ( e.g., cove rage under the Breast & Cervical Cancer Treatment Program) Individuals applying for Medicare cost -sharing (Medicare Savings Program) New mandatory former foster children under age 26 Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 110 of 291 Deemed newborns The income counting and household compositions rules for determining eligibility for MAGI exempt categories remai n the policies in place today. Asset (also referred to as resource) limits and income disregards can be applied to non -MAGI groups. Resources are real or personal property that is owne d jointly or by an individual. The owner of a resource is any individual who has the ability to liquidate or dispose of the resource. Resources include, but are not limited to: Cash on hand Checking accounts Savings accounts Savings certificates Trust funds Individual r etirement accounts Keogh plans Credit union accounts Burial accounts Prepaid funeral agreements Stocks Bonds Nursing home accounts Some items are not counted as assets, including: An indiv idual's home (refers to homestead property as unoccupied or rental properties are counted as an asset) A vehicle if it is used for transportation for the indiv idual or a member of their household; Household goods such as furniture and appliances Personal items such as jewelry or clothes Burial plots, irrevocabl e funeral trusts and term life insurance Eligibility determination for a non -MAGI category can be trigg ered through multiple methods. An individual applying through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) or the state Division of Family Resources (DFR) may request a determination for a non -MAGI category during the course of t he MAGI determination process . Additionally, the Indiana Application for Health Coverage includes screening questions to capture potential elig ibility for non -MAGI Medicaid. Answering in the affirmative to any of the disability or long -term care related questions will trigger review f or potential eli gibility for a non - MAGI group. An applicant is not obligated to go through the non -MAGI determination process; if the individual is satisfied with MA GI-based coverage the individual may stay enrolled in that manner. If appl icable, the FFM transfers the electronic accounts of individuals potentially eligible for Medicaid on the basis of non - MAGI to DFR for determination. An individual can be enrolled in a MAGI Medicaid category or receive a qualified health plan (QHP) ) while a non -MAGI dete rmination is pending. If the individual has gone through the non -MAGI determination and is determined eligible for a non -MAGI category, eligibility in the MAGI category is ended (if applicable) and the individual is transiti oned to the non -MAGI category. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 111 of 291 The individual does have the choice regarding which category for which the individual wishes to be considered. L. Eligibility Groups The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and associated regulations implemented changes related t o Medicaid eligibility groups. These changes include the following, all effective January 1, 2014: The mandatory coverage of individuals under age 26 who were in foster care and receiving Medicaid in the state upon aging out of the foster care system ( 42 CFR 43 5.145 ). States are required to provide coverage to this group without regard to the individual's income. The mandatory cover age of children ages 6 -18 in Medicaid u p to 133% of the federal poverty level ( FPL) versus 100% FPL. This will not impact Indiana as the state already provided coverage to children in this age and income range in the Medicaid versus separate CHIP program. Additionally, federal regulations consolidated multiple mandatory and optional eligibility groups into the new overarching categories listed below. o Infants and children under a ge 19 ( 42 CFR 435.118 elatives ( 42 CFR 435.110 ) This regulatory consolidation will collapse ce rtain pre -2014 aid categories. T his will not result in coverage changes or impact beneficiaries though they may see a change in the name of their aid category. The following table (see Table 33) outlines Indiana Medicaid's eligibility groups and the associated program.

The Eligibility Hierarchy In determining an individual's Medicaid eligibility category, in the absence of a stated preference by the applicant, the eligibility determination is system generated based on a hierar chy. The hierarchy is designed so that individuals are first considered for the most comprehensive benefit package with the least restric tive eligibility requirements. For example, children are first considered for enrollment in Medicaid versus the Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) and the Family Planning Eligibility Program is the last group on the hierarchy, as it o ffers the least comprehensive coverage. More information on Medicaid eligibility can be found on the Indiana Medicaid website at http://member.indianamedicaid.com/am -i-eligible/eligibility -guide.aspx . 1. Infants and Children Babies born to Indiana Medicaid enrollees receive coverage for their first year of life without the need for a separate Medicaid application. This is referred to as deemed newborn coverage. There is no income requirement for this group; coverage continues for one year. Newborn coverage continues regardless of whether the infant continues to live with the birth mother or whether the child ever lived with the birth mother in the case of adoptio n or other custody arrangement. However, if the child is adopted and the names and location of the adoptive parents are unknown, the child can only be covered for the duration of the hospitalization starting with the month of birth. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 114 of 291 Children up to age 19 under 250% FPL are eligible for enrollment in the Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP). Program enrollment ( i.e., in Medicaid or CH IP) depends on the child's age and federal poverty level (FPL) as described in the following table (see Table 34): Table 34: Children's Program Eligibility by Age and Federal Poverty Level ( FPL) Age FPL Program 0-1 208% FPL Medicaid FPL Medicaid >158 -250% FPL CHIP Source: Family and Social Services Administration, Indiana Client Eligibility System Program Policy Man ual, Chapter 2400 , www.in.gov/fssa/files/2400.pdf a. Children's Health Insurance Program Specific Eligibility Provisions In order to qualify for the Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ), an individual cannot be covered by other comprehensive health insurance (hospital and medical or major medical). A child whose health insurance coverage was dropped voluntarily may not receive CHIP coverage for 90 days following the month of termination; this is re ferred to as a waiting period. There is no waiting period imposed in the following situations: The child is no longer eligible for Medicaid or another insurance affordability program The cost of the discontinued coverage for the child exceeded 5% of household income The cost of family coverage that was discontinued, that includes the child, exceeds 9.5% of household income The child's parent is determined eligible for a premiu m tax credit (PTC) to p urchase coverage on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) because the employer sponsored insurance in which the family was enrolled is determined unaffordable The employer no longer offers health plan coverage or stopped offeri ng coverage of dependents The loss of eligibility for employer coverage (other than through full payment of the COBRA premium) is due to termination of employment or reduction in work hours The loss of coverage is due to death or divorce of the parent, guardian or other family member The child has special health care needs Additionally, children whose parents, caretakers or spouse can cover them under the State of Indiana's health coverage plans offered to s tate employees are not eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program . The Af fordable Care Act (ACA) required states to maintain coverage under CHIP for children who lose Medicaid coverage due to the elimina tion of disregards under modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) . This protection applied only to children enrolled in Medicaid as of December 31, 2013 who lost eligibility at their first MAGI based renewal due to the elimination of disregards who were not otherwise CHIP eligible. To comply with these federal requirements, children who transfer red to CHIP under this protected status were not denied Medicaid due to having other credita ble health insurance coverage. This protected status remained in place until the child's next schedu led renewal ( i.e., 12 months). At that time, the regular CHIP eligibility criteria was applied. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 115 of 291 As discussed further in the CHIP Premiums section , to be enrolled in CHIP individuals have a monthly premium obligation and are terminated from coverage after 60 days of non -payment. 2. Parents and Other Caretaker Relatives States are required to provide coverage to parent and caretaker relatives under the inco me standard established by the s tate within federally defined parameters. In Indi ana, the income standard for parents and caretaker relatives is the MAGI equivalent of the coverage level in effect prior to 2014. An explanation of MAGI conversion is provided in the MAGI Conversion section . A caretaker relative is defined as a relative of a dep endent child by blood, adoption, or marriage with whom the child is living who assumes primary respon sibility for the child's care. Caretaker relatives include the following: Parent Stepparent Grandparent Sibling Stepsibling Aunt or Uncle First Cousin Nephew or Niece The spouse of any of above, even after marriage is terminated by death or divorce Any blood relative within the fifth degree of relationship, including but not limited to, those of half blood, first cousins once removed and individuals of p receding generations as denoted by prefixes of grand, great, great -great, or great -great -great In Indiana, a dependent child is under the age of 18 and does not need to be deprived of parental support by reason of death, absence from the home, physical or mental incapacity or unemployment. Parents and caretaker relatives are covered under HIP 2.0 and are eligible for HIP State Plan benefits. 3. Pregnant Women Pregnant women below 208% FPL are eli gible for Medicaid in Indiana. For purposes of determining the household size of a pregnant woman in the eligibility determination process, a pregnant woman is counted as two (or more, if the woman is pregn ant with more than one child). In determining the eligibility of others in her ho usehold ( i.e., children or spouse), the unborn child is not counted by the state. Effective January 1, 2014, verification of the pregnancy from a medical provider is no longer required for application \u2014self attestation of pregna ncy is acceptable requireme nt. In addition to coverage throughout the duration of the woman's pregnancy, coverage continues f or a 60 day postpartum period. A pregnant woman enrolled in Medicaid remains eligible throughout the duration of her pregnancy and a 60 day postpartum period, even if a change in income would otherwise render her ineligible. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 116 of 291 4. Former Foster Children The Affordable Care Act (ACA) created a new mandatory coverage group for former foster children up to age 26. Prior to January 1, 2014, Indiana provided cove rage to former foster children up to age 2 1 with incomes below 200% FPL. Effective January 1, 2014, in accordance with federal requirements, the state will provide coverage to former foster children who were enrolled in Indiana Medicaid and in foster care under the responsibility of Indiana on their 18th birthday, up to age 26, without regard to income. 5. Long -Term Care/Nursing Facility Any person seeking nursing facility placement in Indiana must complete the pre -admi ssion screening (PAS) proces s. This process is used to determine the appropriateness of the placement to ensure that nursing facility al ternatives have been explored. Failure to participate in the PAS results in the individual being ineligible for Medicaid reimbursement in a nursing facility for up to one ye ar from the date of admission. Application is made through the nursing facility to which the individual is seeking admission, a hospital at which the individual is a patient , or through a local Area Agency on Aging.38 In determining a nursing facility resident's financial eligibility for Medicaid, special income and resource provisions apply when the institutionalized indi vidual has a community spouse. A community spouse is an individual who is married to an elderly, blind or disabled institutionalized applicant or recipient of Medicaid. Spouses of nursing home residents have protection from losing income and assets in order to pay for the in stitutionalized spouse's care. Community spouses are allowed to retain income and assets that are above the regular income and resource li mits for Medicaid eligibility. The state calculates the \"spousal share\" or the amount of income and assets that may be maintained for the sup port of the community spouse. To determine the spousal share, the couple completes Form 2060 - Resource Assessment Notice and Request39 and provides documentation of the resource values as of the date of admission to the nursing facility. These amounts are adjusted annually; the dollar amount s reflected below represent 2016 figures.40 The community spouse may maintain all of the community spouse's personal income and half of the income generated by assets owned by both spouses. If this amount is less than $ 2,003 monthly , the community spouse may maintain a po rtion of the institutionalized spou se's income to bring the community spouse's monthly income up to this level. If the community spouse's monthly income is more than the Maximum Maintenance S tandard ($2,9 81), the community spouse cannot keep any of the institutionalized spouse's income. 38 Contact information and locations of the local Area Agencies on Aging are posted on the FSSA website at www.in.gov/fssa/da/3478.htm . 39 DFR offi ces are to provide Form 2060 to interested persons upon request and should provide a supply to facilities in the county. A completed Form 2060 can be mailed to FSSA Document Center or the local DFR office. Local DFR offices are listed online at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov . 40 Source: Medicaid Policy Manual , Chapter 3000, www.in.gov/fssa/ompp/4904.htm Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 117 of 291 With the exception of any portion allocated to the community spouse as described above and the allowable deductions listed below, the institutionalized sp ouse must use all of the institutionalized spouse's own income to pay for nursing home ca re. The following are allowable deductions: A $52 monthly personal needs allowance Court ordered guardianship fees paid to the applicant/recipient's legal guardian, not to exceed $35 per month Once per year, federal, state and local taxes on unearned income which are owed and paid A portion of sheltered workshop earnings and earnings which are part of a habilitation plan Health insurance premiums Medical expenses not subject to payment by a third party and are not covered by Medica id, with the exception of nursing facility expenses incurred during an imposed transfer of property penalty. Any costs for the nursing home care that remain are covered by Medicaid. In determining the maximum assets a community spouse may own without rend ering the institutionalized spouse ineligible, most assets are considered joint regardless of whose name they are in (i.e., the community spouse or institutionalized spouse). As of 2016, t he community spouse asset limit is the greatest of the following amo unts: The state minimum standard of $23,844 ; The spousa l share, up to a maximum of $119,220 ; Any amount of resources ordered by a court against the institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse; or The amount established by an administra tive l aw judge (ALJ) as the result of an appeal. Examples of countable assets include bank accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, revocable trusts, the cash value of life insurance policies and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) . More information on wha t counts as income or assets is available in the Indiana Long Term Care Insurance Program (ILTCIP) website at www.in.gov/iltcp/2343.htm . a. Miller Trusts and Eligibility for Medicaid Coverage of Long -Term Care and Home and Community -Based Services If an applicant has monthly income that exceeds 300% of the maximum Supplemental Security Income (SSI) federal benefit rate ,41 also known as the Special Income Limit (SIL), the applicant must establish a Miller T rust prior to becoming eligible for Medicaid coverage of institutional or home and community - based services. A Miller T rust, also known as a Qualified Income Trust (QIT) , is a legal arrangement for holding funds which allows an individual with income over the 300% of SSI threshold to qualify for coverage. The Medicaid agency disregards income placed in the trust for the purpose of eligibility. At a minimum, an individual must place the portion of the individual's monthly income that exceeds the SIL in the trust. 41 The monthly maximum f ederal SSI amounts for 2016 are $733 for an eligible individual and $1,100 for an eligible individual with an eligible spouse (see www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/SSI.html ). Multiplied by three these numbers are $2,199 and $3,300, respectively. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 118 of 291 Individuals may apply certain deductions to these funds, and the remaining amount in the trust is paid to the institution as part or all of the member's liability. The following figure (see Figure 4 ) provides a high -level o verview of how a Miller T rust works: Figure 4: How a Miller Trust Works *Funds deposited in Miller T rust represent a ll or part of member's liabili ty to the facility, depending on whether member's enti re income is deposited or simply the amount that exceeds SIL. Either approach is acceptable.

N. Income Standards Income limits for eligibility groups which are based on the federal poverty l evel (FPL) are adjusted yearly with the annual publishing by the feder al government of revised federal poverty levels . The following tables (see Table 3 5, Table 3 6, Table 3 7, Table 38 and Table 39 ) reflect the income limits for 2016 eligibi lity based upon the 2016 federal poverty levels . Annual updates can be accessed in the Federal Register located at www.federalregister.gov upon publica tion. They are typically published in late January and become effective for Indiana Medicaid eligibility determinations in March or April.

The SSI payment standards are updated effective January 1 of each year whenever there is a cos t of living adjustment (COLA). Therefore, any changes to the income standards for these eligibility groups are effective January 1st each year. For the Med icare Savings Program, income standards are updated ba sed on the annual FPL changes. However, any COLA increase in Social Security benefits received annually in January by Social Security beneficiaries is disregarded until April of the same year. The months of the COLA disregard are refer red to as \"transition months.\" The April date is based on the FPL guidelines being published in February, if FPLs are published at a different time, the transition months are adjusted accordingly. O. Authorized Repre sentatives Medicaid applicants and beneficiaries may designate an individual or organization to act responsibly on their behalf in assisting with the application, redetermination process and ongoing communications with the state. Authorized R epresentativ es (ARs) are commonly a trusted family member, but they can also be a third party entity. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 121 of 291 The designation of an AR must be in writing and signed by the applicant or beneficiary and the Authorized Representative. Authority for an individual or entity to act on behalf of an applicant or beneficiary accorded under state law, including but not limited to, a court order establishing legal guardianship or a power of attorney, is treated as a written designation by the applicant or beneficiary of Authorized Rep resentation. If an individual is medically incapable of signing the authorization, medical documentation must be provided. An individual may designate an AR through the Indiana Application for Health Coverage (IAHC), which includes the AR form with the application . The AR form is bar -coded to match each specific case to allow for expedited processing and better service to the AR and the consumer. In completing the AR form, the individual designates what functions the representative is authorized to complete including: Application functions o Sign application o Provide all required proof of info rmation necessary to determine eligibility for benefits o Receive the n otice of the application decision o Speak on applicant's behalf at a hearing if the application decision is appealed Ongoing o Report changes o Attend periodic redeterminations o Receive the appointment notices and any redetermination mail -in forms Designation as an AR is valid until the applicant or beneficiary: Modifies the authorization Notifies the agency that the representative is no longer authorized to act on the applicant's or benef iciary's behalf The AR informs the agency that the AR no longer is acting in such capacity, or there is a change in the legal authority upon which the individual or organization's authority was based. Additional information on ARs can be found on the Ind iana Medicaid website at http://member.indianamedicaid.com/members -rights --responsibilities/advocaterepresentative - authorization -form.aspx . P. Verifying Factors of Eligibility After an individual has submitted an application as described in the Medicaid Application section of the Helping Consumers App ly for Coverage chapter of the manual, the s tate will verify certain factors of eligibility. Beginning in 2014, s tates are only permitted to collect paper documentation from Medicaid applicants to verify factors of eligibility when electronic data sources, which have been deemed to be IMPORTANT NOTE: It is important that an AR be designated through the AR form attached to the Indiana Application for Health Coverage. Each bar -coded AR form is unique to a specific case, therefore copies should not be made of the form to attach to other cases, nor should the bar code be altered under any circumstances. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 122 of 291 useful and rel iable by the s tate, are not available or an individual's self -attested information entered on the Indiana Application for Health Coverage is not \"reasonably com patible\" with electronic data. States have some discretion in developing reasonable compatibility policies. This modifies the pre -2014 process under which the state used electronic data sources for some eligibility factors with Medicaid applicants providing paper documentation upfront to support self -attested application information for other factors of eligibility. Indiana utilizes a variety of electronic data sources, including state data sources and federal data sources accessed through the Federal Hub, to verify factors of eligibil ity. The state will not utilize electronic Federal Tax Information (FTI) from the IRS to verify income as annual tax return data is outdated for purposes of deter mining current monthly income. Examples of data sources which will be consulted include but are not limited to: Social Security Administration (SSA) Department of Homeland Security TALX Work Number State Wage Information Collection Agency (SWICA) State Unemployment Compensation Vital Statistics The next table (see Table 40) outlines when paper documentation will be required, by eligibility factor, and examples of acce ptable forms of documentation. Individuals will be notified via the Pending Verification Checklist (DFR Form 2032) when additional documentation is req uired to complete the eligibility determination process as well as the acceptable forms of documentation, submission instruction s and deadline for submission. The case name and case number should be written on each document submitted, and the Cover Sheet c ontained in the mailing should be sent in with the suppor ting documentation. Individuals are generally required to provide documentation within 10 calendar days and may submit the requested documenta tion via fax to 1 -800-403-0864, deliver them in person to a local Division of Famil y Resources (DFR) o ffice (searchable at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov ), or mail to the FSSA Document Center at the following address : FSSA Document Center , P.O. Box 1810 , Marion, IN 46952 . The requirement to provide verification documents is limited to those necessary to ensure an accur ate eligibility determination. For example, financial and demographic information is required only for those individuals living in the home who are members of the Assistance Group ( AG); therefore information will not be required to verify the circumstances of a non -AG member. When providing verifications, applicants should provide the most cu rrent documentation available. Financial eligibility is based on the best estimate of income and circumstances which will exist in the month for which the assistance is being considered. This estimate is founded upon the most complete information available to the DFR as of the authorization date. This eligibility determ ination requires k nowledge of an individual's or AG's current, past or an ticipated future circumstances. A presumption that current or historical trends will continue in the future is not made. Use of historical trends is used if there is reason to believe , with supporting documentation, that the trends will continue. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II.

Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 126 of 291 Q. Eligibility Appeals Medicaid applicants and beneficiaries have the right to appeal decisions of the state regarding their eligibility. Appeals of some decisions must first go to the managed care entity (MCE) before being directed to the state. Appealable actions include the termination, suspension or reduction of Medicaid eligibility or covered services. Following is a list of some common examples of appealable actions: The effective date of Medicaid coverage Premium or cost -sharing obligation Denial of eligibility Computation of the spousal share and the community spouse resource standard This section describes eligibility related appeals; refer to the Post -Eligibility Appeal s section for additional info rmation on appeals related to authorizations for covered services. States that de legate authority to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) to conduct Medicaid eligibility determinations may also delegate aut hority for processing appeals. Indiana has not delegated such authority. Therefore, appeals of Medicaid eligibility de terminations are handled by the s tate. Applicants and beneficiaries are entitled to receive written notice of their appeal rights wheneve r an action is taken on their case. Therefore, they should be encouraged to carefully read all notices for relevant instructions such as deadlines to submit an appeal, where to submit an appeal and requirements for submission. Individuals must file appeal s by the date listed on their notice. Current eligibility will be maintained while the appeal is pending if the individual files an appeal before the date the decision goes into effect. The individual may opt to not have benefits continued pending the appe als decision. Appeals of some decisions must first go to the managed care entity before being directed to the state. If the last day of the month before the effective date falls on a weekend or holiday, the appeal must be rece ived by the next business day. If the decision of the s tate is upheld, the appellant is required to pay for the benefits received whil e awaiting the appeal outcome. Therefore, if an individual does not want to continue benefits during the appeal, this shou ld be clearly in dicated on the appeal request. If benefits involve the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the individual is required to continue to make the required contributions or premiums during the contin ued benefit period. When an appeal request is received, the FSSA schedules a fair hearing. The appellant is notified in writing of the date, time and place of the hearing. This is generally held in the Division of Family Resources (DFR) county office where the appellant resides, but it may be conducted by phone at the appellant's request. Pre-hearing conferences are held on some cases during which the appel lant can describe why the appellant is dissatisfied and t he DFR explains the reason for the action whi ch has been taken. If resolution occurs at this pre -hearing conference, the applicant can withdraw the request for appeal. The fair hearing will continue as scheduled if the appeal is not withdrawn. The hear ing will be held in front of an a dmin istrative law j udge (ALJ). Individuals can represent themselves or seek assistance from another individual such as a lawyer, friend or relative. Individuals Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 127 of 291 who wish to have legal representation but cannot afford it can contact Indiana Legal Services. Contacts by location are available at www.indianalegalservices.org/providers . Both the individual and s tate will present their respective positions and t he ALJ will render a decision. For eligibilit y-related appeals, the s tate's d esignee typically presents the s tate's position via telephone. Notification of the ALJ decision will be sent in writing to the individual. Any necessary adjustments to eligibility as an outcome of the decision will be made in accord ance with the hearing outcome. If the decision is not favorable to the appellant, the appellant may be required to repay bac k benefits paid on the appellant's behalf. If the decision is favorable to the appellant and involves HIP 2.0 or CHIP, the individual would be required to pay any contributions or premiums back to the effective date of coverage. Individuals who wish to challenge an eligibility decision under the disability category will appeal eithe r to the Social Security Administration (SSA) or to Indiana Medicaid depending on the reason for the initial denial. If the applicant was denied Medicaid eligibility because of an SSA disab ility denial on file, the applicant should appeal to the Social Sec urity Administration . If the Indiana Medical Review Team (MRT) determined the applicant non -disabled, or the application was denied for reasons other than disability (i.e., excess income or resources), the applicant should file the appeal to Indiana Medica id. If an individual is dissatisfied with the hearing decision , the individual has the r ight to request a review by FSSA through an Agency Review. The written notice outlining the hearing decision will include instructions on how to file a request for Agency Review, including the deadline to file. Individuals that receive continued benefits during an appeal and subsequently lose their appeal may be subject to benefit recovery at the discretion of the state. Additional information on eligibility appeals can be found on the Indiana Medicaid website at http://member.indianamedicaid.com/members -rights --responsibilit ies/appeals -and-grievances.aspx . R. What an Individual Can Expect After Being Determined Eligible for Indiana Medicaid 1. Effective Date of Eligibility Individuals can be determin ed Medicaid eligible for up to three months of retroactive eligibility from the date of application. During periods of retroactive eligibility a Medicaid enrollee is not assign ed to a Hoosier Healthwise or Hoosier Care Connect managed care entity (MCE) (i.e., no retroact ive MCE assignments are made). If an enrollee received covered services during the period of retroactive eligibility and paid out -of-pocket for such costs, the enrollee is to receive reimbursement from the provider and the provider can then bill Medicaid. This three -month retroactive eligibility period does n ot apply to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or t he Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0). For these programs, final enrollment is dependent on premium contribution (CHIP) o r POWER account payment (HIP 2.0). For CHIP, members become eligible for ben efits on the first day of the month in which they applied and p aid the first month's premium. For example, if an application was filed in June, approved on the 15th of June and the applicant's first month's premium was paid in full, eligibility would begin on the first day of June. For all programs, an individual's eligibility notice will detail the effective date of eligibility. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 128 of 291 2. Notices and Insurance Card An individual determined eligible for Medicaid will receive the following initial communication materials: An eligibility determination notice from the s tate within 24 hours of eligibility determination plus mailing time A member identification card (see below) referred to as the Hoosier Health Card within five business days plus mailing time (this is not sent to HIP 2.0 enrollees) HIP 2.0 enrollees receive a member ID card from their managed care entity (MCE) Hoosier Healthwise and HIP 2.0 enrollees receive communication materials from their MCE, including a member handbook CHIP & M .E.D. Works eligible individuals receive premium invoices HIP 2.0 eligible individuals receive Personal Wellness and Responsibility (POWER) Account contribution notices 3. CHIP Premiums Individuals in the Child ren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are respon sible for mon thly premiums as outlined in the following table (see Table 41): Table 41: CHIP Premium Amounts (Based on 201 6 FPL) Family FPL Monthly Premium for 1 Child Monthly Premium for 2 or More Children 158% up to --benefits/medicaid -programs/hoosier -healthwise/faq -hoosier Program Policy Manual , Section 3010.30.40, http://www.in.gov/fssa/files/Medicaid_PM_3000.pdf Eligibility in CHIP is not finalized until an individual pay s the first required premium. CHIP eligible families will rece ive a monthly premium invoice. Monthly payment in full is required. Premium payment checks or money orders should be mailed to: Hoosier Healthwise -3127 . There is a 60 -day grace period for non-payment of CHIP premiums. CHIP coverage will be terminated if payment is not received within this time . To reenroll , a new Indiana Application for Health Coverage must be submitted and p ast due premiums must be paid. However, under federal regulations, effective Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 129 of 291 January 1, 2014, if an individual fails to repay past due premiu ms and reapplies for CHIP, the s tate will not prohibit reenrollment if more than 90 days has passed since the date of disenrollment for non - payment. This replaces the old policy under which repayment of a past due premium was a condition of reenrollment. CHIP members who have questions a bout premium payments can call 1 -866-404-7113. 4. HIP 2.0 Personal Responsibility and Wellness (POWER) Account Contributions As detailed in the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) section , HIP 2.0 enrollees are responsible for monthl y contributions to the POWER Account. After being determined eligible for HIP 2.0, the individual will receive an invoice from their managed care e ntity (MCE) detailing the required contribu tion and payment instructions. Enrollment in HIP Plus is determinant on making POWER Account contribution s. Members receive monthly invoices for monthly contribution amounts. If a HIP 2.0 enrollee does not make required monthly cont ributions , the enrollee will \"fallback\" i nto the HIP Basic plan, which is less predictable and more costly than the HIP Plus plan . POWER account contributions are approximately 2% of income and are a minimum of $1 per month. HIP 2.0 enrollees with questions about t heir POWER Account contributions should contact the MCE with whom the y are enrolled as outlined in the following table (see Table 42): Table 42: HIP 2.0 Managed Care Entity ( MCE Contacts Premiums As detailed in the M.E.D. Works section , enrollees in the M .E.D. Works (Medicaid for Employees with Disabilities) program are responsible for monthly premium payments as shown in the following table (see Table 43). Premiums are based on the income of the a pplicant/recipient and spouse. These monthly income limits are adjusted annu ally based on the updated FPLs released by the federal government. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 130 of 291 Table 43: M.E.D. Works Premiums (Based on 201 6 FPL) Monthly Income Premium Single $1,459 - , Chapter 3010.20.20, https://secure.in.gov/fssa/files/Medicaid_Combined_PM.pdf After being determined eligible for the program, enrollees w ill receive a monthly invoice. Payments ar e sent to: M.E.D. Works 946 , Indianapolis, IN 46206 . M.E.D. Works enrollees with questions related to premium payments can be directed to the M.E.D. Works Payment Line at 1 -866-273-5897. S. Eligibility Redeterminations Medicaid redeterminations are cond ucted every 12 months for modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) categories. For non -MAGI groups, redeterminations must be completed at least every 12 months, but may occur more frequently to align with o ther benefits redeterminatio n. For MAGI categories, the state will renew eligibility without requiring additional information from the enrollee if there is sufficient information in the enrollee's electronic account t o do so . If sufficient information is available to determine ongoing eligibility, the individual is notified of the eligibility determination and required to notify the state of any inaccuracies. No signature or any additional information is required from the individual if all information contained in the notice is accurate. For non -MAGI categories, this electronic renewal process does not apply as there are no electronic data sources available to determine resource eligibility. If insufficient information is available to determine ongoing eligibility, a pre -populat ed renewal form will be sent to the individual requesting the missing in formation . Instructions, including the due date for returning the redetermination form and documentation , are provided on the mailing. Redetermination materials can be submitted to 1 -800-403-0864, by mail to the FSSA Document Center (P.O. Box, 1810, Marion, IN 46952) , or to a local Division of Family Resources (DFR) office (listed at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov ). Individuals should include their ca se name and case number on all submitted documents. Eligibility is terminated for individuals who do not return the materials (redetermination form and/or required veri fications) in a timely manner. If eligibility is terminated but the individual returns the Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 131 of 291 documents within 90 days of the original due date, eligibility is reviewed without the need to submit an Indiana Ap plication for Health Coverage . If the individual fails to return the materials within 90 days of the original due date, the individual must file a new Indiana Application for Health Coverage. 1. Eligibility Redeterminations for Members Eligible Based on Blindness or Disability Due to Indiana's transition to 1634 stat us effective June 1, 2014, the s tate will accept and defer to Social Security Administration (SSA) disability determinations for Medicaid eligibility purposes. The s tate will require most members eligible under the blindness and disability Medicaid categories (MA B and MA D) to apply to SSA at the time of their redetermination ( Medical Review Team ( MRT ) progress report) for a disability determination and any other benefits for which they may be eligible, if they have not already done so. This requirement will be waived for children under the age of 18 and members of a group that has a recognized religious objection to applying for federal benefits, such as the Amish. If the member does not fulfill the requirement to file an application with SSA within 45 days of the MRT progress report, the member's eligibility will be denied for failing to comply with the requirements of the process and will have to re -apply. While the SSA applic ation is pending, the Indiana MRT process will run concurrently and MRT will rend er its own decision. The MRT's disability determination will be effective until the SSA renders its decision. 2. Reporting Changes Enrollees are required to report changes to the state. Examples of required changes to report include a change in address , income or family composition. Changes can be reported via FSSA's website at www.in.gov/fssa/dfr/2999.htm , by calling 1 -800-403-0864 , by mail to the FSSA Document Center (P.O. Box, 1810, Marion, IN 46952) , or at a local DFR office (listed at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov ). The state will review eligibility based on reported changes and provide written notice to enrollees of any resulting eligibility changes. 3. Preg nancy and Newborn Coverage Babies born to Medicaid enrollees receive coverage for their first year of life without the need for a separate Medicaid application. They will be covered under Hoosier Healthwise and enrolled in their mothe r's managed care enti ty. This is referred to as deemed newborn coverage. There is no deemed newborn coverage for CHIP enrollees; these mothers must file an application for coverage for their baby. All Hoosier He althwise enrollees must have a primary medical p rovider (PMP), includin g newborns. Enrollees should be encouraged to select a provider for their baby prior to birth. The provider for the baby must be in t he same network as the mother. This process is refer red to as pre -birth selection. Once a pregnant enrollee has sel ected a PMP for the baby, she should call her MCE to finalize the selection. Upon the birth of the child, the mother must report the birth to the DFR via the methods of repo rting changes described in the previous section . Alternatively, many hospitals will report the birth of the baby through a \"babygram\" sent via fax to the Division of Family Resources . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 132 of 291 T. Using Coverage Once an individual is determined eligible and enrolled in the applicable program ( e.g., Hoosier Healthwise, HIP 2.0, Hoosier Care Connect, or traditional Medicaid), the individual is eligible to beg in accessing covered services. Enrollees should present their ID card every time they seek services and may only receive services from Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) enrolled provi ders, with the exception of emergency services. Hoosier Healthwise, HIP 2.0 and Hoosier Care Connect enrollees are requir ed to seek services from their primary medical p rovider (PMP), with the ex ception of emergency services. PMPs will provide referra ls to specialists as required. Additionally, individuals may self -refer to the following IHCP enrolled provider types and services: Chiropractic services (except HIP 2.0) Eye care services, excep t surgical services Podiatric services (except HIP 2.0) Psychiatric services Family planning services Emergency services Immunizations Mental health providers (for HIP 2.0 and Hoosier Healthwise must be an in -network provider) Diabetes self -management services U. Prior Authorization Some services require pri or authorization (PA), a process under which the medical necessity of a requested servi ce is reviewed. Under the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) and Hoosier Health wise (HHW) programs, the managed care entities (MCEs) with whom the s tate contracts are author ized to establish their own PA policies within the parameters established by federal Medicaid managed care regulations and the terms of the MCE's contract with the s tate. Enrollees are notified of the services which require PA through their Member Handbook s issued by the MCEs and may also seek additional information through the MCE member services helpline. An enrollee's provider submits a PA request to the applicable entity ( i.e., Hoosier Healthwise or HIP 2.0 MCE, or the s tate's designee for t raditional Medicaid enrollees). If a PA request is denied, an individual has the right to appeal and such appeal rights will be included in the PA determination letter with instructions and parameters for appealing. Further information on the appeals process is available in the Post Eligibility Appeals section . Failure to receive PA prior to receiving services may result in the provider receiving a denial of claims payment. V. Copayments Certain Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP ) covered serv ices have required copayments. This section does not apply to HIP 2.0 enrollees; see Table 18 for a list of copayments required under the HIP Basic plan. There are co pays for transportation services for Medicaid enrollees a s outlined in the following table (see Table 44). The following services are exempt from the transportation copayment requirement: Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 133 of 291 Emergency ambulance Transportation provided to enrollees under 18 Transportation provided to pregnant women Transportation provided to enrollees who are inpatient in hospital, nursing facility, intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disability or other medical institutions Transportation provided to Hoosier Healthwise managed care entity ( MCE ) enrollees Table 44: Transportation Copayments for Medicaid Enrollees Copayment Transportation Service $0.50 each one -way trip Transportation services that pay $10 or less $1 each one -way trip Transportation services that pay $10.01to $50 $2 each one -way trip Transportation services that pay $50.01 or more Source: 405 IAC 5-30-2 Pharmacy copayments are outlined in the following table (see Table 45).

Post -Eligibility Appeals After an individual has been determined eligible and is enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, the individual has appeal rights related to actions taken by the s tate. Appealable actions include: Denial or limited authorization of a requested service, including the type or level of service Reduction, suspension or termination of a previously authorized service Denial, in whole or in part, of payment for a service Failure to provide services in a ti mely manner, as defined by the s tate Failure of a c ontractor to act within the required timeframes Lack of satisfaction with a medically frail determination (HIP 2.0) For example, an individual can appeal prior authorization decisions, a d elay in receipt of covered medical services, change in nursing home or waiver level of care, termination of eligibility or other actions which affect receipt of Medicaid or medical services. Individuals must file appeals by the date listed on their noti ce of action. Current benefits may be continued while the appeal is pending if the individual files an appeal within the timefram e specified on their notice. If an individual receives services while the appeal is underway, if the denial of services i s uphe ld upon appeal, the individual may be financially responsible for the services received during the appeal. The appeal process differs based on whether or not an individual is enrolled in a managed care e ntity (MCE) (HIP 2.0, Hoos ier Healthwise, or Hoosi er Care Connect) or traditional Medicaid. Both processes are described in the following sections . Additional information on eligibility appeals may be found on the Indiana Medicaid website at http://member.indianamedicaid.com/members -rights --responsibilities/appeals -and-grievances.aspx . a. HIP 2.0, Hoosier Healthwise, and Hoosier Care C onnect Grievances and Appeals Members enrolled in HIP 2.0, Hoosier Healthwise , or Hoosier Care Connect should contact their managed care e ntity (MCE) to file a grievance or appeal. Enrollees in these programs are required to exhaust the MCE grievance and appeal process prior to fi ling an appeal with the state. Enrollees sh ould be directed to the MCE in which they are enrolled for specific instructions on submission . Additionally, all not ices of action from the MCE will provide instructions on appeal rig hts, timelines and procedures. If a HIP 2.0, Hoosier Healthwise , or Hoosier Care Connect enrollee is not satisfied with the appeal decision made by the MCE, the enrollee may request an exter nal review. This can be conducted either by an independent r eview o rganization (IRO) or the enrollee can go directly to the State Fair Hearing Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual II. Indiana Health Coverage Programs IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 135 of 291 process. If an individual opts t o go through the IRO, the individual can still request a State Fair Hearing if dissatis fied with the outcome of the internal review organization . In addition to the appeals process, e nrollees may file a grievance. A grievance is an expression of dissatisfaction about an y matter other than an action. An example of an issue for which an individual would f ile a grievance is if the individual is dissatisfied with the quality of care provided or the cond uct of a provider or employee. Individuals must file a grievance within 60 days from the day or event in question. Grievances can be filed orally by con tacting the appropriate MCE member services h elpline, or in writing. Additional information on eligibility appeals may be found on the Indiana Medicaid website at http://member.indianamedicaid .com/members -rights --responsibilities/appeals -and-grievances.aspx . b. Appeals to the State Medicaid beneficiaries who are not enrolled with an MCE or care management organization ( CMO ) submit their appeals directly to the s tate. Beneficiaries will alwa ys receive written notice of their appeal rights whenever an action is taken on their case. Therefore, they should be encouraged to carefully read all notices for relevant instructions such as deadlines to submit an appeal, where to submit an appeal , and requirements for submission. After an appeal is filed, individuals will be notified in writing of any appli cable hearings. T he notice will include the date, time and place of the hearing. The heari ng will be held in front of an administrative law judge (ALJ). Both the individual and s tate will present their position and t he ALJ will render a decision. Notification of the ALJ decision will be sent in writing to the individual. Individuals may represent themselves or seek assistance from another indivi dual such as a lawyer, friend or relative. Individuals who wish to have legal representation but cannot afford it can c ontact Indiana Legal Services. Contacts by location are available at: www.ind ianalegalservices.org/providers . Both the individual and s tate will present their position and t he ALJ will render a decision. Notification of the ALJ decision will be sent in writing to the individual. Any necessary adjustments to eligibility as an outco me of the decision will be made in accor dance with the hearing outcome. If an individual is dissatisfied with the hearing decision he or she has the right to request a review by the FSSA through an Agency Review. The written notice outlining the hearing de cision will include instructions on how to file a request for Agency Review, including the deadline to file. Additional information on eligibility appeals may be found on the Indiana Medicaid website at http://member.indianamedicaid.com/members -rights --responsibilities/appeals -and-grievances.aspx .

Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 139 of 291 III. Health Insurance Basics and t he Federally - facilitated Marketplace A. Chapter Objectives 1. Understand basic insurance concepts , how the health insurance market works, and the key costs and benefits on a health insurance plan description 2. Understand the key concepts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and what are the requirements for consumers and for health insurance plans sold on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) 3. Understand what the FFM is , who can use it , and where Hoosiers consumers should go for assista nce with the FFM 4. Understand how to h elp a consumer identify whether or not the consumer may be eligible for coverage and cost assistance programs , and how to enroll into Indiana Health Coverage Program s (IHCPs) or the FFM 5. Understand t he new insurance a ffordability programs including qualified health plans (QHPs), premium tax credit s (PTC s), and c ost-sharing reductions (CSR s), how these programs work, and who is eligible for these programs B. Key Terms 1. Actuarial Value (AV) is the average percentage of allowed medical cost expected to be paid by a health plan over all covered enrollees . All health plans of fered on and off of the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) in the individual and small group markets are required t o meet certain AV standards that are to be displayed to consumer s. In general, plans with high er AV s will have higher premiums and lower cost sharing . 2. Adverse Selection is when individuals wait until they become sick or need health care services to enroll in a plan. Off-marketplace plans can restrict purchase of plans to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) open enrollment periods , which gives the plans the abili ty to limit adverse selection. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated health plan's ability to screen for health status and exclude preexisting c onditions prior to enrollment. 3. Affordable Care Act (ACA) (also referred to as Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or Obamacare ) is a federal statute that was signed into law (Public Law 111 -148) by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010 and later amended by the federal Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ( Public Law 111 -152). The law provides fundamental reforms to the United States healthcare and health insurance systems, including the establishment of health insurance marketplace s and federal consumer assis tance programs (such as federal Navigator s, Certified Application Counselors ( CACs ), and non -Navigator Assistance Personnel). 4. Benchmark Plan (also referred to as Essential Health Benefit (EHB) Benchmark Plan ) is the health plan in a state that identifies the benefits and services classified as essential health benefits ( EHBs) in the state. The A nthem preferred provider organization (PPO) plan is the benchmark plan in Indiana , supplemented by FEDVIP dental and vision benefits . Summaries of each state's benchmark plan can be found on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website at www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/data -resources/e hb.html . 5. Bronze Plan is a type of qualified health p lan (QHP) offered to consumers on a m arketplace. It is designed so that an insurance carrier will pay 60% of covered healthcare expenses with the remaining 40% to be paid by the consumer . The consumer' s expenses will be in the form of out -of- pocket fees over and above the cost of the plan's monthly premium (which is the lowest of the three Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 140 of 291 QHPs/Metal Plans offered in Indiana) . Out-of-pocket expenses in 201 7 are capped at $ 7,150 for individual plans and $1 4,300 for family plans. 6. Catastrophic Plan is a health plan available on and off the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) for individuals who are under the age or 30 or who received an exemption from the Individual Mandate to maintain minimum essential c overage (MEC) . It is exempt from actuarial v alue (AV) requirements. The i ndividual is responsible for most healthcare cost s until deductible/out -of-pocket maximum is met . It qualifi es as MEC for the Individual Mandate, and the individual is not eligible for premium tax credits (PTCs) or cost -sharing r eductions (CSRs). 7. Certificate of Coverage is a list of benefits, services, cost sharing, exclusions, and lim its applied by a particular health insurance policy. 8. Child -only Policy (or Child -only Plan ) is an individual m arket policy that is sold to a child under the age of nineteen. Child -only p olicies do not include policies that are sold to adults with children as dependents. 9. Churn is transferring from one health insurance coverage to another . Individuals that experience a change in circumstances during the year that impacts their eligibility in the Federall y-facilitated Marketplace (FFM) or a state insurance affordability program may experience churn to another health coverage program for themselves or their dependents. 10. COBRA Insurance (also known as Consolidated Omnibus Budget Recon ciliation Act ) is a type of temporary health insurance coverage authorized under federal law (COBRA) that may allow an individual to elect to keep the individual's insurance coverage if the individual's employment ends, the individual loses coverage as a d ependent of the covered employee, or an other qualifying event occurs. If an individual elects COBRA coverage, the individual pays 100% of the premiums, including the share the employer used to pay, plus a small administrative fee. 11. Coinsurance is a consumer's share /percentage of the cost of a healthcare service , paid in addition to the deductible amount. For example, after the consumer has met the deductible amount the consumer's coinsurance may be 20% ( i.e., \"80/20\" - health plan pays 80% and consumer pays 20%) of healthcare costs up until the consumer reached the out -of-pocket maximum. 12. Common -Law Employee (or Employee ) is an individual who the Internal Revenue Service (IR S) would consider an employee based on the degree of control an em ployer has over the individual and the overall relationship between th e employer and the individual. This common -law standard is used under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA) to define an employe e. Non-employee directors, sole proprietors, partners, 2% or more shareholders in an S corporation, and a leased employee are not treated as employees. 13. Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) (also known as a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) ) is a health plan that has a high deductible cost but often lower premiums. An individual with a CDHP is eligible for a health savings account (HSA) to which the individual can contribute pre -tax dollars for qualified healthcare expenses. Employers can also contribute to health savings accounts. 14. Copayment (also referred to as Copay ) is a flat fee consumers may need to pay when they are seen by the healthcare provider. Some plans may charge copayments for some services and coin surance for others . 15. Cost -Sharing is the share of costs covered by an individual's insurance that the individual pays out of his or her own pocket. This generally includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, but not prem iums (unless it is premiums paid for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)) . A health plan's cost -shari ng policy can be found in its Summary of Benefits and Coverage . 16. Cost -Sharing Reductio n (CSR) is a qualified health plan (QHP) discount on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) that lowers the amount a consumer has to pay out -of-pocket for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. A CSR is offered in addition to premium tax c redits (PTC s). Quali fying individuals do not have to apply for a CSR separately if the individual : (1) meets all requir ements for Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 141 of 291 a PTC; (2) is enroll ed in a s ilver plan on the FFM ; and (3) has household income between 100% and 250% federal poverty l evel (FPL) (or between 100% and 300% FPL for Native Americans ). 17. Deductible is a set amount that the individual will spend toward health care before the insurance carrier begins to make payments .

The ACA also required a new m arketplace (sometimes termed an \"exchange\") to be created in each state that will offer individuals and small businesses a new avenue to purchase health insurance coverage. The states are able to choose between three models of marketplaces: federally -facilitated (federal), operated in partn ership with the federal government , or operated by the state. Indiana has chosen to allow the federa l government to facilitate its m arketplace. This new avenue to purchase coverage is intended to facilitate consumer choice in selecting a health plan that best meets individual needs. For individuals, the ACA created new req uirements to maintain coverage, provisions for premium tax credits (PTCs) and cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) to help individuals and families up to 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) afford cover age, tax penalties associated w ith not having health insurance, and put annual restrictions on when coverage w ill be available for purchase. The coverage options offered to indivi duals will also be substantially different than individual coverage prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act . Among the major changes, the ACA eliminated the ability for insurers to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to individuals based on health status, and changed requirements around cost -sharing and the comprehe nsiveness of offered benefits. Low-income individuals in some states may also have access to expanded Medicaid programs. Small businesses have the option to obtain coverage fo r their employees in the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). The ACA also imposes new requirements on small businesses regarding how to count employees, new restrictions on deductible amounts in the insurance plans offered t o employees, general changes to the structure and benefits offered in small employer plans, and a transition of the tax credits for offering health insurance to availability only for those who purchase coverage in the SHOP. For large employers, the ACA c hanges the way employees are counted and implements new employer - shared responsibility provisions. Starting in 2015, these provisions require employers to pay fines if their employees receive premium tax credits (PTCs) for coverage in a m arketplace because the employer does not offer coverage or offers coverage that is not affordable (the cost of single premiums exceed 9 .66% of the employee's household income) or does not provide minimum value (MV) (covers 60% of healthcare costs). For insurers, the ACA made changes to how insurers issue plans, how insurers develop premium rates, how the cost -sharing and benefits are structured, and who and what benefits their plans have to cover. The ACA also cre ated a new category of health insurance plan, the qualified health p lan (QHP), as the only type of plan that is offered on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM). Insurers are also requir ed to meet new medical loss r atio (MLR) and actuarial v alue (AV) requirements. Sidebar: In the original passage of th e ACA , the terminology used was exchange. For e xchanges run by the fede ral government , the name was changed to m arketplace. State -run exchanges or marketplaces may use exchange, m arketpl ace, or their own terminology. In Indiana, the e xchange is run by the federal gover nment and is termed the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM), Marketplace, or Federal Marketplace .

Requirement to Have Health Insurance Called the Individual Shared -responsibility provision or the Individual Man date, the ACA requirement that individuals have health insurance subjects individuals to a tax penalty if they do not maintain minimum essential c overage (MEC) for themselves and their dependents or receive an exemption from the requirement. Minimum Essential Coverage is defined by types of health coverage ; and individuals with health coverage through employers, government programs, or the individual market are likely to meet this requirement. b. Guaranteed Issue and Guaranteed Renewability Individuals who previously would have been denied for health insurance because of their health status are now guaranteed under the ACA that insurers will issue coverage. Additionally, insurers are not able to charge higher premium s to individuals becau se of pre -existing conditions. c. Comprehensive Coverage All non -grandfathered major medical plans are required to cover certain preventive health benefits designated by the A ffordable Care Act . In addi tion, health plans sold on t he individual and s mall group markets will be required to cover the essential health b enefits (EHBs) and to off er plans in the metal tiers. All health plans subject to the ACA in the individual and small group market must offer plans at the bronze, silver, gold and/ or platinum level. The benefits offered in each level may not vary; however, the amount of cost -sharin g an individual would pay for s ervices will vary by metal tier . Existing individual and small g roup health insurance policies that do not meet all of the requirements of the ACA ( i.e., \"grandmothered \" or \"transitional\" plans ) may be renewed in Indiana at the discretion of the issuers through October 1, 2016. These plans must not undergo any material changes to the plan (e.g., a change in plan benefits, or a \"buy -down\" of plan premiums by ins urer to lower cost -sharing ), are required to cover certain preventive health benefits designated by the ACA, and are not required to contain the 10 EHBs or to adopt the rating structure of fully ACA -compliant plans. d. New Avenues to Purchase Health Insurance Individuals may sh op for and purchase he alth insurance directly from the health insurer, through an insuran ce agent or broker, or online. However, they also have access t o the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM). To purchase cov erage on the FFM in Indiana, individuals must be a United States citizen, national, or legal resident, reside or intend to reside in the state of application (Indiana), and not be incarcer ated. Individuals will have a choi ce among all FFM plans that offer coverage for their location and family composition and will be able to select a plan based on quality, covered benefits, covered providers, and expected cost -sharing level. e. Help Payin g for Health Insurance and Cost -Sharing There are two provisions that help qualified individuals afford health insurance premiums and cost - sharing for health services received. Both of these programs are only available for individuals who are screened and found eligible by the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . Individuals can approach the FFM directly and apply for health coverage, or may work through an insurer that sells plans on the FFM or a Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 151 of 291 FFM agent, broker , or web -broker. However, health insurance plans that are not offered on the FFM will not be eligible for these affordability programs that reduce premium cost and cost sharing for eligible individuals. The first program, the premium tax c redit (PTC), helps individuals at qualifying income levels to aff ord health insuran ce premiums. This program requires individuals to pay a certain amount towards the premiums to cover themsel ves and th eir families. The percentage of income that individuals and families must pay toward a premium varies based on income level. Premium costs in excess of the amount the indivi dual or family must pay is covered through the PTC program. The amount of the PTC is estimated when the individual applies for insurance affordability programs via the FFM , and can be in advance directly paid to the healt h insurer to reduce premiums or claimed retroactively when taxes are filed (see the APTC Reconciliation section for more information on this process). Individuals who smoke will not receive a tax credit for any premium portion rela ted to tobacco use. The second program, cost-sharing r eductions (CSR s), helps eligible individuals with qualifying income levels (under 250% of the federal poverty level (FPL)), who select a qualifying plan, to pa y for cost - sharing obligations r elated to obtaining health care. This program has the potential to greatly reduce cost sharing that qualifying individuals may owe for health care expenses. Individuals who qualify for CSRs must select a silver level plan to receive the benefit. There is no separate application for this program; however, individuals may have to pay slightly more in monthly premiums for a s ilver plan than for ot her available plans on the FFM ( bronze plans). The slightly higher monthly premium payme nt translates into reduced cost -sharing responsibility when the individual seeks care. f. Enrollment Periods Individuals can only purchase qualified hea lth plans (QHPs ) sold on the FFM during open enrollment periods. For 2017 coverage, the open enrollment p eriod is November 1, 2016 - January 31, 2017. Outside of open enrollment , individuals may only purchase or change a FFM plan if they have life event that qualifies them for a special enroll ment period (SEP) . Examples of these life events includ e individuals losing access to other health coverage or experiencing an event like marriage, divorce, or the birth or adoption of a child. Health i nsurers that sell plans out side of the FFM may elect to only sell plans during the FFM open enrollment periods. Regardless of whether an individual is purchasing a plan inside or outside of the Marketplace, individuals that do not pur chase a plan during the open enrollment period will not be able to purchase health insurance at other times of the year. 2. Employer Impacts The Affordable Care Act ( ACA) contains provisions impact ing small and large employers. In Indiana, small emplo yers with up to 50 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) have access to the SHOP Marketplace to purchase coverage for their employees.42 Small employers with up to 2 5 FTEs may be eligi ble for tax credits to help pay for the cost of cov erage for their e mployees. To receive these tax credits, the small employers must enroll in coverage through the SHOP Marketplace . Large employers with 51 or more 42 Under the A CA, the definition of small employer was set to change effective January 1, 2016, increasing a small employer from one to 50 employees to one to 100 employees. However, the federal PACE Act ( H.R. 1624 \u20142015 ) prevents this change from happening, unless a state chooses to define a small employer as having up to 100 employees. As of 2016, Indiana has chosen to keep the definition at one to 50 employees. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 152 of 291 FTEs will be subject to the Employer Mandate /shared -responsibility payment if they do not offer coverage that is affordable and provides minimum value (MV) to all FTEs and a FTE receives a premium tax c redit (PTC) from the Federally -facilitated Marketpl ace (FFM) . a. Full -Time Equivalent Employees The ACA institutes a new way to count employees to determine if an employer is a small or large employer for the purpose of determining if an employer is subject to the Employer Mandate payment or if an emplo yer is eligible for the SHOP Marketplace . This is called the full -time equivalent employee (FTE) count. Previou sly, a count would be taken of all of t heir full -time employees. Full-time employees are defined as employees working an average of 30 hours43 or more a week. The FTE count includes these full -time employees and adds a full -time equivalent estimate for part -time employees that work on averag e less than 30 hours per week. For example, an employer with 20 employees that work over 30 hours a week on average woul d have 20 full -time employees. To determin e FTEs , the employer would sum all hours worked by part -time employees in each we ek and divide this sum by 30.44 Full-time equivalent employees are calculated based on an a nnual average of hours worked . Employers that have staffing variability during the yea r and sometimes have over 50 FTE s and sometim es under 50 FTEs will need to calculate their annual average employees to determine if they are a small or an applicable45 large employer for the purposes of SHOP enrollmen t and the large employer shared -responsibility provisions. Additional guidance is provided by the federal -Provisions to assist employers on how to account for various employee types and circumstances, such as a salaried employees who do not clock in their hours, when determining if an organization is considered a small or la rge group employer. Furthermore, this guidance describes the transitional relief availa ble to employers for the shared -responsibility requirements beginning in 2015. The following table (see Table 4 7) provides an illustration of how an employer might determine full -time equivalent employees . This illustration is an example only and is not intended to provide instructions for employers on how to calculate their fu ll-time equivalent employees. 43 130 hours of service in a calend ar month is treated as the monthly equivalent of at least 30 hours of service per week, provided that the employer applies this equivalency rule on a re asonable and consistent basis. This monthly standard takes into account that the average month consists of more than four weeks. 44 As a proxy, employers may divide the hours worked by all part -time employees in a month and divide by four. 45 Employers will use information about the number of employees they employ and their hours o f service during 2016 to determine whether they employ enough employees to be an applicable large employer for 2017 . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 153 of 291 Table 47: Example of Full -time Equivalent Employee (FTE) Count Month Full-time Employees Full-time equivalent employees Total Employee Count January 35 10 45 February 36 12 48 March 36 11 47 April 36 12 48 May 35 15 50 June 37 16 53 July 37 16 53 August 37 20 57 September 35 16 51 October 37 11 48 November 35 10 45 December 35 10 45 Annual Average Employees 35.9 13.3 49.2 In the example, even though the employer has over 50 full -time employees and FTE s for some months, on average over the year there are fewer than 50 full -time and f ull-time equivalent employees. Thus, the employer would be eligible to enroll in the SHOP and would not be subject to the employer shared - responsibility payments. If the employer's annual average FTE count, displayed in the highlighted box of the chart above, is greater than 50 employees, the employer is not be eligible for enrollment in the SHOP and would be subject to the em ployer share d-responsibility requirements. However, employers of seasonal workers that have an average annual FTE count over 50 may not be subject to the employer shared -responsibility requirement if their employee count exceeds 50 employees for no more th an four months out of the year and the employees in excess of 50 ar e considered seasonal workers. In addition, employees that enroll in coverage through the SHOP when they have under 50 FTEs may continue to reenroll in SHOP coverage even if they grow to ov er 50 fu ll-time equivalent employees. The FTE count is based on the parent business. Businesses with multiple divisions or subsidiaries that are owned by the same organization will sum their FTE counts. Sidebar: Eligibility for the small group market in the state is based on full -time employees while eligibility for the SHOP is based on full -time equivalent employees. Employers that have over 50 employees when FTEs are included, but under 50 full -time employees, will not be eligible for initial enrollment in the SHOP and will be subject to employer shared -responsibility provisions. However, they will also be eligible for small group coverage off of the FFM and ineligible for large group coverage by virtue of havin g fewer than 50 full -time employees. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 154 of 291 Sidebar: Though the FTE count will determine if a business is a small or large business and eligible to purchase on SHOP or subject to the large employer mandate, the employees that will be offered coverage under a plan are only those employees that are full -time employees, meaning those that work over 30 hours a week. Under the ACA, employers are not required to offer coverage to employees that work under 30 hours a week for employers that exceed 50 employees. More information on FTE count can be found at www.healthcare.com/small -businesses and www.irs.gov/pub/irs -drop/n -12-58.pdf count www.healthcare.gov/shop -calculators -fte/. Employers with questions about their FTE count and if they are a large or small employer should contact an ag ent or broker46 or the SHOP at www.healthcare.gov /small -businesses or 1-800-706-7893. 3. Small Employers a. SHOP Marketplace The Small Business Heal th Options Program (SHOP) is a m arketplace for small employers in Indiana with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) . Small em ployers may use the SHOP to purchase coverage for their employees. In most circumstances SHOP , coverage may be obtained at any time of the year and is not subject to an open enrol lment period. For employers that do not meet minimum participation or minimum contribution requirements , there will be a once annual \"open enrollment period ;\" all other employers may enroll in the SHOP at any time. Small e mployers interested in SHOP coverage should contact their ag ent or broker or the SHOP directly at www.healthcare.gov /small -businesses or 1-800-706-7893. Employers may set up an onl ine account for the SHOP at any time and will be able to receive an eligibility determination for SHOP coverage and begin the plan selec tion pro cess . Employers may view a sample employer application on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website at www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms -Reports -and- Other -Resources/Downloads/shop -employer -Resources/Downloads/shop - employee -application -5-31-2013.pdf completed online at www.healthcare.gov /small -businesses . Also, detailed, step -by-step guides on how to complete the application and enrollment process are posted online at www.healthcare.gov/small -busines ses/choose - and-enroll/enroll -in-shop . More info rmation on the SHOP is available in the SHOP section . b. Small Employer Tax Credits Small employers with fewer than 2 5 FTEs , excluding the owner and family members, with an average per employee wage lower than $50,000 annually, may be eligible for a tax credit if they purchase coverage on the SHOP Marketplace for their full -time employees. This tax credit can be claimed by eligible small employe rs when they file their taxes. The amount of the small emp loyer tax credit is up to 50% of the amount the employer pays towa rds premiums for employees (up to 35% for tax -exempt 46 A list of agents and brokers who have completed the FFM registration is posted on the CMS website at https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs -and-initiatives/health -insurance -marketplaces/a -b- resources.html#Agent%20and%20Broker%20Federally - Facilitated%20Marketplace%20%28FFM%29%20Registration%20Completion%20List . Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 155 of 291 employers) and can only be claimed if the employer purchases insurance for their employees through the SHOP Marketplace. The amount of the tax credit varies by the number of employees and the employee's average wages. Employers with fewer workers and a lower average wage will receive a greater relative tax credit. The following table (see Table 4 8) displays the percent of their contribution that qualifying employers may expect to be returned at tax filing if they have offered coverage through the SHOP Marketplace . This table is for illustrative purposes only, and does not represent the actual tax c redit any small employer may or may not be eligible for. Table 48: Small Employ er Tax Credits - Percent of Employer C ontribution Full-time equivalent employees Average Annual Wages of Small Business Health Insurance Tax Credit , www.ncsl.org/documents/health/SBtaxCredits.pdf Employers may also utilize the tax credit estimator available at www.healthcare.gov/shop -calculators - taxcredit . Employers interested in applying for the tax credit can find more information on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website at www.irs.gov/uac/Small -Business -Health-Care -Tax-Credit -for-Small -Employers . Employers that are interested in applying for the tax credit should contact their agent or broker, a tax professional, or the SHOP Marketplace at www.healthcare.gov /small -businesses or 1-800-706-7893 for further detail on the application process and requirements. c. Employer Shared -Responsibility Payments Starting in 2015, employers in Indiana with over 50 full -time employees , including full -time equivalent employees (FTEs) , have been subject to the employer shared -responsibility p rovisions (the \"Employer Mandate \"). These employers are subject to a tax penalty levied by the IRS for each month in which they have one or more full-time employees receiving a premium tax c redit (PTC) through the Federally -Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 156 of 291 facilitated Marketplace (FFM) . Employers will not be subject to the shared -responsibility payment if employees that work on average less than 30 hours a week receive a premium tax credit . The shared - responsibility payment assessed when full -time employees receive a PTC will vary depending on whether or not the employer offers coverage to at least 95%47 perce nt of their full -time employees . Additional -law-and- business/employer -shared -responsibility -payment for other methods use d to assess the employer shared -responsibility payment. Table 49: Large Employer Shared -Responsibility Payments Employers Offering Coverage to At Least 95% of Full-Time E mployees Employers Not Offering Coverage to At Least 95% of Full -Time E mployees Penalty is the lesser of: $3,000 per year ($250 per month) for each full-time employee receiving a premium tax c redit (PTC) , or $2,000 per year ($167 per month) for every full-time employee and full -time equivalent employee (FTE) , excluding the first 30 employees $2,0 00 per year ($167 per month)* for every full-time employee and FTE , excluding the first 30 employees * For an employer that offers coverage for some months but not others during the calendar year, the payment is computed separately for each month for which coverage was not offered. Source: Internal Revenue Service, Calculation of Employer Shared Responsibility Payment employer with 75 FTEs that offers coverage to at least 95% of their full -time employees and has one full-time employee who receives a PTC for the entire year would be subject to a p enalty of $3,000, if the full-time employee only received a PTC for a month, this employer would be subject to a $250 penalty. An employer with 75 FTEs that does not offer coverage to at least 95% of full -time employees and has one or more full -time employ ee(s) receive a PTC for an entire year will be subject to a penalty of $90,000 .48 If one or more full -time employees receive a PTC for a single month then the employer with 75 FTEs will be s ubject to a penalty of $7,500. Employers that offer coverage to a t least 95% of their full -time employees but have a substantial number of full -time employees that receive a PTC due to the employer coverage either being unaffordable ( premium contribution exceeds 9.66 % of household income for single coverage) or not offering minimum value (MV) will pay: the lesser of $3,000 for each employee receiving a PTC for the entire year or $2,000 for each full -time employee and FTE, excluding the first 30 employees. For example, if an employer with 75 FTEs that offers coverage to at least 95% of their employees has 35 full - time employees that receive PTCs for the entire year, they would not be subject to the $3,000 penalty for every individual receiving a PTC, as this would be $105,000, which is greater th an the $90,000 an employer of the same size that did not offer coverage to at least 95% of FTEs would pay. This employer would pay the maximum penalty amount of $90,000. The amounts of the employer penalty will be updated on an annual basis. 47 Large employers with between 50 and 100 employees may have up to five full -time employees that are not offered coverage. 48 $2,000 x ( 75-30) = $90,000 Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 157 of 291 Large employe rs may be subject to this pena lty when employees receive a premium tax credit . Individuals that have access through an employer to affordable coverage that provides MV are not eligible for a premium tax credit . Large employers will only be subject to this penalty if: The employer -sponsored plan is no t affordable for the employee. For employer -sponsored insurance, affordable coverage costs less than 9. 66% of the employee's household income for a single (not family) premium. Because employers do not know wha t employees' household income is, they may claim a safe harbor exemption if the cost of their lowest cost coverage option, including discounts for non -smoking, is less than 9. 66% of the employee's annual wage as reported on the employees W2. The employer -sponsored plan d oes not provide minimum value. Minimum value is discussed in the next section . The employer does not provide an employer -sponsored plan option to full -time employees. Employers may still implement a waiting period f or enrollment in the employer -sponsored coverage of up to 90 days for new employees. Employers will not be liable for any employer shared -responsibility payments for the employees in the waiting period. Employer shared -responsibility payments for 2016 will be paid in 2017, 2017 will be paid in 2018, and so on. Employers may appeal the as sessment of the employer shared -responsibility provisions. This appeal should be directed to th e IRS , the federal agency that administers the penalties. d. Minimum Value of Plans Nothing requires employer plans to provide minimum value (MV) . Employees may be eligible for premium tax credits (PTCs) if their employer -sponsored plan does not provide MV and employers with over 50 full -time equivalen t employees may be subject to the employer shared -responsibility payments if any of their full -time employees receive premium tax credits . To provide MV, an employer -sponsored plan must have an actuarial v alue (AV) of at least 60 percent . In other words, the employer -sponsored plan must cover at least 60% of the cost of the benefits offered on the plan over the entire population. Employer contributions to health savings a ccounts ( HSAs ) and ) for cost -sharing will count towards MV, as will any incentives employees earn for tobacco cessation activities. Minimum value does not require tha t certain benefits be offered. Plans purchased on the large group marke t or employer self -insurance plans are not required to meet the essential health b enefit (EHB) requirements and individuals covered by large employer plans that provide MV may not have coverage for all 10 categories of t he essential he alth b enefits. Minimum v alue only refers the percent of the cost of benefits covered in aggregate by the employer. Empl oyers may use the MV calculator , which can be downloaded through plan's minimum value. Employers needing as sistance with the MV calculator should contact the SHOP at www.healthcare.gov /small -businesses or 1-800-706-7893 or their agent or broker. Employers with questions pertaining to if their hea lth plan meets the MV requirements should contact their carrier or an agent or broker. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 158 of 291 e. Employer Interaction with the Individual Marketplace Both small and large employers may expect to have some interaction with the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . To apply for coverag e on the FFM , individuals may need help from their employe r to complete the application. Employers can expect to be asked to complete a form for employees that are applying for PTCs for t hemselves or their dependen ts. This form will ask for information such as the federal employer identification n umber (EIN), a contact for employer health coverage options, if the employee or their dependents are eligible for health coverage, and what the cost of the coverage is for the employe e and any eligible dependents. Employers may also expect to be ask ed to provide the MV of their emplo yer-sponsored coverage option. The form that employers may be asked to complete by employees applying for cov erage on the FFM for themselves or their dependents can be viewed at www.healthcare.gov/downloads/employer -coverage -tool.pdf . Employers will also receive a notice from the FFM every time one of their employees r eceives a premium tax credit . Employers are required to notify employees of the coverage avai lable on the FFM , even if affordable coverage that provides MV is offered to all full -time employees. 4. Insurer Impacts a. Rating Requirements Insurers may only charge individuals ' premiums based on age, location, and tobacco -use status , and not based on pre -existing conditions . b. Market Reforms Market reforms require insurers to cover dependents up to age 26 if they offer dependent coverage , eliminate th e ability of insurers to deny coverage or charge higher premiums on the basis health status, and require issuers offering coverage in the individual and small group markets to meet essential health benefit (EHB) and actuarial value (AV) requirements. c. Certification Requirements All health insu rance plans sold in the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) must be certified as qualified health p lans (QHPs). Among many other requirements, QHPs must meet standards related to the adequacy of their provider networks, quality, and non -discrimination. d. Medical Loss Ratio All insurers must meet medical loss r atio (MLR) requirements. The MLR refers to the percent of funds collected through premiums, after accounting for taxes and fees, which an insurer spends on enrollee health care costs. Insurers must meet a n 80% threshold for coverage offered in the indiv idual and smal l group markets. For the large grou p marke t, the requirement is 85% . Insurers that do not meet the threshold for expenditures on enrollees' health care cost s will owe refunds to enrollees or the plan sponsor for the difference between the MLR requirement and the amount spen t on enrollee medical costs. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 159 of 291 D. Health Insurance Basics and Characteristics of Coverage under the Affordable Care Act 1. Basics of Health Insurance Markets The market for he alth insurance is divided into individual, small group, large g roup, and self -insured segments. These market divisions are based on the types of pol icies issued and the number of people covered by each policy. In the individual m arket, health insurance policies cover only an individual and eligible family memb ers and dependents. The insurance policy issued will cover a single individual or family. In the small group m arket, health insurance policies are issued to employers to cover the employees and at the employer's discretion, their families and dependents. In Indiana, small group policies can be issued to employers with 5 0 or fewer eligible employees. \"Eligible employees\" are defined as those \"common -law employees \" (recognized by IRS as the employer's employee; does not include owner or owner's spouse ) who work 30 or more hours per week and have met any employer wai ting period requirements. Part-time employees, temporary employees and seasonal employees do not count when determining if an employer is eligible in the small group or not. Sidebar: Under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA), the definition of s mall employer was set to change effective January 1, 2016, and increase a small employer from one who employs one to 50 employees to one who employs one to 100 employees. However, the PACE Ac t (H.R. 1624 - 114th Congress) , prevents this from happening. Unless a state chooses to define small employer as having up to 100 employees, the definition of small employer will remain at one to 50 employees, as is the case in Indiana. See IDOI Bulletin 221 . Similar to the small group m arket, large group m arket health insurance policies are issued to employers to cover their employees and, at the employer's discretion, their family and dependents. However, large group policies are designed for employers with over 50 eligible employees. Another option for employers is to self -insure. Under a self -insured scenario, the employer \u2014not an insurance company \u2014is responsible for paying health costs of enrolled em ployees up to a capped amount. The capped amount is called \"stop -loss insurance \" and covers self -insured employers who have employees with high cost medical ev ents. For self -insured policies, insurance companies act as administrators of hea lth benefits for the employer. In general, large employers are most likely to self - insure, th ough not all l arge group policies are self -insured. Insurers offering products or services in a ny market segment (individual, small group, large group, or self-insured) may be designated as a health maintenance o rganization (HMO) . In general, HMOs have more exclusive provider contracts than other health insurers; that is, individuals covered under an H MO will have a prescribed set of providers that may provide covered services. Due to the way HMOs contract with providers, their provider networks may be smaller than non -HMO networks; however, these tighter networks may provide a more coord inated health care experience. Except for certain services, including emergency services, HMOs are not required to cover services provided by out of network providers. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 160 of 291 Other than the HMO designation, insurance policies may be designated as preferred provider organization s (PPO), point of service (POS), exclusive provider organization (EPO), or consumer directed health p lan (CDHP), also known as a high deductible health plan (HDHP). PPOs are health plans that have a contract with certa in providers, referred to as in -networ k providers. Individuals may choose to receive service from among the preferred provider s or may choose to go to an out -of-network provider and in general be subject to greater cost -sharing. POS plans require individuals to select a primary care physician (PCP) who can then refer individuals to other providers that may have a contract with the insurance company 'in network' or be out of th e insurance company's network. EPOs are similar to PPOs; however, under an EPO the individual will receive no insurance coverage for non -emergency services rendered at providers that are not in the plan's network. CDHP plans are plans that have higher deductible costs but often have lower premiums. I ndividuals with CDHP plans are eligible for a health savings a ccount (HSA) , to which they can contribute pre -tax dollars for qualified health expenses. Employers can also contribute to health savings accounts . The Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) is responsible for regulating individual, small g roup, large group and HMO in surers. The IDOI verifies that insurers are financially solvent, have actuarially sound rates, and meet state regulatory requirements. Self-insured plans are regulated by the federal government. 2. Basics of Health Insurance Coverage Regardless of the market from which the individual receives coverage, when a member has purchased and is enrolled in health insurance coverage, the member will receive a card that contains me mber information and basic cost -sharing details. The exact inform ation included on the insurance card is not standard an d will vary from plan to plan. This card must be presented to providers when individuals s eek health care services. Enrollees may expect health insurance coverage to provide coverage as described in the health insurance policy's \"Certificate of Coverage. \" The Certificate of Coverage will list the benefits and services that ar e covered by the plan, the cost -sharing that will be appli ed, and any associated limits. Benefits and services that are excluded from coverage will also be listed. To understand the scope and cost - sharing coverage provisions, members should consult their Certificate of Coverage, look online at the carrier's website, or call their health insurance plan with spe cific questions. Healt h insurance plans may not cover all services offered by medical providers, or may apply different member cost -sharing requirements dependent on the service and selected health care provider. Consumers may also receive a \"Summary of Benefits and Coverage\" from an insurer, which summarizes the key features of a health plan, such as the covered benefits, cost -sharing provisions, and covera ge limitations and exceptions. The Summary of Benefits and Coverage helps consumers better understand the coverage they h ave and compa re different coverage options. Consumers may receive the Summary of Benefits and Coverage from an insurer when shopping for health insurance coverage, when enrolling in coverage, at the beginning of each new plan year, or within seven business days of requesting a copy from their issuer or group health plan. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 161 of 291 a. Health Plan Cost Outside of the benefits covered, one of the main features of health insurance plans is how the cost of the health plan to the beneficiary is distributed between the premium and other cost-sharing , including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Memb ers enrolled in commercial health insurance will pay a monthly fee, termed a premium, to maintain their enrollment in coverage. The member pays this monthly fee regardless of whether or not the member accesses health care services. Health plan members who d o not pay their premiums will have their health insurance coverage cance lled. When members a ccess healthcare services, cost -sharing wi ll likely apply. Depending on the plan, members may have deductibles, copayments , and coinsurance. The cost -sharing re quired by the policy will be described in the Certificate of Coverage, and a summary will be provided on the health insurance card. A deductible is the base amoun t the member pays for services prior to the health insurance paying for coverage. For example a health plan with a $1,000 deductible will require that members pay $1,000 for health services prior to the health plan paying for a portion of care received (see Figure 6 ). Deductibles are s et on an annual basis, and every plan year the enroll ee's deductible will be reset. Health insurers may have separate deductibles for separate services, for example, pharmacy and medical services. Certain services, such as preventive services, may be paid by the health plan in full even if a m ember has not met the member's deductible. In general, members with deductibles will r eceive a bill from their health care provider after their visit showing the amount th e member owes for the service. This amount will be the amount the insurer wou ld have paid to the health care provider for the service. Members with deductibles are responsible for paying the provider for these expenses until they have met their deductible. In addition to a deductible, members may be required to pay either coinsurance or copayments to their healthcare provider. Coinsurance refers to a percent of the cost of the service the health care provider will expect to have paid at the time of the visit. For example, 20% coinsurance means that 20% of the total cost of the service will be charged to the individual when the individual accesses health care services , up to the coinsurance limit (e.g., $5, 000). For example, if the cost of the service is $100, the individual will be expected to pay $20 if the coinsurance limit has not been me t. Once the coinsurance limit is met, the issuer pays the full cost of the service (see Figure 6 ). Depending on the health plan and healthcare provider, individuals may be expected to pay coinsurance at the time of the visit, or th ey may receive a bill from the provider showing the amount of coinsurance owed after the visit. Copayments (or \"copays \") refer to a specific dollar amount that an individual will pay for a particular service, regardless of the total cost of the service accessed. For example, an individual may have a $15 copaymen t for a doctor's office visit. Copayments are generally required to be pa id at the time of the service. Coinsurance and copayments can differ based on the type of service accessed ; and there may b e different amounts applied to primary care physician visits, specialist visits, and prescription drugs. In addition, prescription drug coverage may have cost -sharing tiers, and depending on the prescription selected, the individual may pay different copay ments or coinsurance amounts. Copayments and coinsurance count towar ds the enrollee's deductible. Until the enrollee has met the enrollee's deductible, the provider may bill the enrollee directly, even if copayment or coinsurance was paid at t he Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 162 of 291 time of t he health service. The amount of the bill will be for the difference between the copayment or the coinsurance paid at the time of the visit and the amount the insurer wo uld have paid for the service. After the deductible is met for covered services, the enrollee will only be responsible for paying the copayment or coinsurance up to the policy's out -of-pocket maximum cost. The following figure provides an illustration of how deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments work (see Figure 6 ): Figure 6: Example of Health care Cost -Sharing between a Consumer and Issuer Example plan features: $1,000 deductible, 20% -of- pocket limit (deductible excluded), and $15 copayment. Example shows the cost -sharing from the consumer's point of view. *Issuer pays 80%, and consumer pays 20% of healthcare costs **Excluding some doctor vis its, which may be covered by $15 copayment The health plan's out -of-pocket maximum is the greatest amount that an enrollee can expect to pay for services in any plan year. Out-of-pocket maximum will likely b e different fo r individual and family plans. Beginning in 2014, out -of-pocket maximums for the majority of health plans in the market will be limited to a maximum amount set by the I nternal Revenue Service (IRS).49 Stand -alone dental plans or pediatric de ntal benefits may also have a separat e out -of-pocket maximum . The stand -alone pediatric dental out -of-pocket maximums only apply to benefits for those under 19; there is no mandate d limit for adults. Beginning in 2015, plans are required to coordinate out -of-pocket maximums across benefits and individuals will not be subject to separate out -of-pocket maximums for services covered on a single plan with the exception of stand -alone pediatric dental benefits. The separate out -of-pocket maximum for stand -alone pediatric dental benefits remain s. Out-of-pocket maximums will be lower for individuals eligible for cost-sharing r eductions (CSRs) based on their income. Out-of-pocket maximums apply only to in -network providers and the essential health benefits (EHBs). Benefits in excess of the EHB s and non -emergency services provided out of network are not subject to this out -of-pocket maximum. Out-of-pocket maximums are determined on an annual basis and reset each po licy year. 49 For 2017, this maximum amount is $7,150 for an individual and $14,300 for a family. These limits apply to medical benefits only and if, for example, pharmacy benefits are separately administered, they may have separate out-of-pocket max imums up to the $7,150 individual and $14,300 family amounts. Deductible Consumer pays 100% of healthcare costs up to the amount of the deductible ( e.g., $1,000**) Coinsurance Consumer pays 20% of healthcare costs up to limit of coinsurance (e.g., $5,000) Issuer Consumer pays 0% of healthcare costs after costs reach deductible plus coinsurance limit (e.g., $6,000); issu er pays 100% Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 163 of 291 Many health insurance plans will have different cost -sharing requirements for in -network and out -of- network providers. In-network providers have engaged in a contract with the insurer and agreed to provide services at a discounted rate in retur n for access to a larg e group of insured individuals. A list of in-network providers can be accessed through the health insurer's website or by calling the health insurer 's consumer help desk. Enrollees in need of emergency services who seek care through a n out -of- network provider will not be subject t o increased out -of-network cost -sharing. Additionally, if an insurance plan does not contract with a provider that can provide an ACA -mandated preventive service in-network, the plan must cover the service pro vided by an out -of-network pro vider and apply in - network cost -sharing. Cost -sharing for out -of-network providers will likely be higher than in -network providers. Some out -of- network providers may not accept an individual's health insurance, and paym ent m ay be requested up front. For providers that do not accept an individual's health insurance, an individual may submit a form directly to their insurer showing what they paid for the service. If this form is submitted, the amount the enrollee spent for cove red services will count toward the plan deductible and out -of-pocket maximum, and if the enrollee has met his or her deductible the insurer may issue compensation. To help pay for cost -sharing, including coinsurance, co payments, and deductibles, individu als can take advantage of health savings a ccounts (HSAs) or flexible spending a ccounts (FSAs) . Health savings account s are only available for individual s that select consumer directed health plans (CDHPs) or high deductible health p lans (HDHP s). Both HSAs and FSAs allow the individual and the individual's employer to contribute pre -tax dollars towards th e cost of future health costs. Dollars in HSAs do not expire and belong solely to the individual (including the employer contribution), but individuals must pay a penalty if they use the funds for anything other than q ualified health care expenses. FSAs also allow individuals and employers to contribute to potential cost sharing; however, funds in flexible spending accounts expire at the end of the year. Some individuals may also have access to a health reimbursement a ccount (HRA) through their employer. These accounts allow the individual to pay for cost -sharing; however, in general, unlike HSAs, the employer owns the funds (as opposed to the individual). Each time a health service is accessed, members will receive an \"Explanation of Benefits \" (EOB) from their insurer. This document will describe what the insurer paid for the service, what the member paid and/or owes for the service, and a summary of the me mber's remaining deductible and out-of-pocket maximum amounts. These forms provide information to the member on their use of services and are not bills. 3. Types of Health Insurance Coverage a. Major Medical Insurance Health insurance plans termed major medical insurance offer individuals comprehensive ins urance against potential health care costs. Major medical insurance plans offer coverage for a wide array of health benefits, providers, p roducts, and services. Plans that only cover a specific heal th condition or service are not major medical products. In general, being covered by a major medical insurance product will qualify as minimum essential c overage (MEC) und er the Affordable Care Act (ACA) . However, some major medical i nsurance products are not considered MEC, for example certain type s of student health insurance. For more detail on if a certain major medical i nsurance product will meet the requirement to maintain MEC, see the Minimum Essential Coverage section . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 164 of 291 Major m edical insurance p roducts are offered in the individual, small group, large group, and s elf- insured ma rkets and can be structured as a preferred p rovid er organization (PPO), ex clusive provider organization (EPO), health maintenance organization (HMO), or point of s ervice (POS) plans . Many of the ACA provisions apply to major medical insurance plans. For individuals enrolling in plans through a large employer offering large group or self-insured coverage to their employees, the process of enrolling in major medical insurance coverage will not change substantially. The coverage offered by these plans will be required to meet the ACA preventive benefit plan requirements and other ma rket reforms and will be subject to minimum value (MV) requirements. However, for individuals enrolled in these coverage types, the options and enrollment process will not vary substantially. For consumers or business looking f or coverage in the small group or individual markets , the coverage options and benefits will vary from the previous process. b. Metal Tiers (Actuarial Value) All non-grandfathered health coverage (excluding grandmothered/t ransitional plan s) in the individual and small group marke ts on and off the Marketplace are required to offer coverage that is indexed to a certain actuarial v alue (AV) and are referred to as \"metal tiers .\" The plans offere d will be designated bronze, silver, gold, or platinum . The higher level plans ( e.g., gold and platinum) will, in general, have higher premium s, but require less member cost -sharing. Regardless of metal level, all coverage in the individual and small group markets will also be required to cover the essential health b enefits (EHB). Overall, the benefits covered will not vary by metal lev el, however, the enrollee 's cost -sharing responsibility will vary by metal level. c. Catastrophi c Plans Consumers looking for coverage in the individual market may also have the option of selecting a catastrophic plan. These plans offer coverage that does not meet the bronze metal tier requirements. Those insured by catastrophic p lans can expect , in aggregate , to pay over 40% of t heir total medical cost. In general, these plans will have a deductible equal to the out -of-pocket maximum levels and will only provide coverage for required preventive care and a few primary care physician visits prior to t he enrollee meeting the deducti ble. Other than these services, enrollees will be required to cover the costs for all health care until the out -of-pocket maximum is met in or for any plan year. With catastrophic -plan coverage, enrollees may expect that th ey will pay less for the policy, but will bear a greater share of the expenses if they have a health event. Catastrophic p lans are not available to all individuals and may only be purchased by those who are under 30 or who have received an exemption from t he individual s hared -responsibility r equirement to maintain minimum essential c overage . Catastrophic p lans may provide family coverage and may enroll children, but they are not avail able in the small g roup. Catastrophic plans offered inside the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) will be subject to the open enrollment periods and special enrollment p eriods (SEPs) . Outside of the FFM , as with all outside market plans, enroll ment in catastrophic p lans may be restricted to the open enrollment periods at the health insurance issuer's discretion. Catastrophic p lans may be available; however, there is no re quirement for health insurance issu ers on or off the FFM to offer these products. These plans are not eligible for the premium tax c redit (PTC) or cost-sharing r eduction (CSR ). Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 165 of 291 d. Grandfathered Plans The ACA allows health plans that were in existence as of th e passage of the law to obtain \"Grandfathered\" status and to be exempt from compliance with many ACA provi sions related to benefits, cost -sharing, pre -existing condition ex clusions, and annual maximums. Plans may only maintain grandfathered coverage status if they do not make substantial change s to their policies. If a plan eliminates a b enefit, increases enrollee cost -sharing, or increases or adds annual maximums, it will cea se to be a grandfathered plan. The grandfathered plan provision is intended to allow employer -sponsored and individual coverage a more gradual trans ition to the ACA requirements. Because plans lose grandfathered status if they make changes, it is expected that each year, fewer and fewer individuals will be covered by grandfathered plans and more individuals will receive coverage under plans that must fully comply with all ACA requirements. Individuals who are newly enrolling in coverage will not be enrolled into grandfathered coverage, with the exception of individuals who are added as a spouse or dependent on a grandfathered individual policy. Those enrolling into group coverage may receive grandfathered coverage if the large or small group plan they are enrolling in has maintained its grandfathered status since the passage of the A ffordable Care Act . It is difficult to tell if any particular employer -sponsored health plan is grandfathered. If an individual finds that his or her plan is not covering the ACA -mandated p reventive service s without cost -sharing, or is imposing an annual maximum limi t, the individual should contact the employer or plan administrator to determine if the coverage is grandfathered coverage. Grandfathered coverage meets the requirement to maintain minimum esse ntial c overage . Individuals offered grandfathered coverage through an employer may choose to not accept the coverage and purchase coverage that meets the ACA requirements in the individual m arket. However, unless the grandfathered coverage option was unaff ordable or did not provide MV, these individuals will not be eligible for premium tax c redits . e. Grandmothered Health Plans Grandmothered healt h plans, often referred to as \"t ransitional\" health plans, are health plans that were effective after the ACA was signed into law on M arch 23, 2010, and issued prior to December 31, 2013 . Grandmothered plans include some , but not all, of the ACA features, and they cannot be sold on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . On March 5, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) released a bulletin stating that it will allow insurers to renew existing individual and small group health insurance policies even though they do not meet all of the requiremen ts of the Affordable Care Act. The extension will be for t wo years, meaning policies can be renewed through October 1, 2016 if a state 's insurance re gulators permit such renewals. An insurer may choos e to renew all i ndividual policies and non -renew small g roup policies, or vice-versa. On March 31, 2014 , the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) released a bulletin stating that it will allow insurers to determine whether to renew grandmothered plans so long as the renewals are made on a non -discriminatory basis. Therefore insurers must renew or non -renew all i ndividual or small g roup policie s. Plans that are cancelled cannot be reinstated. The IDOI is not requiring insur ers to renew Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 166 of 291 policies. In addition, consumers may not purchase new grandmothered p lans or switch to a different insurer to replace a grandmothered p lan. The grandmothered p lans renewed under thi s option must not undergo any material changes to the plan ( e.g., a change in plan benefits or a \"buy -down\" of plan premiums by ins urer to lower cost -sharing ); otherwise, an ACA -compli ant product would be required. The grandmothered p lans renewed under this option are not required to contain the 10 EHBs , or to adopt the ra ting structure of fully ACA -compliant plans. However, grandmothered p lans must comply with the following ACA provisions upon renewal: Elimination of annual dollar l imits on EHB to the extent the grandmothered p lans cover EHBs No pre -existing condition exclusion ( small groups) Waiting periods not to exceed 90 days ( small groups) Mental health parity rules ( individual plans upon renewal July 1, 2014 or later; not applicable to small group plans) Cover certain preventive health b enefits designated by the ACA (individual and small g roup) Spending no less than 80% of premiums on medical costs (individual and sma ll group) Carriers who elect to offer 2014 renewals of these existing plans \u2014the grandmothered p lan option \u2014 were required to provide notice to any individuals and small businesses that received a discontinuation letter. Voluntary termination of a policy by an individual does not constitute a special enrollment period. f. Qualified Health Plans Plans sold on the i ndividual or SHOP marketplace s must be certified as qualified health p lans (QHPs). For individuals , the QHPs offered through a m arketplace are the only plans that an individual can pur chase that are eligible for PTCs or cost-sharing r eductions . For small businesses , the QHPs on the SHOP are the only plans that an employer can receive a tax credit for begi nning in 2014. Like all individual and small group plans, all QHPs must meet the EHB requirements and offer metal tier plans that are indexed to AV, including bronze, silver, gold, or p latinum plans. In addition to these market -wide requirements, QHPs off ered on the FFM are subject to additional requirements and must receive a certification. Each QHP must offer an option, at minimum, for the silver and gold metal tier and must offer comparable child -only plans. Child -only plans are options that enroll only a child without offering coverage for the child's parent, caregiver, or legal guardian. In cases where employer -sponsored coverage does not offer coverage for dependents, the child caregiver relationship does not allow the dependent to be added to the adult's plan, or to the parents or legal guardians covered by Medicare. These policies offer an opportunity to purchase coverage only for a child without having an adult covered as well through a family policy. Qualified health plans must offer child -only policies in at least the silver and gold levels. In Indiana, since the passage of the ACA and the subsequent elimination of health insurers' ability to deny coverage for children based on preexist ing conditions, there were no health insurer op tions for child -only coverage. Coverage throu gh child -only plans is an option on and off the FFM as of January 1, 2014. Child -only plans off ered on the FFM are QHPs and are eligible for PTCs and cost-sharing reductions . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 167 of 291 Qualified health plans must also be accredited, or be in the process of gaining accreditation, through a recognized accrediting entity. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC ) are recognized as accrediting entit ies for qualified health plans. Accreditation is an independent evaluation of the health plan that identifies area of improvement and allows for health plan quality reporting. Terminology displayed next to a QHP such as \"Accredited by NCQA\" or \" Accredited by URAC \" means that the plan has received an independent evaluation by the accrediting entity and i s considered to be accredited. If the plan is in the process of receiving accreditation, the QHP will be indicated as \"Not yet accredited.\" In addition to accreditation, QHP s must meet network adequacy and standards related to providing coverage through a sufficient number of essential community p roviders. In absence of state -specific standards, health plans that are accredited are assumed to meet the networ k adequacy standards as network adequacy is a component of the accreditation pr ocess. Plans that are in the process of receiving accreditation must submit docu mentation of network adequacy. QHPs must also meet the requirement to have a sufficient number of essential communi ty providers in their network. Essential community providers are health providers and clinics that are in health provider shortage areas and/or serve predominantly low -income clients. As of 2016, QHPs are required to include at least 3 0% of the essential community providers in their service area as network providers, or they must submit a justification as to why t hey do not meet this standard. Both the network adequacy and essential community provider policies are t ransitional and may chan ge in future years. Qualified health plan s must also meet non -discrimination standards and they may not design or offer health benefits in a manner that discriminates against individuals on any basis, including race, gender, and health st atus. These plans may not change their premium amount during the year; provided nothing changes in the enrollee's circumstance, those who enroll are assured that until the close of the plan year, their premium or cost -sharing will remain constant. Premiums may change if en rollees add or remove dependents from their policy, move to a different rating area, or change their tobacco use status. Finally, QHPs must m eet transparency requirements. They must keep their provider lists, including the list of providers that are accep ting new patients, up to date and make them readily available to member s. They must also provide cost -sharing information to members for specific services upon member inquiry. Sidebar : The ACA requires the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HH S) to develop quality data collection and reporting tools such as a Quality Rating System (QRS), a Quality Improvement Strategy (QIS), and an enrollee satisfaction survey system. The framework for a QRS has been continually developed to ra te QHPs offered t hrough a marketplace on specific quality measures. Issuers of QHPs are required to col lect and report data for the Quality Rating System . Qualified health plan s may be offered both on and off of a m arketplace. Qualified health plans offered off of a m arketplace must have the same pricing as tho se offered on a m arketplace. Only QHPs offered through a m arketplace are eligible for insurance affordability p rograms , including PTCs and cost-sharing reductions . QHPs wil l be identified throu gh their marketing materials. Qualified health plan s offered off of the FFM will identify that they have QHP certification, but that they are not eligible for insurance affordability p rograms. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 168 of 291 To enroll in a QHP on the FFM , indiv idual s must be U.S. citizen s, national s, or legal resident s, not be incarcerated, and reside or intend to reside in the state in which the QHP is offer ed. For individuals that do not meet the citizen, national or legal resident requirement, the plan must be mad e available to the individual outside the FFM if it is eligible to be sold on the outside market. g. Multi -State Plans Multi -state plans are plans that were offered initially in some stat es, but in all states by 2016. These plans are offered through the FFM and are plans that the Federal Office of Personnel and Management contracts with issuers to offer in the m arketplaces. Multi -state plans are QHPs and are eligible for individuals interested in receiving PTCs and cost-sharing r eductions . They will not be offered on the outside market. In Indiana, multi -state p lans will be required to offer the same set of EHBs and meet the same requirements as other plans on the market. 4. Other Commercial Coverage Types In addition to the types of major medical i nsurance discussed, excepted b enefits will continu e to be offered in the market. Excepted benefit plans are plans that cover a specific service or condition and do not provide comprehensive health coverage. These plans are not subject to m any of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) market reforms and may still use lifetime and annual maximums and factors other than age, location, and tobacco use to d evelop their premiums. These plans may also deny, or charge additional premium based on pre -existing health conditions. a. Stand -Alone Plans Stand -alone dental plans will be the only excepted benefit plan that are offer ed on the Federally - facilitated Marketplace (FFM) . Pediatric dental is an essential health b enefi t (EHB) requir ement under the ACA , and health plans that offer dental -only benefits are availa ble on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . If there are a sufficient number of s tand -alone dental plans on the FFM , major medical QHPs will not have to offer the pediatric dental benefit. Marketplace stand -alone dental plans are prohibited from applying lifetime or annual maximums to the pediatric dental portion of the stand -alone dental benefit. To be of fered on the FFM , stand -alone dental plans must go thro ugh a ce rtification process similar to qualified health p lans (QHPs) and must meet certain requirements including network adequacy, essential community providers, and non -discri mination. Stand -alone dental plans will not be offered in the metal tier levels of QHPs, but instead the pediatric stand -alone dental benefit will be offered at a high and low level of 70% and 85% actuarial v alue (AV) , respectively. The out -of-pocket li mit for stand - alone dental plans will not be coordinated wit h the enrollee's major medical i nsuranc e plan. Note , these Sidebar: While QHP requirements do not limit individuals that have Medicare from purchasing a QHP, existing requirements prohibit insurers from selling a major medical policy to cover an individual that has Medicare. Individuals covered by Medicare looking for addi tional coverage should contact the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) at 1 -800-452-4800. More information about SHIP can be found at www.in.gov/idoi/2507.htm . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 169 of 291 requirements only apply to pediatric dental benefits, or benefits for those under 18 years old . There are no ACA requirements related to actuarial value or out -of-pocket limits for adult dental benefits. Stand -alone dental plans on the FFM may be purchased with the use of the premium tax c redit (PTC). If, after the purchase of a major medical plan, an individu al has remaining PTC funds, these funds may be applied to the purchase of a stand -alone dental plan. The individual will pay any remaining premium not cover ed by the remaining PTC funds. Stand -alone dental plans are not eligible for cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). Individuals that qualify for CSR for their major medical plan will not receive them for their stand -alone plan. Individuals purchasing cover age on the FFM will not be required to purchase a pediatric dental stand - alone plan if the QHP they select do es not offer pediatric dental. However, individuals purchasing coverage that does not offer pediatr ic dental coverage off of the FFM will be required to assure the carrier that they have stand -alone dental coverage for the pediatri c dental EHB through a marketplace certified stand -alone dental plan. Stand -alone dental plans off of the FFM are offered both as m arketplace -certi fied, for individuals who need to make an assurance that they have coverage through a m arketplace -certified stand -alone dental plan, and as p lans without this design ation. Stand -alone dental plans on a m arketplace may also offer adult dental, however pediatric dental is a requirement. b. Other Excepted Benefit Plans Of the other excepted benefit plans availa ble, the most common is stand -alone vision. Othe r excepted benefit plans include: (1) those sold for disease -specific coverage such as \"cance r-only policies ;\" (2) those sold for benefit -specific coverage such as inpatient hospital coverage ; or (3) \" fixed indemnity insurance \" offered on a separate poli cy from p rimary health coverage . These excepted benef it plans are not subject to ACA market reform requirements, are not offered through m arketplaces, and are not eligible to be purchased through insurance affordability p rograms . Individuals interested in purchasing these plans should seek information through an insurance agent or broker. c. High Risk Pool Coverage Indiana's high risk pool \u2014the Indiana Comprehensive Health Insurance Association (ICHIA) \u2014provide d coverage for individuals with high risk conditions who have been denied commercial insurance due to their health status. With the ACA market reforms, major medical insurers could no longer deny individuals coverage based on health status; thus, the ICHIA program was no longer needed. Individuals seeking coverage through ICHIA should ap ply for coverage through the FFM or directl y through an insurer. T hey may no longer be denied bas ed on health status. Similarly, the temporary federal program for individuals with high -risk conditions, the Pre -Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) , phased out in 2014. Individuals interested in PCIP coverage sho uld apply through the FFM or directly with an insurer. Beginning in 2014, these individuals may no longer be denied coverage due to health status.

Characteristics of the Health Insurance Market under the Affordable Care Act 1. Minimum Essential Coverage The Affordable Care Act (ACA) c ontains a provision requiring non -exempt individuals to maintain minimum essential c overage (ME C) for each month in the year. Coverage for one day in the month is considered to be coverage for the entire month. The requirement to maintain MEC is referred t o as the shared -responsibility provision or the Individual M andate . Non -exempt individuals who do not maintain MEC will be subject to a tax penalty from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Minimum essential c overage is coverage that is considered comprehensive health insurance by the Affordable Care Act . Minimum essential c overage is not defined by the benefits cove red, but by types of coverage. In determining if an individual has maintained MEC, neither the cost the i ndividual has paid for the coverage or what the coverage offers is taken into ac count. The only concern is if the individual's type of coverage is considered to be MEC by the federal government. Under the ACA , certain government -sponsored health coverage programs and private market coverage types are designated as MEC ; and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury are provided with the ability to designate other coverage as minimum essential c overage. In addition, there are coverage types that are not considered to be MEC that ar e defined by federal guidance. The types of coverage designated as MEC and those not recognized as MEC will be continually upda ted by the federal gov ernment. As of 2016 , certain types of coverage considered to be MEC and types not considered to be MEC are outlined in the following table (see Table 50). Individuals with questions on whether their coverage type is recognized as MEC should contact their coverage provider or the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) at www.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318- 2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) . A list of health plans that qualify as MEC is posted on the FFM website at www.healthcare.gov/fees/plans -that-count -as-coverage . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III.

Government -Sponsored Coverage Government -sponsored coverage, including Medicaid, the Children Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ), the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0), Medi care programs and coverage for V eterans and Peace Corps volunteers , is, with a few exceptions, considered to be minimum essential c overage . Individuals enrolled in these coverage types will meet the requirement to maintain MEC for every month in which they are enrolled. i. Minimu m Essential Coverage Detail: Medicare The Medicare p rogram is a taxpayer -funded program administe red by the federal government. It provides health coverage to those age 65 and older and qualify ing disabled indivi duals. Many qualified individuals are autom atically enrolled in Medicare. Med icare has multiple components. Part A covers hospital and home health services ; and the vast majority of beneficiaries do not pay a premium for it. Part B covers doctor visits and other non -hospital related medical item s and services, and in general requires payment of a premium. Part C combines Medicare Part A and Part B and is referred to as Medicare Advantage; it offers both hospital and outpatient medical coverage through p rivate market health insurers. Part D covers pharmacy benefits. To qualify as having MEC, individuals only have to be enrolled in Part A. Medicare Part C also counts as minimum essential c overage . For the minority of individuals who do not qualify for Part A and have bought into Part B and D coverage, th ese types of Me dicare are not considered to be minimum essential coverage . In addition, for a minority of individuals that must pay premiums for Medicare Part A, they are only considered to have access to MEC if they enroll in this coverage and would not be ineligible for premium tax c redits (PTCs) based on access to Medicaid Part A if they choose not to enroll. Figure 7: Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) and Medicare Summary In addition, some individuals purchase Medica re supplemental policies, termed Medigap policies. Medigap policies by themselves are not considered to be MEC; however, purchase of a Medigap policy requires enrollment in Part A and Part B, so individuals with a Medigap policy should meet the MEC require ments due their enrollment in Part A. Medicare Part A (Hospital) Medicare Part C (Private Market) MEC Medicare Part B (Medical) Medicare Part D (Prescription) Not MEC Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III.

Minimum Essential Coverage Detail: Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are programs that are administered by states and jointly funded through the federal gover nment and the state. Each state has different progra m op tions and eligibility criteria. In general, Medicaid and CHIP offer coverage to low -income individuals that meet the program eligibility criteria; depending on the program, the eligibility criteria for Medicaid may be related to income, age, disability , or health status. For more information on details and eligibility criteria for Medicaid and CHIP in Indiana , please see the details in the Medicai d section and CHIP section . With the exception of the following programs, all Medicaid and CHIP programs are considered to be MEC and enrollment in these programs will satis fy the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage . iii. Minimum Essential Coverage Detail: Healthy Indiana Plan The Healthy Indi ana Plan ( HIP 2.0 ) is the s tate of Indiana's plan to improve and expand the successful Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) and concurrently replace traditional Medicaid in Indiana for all non -disabled Hoosiers ages 19 -64. HIP 2.0 builds on the successes of the orig inal HIP design. It adds new pathways for coverage \u2014HIP Plus, HIP Basic, HIP State Plan, and HIP Employer Link \u2014that promote employer - sponsored coverage and continue HIP's private market consumer -directed model with incentives for members to take personal re sponsibility for their health. Full details on HIP 2.0 are available on the HIP 2.0 website at www.in.gov/fssa/hip and in the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) section of this resource manual. iv. Minimum Essential Coverage Detail: Medicaid Family Planning Coverage The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) offers states the option to implement a Medicaid program that prov ides family planning services. This coverage is not con sidered to be MEC and those enrolled in the family planning coverage option through Medicaid must seek other sources of MEC to meet the requirement to maintain minimum essential c overage . For more information on the Medicaid family planning c overage option please see the Medicaid section . v. Minimum Essential Coverage Detail: Medicaid Tuberculosis Related Services The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services offers states the option to implement a Medicaid program that covers individuals who are diagnosed with tuberculosis for tuberculosis -related services. This coverage is not considered to be MEC and those enrolled in coverage for tuberculosis -related services must seek other sourc es of MEC to meet the requirement to maintain minimum essential Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 174 of 291 coverage . Indiana has not implemented this optional coverage category, so there will be no Indiana residents with this coverage type. More information on tuberculosis related services can b e found on CMS's website at http://downloads.cms.gov/cmsgov/archived -downloads/CMCSBulletins/downloads/Info -Bulletin -TB.pdf vi. Minimum Essential Coverage Detail: Medicaid Pregnancy -Related Services States have the option, with federal approval, to provide pregnancy -related coverage to certain Medicaid -eligible pregnant women versus full Medicaid coverage. Women covered by a Medic aid program offering benefits based on the covered individual being pregnant are not also considered to be covered by minimum essential coverage . Women with pregnancy -related Medicaid coverage should verify if their state's program is considered MEC. If it is not considered MEC, those women are subject to the individual shared -responsibility penalty if they do not receive other minimum essential coverage . In Indiana, Medicaid provides full benefits to pregnant women and therefore they will qualify as being covered by minimum essential coverage . More information on pregnancy -related services in Indiana can be found in the Medicaid section . vii. Minimum Essential Coverage Detail: Medicaid Coverage of Emergency Medical Services Medicaid provides limited emergency services to non -citizens who are not eligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status but who would otherw ise meet the Medicaid eligibility criteria. For individuals receiving these emergency services, only medical benefits are not considered to have minimum essential coverage . Individuals not -lawfully present are no t required to have MEC; however, those lawfu lly present non -citizens who receive Medicaid coverage limited to emergency medical services (EMS) will need to seek other coverage to meet the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage . viii. Minimum Essential Coverage Detail: Coverage for Vete rans and Other Federal Coverage Those with access to medical benefits through the Veterans Administration will most likely meet the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage .50 Comprehensive benefits available under TRICARE and C HAMPVA will be considered MEC and individuals enrolled in these programs will meet the requirement to maintain MEC for each mon th in which they are enrolled. However, programs that do not offer comprehensive health coverage or only cover a specific benefit will likely not be considered to be minimum essential coverage . This includes supplemental TRICARE policies. Federally -sponsored coverage for Peace Corps volunteers counts as minimum essential coverage . Individuals with these coverage types will meet the MEC requirement for every month in which they are enrolled in the coverage. 50 Per the minimum essential coverage (MEC) guidance, health coverage programs for veterans and their dependents under Title 10 USC chapter 55 and Title 38 USC chapter 17 or 18 will qualify as mi nimum essential coverage. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 175 of 291 b. Employer -Sponsored Coverage Health insurance coverage obtained through an employer as small group, large group, or self-insured coverage is considered to be minimum essenti al coverage . Employer -sponsored coverage includes coverage offered by federal, state, and local g overnment to their employees. Those enrolled in employer -sponsored coverage will meet the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage . This is the case even if the employer -sponsored coverage did not offer coverage of the essential health benefits (EHBs) ,51 would not be considered to be affordable for the individual, or did not provide minimum value (MV) . If the individual is enrolled in the employer -sponsored insurance, then he or she meet s the requirement to maintain MEC for every month in which they are enrolled. i. COBRA & Retiree Coverage Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) and retiree coverage that are sponsored by an employer count as MEC for the enrolle d individuals. However, individuals that are eligible for COBRA or retiree coverage, but do not enroll, will not be excluded from eligibility for the premium tax credit (PTC) based on having access to other minimum essential coverage. Individuals that enroll in COBRA or retiree coverage will not be eligible for the PTC and will be considered to have access to other minimum essential coverage. Failure to pay COB RA premiums resulting in loss of coverage will not trigger a special enrollment period (SEP) for the individual. If an employer has over 25 employees , the employee may be eligible for COBRA benefits on termination of employment. The employee has 60 days to c hoose COBRA or an ACA plan. If the employee chooses COBRA , the employee is eligible for an ACA plan only during open enrollment or upon term ination of the COBRA benefits. If an employer has fewer than 25 employees, under Indiana small group law a conversion policy must be offered. c. Coverage in the Individual Market Health insurance coverage obtained through the individual market is considered to be minimum essential coverage . Those enrolled in individual market coverage will meet the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage . This is the case even if the individual is enrolled in a catastrophic plan.52 For every month the individual is enrolled in a plan on the individual market , the individual will meet the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage . d. Coverage under a Grandfathered Plan Certain health plans that have maintained a \"grandfa thered \" status may not meet all of the ACA requirements related to benefits, lifetime and annual, maximums, depen dent age, or other provisions. However, these plans may still be offered if they have maintained their status since the implementation of the A CA as a grandfathered plan and have not made chang es to their benefits or rates. Coverage offered by grandfathered plans is considered to be MEC, even though it may not meet some of the ACA 51 The essential health benefits (EHBs) are not required to be covered in the large group or self -insured markets, only non -grandfathered individual and small group market plans are requ ired to cover the essential health benefits. 52 Individuals may only enroll in the catastrophic plan if they are under age 30 or have received an affordability or hardship exemption. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 176 of 291 requirements. Enrollees of grandfathered plans will meet the requi rement to maintain MEC of every month they are enrolled. e. Additional Coverage as Specified Federal guidance specifies certain additional types of coverage as minimum essential coverage . These coverage types include most student health plans , refugee m edical assistance, and state high risk pool coverage. Enrollees of these types of coverage would be considered covered by MEC for each month in which they were enrolled. Not all types of student health insurance will be considered to be minimum essential coverage . Individuals with questions about if their student health insurance coverage meets the MEC requirements should contact the educational institution an d the health plan in question. Individuals that have access to qualifying student health coverage are only considered eligible for MEC i f they enroll in the coverage. Those that do not enroll may be eligible for premium tax credits (PTCs) or cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) in the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . A list detailing recognized types of MEC is made available by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servic es (HHS) . Individuals with questions about whether their student health insurance op tions qualif y as MEC should consult the HHS list of minimum essential coverage available at www.healthcare.gov/fees/plans -that-count -as-coverage . Sidebar : Student health plans are a type of coverage offered to students and their dependents under a written agreement between an institution of h igher education and an issuer. Effective May 12, 2014 , student health insurance coverage is not required to be offered as a calendar year plan, since coverage is offered norma lly on an academi c year basis. As a result, student health coverage is exempt from the requirement to establish open enrollment periods and coverage effective dates based on a calendar policy year. Any coverage that only covers a certain limited condition, or provides additional coverage to reduce enrollee cost sharing will not be considered MEC; these coverage types include cancer only policies, hospital only policies, or long -term care coverage. f. Updates to Coverage Types Sponsors of other coverage types that are not current ly listed as MEC may apply to HHS to have the coverage they sponsor recognized as minimum essential coverage . HHS maintain s a public list of the types of coverage recognized as MEC at www.healthcare.gov/fees/plans -that-count -as-coverage . Organizations that become recognized as MEC will be required to notify their enrollees. 2. Individual Shared -Responsibility Requ irement The shared -responsibility provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to as the \"individual mandate,\" requires that all individuals maintain minimum essential c overage (MEC) for themselves and their dependents. Individuals who do not maintain MEC for themselves or their dependents may apply for exemptions53 (see Table 51) from the MEC requirement. Those who do not 53 A list of possible exemptions from the requirement to have health insurance is available online at www.healthcare.gov/health -coverage -exemptions/exemptions -from -the-fee.

Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 177 of 291 have MEC or an exemption wil l be r equired to pay a shared -responsibility payment to the IRS upon tax filing . a. Exemptions The ACA allows for individuals to apply for exemptions (see Table 51) from the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage . Depending on the type, an exe mption may be requested either prospectively or retrospectively through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM ). Individuals granted exemptions will not face a shared responsibility tax penalty for not maintaining minimum essential coverage . For employers, employees who have been granted an exemption will not count towards their required participation rate of 70 percent . Eligibility for exemptions can be categorical, based on income, or re lated to other circumstances. Examples of categorical exemptions include if an individual is a member of an American Indian tribe, a member of a religious sect with a documented ethical or moral opposition to health insurance, or is currently incarcerated. Exemptions based on income include the affordability exemption and the exemption for individuals with income below the tax filing threshold. The only way for an individual to be certain if the individual is eligible for an exemption, is to apply. Individuals seeking an exemption from the shared -responsibility requirement may apply for one or more of the nine exemption typ es. Depending on the exemption type , it may only be able to be granted by the IRS or FFM ; some exemptions ma y be granted by both entities. The time period the exemption is valid for also varies; exemptions may be granted on a monthly, annual, or multi -year basis. Individuals m ay be eligible for multipl e exemptions at the same time. The IRS and FFM will process all exemption reques ts received for an individual. To be eligible for an exemption in any month the individual must meet the criteria for the exemption for at least one d ay in that month. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III.

Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 179 of 291 If individuals apply for an exemption based on membership to healthcare sharing ministry or a religious organization with an objection to health insurance that is not recognized by HHS, they will be informed of how their health sharing ministry or religious organization can obtain recogni tion for the purposes of shared -resp onsibility payment exempt ions. These individuals associated with non -recognized groups will not be provided with an exemption but will be notified how to get their organization recognition to qualify for the exemption. For the hardship exemptions, there are six different types of exemptions that may fall into this category (see Table 52). Thes e exemptions may be granted by the IRS or the FFM , depending on exemption type and can be processed retrospectively or prospectively. Table 52: Hardship Exemptions from the Individual Mandate (cont. to next page) Hardship Exemption Description Granted by Other Inability to purchase Significant unexpected increase in essential expenses due to financial or domestic circumstances including unexpected natural or human caused events. Expense of purchasing health insurance would have caused individual to experience serious deprivation of food, shelter, clothing or other necessities. Individual has experienced other factors similar to these and this prevented obtaining of minimum essential coverage (MEC) . Marketplace Exemption will be provided at minimum fo r the month it is applied for; marketplaces have discretion to provide for additional months after the hardship. Lack of affordable coverage based on projected income Cost of the lowest cost MEC option is greater than 8 .13% of income for individual or dependent. Exemption is only available from the Marketplace as a hardship exemption through the end of the open or special enrollment period (SEP) . Exemption is granted for entire year regardless of changes in circumstances. Calculation for affordable coverage will account for increased premiums due to Marketplace Same as IRS affordability exemption but may be awarded prospectively. Individuals awarded this exemption may enroll in catastrophic plan. Eligibility for an employer - sponsored plan only considere d if the plan meets minimum value requirements.

Marketplace Exemption granted on continuing basis until reported that applicant no longer meets requirements Source: 45 CFR In ad dition to the different types of hardship exemptions, affordability exemptions vary depending on the relationship of the individual to the insured. Individuals receiving an affordability exemption either prospectively through the FFM or retrospectively thr ough the IRS must demonstrate that the lowest cost MEC exceeded 8.13%54 of their household income. The following table (see Table 53) shows the approximate annual and monthly premiums individual s at certain income levels would have to pay for the lowest cost MEC in order to qualify for an affordability exemption. 54 Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 181 of 291 Table 53: Estimated Premium Cost s to Qualify for an Affordability Exemption Income and Premium Amounts for Affordability Exemptions Annual amounts reflecting 8. 13% of income. To know for sure if an individual qualifies for an affordability exemption, the individual should apply for the exemption. Source s: 26 CFR \u00a71.5000A affordability programs , determ inations for exemption s based on affordability do not include non -taxable social security benefits as income, but are increased by any amount of employ er salary reduction agreement. Affordability exemptions (see Table 54) can be granted retrospectively by the IRS and based on taxable income for the most recent year tax data was available ; or they can be conducted prospectively by the FFM and bas ed on projected annual income. Affordability exemptions are calculated differently dependent upon what type of coverage is being examined for affordability and whether the individual is a dependent. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 182 of 291 Table 54: Affordability Exemptions from the Individual Mandate Type Description Other Affordability for employer - sponsored coverage - employee For self -only coverage , affordability for the purpose of an exemption is determined based on the cost of the l owest cost self -only coverage. Coverage that exceeds 8 .13% of income is unaffordable and the individual may receive exemption. When calculating the affordability of employer - sponsored insurance all premium discounts related to wellness programs, including programs for tobacco use, are considered to be unearned. Affordability for employer - sponsored coverage - related individual Affordability of employer -sponsored insurance for related individuals is determined based on cost of coverage for the lowest cost employer - sponsored plan that covers both the employe e and the related individuals. If the cost of coverage for the family is greater than 8 .13% of income then the related individuals are exempt. If cost of coverage for the self - only coverage is less than 8.13% of income then the emp loyee is not exempt , even if cost of coverage for family coverage is greater than 8 .13% of income. Individuals who receive this exemption will not be subject to a shared -responsibility payment but will also not be eligible for p remium tax credits (PTCs) o r cost -sharing reductions (CSRs) . Affordability for coverage in individual market For individuals only eligible in the individual market affordability is based on the cost of the lowest cost bronze plan that covers the applicable individuals, or the taxpayer may elect to base the affordability on the lowest cost bronze plan that would cover a similar group (e.g., an aunt and two nieces could base affordability on lowest cost Adult +2 plan). Any advanced payments of the PTC that the individual(s) would be eligible for are taken into account ; and if , with this consideration , the contribution for the lowest cost bronze plan is greater than 8 .13% of income for applicable individuals , then individuals are exempt. Guidance is still unclear if premium rate increases for tobacco use will be included or not in the calculation of individual market affordability. Source: 26 CFR \u00a71.5000A is a discrepancy between the af fordability provisions and the premiu m tax credit (PTC) provisions. Individuals and families who have access to minimum essential coverage (MEC) where the cost exceeds 8 .13% of income, but is less than 9. 66%55 of income , are eligible for an exemption, but no t 55 Source: www.irs.gov/affordable -care -act/individuals -and-families/questions -and-answers -on-the-premium -tax- credit Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 183 of 291 eligible for a premium tax credit . For related individuals in an employer -sponsored plan, eligibility for a PTC is based on the contribution for self -only coverage. Therefore, if the employee's contribution for self-only coverage c osts less than 9. 66% of income, none of the employees' dependents eligible for employer -sponsored coverage can receive PTC in the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) regardless of the cost of family coverage. Additionally, PTCs for individuals between 250% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL)56 only come into effect after the individual or family has spent 8. 13% to 9. 66% of their income towa rds the purchase of insurance. Individuals in this income range could potentially be eligible both for a PTC a nd an affordability exemption. The exemption is not guaranteed in these circumstances because the amount of the PTC is based on the cost of the second lowest -cost silver plan and qualificat ion for the exemption is based on the lowest -cost bronze p lan. b. Applying for an Exemption As displayed above, individuals may apply for the exemption either through th e IRS or the FFM , dependi ng on the type of exemption . For exemptions obtained throu gh the FFM, the individual may use either the \"single streamlined a pplication \" or a separate exemption application.57 If an ind ividual has already completed a single streamlined application to apply for health coverage, he or she may not need to complete an additional application to apply for an exemption (this depe nds on the type of exemption). Any informati on previous ly entered on the single streamlined application can be used to assess FFM exemptions. Individuals only intereste d in applying for an exemption and not interested in eligibility for qualified health plans (QHPs) or insurance affordability programs may use the FFM exemption application. Most e xemptions gran ted by the IRS are obtained through the tax -filing . Information on claiming and reporting exemptions from the Individual Mandate is available on the IRS website at www.irs.gov/Affordable -Care -Act/Individuals -and-Families/ACA -Individual -Shared - Responsibility -Provision -Exemptions . c. Exemption Appeals Individuals have the right to appeal exemption denials. Appeals for exemption denials would be directed to the agency t hat issued the initial denial. Exemption appeals de nied by the FFM would be directed back to the FFM and exemption appeals denied by the IRS would be directed to t he IRS.

The separate exemption applications are available at www.healthcare.gov/health -coverage - exemptions/forms -how -to-apply . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 184 of 291 Individuals who are not enrolled in MEC and who do not receive one of the above exemptions from the requirement to maintain MEC will owe a shared -responsibility payment to the IRS when filing their taxes. 3. Shared -Responsibility Payment Individuals are required to maintain minimum esse ntial coverage (MEC ) for th emselves and their dependents. Any month in which the individual or his or her dependents are covered by MEC or eligible for an exemption for at least one day counts as a covered month. For months where the non-exempt individual or non-exempt dependents did not have at least one day of MEC, a shared -responsibility payment is owed for every applicable individual without MEC or an exemption. Shared -responsibility penalty payments are calculated on a monthly basis for every non -exempt individual in the household without minimum essential coverage . Penalties may not be greater than the national average premium for a qualified health plan (QHP ) bronze p lan that would cover the applicable individual(s). Maximum penalties will vary by family composition, age, a nd potentially smoking status. Subject to the maximum amount, the assessed penalty is the greater of: (1) the dollar amount penalty for every non - covered individual or dependent in the household ; or (2) the percentage of taxable income amount penalty. Dollar amount penalties are charged on every individual without coverage in the household and the maximum dollar amount penalty for a household is 300% of the individual dollar amount penalty. However, if the pe rcent of income penalty is greater than the maximum dollar amount penalty then the percen t of income penalty will apply. The fo llowing table shows the annual shared -responsibility paym ent amounts for 2016 (see Table 55): Table 55: Annual Shared -Responsibility Payment Amounts* Year Penalty is the greater of: Maximum Penalty Dollar Penalty, assessed for every household member without minimum essential coverage ( MEC ) Percent Penalty 2016 Adult: $695 2.5% of annual household income National average p remium for a qualified health plan (QHP ) bronze p lan that would cover the applicable individual(s) Under age 18: $347.50 Maximum: $2,085 *Penalty is the greater of the amounts shown in the table but may not be greater than the average national QHP bronze plan premium.

Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 185 of 291 In general, individuals at lower incomes will pay the dollar amount penalty, while individuals at higher incomes will pay the percent penalty. Individuals and family with income above the following incomes (see Table 5 6) will be su bject to the percent penalty displayed in the table above (see Table 55). Table 56: Minimum Income Levels for Percent Penalties 2016 Income level where percent penalty applies \u2014Individual >$27,800 taxable income Income level where percent penalty applies \u2014Family* >$83,400 taxable income *Family of three to six individuals dependent on ages of applicable family members. Source: 26 CFR \u00a71.5000A -4 For example, an individual with $30,000 in taxable income w ould be subject to the percent penalty in 2016. The individual would be responsible for paying 2.5 % of his or her taxable income , or $750 , as a shared -responsibility p ayment. Shared -responsibility payments are assessed when individuals file t axes. The I RS may not file notice of lien or levy on the taxpayer's property for fa ilure to pay an assessed shared -responsibility payment, and the taxpayer may not be subject to criminal prosecution or penalty for failing to pay the assessed payment in a timely manner. However, the IRS may collect shared -responsibility payments through deducting the owed amount from individuals' overpayment returns. Federal guidan ce on MEC, s hared -responsibility payments, and e Availability and Guaranteed Renewability The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminates the ability for health plans offering major medical products to refuse to issue coverage based on health status, family health history, age, gender, or other factors. Prior to the ACA, depending on local state laws, health plans could den y individuals covera ge based on pre-existing health conditions. Begin ning in 2014, consumers have been able to purchase major medical products without regard to health status. In limited circumstances, issuers may deny enrollment to individuals if the in dividual is not a resident of the health plan's service area or if the health plan has reached capacity for their provider network and is not accepting new enrollees . In all other circ umstances , a health plan must guarantee an offer of coverage to all indi viduals that apply. 58 Other helpful information regarding MEC, the individual mandate, and ex emptions can be viewed on the Exemptions respectively. Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 186 of 291 Individuals are not required to e nroll in the offered coverage. Enrollees are also assured that their health insurance will be able to be renewed (including grandmothered plans up through October 1, 2016 , subject to discretion of issuers ), provided that they pay their premiums and still live within the issuer's service area. Sidebar : As of January 1, 2015, a health insurance issuer is prohibited from denying coverage options to same -sex spouses under th e same terms and conditions as coverage of fered to opposite -sex spouses. An issuer cannot deny insurance coverage to same -sex spouses if the marriage was validity entered into in a jurisdiction where the laws authorize the marriage of two individuals of the same sex, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the insurance policy is offered, sold, issued, renewed, in effect, or operated, or wher e the policyholder resides. In addition, same -sex spouses will receive premium tax credits (PTCs) and cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) , as applicable. Guaranteed availability and guaranteed renewability apply to group market plans as well. Small group market plans are required to meet minimum participation requirements on the SHOP and may be required by the carriers to meet mini mum contribution requirements. However, even if these requirements are not met, there will be one annual period where small group market plans may enroll in SHOP coverage, which will meet the guaranteed availability requirements for the small group market. On the small group market, issuers may decline to renew plans if they do not meet the minimum participation or mini mum contributio n requirements. Under the g uaranteed availability requirement, plans qualified to be offered both on a nd off the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) are required to allow individuals who do not qualify to purch ase FFM coverage to purchase the p lan directly from the carrier. With this requirement, individuals that do not qualify for FFM coverage have guaranteed availability to FFM plans. These requirements apply to major medical insurance plans. Health plans that are coverin g limited or excepted benefits ( e.g., dental, vision, hospital only, etc. ) do not have to comply with guaranteed availability or guaranteed renewability and, at their discretion, may deny individuals an offer of co verage based on health status or other factors. a. Pre-Existing C onditions Individuals who have pre -existing health conditions may no longer be excluded from an offer of coverage beginning in 2014. For children, the requirement to offer coverage regardless of any pre - existing condit ions went into effect in 2010. Those with pre -existing conditions who may have been excluded from health insurance coverage pr ior to the ACA will now have access to coverage. In addition to the requirement that cov erage be offered without regard to pre -existing conditions, there may be no exclusions to the offered coverage based on pre -existing conditi ons at the time of enrollment. Prior to the ACA requirements, many health insurers excluded pre -existing conditio ns from the offer of coverage. For example, prior to 2014, the individual in need of knee surgery may have received an offer of health insurance, but the insurance wou ld not cover the knee surgery. Beginning in 2014 for adults (and already in effect for child ren), an individual in need of knee surgery is able to enroll and receive coverage for services related t o the knee surgery right away. This is a change in prac tice for many health insurers. Individuals with pre -existing conditions will be assured those co nditions will be covered by coverage purchased in 2014 and beyond. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 187 of 291 The requirement to not allow an individual's health status to impact an offer of coverage applies only to major medical insurance plans. Health plans that are coverin g limited or excepted benefits ( e.g., dent al, vision, hospital only, etc.) do not have to comply with this requirement, and at their discretion, may exclude pre -existing conditions from an offer of coverage. Additional information on pre -existing conditions may be viewed onlin e at www.healthcare.gov/coverage/pre -existing -conditions . b. Dependent Age d 26 The ACA requires that all health plans that o ffer coverage for dependents cove r eligible dependents up to 26 years of age . Eligible dependents include the natural and adopted children, step children, and children subject to legal guardianship of the individual holding the policy. The requirement applies regardless of whether the dep endent has access to other coverage, is not a financial dependent, is married, lives in another location, is not a dependent on the adult's tax retur n or is not a current student. For married dependents under age 26, their spouses and children would not be required to be covered under the dependent age 26 requirements. Dependents can be on their parents' coverage even if they have another offer of coverage from an employer. Details on requirements for dependent s aged 26 in Indiana can be found in the Ind iana Department of Insurance (IDOI) bulletin at www.in.gov/idoi/files/Bulletin_189.pdf website at www.healthcare. gov/young -adults/children -under -26. 5. Elimination of Lifetime and Annual Maximums The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminates any lifetime or annual maximums applied to coverage that would be considered to be part of the essential health benefits (EHB s) for all n on-grandfathered health plans. Health plans can still place dollar limits on benefits that are not considered to be part of the essential health benefits .59 Lifetime limits were eliminated in 2010, and annual limits are prohi bited beginning in 2014. Individuals enrolled in non -grandfathered health plans will not be at risk of reaching any caps on their EHB coverage in cases of high -cost events. 6. Rating Factors Rating factors (or \"premium rating factors\") refer to the info rmation insurance companies use to decide what premium to cha rge any particular individual. Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the premium cost for major medical plans could vary based on health status, gender, age, weight, tobacc o or alcohol use, location, or other factors. Beginning in 2014, the ACA limit ed the allowable rating factors to a ge, location, and tobacco use. These plans may no longer charge different rates bas ed on gender or health status. Plans that are not considered major medical insurance plans and offer excepted benefits including dental only, vision only, or other specific benefit coverage are not subject to these rating requirements and may rate on factors other than a ge, location, and tobacco use. 59 Essential health benefits (EHBs) vary by state. Please see the Essential Health Benefits section for more detail. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 188 of 291 a. Rating for Age The ACA limits how much a major medical pla n can increase the cost of the plan for older individuals to a three -to-one ratio. Older adult s may be charged no more than three -times the p remium as younger adults. The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) developed an age rating curve (see Table 5 7) to determine how premiums can change based on the individual's age. Per this age curve, indi viduals under 20 years will have a premium that costs 63.5% of the premium for individuals between 21 and 24, and at age 64, an individual may expect his or her premium to be three -times as much as an individual at 21 years of age . Table 57: Federal Premi um Rating Curve Based on Age AGE PREMIUM RATIO AGE PREMIUM RATIO AGE PREMIUM RATIO 0-20 0.635 35 1.222 50 1.786 older 3.000 Source: CMS , Overview: Final Rule for . b. Rating for Tobacco The ACA allows health insurance issuers to charge up to 1.5 times the premium for individuals that use tobacco. Under ACA regulation, to bacco use is defined as use of any tobacco product on average four or more times per week over the past six months. Any religious or ceremonial uses of tobacco would be excluded from this definition. Rate increases for tobacco may only be applied to indivi duals who may legall y use tobacco under state laws. If an individual incorrectly reports tobacco use, issuers may not cancel the policy, but they may charge back premiums for the months the tobacco use was incorrectly reported. Health insurance issuers may vary their tobacco use rating factor based up to a 1.5 -to-one ratio, and they may have different ratios for different ages, however, at no point may a rate increase for tobacc o based on age contradict the three -to-one age rating limit. For example, the rates for a smoker at age 64 Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 189 of 291 may be no more than three times the rate for a smoker at age 21, though the rate for a smoker at age 64 may be 4.5 times higher than the rate for a non -smoker at 21 years of age . The method used to develop the premium rating for tobacco use, whether to vary the premium for tobacco use based on age, and how much to vary it, is curr ently up to issuer discretion. Differe nt health plans offered on a m arketplace may have different policies on rating for tobacco use and the premium may vary for tobacco users , depending on their age and the health plan they select. c. Rating for Location As the cost of health care may vary by location, the ACA allows insurers to adjust their premiums depend ing on an enrollee's location. States may establish their own rating areas with the approval of the Center for Consumer Information an d Insurance Oversight (CCIIO). If states do not establish rating areas, the default rating areas are the state's Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), plus one addi tional area to encompass rural areas not included by th e MSAs. More information on MSA's can be found online at www.census.gov/population/metro/files/metro_micro_Feb2013.p df and www.census.gov/population/metro/data/metrodef.html d. State -Specific Rating Areas Indiana has accepted the default number of rating areas proposed by CCIIO and has a rating a rea for each MSA plus one additional rating area for a total of 17 rating areas in Indiana. However, the State modified the boundaries of the proposed rating areas to make them more contiguous ; and thus Indiana's rating areas do not precisely follow the bo undaries of the Census Bureau's MSAs but are instead based on co unty boundaries. Carriers may assign different premium rat ing factors to each area. The following map (see Figure 8), delineates Indiana's rating areas. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 190 of 291 Figure 8: Indiana Rating Areas Source: Indiana Department of Insurance, Bulletin 197: Geographical Rating Areas (2013), www.in.gov/legislative/iac/20130403 -IR-760130130NRA.xml.html In the SHOP , location rating may be based either on the location of the business or the location of the employees. For small businesses with employees in multiple states, the employees may be covered through the marketplace in their home state or through the m arketplace in the business's home state. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 191 of 291 i. Family Plans In Indiana, when calculating the premium for family plans, the premium attributable to each member of the family is added together to get th e premium for the family plan. Each rating factor will be attributed to each member separately and a combined premium for the family will be calculated. All family members age 21 and over will be included in the calculati on of the family premium, but only the oldest three family members age 20 and under will be included. This means that for a couple with four children 20 and under, only the oldest three dependents under 21 will be considered when calculating the family premium. Table 58: Rating for Family Plans Family Members 21 and older Family Members 20 and under Rate for Age Assign an age rating to each family member Rate for the oldest three family members 20 and under Rate for Tobacco Use Assign a tobacco rating to each family member Rate for the oldest three family members over 18 and 20 or unde r* Rate for Location Assign a location rating to each family member Rate for the oldest three family members 20 and under Calculate Premiums Determine premium for each individual Dete rmine premium for the oldest three members 20 and under Family Premium Sum premiums for members 21 and older and the oldest three family members 20 and under to reach the total amount of premium for the family * In Indiana, tobacco use is prohibited for those under eighteen. The tobacco rating factor can only be applied to members who may legally use tobacco in the state in which they reside. Source: 45 CFR \u00a7147.102 ii. Small Group Plans Similar to developing a premium for a family, plans in the small group calculate premiums by determining each plan members individual rating factor based on age, tobacco use, and location , and then adding all of th e individual p remiums to reach a group rate. For group plans, individuals that use tobacco but enroll in a wellness plan or smoking cessation program will have the incr eased rate for tobacco waived. The final premium an enrollee of a small group plan pays will depend on the employer's contribution to the health plan. 7. Medical Loss Ratio The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all issuers of major medical products spend a certain percentage of their an nual revenue on medical costs. The percentage a health insurance plan spends on medical costs for enrollees is referred to as the p lan's medical loss ratio (MLR). Medical costs include both the costs of claims paid and any activities the health plan undert akes to improve the quality of healthcare provided. The ACA requires that large group plans have a MLR of 85% and that individual plans and small group plans have a MLR of 80 percent . These amounts are adjusted for fees and taxes required o n the Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 192 of 291 insurance companies. Plans that do not meet these MLR requirements must pay rebates to enrollees to compensate them for the excess premium collected. Health plans were required to start reporting on MLR and issuing rebates to consumers in 2012 for the 2011 plan yea r. However, beginning in 2014, there are some additional changes to the insurance market that make the calculation of MLR and the associated consumer rebates more complicated. Starting in 2014, each insurance plan's final MLR is calculated annually after the application of programs that may i mpact the final MLR, including risk a djustment, reinsurance, risk corridors, and any other fees and taxes. The annual calculations commence after the close of the plan year ; and risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridors ar e applied to each health plan. After these programs are applied, the health plan must calculate its medical loss ratio. For 2014 and years after, health plans will have to report their MLR to the federal government and enrollees by July 31 of the year following the plan year. For example, for the January 201 6 to December 2016 plan year, health plans must repo rt their MLR by July 31, 201 7. With this notification, enrollees in the health plan will know if they can expect a reb ate from their healt h plan. Health plans that owe consumers rebates are required to pay these rebates by September 1 of the year following the plan year. Consumers that are owed a rebate for the 201 6 plan year can expect to receive their rebate payment b y September 1, 201 7. Rebates for small and large group plans will be paid to the employer and it will be at the discretion of the employer on how and when they shoul d be distributed to enrollees. There is no expected amount of rebate, and each consumer 's rebate will depend on the health plan 's final MLR and how many members were enrolled. Enrollees who believe they should have received a rebate, but have not, should contact their health insurance plan. More detailed in formation on MLR and rebate calculations can be found online at www.healthcare.gov/health -care -law-protections/rate 8. Marketplace v s. Non -Marketplace Coverage Marketplaces d id not eliminate the avenues through which individuals and small busi nesses p urchase d coverage prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) . Individuals and small businesses are still able to purchase coverage through methods that may include direct purchase from carriers, through agents or brok ers, or through carrier websites. However, coverage available through the individual and SHOP marketplaces allow access to programs not av ailable on the outside market. In additio n, while all plans sold have to meet market requirements including the rating factors , dependent age 26 , essential health benefits (EHBs) , actuari al value (AV) requirements, and elimination of lifetime and annual limits , health plans sold through marketplaces are subject to additional requirements placed on qualified health plans (QHPs). In general, a major medical plan sold either on or off of the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) will offer comprehensive health coverage and will meet the requirement for individuals to maintain minimum essential coverage (MEC). However, individuals who purchase a major medical plan off of the FFM in the individu al market may be required to attest that they also have coverage for pediatric dental essential health benefits (EHBs) if these benefits are not included in their medical plan. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 193 of 291 Not all plans offered outside of the FFM will be offered on the FFM , so there may be a greater selection of plan offerings outsi de of the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . Plans on the FFM are not required to offer their coverage options outside of the FFM , so there may be a different selection of plans on the FFM than is ava ilable off of the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . Due to guaranteed availability and guaranteed renewability clauses , individuals who do not qualify to purchase a QHP have an avenue to access the QHP through a n off -marketplace coverage option. If a health insurance carrier offers the same health plan both on and off the FFM, that health plan must have the same premiums regardless if it is sold on or off the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . For individuals, only plans sold on the FFM are eligible for premium tax credits (PTC s) or cost-sharing reductions (CSR s). These programs have the potential to decrease the premium cost and the level of cost sharing p aid by qualifying individuals. For small businesses, the small business tax credits are only available through the SHOP Marketplace . Small businesses that would like to take advantage of these tax credits must seek coverage for their employees through the SHOP Marketplace. At their discretion, off -marketplace individual plans may restrict enrollment to the FFM open enrollment periods. Consumers that seek coverage outside of the open enrollment period without receiving a special enrollment period (SEP) may not be able to purchase a health plan. Sidebar : Off-marketplace plans ' ability to restrict purchase of plans to the FFM open enrollment periods gives the plans the abili ty to limit adverse selection. Adverse selection is when individuals wait until they become sick or need health care services to enroll in a plan. The Affordable Care A ct (ACA) eliminated health plan s' ability to screen for health status and exclude preexisting c onditions prior to enrollment. Restricting enrollment to the FFM open enrollment periods is one of the few avenues left for health plans to combat adverse selection ; and many health plans may choose to lim it enrollment to these periods. In Indiana, it is expected that health plans offering plans ou tside of the FFM will take advantage of this option. Therefore, individuals who do not enroll on or off of the FFM during an open enrollment period and do not experience an event that may trigger a SEP, may not have the opportunity to enroll throughout the year. 9. Small Business Health Insurance Options Program The Small Business Health Insurance Options Program ( SHOP ) Marketplace is a forum for small businesses to purchase group coverage for their employees. Starting in 2014 , businesses that qualif ied for small group market coverage in the state based on their number of employees60 could use the SHOP to find, select, and enroll employees in coverage. Employers that enroll in SHOP coverage and then grow past the small group limit for employees may con tinue with their SHOP coverage, and renew their SHOP coverage, should they desire to do so. In general, there is no open enrollment period for SHOP coverage and qualifying employers may e nroll their group at any time. Employees enrolled in SHOP coverag e will meet the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage (MEC). Employers apply to the SHOP for their employees and employees must be eligible for a qualified health plan (QHP) to be able to receive SHOP coverage. For federally - 60 In Indiana, between 2 and 50 full -time employees and full -time equivalent employees (FTEs); self -employed and sole-proprietorships excluded. Employees are defined as those \"common -law employees,\" which are recognized by the IRS as the employer's employee and not as an independent contractor. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 194 of 291 facilitated SHOP Marketplaces, the SHOP will initially allow employers to select a plan for their employees and then will facilitate employee enrollment into the selected health plan. For years after 2014, emplo yees are able to select from amongst SHOP plans in a metal tier selected by the employer. The SHOP requires that at least 70% of employees, who are not enrolled in other MEC and who do not have an exemption, take up the offer o f coverage for the employer to be eligible for SHOP coverage. For employers who do not meet the minimum participation requirement, the guaranteed availability and guaranteed renewability provisions still apply ; and there will be one annual SHOP open enrollment period where employers with less than a 70% participatio n rate may enroll in the SHOP. This period is from November 15th to December 15th. As is the practice today, health insurance plans in the SHOP may require that em ployers contribute a minimum percentage of the premium for the group plan for their employees. Employers that do not meet the health plans contribution rate requirements may be denied coverage for all periods during the year, except during the once annual SHOP open enrollment period from November 15th to December 15th. By allowing enrollment of these employers during this enrollment period , the guaranteed availability and guaranteed renewability provisions are met for SHOP. Starting in 2014, employers that wish to receive the small employer tax credit for offering coverage must obtain coverage through the S HOP to receive the tax credit. This tax credit is available for qualifying employers with fewer than 25 low-wage employees , and will credit back to them a portion of the premium spent on health coverage for their employees. SHOP plans will be required to meet the essential health benefit (EHB) requirements, and be certified as qualified health pla ns. However, all plans in the small group market are required to have reduced deductibles when compared to plans in the i ndividual market. SHOP plans are limited to a certain deductible . There are no deductible limits for small group plans . a. SHOP Enrollment Employers that wish to use the SHOP Marketplace to attain coverage for employees may enroll in the SHOP with the help of an agent or broker or may enroll directly via www.healthcare.gov/small - businesses . The SHOP Marketplace wil l have unique applications for employers to complete that will provide basic info rmation about their employees. Employees will provide more detailed personal information and information on their dependents when enrolling in the health plan. Employers will be able to manually enter in information on the employees or upload employee information to the SHOP directly. In 2014, the employer was required to set a contribution level and select a plan for their employees. In 2015 and after, the employer must select a metal coverage level (bronze, silver, gold, or platinum), as well as a reference pl an within that coverage level. The employer sets their contribution level as a percentage of the premium based on that reference plan a nd then employees are free to select any available SHOP plan from amongst the eligible plans in the selected coverage level. In 2014, employers paid their portion and their employee's portion of premiums for their group coverage directly to the insu rer that issued the coverage. For years beginning in 2015, the employer and employees portions of the p remium go directly to the SHOP Marketplace. The SHOP then distribute s these payments to the health plans chosen by the enrollees. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 195 of 291 10. Changes to Health Insurance Regulatory Conditions under the Affordable Care Act a. ACA -Mandated Benefits: Preventive Services The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates the inclusion of certain categories of preventive services in all non-grandfathered health plans. These se rvices must be provided without the application of any cost sharing , including deductible, co payment , or coinsurance requirements. The preventive services required by the ACA are described in reference to lists of recommended services developed by various governmental agencies. Under the ACA requirements to cover preventive health services, all health plans must cover : (1) all preventive items or services that have a rating of 'A' or 'B' by the United States Preventive Task Force (USPSTF); (2) Immunizations recommended for the individual 's age and health status by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); (3) for infants, children and adolescents, preventive care and screenings included in the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) comprehensive guidelines; and (4) preventive screenings for w omen as provided for in the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration . Health plans may not require cost -sharing for any of the items or services l isted by any of these sources. Health plans may cover additiona l preventive services that are not included in these lists at their discretion, but they are required to cover at least those preventive services included on the above lists. The following lists for preventive care (see Table 5 9) will be maintained and updated by the USPSTF, HRSA, and the CDC's Advisory Commit tee on Immunization Practices. As recommended items, services, and immunizations change, issuers will have to update their benefit packages to a lign with the recommendations. In general, a health insurance issuer has one year following the issuance of a new preventive health guideline to implement coverage of the preventive health service in their health plans. The one year period is based on the next plan or policy year comme ncing one year afte r the recommendation was made. i. United State s Preventive Services Task Force Guidelines Current United States Preventive Services Task Force (USP STF) A and B recommendations can be found online at www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/uspstf -a-and-b-recommendations . As of July 2016, t he preventive items and services recommended by USP STF include the following (see Table 59): Table 59: USP STF Recommended Preventive Items and Services (cont. to following pages) # Topic Description Grade 1 Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: men The USPSTF recommends one -time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm by ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. B 2 Alcohol misuse screening and counseling The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen adults age 18 years or older for alcohol misuse and provide persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking with brief behavioral counseling interventions to reduce alcohol misuse. B Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 196 of 291 # Topic Description Grade 3 Aspirin preventive medication: adults aged 50 to 59 years with a 10% 10 -year cardiovascular risk The USPSTF recommends initiating low -dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10 -year cardiovascular risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, ha ve a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low - dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years. B 4 Bacteriuria screening: pregnant women The USPSTF recommends screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria with urine culture in pregnant women at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation or at the first prenatal visit, if later. A 5 Blood pressure screening in adults The USPSTF recommends screening for high blood pressure in adults age 18 years and older. The USPSTF recommends obtaining measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment. A 6 BRCA risk assessment and genetic counseling/testing The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with one of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes ( BRCA 1 or BRCA2 ). Women with positive screening results should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing. B 7 Breast cancer preventive medication The USPSTF recommends that clinicians engage in shared, informed decision -making with women who are at increased risk for breast cancer about medications to reduce their risk. For women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects, clinicians should offer to prescribe risk-reducing m edications, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene. B 8 Breast cancer screening The USPSTF recommends screening mammography for women, with or without clinical breast examination, every 1 to 2 years for women age 40 years and older. B 9 Breastfeeding counseling The USPSTF recommends interventions during pregnancy and after birth to promote and support breastfeeding. B 10 Cervical cancer screening The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer in women ages 21 to 65 years with cytology (Pap smear) every 3 years or, for women ages 30 to 65 years who want to lengthen the screening interval, screening with a combination of cytology and human papil lomavirus (HPV) testing every 5 years. A 11 Chlamydial i nfection screening: women The USPSTF recommends screening for chlamydia in sexually active women age 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection.

To qualify as an exempt religious employer the organization must be covered by the IRS definition at 26 USC \u00a7 6033 (a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) and be a church or other house of worship or an affiliate d organization or association. Not-for-profit religious organizations with objections to th e offering of contraceptive coverage but that do not qualify for the exemption will not be required to contract or pay for contraceptive coverage for their employees; however, their employees will be required to be offered th e coverage for contraceptives. In these cases, the insurer of the group health plan for the not -for-profit, or the third -party administrator for a self -insured health plan, will be required to offer the employees of the objecting not for profit contraceptive coverage at no cost to the e mployee or the not -for profit. To employees of these organizations , contraceptive coverage will be provided and neither the organizations nor the employees will be responsible for paying for the coverage for contraceptives.

Guidelines for Immunizations The Center for Disease Control's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends immunizations based on age , health sta tus, and immunization history. Many of these recommendations are contingent on age and health status; however, in general children and adults that meet qualifying conditions can expect to have the following immunizations covered without cost sh aring under the ACA's mandate for preventive health services. Hemophilus influenza Type B Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Herpes Zoster Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis Varicella Vaccines that are not considered preventive and are administered for purposes such as travel would not be covered by the ACA mandate to cover preventive vaccines without applying cost -sharing requirements.

Essential Health Benefits While the ACA mandated preventive services apply to all non -grandfathered health pla ns in all market segments, the essential health b enefits (EHB) requirements only apply to the individual and small group markets an d to Med icaid benchmark plans. Starting in 2014, all non -grandfathered major medical plans Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 204 of 291 in the individual and small group market are required to cover the EHB, at a minimum. Health plans subject to the EHB requirements must cover these benefits or they will not be able t o offer coverage in the state. Benefits considered to be EHB cannot be subject to annual spending limitations in accordance with the elimination of lifetime and annual maximum amounts; however, visit limits may s till apply to these benefits. As d efined by the ACA, the EHB must include at minimum benefits in the following 10 categories (see Table 61): Table 61: Essential Health Benefit (EHB ) Categories 1. Ambulatory Patient Services 6. Emergency Services 2. Hospitalization 7. Maternity and Newborn Care 3. Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services, including behavioral health treatment 8. Prescription Drugs 4. Laboratory Services 9. Rehabilitative and Habilitative Services and Devices 5. Pedia tric Services, including oral and vision care 10. Preventive and Wellness Services and Chronic Disease Management Source: HealthCare.gov (2016) , Essential Health Benefits , www.healthcare.gov/glossary/essential -health -benefits The ACA lists these broad categories as essential health benefits . To define the exact services comprise the EHB in each category, each state has an EHB \"benchmark plan \" that identifies the benefits and services classified as EHB i n the state. Summaries of each state's EHB benchmark plan can be found on CMS's website at www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/data -resources/ehb.html . The EHB benchmark plan is comprised of the benefits offered in one of the following health insurance plans: the three largest hea lth plans by enrollment in the small group market, one of the three largest state employee plans, one of the largest federal employee plans, or the largest commercially offered HMO by en rollment offered in the state. States may select from among these benc hmark plans; however, if a state did not make a benchmark plan selection, the default benchmark plan is the largest small group plan by enrollment in the state. This plan will reflect benefits and services commonly offered in current small group health pla ns, and all health plans in the individual and small group market s will be required to offer services that are at least substantially equal to the benchmark pl an. If the benchmark plan did not include benefits in one of the EHB categories noted above, the benefits were s upplemented from another plan. Pharmacy EHB requirements differ from medical benefit requirements. For pharmacy benefits , the drugs covered by the selected benchmark are divided into cl asses and categories of drugs. Health plans do not have to cover the exact drugs covered by the EHB benchmark plan, but must offer the same number of drugs in each class and category as the benchmark health plan, or at least one drug in a class or category if there are none covered by t he benchmark health plan. A list of prescription drugs covered by health plans should be available by request. In Indiana, the E HB benchmark plan is the Anthem p referre d provid er organization (PPO) plan. This plan offers comprehensive coverage in all categories excep t pediat ric dental and vision. The pediatric dental and vision benefits are supplemented from the federal empl oyees' vision and dental plan. Habilitative services are covered in this plan at parity with rehabilitative services. The Indiana Department of Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 205 of 291 Insurance (IDOI) has elected to not allow plans to substitute benefits, so all plans offered in the individual and small group markets in Indiana will be required to cover at minimum the exact benefits present in the Anthem PPO plan. A summary of the Indiana EHB ben chmark benefits can be accessed on CMS's website at cciio.cms.gov/resources/data/ehb.html#indian a.html . However, EHB are based on the actual benefits in th e plan and not on the summary . The c ertifi cate of c overage and a summary of Indiana's benchmark p lan can be accessed on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2812.htm . The Indiana EHB plan covers a broad and comprehensive range of medical services meeting all EHB requirements, except the requirement to offer pediatri c dental and vision services. However, it does not cover: acupuncture, bariatric surgery, infertility treatment and diagnoses, or heari ng aids . The plan covers chiropractic serv ices limited to 12 visits a year, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy services limited to 20 visits per therapy, per year. The benefits offered in the benchmark plan are the EHB for Indiana and are the minimum benefits that must be offered by al l non -grandfathered individual and small group plans in the market. The cost of providing these benefits will determine the amount of premium tax credits (PTC) . Plans may offer benefits in excess of the EHBs and may cover services no t covered by the EHB benchmark plan or offer limits on services greater than that offered by the EHB benchmar k plan. However, these services will not be considered to be EHB, they may be subject to lifetime and annual maximums, and PTCs will not cover the cost for the additional services. Indiana's EHB benchmark does not cover the pediatric dental or vision bene fits. These benefits have separate plan benchmarks that define what benefits and services mu st be offered under this plan. The certificate of c over age for the pediatri c vision services and for the pediatric dental services may be viewed on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2812.htm . All pediatric dental and vision services covered by these benchmark plans are considered to be EHB s in Indiana. Frequently asked questions (FAQs) about EHBs in Indiana may be viewed on IDOI's website at www.in.gov/idoi/2812.htm . Sidebar: Pediatric dental is listed as a required EHB in the Affordable Care Act. HHS defines pediatric dental as recommended dental servic es for those age 18 and under. For those over 18, with no dependents under 18 covered on their plan, the requirement for the plan to cover pediatric den tal services remains in place. In the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM), the individual or small group market plan may elect not to offer the pediatric dental coverage if there is a stand -alone pl an offered on the FFM . In this insta nce, the plan on the FFM does not have to verify that the individual has purcha sed pediatric dental coverage. However, for individual and small group market health plans sold outside of the FFM , the plan may elect not to offer pediatric dental coverage, but must require individuals purchasing the plan to attest that they have coverage for FFM certif ied pediatric dental services. It is unclear what the consequences to the health plan or the individual would be if the indi vidual did not actually obtain coverage for pediatric dental services. c. State -Mandated Benefits There are certain benefits that , due to state law , health insurers must cover or must offer a s an option to all enrollees. Benefits mandated by state la w (see Table 62) may apply only to certain market Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 206 of 291 segments and issuer types (i.e., the individual, small group, or large group markets , or to health maintenance o rganizatio ns (HMOs) ). Additionally, state -mandated benefits may be mandated to be covered or be a mandate for the issuer to offer the enrollees the option of selecting coverage for the benefit ( e.g., must offer). Many of the mandates that must be offered by law in Indiana are also requirements of the Affordable Care Act . For example, mandates related to preventive screenings for cancer, mental health parity, and coverage of substance abuse disorders are all also required by the ACA's preventive services and EHB requirements. Indiana's mandates also restrict issuers' abi lity to exclude certain providers from their networks. For example, there are mandates that prohibit issuers from excluding chiropractors and personal trainers as provider t ypes. However, these mandates do not require coverage of chiropractic or personal t rainer services. They only require that if a chiropractor or personal trainer can, within the scope of his or her practice, provide a cove red benefit to an enrollee, he or she cannot be excluded by the issuer solely due to provider type. The interaction of the ACA preventive health mandates, the state mandates, and the essential health benefit (EHB) requirem ents for the non -grandfathered i ndividual and small group plans increase the benefits that enrollees can expect to be offered on plans. In instances where mandates from among these groups do not align, the most comprehen sive mandate takes precedence. For example, an Indiana state mandate requires that chiropractors be covered providers, but does not require c over age for chiropractic services. However, the EHB requirements provide for a minimum of 12 chiropractic visits for plans s in the individual and small group markets. These plans must comply with both mandates and offer at minimum 12 visits and cover chir opractors for other services that can be provided within the scope of their license. The EHB benchmark plan is a small group plan and all the benefits covered in this plan become required EHB for non -grandfathered plans in both the individual and the small group markets. Since the benchmark plan covered all of Indiana's required small group mandates, these now also become required in the individual market even if the state mandate d oes not have this requirement. For example, coverage of autism spectrum dis orders is required by Indiana law in the small group market. However, in the individual market, by Indiana mandate, the health plan has to offer the option to purchase this coverage, but the health plan is not required to assure these services are c overed in every issued policy. However, since autism spectrum disorders were covered in Indiana's EHB benchmark plan, coverage for these services is required to be in all non -grandfathered individual policies. In addition, some state mandates around preventive requirements may go beyond wh at is required by federal law. For example, in Indiana, prostate antigen testing is a mandated service. However, this service is not required under the ACA preventive requirements . Insurers may not impose cost -sharing on plan enrollees for ACA -required covered preventive services; however, ins urers may require enrollee cost-sharing for preventive servic es mandated by the state only. For instance, though prostate antigen screening i s a preventive service in Indiana, health plans are not required to p rovide it without imposing cost-sharing.

Actuarial Value All health plans offered on and off of the FFM in the individual and small group markets are required to meet certain actuarial value (AV). Actuarial value refers to the percent of expected costs for EHB s that the health plan will cover on average for all enrollees. For example, an insurance plan that had 68% AV would expect to cover on average 68% of the medical costs of its members for EHB i n aggregate and the remaining 32% of costs would b e borne by the members. The AV statistic is compiled to be an average for all enrollees in the plan. For enrollees with higher medical costs who quickly reach their out -of- pocket maximum limits, the insuran ce plan may cover more than 68% of their costs, while enrollees with fewer he althcare expenses may pay a greater p ercentage of their total health care costs. Non -grandfathered major medical products must meet certain AV bands to be able to offer coverage either on the FFM or in the outside market. Every plan offered on or off the FFM in the individual or small group market s must fall i nto one of the below AV bands. With the exception of catastrophi c plans, plans with AV outside of the following AV bands cannot be offered (see Table 63). Table 63: Actuarial Value (AV) Metal Level AV target AV Band Bronze 60% 58-62% Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 209 of 291 An enrollee may expect that, i n general, plans with higher AV s will have h igher premiums but reduced cost-sharing. Conversely, plans with lower AV s will have lower premiums, but will subj ect the enrollee to higher cost -sharing. This is true for all enrollees with the exception of those who qualify for cost-sharing reductions (CSR s), who may experience reduced cost -sharing, but are required to select a silver plan to receive the benefit. Actuarial value will be calculated and displayed for every non -grandfathered health plan offered on and off of the FFM in the individual and small group markets. Mor e information on AV can be found online at www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Files/Downloads/Av - csr-bulletin.pdf and www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -2013 -02-25/pdf/2013 -04084.pdf . 11. Changes in Insurance Affordability Options under the Affordable Care Act a. Insurance Affordability Programs The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes two programs designed to m ake insurance premiums and cost - sharing more affordable. These programs are referred to as the premium tax credit (PTC) and the cost- sharing reduction (CSR). Consumers may only take advantage of these programs if they apply f or coverage through t he Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) . b. Federal Poverty Level (FPL) The amount of the PTC and the level of CSR are ba sed on the applicant's income. For these programs income is expressed as a percentage of th e federal poverty level (FPL). Federal poverty level s are published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (H HS) and updated each year. Federal poverty level s are based around a poverty threshold amount whi ch is referred to as 100% FPL. Households with incomes at or below this amount are des ignating as living in poverty. The poverty threshold increases for each individual li ving in the household. Other income leve ls are referenced to 100% FPL. For example, 150% FPL is 1.5 multiplied by the 100% of FPL income level. The following table (see Table 64) displays the FPL levels for 201 6. Eligibility for PTC and CSR in 201 7 will be based on the 2016 FPL levels.

Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 210 of 291 c. Modified Adjusted Gross Income Income used to determine eligibility for insurance affordability programs is not an individual's or household's take -home pay. It is taxable income less applicable deductions, increased by: Foreign earned income Tax exempt interest Social security benefits This income calculation is called modified adjuste d gross income (MAGI). MAGI is adjusted gross income (AGI) as reported on an individual's tax return , increased by the above amounts. AGI is income reduced by eligible deductions including trade or business activities, individual retirement account (IRA) contributions, health savings account (HSA) contri butions, and other deductions. More information on AGI can be found on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website at www.irs.gov/uac/Definition -of- Adjusted -Gross -Income . MAGI and AGI are income in reference to the income reported on an individual's tax return. Individuals who would like to know if they may be eligible for insurance affordability programs should refer to their prior year tax returns for their AGI amount and increase this amount by the items specified above. This will be the best estimate of MAGI. If the MAGI is between 100 % and 400% of FPL as displayed on Table 64, the individual/household may meet the income qualifications for insurance affordability p rograms . The only way for an individual or a household to know for certain if they qualify for Insurance Affordability Programs is to apply through the federal Marketplace (www. healthcare.gov ). 12. Eligibility for Insurance Affordability Programs In addition to having modified adjusted gross income (MAGI ) between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), to be eligible for insurance affordability programs an individual must meet all of the following requirements: Be a citizen, national, or lawfu l resident of the United States Not be incarcerated Reside or intend t o reside in the state in which the individual is apply ing for coverage Not be claimed as a dependent on another individual's tax return Not be eligible for other minimum essential coverage (MEC) or only be eligible for employer - sponsored coverage that does not meet minimum value (MV) or affordability requirements Enroll in a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum level qualified health plan (QHP) on the Federally - facilitated Marketplace (FFM) . Catastrophic plans and plans sold off of the FFM are not eligible for insurance affordability programs. An individual that does not meet these requirements may apply on behalf of a dependent th at does meet the requirements. The individual will not be eligible for insurance affordability programs; however, the individual may apply on behalf of his or her dependents. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 211 of 291 a. Requirement to File The main insurance affordability program is the premium tax credit (PTC). To be eligible to receive the tax credit to subsidize a FFM health insurance purchase, an individual must certify that the individual will file a tax return fo r the applicable benefit year. For example, if an individual is applying for a PTC in 201 7, the individual can be eligible to receive the tax credit prior to tax filing; however, to receive an advanced payment, the individual must attest that he or she will file an income tax return in 201 7. Advanced payments of the premium tax credit (APTC) will be reconciled with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at tax filing and individuals may receive additional credit, or owe additional tax bas ed on final MAGI and the amount of APTC received. Individu als that do not file their return or file for a timely extension may experience a disruption of APTC payments for the next year . To be eligible for APTC, married c ouples must file a joint return.61 Married couples that received AP TC and file separately will owe the amount of APTC received back to the IRS when they file the ir taxes. b. Requirement to Report Changes Individuals are required to report changes that may impact their eligibility for o r the amount o f their APTC or cost-sharing reduction (CSR) . These changes include: increases or decreases in income, changes in household composition, changes in location, and changes in citize nship or incarceration status.62 If the amo unt of APTC an individual is eligible for decreases during the year and the individual does not report the change, additional taxes may be owed at filing when the APTC payments are reconc iled. Conversely, if the amount for which an individual is eligible i ncreases during the year, the individual may be paying greater contributions than required and may be able to benefit from additional APTC. The FFM will periodically check available data sources for changes that will impact eligibility, but it is the consu mer's primary responsibility to report significant changes. 13. Applying for Insurance Affordability Programs Both insurance affordability programs \u2014premium tax credits (PTCs) and cost-sharing reductions (CSRs)\u2014 may only be accessed through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) (www.healthcare.gov ). Individuals interested in obtaining APTC or CSR for themselves or their dependents must apply for these programs through the FFM during an open or special enroll ment period (SEP) . Those who seek health insurance outside of the FFM will not be eligible for i nsuranc e affordability p rograms. In Indiana, PTCs are obtained thro ugh the Federal ly-facilitated Marketplace . More information on PTCs and application information can be obtained at www.healthcare.gov or by calling the FFM at 1-800-318- 2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) . a. Household Eligibility Individuals may apply for insurance affordability programs for th emselves and their dependents. Individuals may apply for dependents th at live in separate locations. This application may be completed either through the applicants' FFM , or through the marke tplace where the individual resides. Household 61 A victim of domestic abuse who is married and unable to file a joint tax return may claim a premium tax credit (PTC) as referenced in www.irs.gov/pub/irs -drop/n-14-23.pdf . 62 A list of what life changes an individual should report to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) is posted on orting -changes/which -changes -to-report . Training Resource III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 212 of 291 members that are not dependents must apply separatel y for a premium tax credit . For example, in a household that consists of three sisters and their dependent children, each sister must apply separately for herself and her dependent children, unless one of the sisters is legally the dependent of another. b. Payment of the Premium Tax Credits Paym ents of the PTC s are for qualifying individuals that have incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) and that enroll in a qualified health plan (QHP) sold on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . These tax credits are refundable so that individuals may receive them even if the y do not have a tax liability. I n addition, to help pay for health insurance during the tax year , eligible individuals can elect to have the credits paid directly to their insurer to help cover pre mium cost. This option is called the \"advanced payment of the premium tax c redit \" (APTC) . Individuals eligible for the PTC may elect not to receive it during the year and cover their own premium cost. As long as these individuals were enrolled in a PTC e ligible plan, they will receive the PTC that could have helped pay for their covera ge as a refund on their taxes. The amount of PTC is calculated based on a required contribution that varies by household FPL based on MAGI and the premium of an index plan. Sidebar: The 'index plan' for APTC calculation is the second lowest cost silver plan that will cover the applicable individuals. Silver plans are metal tier plans that will offer coverage at approximately 70% actuarial value (AV) . Every health insurance issuer that offers a QHP on a marketplace will be required to offer a silver and gold plan level. The PTC amount will be calculated based on the cost of the second lowest cost silver plan option that covers the members of the household. If the members of the household cannot be covered on the same plan then the plan premiums to cover all the individuals in the household may be summed, or an index plan that covers a similar family com position may be selected. The PTC only applies if an individual or household has made a contribution towards the plan. This contribution will be a percent of income, based on MAGI, and will vary by federal poverty level. To receive APTC, an individual mu st be enrolled in an insurance plan and must pay a required percentage contribution towards the premium, based on income. If the advanced payment option is selected, the APTC is paid directly to the individual's or household's qualified health plan(s). Individuals may choose not to accept any APTC and enroll i n a health plan at full cost. In this case, the APTC amount will be received as a credit or refund during tax filing. The percent of income and estimated income dollar amount that an individual wo uld pay for the index plan prior to the application of APTC shown in the following table (see Table 65). Note that the annual income and monthly income amounts are determined through MAGI methodology and not the income that an individual receives on the individual's paycheck. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 213 of 291 Table 65: Required Contributi on to Silver Plan Prior to Application APTC* FPL >400% FPL Individual Estimated Total Annual and Monthly Contributions Required Before APTC Percent of income contribution 2% to $15, 799 $15, 800 to $376 N/A Not Eligible Family of 4 Estimated Total Annual and Monthly Contributions Required Before PTC Percent of income contribution 2% Not Eligible *Amounts are based on 2016 federal poverty level (FPL). 2017 FPL will be released in January 2017 and will impact income and contribution estimates. Federal poverty level for advanced payment of premium tax credit (APTC) is based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Source: 26 CFR \u00a7 1.36B -3 The maximum amount of PTC is the difference between the required contribution and the p remium for the index plan(s) that cov er the applicable individuals. The PTC only covers the essential health benefits (EHB s); additional benefits will not be covered by a PTC calculation. Because the amount of the PTC is also indexed t o the silver level of coverage, if an individual selects a more expensive plan ( gold or platinum) the individual may expect to pay more than the income percentage referenced in Table 65. Once an individual or family has made its required mo nthly contribution towards the premium cost, then the PTC covers the remaining cost of the second lowest -cost silver plan. For example, if the annual Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 214 of 291 premium for the second lowest -cost silver plan to cover a non -tobacco user with income at 200% FPL ($23,760 per year) was estimated at $3,5 50 or $295 a month, the individual would be responsible for paying approximately $1,496 per year or $12 4 per month, and the PTC amount would be $ 2,054 per year or $1 71 monthly , as calculated from the difference between the premium cost of the second lowest -cost silver plan.63 The amount of PTC that an individual or family is eligible for will vary depending on the age of those applying to b e covered, and their location. This is due to the fact that insurance premium rates vary depending on an individual's age, location, and tobacco use. Individuals that face increased premium cost because of tobacco use will not be eligible for PTCs to cover the addition al premium rela ted to smoking. Though it is not a requirement, insurers may charge up to 50% more in premiums for those who smoke. From the above example, if the individual at 200% FPL ($2 3,760 per year) was a tobacco user, the individual's premium ma y be as much as 1.5 times $3,550 , or $5,325 . However, the amount of the indi vidual's PTC would not change. The individual would still be eligible for a total PTC of $ 2,054 per year or $1 71 monthly, and would be responsible for paying the remaining premium of $3,271 per year o r $272 per month . In this case, due to tobacco use, the individual is paying more than the amount of income contributions stipulated by the PTC calculation process.64 Sidebar: Tobacco use is defined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as use of any tobacco product on average four or more times per week over the past six months. Only those that may legally use tobacco in the state where they are applying for coverage are subject to the increased pre mium for tobacco use. Questions about tobacco use will be asked on the application for insurance affordabil ity programs and for coverage. If, after enrollment, a health insurer discovers that an individual is or has become a tobacco user then they may charge additional premiums back to the date of tobacco use initiation. Insurers may not terminate an individual's health plan if an individual has misrepresented his or her tobacco use; however, an insurer may terminate an individual's plan for non -payment of increased premiums related to tobacco use. Once the PTC amount is calculated, then it will not chan ge based on the plan selected. Individuals may reduce what they pay for health insurance by selecting a lower cost plan or may increase what they pay by selecting a higher cost plan or additi onal benefits beyond the essential health benefits . Individuals may also choose to accept less than the maximum amount for advanced payments of the PTC, and can reconcile the amounts with the IRS when filing their taxes the following year. Individuals that received too much APTC will owe the IRS money and those that received too lit tle will receive a tax credit. If an individual expects that their income will increase during the year or if they prefer to receive a larger refund on tax filing, then they may want to accept less than the maximum amount of APTC to avoid potential tax penalties. At any time an individual may contact the FFM to reduce their APTC amount or to request a new assessment for maxim um APTC amount. The FFM may be reached at www.healthcare.gov or by calling 1 -800-318-2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) . 63 Note, the rates cited in this paragraph are examples only and are not based on any actual premium rates. 64 Note, the rates cited in this paragraph are examples only and are not based on any actual premium rates. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 215 of 291 Sidebar : As of December 30, 2013, if a marketplace discovers that it did not reduce an individual's premium by the correct amount of the APTC, then the marketplace must notify the individual within 45 calendar days of the discovery and refund the individual any excess premium paid by or for the individual. c. APTC Reconciliation Beginning with the 2014 tax filing, individual's that are eligible for AP TC will reconcile these amounts when they file their taxes. Those that have received payments in excess of what they were eligible for will pay back this amount to the IRS; while individuals that received less APTC will receive these payments as refunds on their tax return. The amount that an individual may owe the IRS due to an over payment of the APTC is capped and individuals between 100% and 400% FPL may owe no more than the following amounts (see Table 66) due to excess APTC payments. Table 66: APTC Maximum Reconciliation Amounts Household income Single Individual Family < 200% FPL $300 For if a single individual is assessed to have 275% FPL based on MAG I, and when they file their taxes it shows that they received a $900 overpayment of APTC, then their tax liability is limited to $750 dollars. d. Cost -Sharing Reductions In addition to PTCs, individuals and/or hous eholds may be eligible for cost-sharing reductions (CSR s). To be eligible for CSR the individual or household must also be eligible for the PTC and have income below 250% FPL. Cost-sharing reductions increase the AV of the individual 's health pl an and reduce the expected cost - sharing an individua l may pay throughout the year. This insurance affordability program only applies if the individual selects a silver plan. A silver plan w ithout a CSR is a 70% AV plan. This means that on aggregate for all individuals enrolled in the health plan, the insurance company w ill pay 70% of the total health care c ost and the members will pay 30 percent . Individual members may pay more or less than 30% of their health cost , as AV is calculated over all of the members enrolled in the plan. Cost-sharing reductions increase the proportion of costs that are paid by the health plan, at no additio nal cost to the member. From a base 70% AV, CSR s increase the AV of the plan u p to 94% for some individuals. This result s in a decrease in overall cost -sharing, including a decrease in the total allowable out -of-pocket maximum. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 216 of 291 Table 67: Cost -Sharing Reductions, Silv er Plan Actuarial Value, and Out-of-Pocket Maximums Actuarial Value Individual Annual Out -of- Pocket Maximum 201 7 Family Annual Out -of-Pocket Maximum 201 7 100-150% FPL $14,3 00 Source s: Department of Health and Human Services, Final HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2017 , www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/regulations -and-guidance/ Not all plans will have exactly the out -of-pocket maximums displayed in Table 67; however, they may have out -of-pocket maximums no greater than these amounts. Depending on the plan selected, distribution of the out -of-pocket m aximums between ded uctibles, copayments and co insurance will vary; however, individuals and families that are eligible for CSR and enroll in silver plans will experience lower overall cost-sharing than those that are eligible for a CSR and do not enroll in a silver plan. For example, for 2017 the allowable out -of-pocket maximum is $7 ,150 for an individual and $1 4,300 for a famil y regardless of income . If individuals with household incomes under 250% FPL choose a bronze plan, they will not be eligible for cost -sharing reduc tions. The monthly premium payment for the bronze plan will be less than the premiums for the silver plan; however, individuals that are CSR eligible and enroll in a bronze plan vs. a silver plan can face maximum allowable out -of-pocket costs almo st three times greater than CSR -eligible individuals that enroll in a silver plan. CSR-eligible individuals that select a gold or platinum plan will pay more in premiums, however, they are not guarant eed to receive the reduced cost -sharing that is available under the silver plan.

There is no additional paperwork requi red to receive the reduced cost -sharing. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 218 of 291 Individuals th at experience income chan ges during the year must report these changes. Changes in income or household composition may affect the amount of CSR an individual receives. Changes should be reported directly to the FFM at www.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) . When some family members belong to a federally -recognized tribe and some do not, the family faces a difficult decis ion regarding plan enrollment. Family members that are not tribal members may not enroll in the CSR that are sp ecifically for tribal members. These families may either purchase multiple plans, one to cover the tribal members and to take advantage of the CSR that are only available to the members of federally recognized tribes, and a separate plan to cover the remai ning family members. Alternatively, the family members that are members of federally recognized tribes may decline to enroll in the plans available only to tribal members and the entire family may enroll in a plan that is not restricted to members of feder ally recognized tribes. e. Open Enrollment Periods /Re-enrollment Individuals that are enrolling or re -enrolling in QHPs through the FFM/ www.healthcare.gov may only enroll or re -enroll in and switch QHP's during an open or special enrollment period (SEP) . An uninsured individual that approaches the FFM for coverage outside of an open enrollment period and who is not eligible for a SEP, will not be allowed to enroll or re -enroll through the FFM or take advantage of PTCs or cost-sharing reductions . The dates for the open enrollment period for enrollment or re -enrollment in a QHP through the FFM and application for insurance affordabilit y programs may be viewed at www.healthcare.gov/glossary/open -enrollment -period . For 2017 coverage through the FFM, the open enrollment period is November 1, 2016 - January 31, 2017. Individuals must enroll or re -enroll by a certain date in order to eligible for health coverage and insurance affordability programs as of January 1st of the coverage year . Coverage will not begin until the next month for individuals that enroll or re - enroll after that designated date and who are eligible to receive insur ance affordability programs . The date an individual applies may not be the date of enrollment. The following table (see Table 6 9) shows enrollment and effective dates for insurance affordability programs in the 201 7 open enrollment period. Sidebar: There are two additional CSRs for qualifying members o f federally recognized tribes. Members of federally recognized tribes with incomes at or under 300% FPL may enroll in a silver plan that has 100% AV and no cost -sharing (and therefo re, no out -of-pocket maximum). Members of federally recognized tribes with income over 300% FPL may enroll in a silver plan that offers no cost -sharing for any services provided by an Indiana health provide r. Only members of federally recognized tribes are eligible for these CSR options. A list of federally recognized tribes can be accessed through www.healthcare.gov/glossary/feder ally-recognized -tribe . Sidebar : As of December 30, 2013, if a QHP issuer does not ensure that an eligible individual received the correct CSRs required, then the QHP issuer must notify the individual of the improper reduction within 45 calendar days and refund any excess cost sharing paid by or for the individual. In addition, if a QHP issuer provides greater CSRs to an individual than required, then the QHP issuer will not be eligible for reimbursement for the reductions provided and may not seek re imbursement from the individual or provider as applicable.

Individuals th at are determined eligible for i nsurance affordability programs prior to the 15th of the month, but who do not select a QHP until after the 15th of the month, will have to wait until the following month for the programs to become effective. Health insurance plans may offer coverage in advance of the effective dates if the individual pays the full amount of the premium, without APTC payments; however, individuals waiting for their APTC payments will have to abide by the above effective dates. For all individuals, coverage will not commence until the first premium payment is made in full, so individuals eligible for APTC must pay their portion of the prem ium prior to coverage initiation. After the open enrollment period in 201 7, HHS will provide additional information regarding the dates and guidelines for subsequent enrollment periods online at www.healthcare.gov . It is also important to remember that e nrollees must re -enroll on a yearly basis. f. Special Enrollment Periods Other than the open enrollment periods, individuals may only enroll in or change QHPs durin g a special enrollment period (SEP) . Special enrollment periods apply to the individual and his or her dependents, and an entire family may be subject to a SEP if one member gains access to such a period. Certain events trigger SEPs , and in general, individuals have 60 days from an event that triggers a SEP to enroll in or change, if applicable, a qualified health plan . An exception to the 60 -day rule is that individuals losing coverage from an employer have 30 days after the event. Depending on the triggering event, the SEP will h ave differen t effective dates. There are six events (described in Table 70 as well as online at www.healthcare.gov/coverage -outside - open -enrollment/special -enrollment -period ) that may trigger a SEP where an individual may change QHPs or complete initial enrollment into a qualified health plan.

Enrollment or Plan Error Enrollment or non -enrollment in a QHP is unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous and is the result of the error, misrepresentation, misconduct, or inaction of an officer, employee, or agent of the Marketplace or HHS, its instrumentalities, or a non -Marketplace entity providing enrollment assistance or conducting enrollment activities Enrollment or non -enrollme nt in a QHP or inaccurate eligibility determination is a result of a technical error, such as a Marketplace - related enrollment delay Enrollment in a QHP is impacted by a plan or benefit display error Non-enrollment in a QHP is the result of being determine d ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP by the state Medicaid or CHIP agency 6. Other Qualifying Factors Enrollment or non-enrollment in a QHP is the result of an exceptional circumstance, as determined by the Secretary of HHS, including being incapacitated or experiencing a natural disaster Enrollment or non-enrollment in a QHP is the result of an unforeseen event or a first-time requirement for Marketplace enrollees Enrollment or non-enrollment in a QHP is the result of a significant life event resulting in lack of access to the application or account , and a change in situation or status now requires that the person obtain minimum essential coverage. This includes victims of domestic abuse or spousal abandonment. This also applies to servicemen and women who are starting or ending their service. * Loss of MEC due to nonpayment of premiums does not qualify for a special enrollment period. ** Moving solely for medical treatment or vacation does not qualify for a special enrollment period. ***Change from one legally present status to another does not qualify for a special enrollment period.

Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 225 of 291 An individual can designate a FFM authorized representative66 to handle his or her account. If the authorize d representative designation is completed, the authorized representative will receive coverage notices for the individual and may make coverage option decisions for the individual. The authorized representative designation is valid until the individual revokes it. For individuals paying in full for their QHP coverage through the FFM , there are no eligibility restrictions other than legal U.S. residency, state residency, and non -incarceration. Individuals seeking QHP coverage and insurance affordability programs must, i n addition to the eligibility requirements for receiving coverage through a QHP on the FFM , meet each of the following : Have income between 100% and 400% of federal poverty level (FPL) Not have access to other minimum essential coverage (MEC) Not be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return Enroll in a metal -tier QHP through the FFM Individuals that are incarcerated may apply for coverage for their dependents through the FFM ; however, individuals that are incarcerated may not purchase and be covered by a QHP on the Federally - facilitated Marketplace . To be considered i ncarcerated, individuals must be held in an institution aft er the disposition of charges. Individuals in custody awaiting trial are not considered incarcerated. Individuals that are not state residents may apply for coverage on the FFM for dependents that are state residents or int end to become state residents. Families living in multiple states may be covered on multiple marketplaces. Similarly, individuals that are not citizens, nationals, or legal residents of the United States may use the FFM to apply for coverage on behalf of their dependents that are citizens, nationals, or legal U .S. residents. The FFM may not require an individual applying for coverage solely on behalf of the individual's dependents to provide documentation of the individu al's own legal resident status. Through \"guaranteed issue \" and \"guaranteed availabilit y,\" individuals that are not citizens, nationals, or legal residents of the United States may purchase qualifying FFM plans without going through a FFM determination by contacting the carrier directly.67 The appli cation for coverage through the FFM will first ask for basic information from the individual, including name, address, social security number or immig ration doc ument identification, and information about how he or she would like to receive information from the FFM or health plan. Individuals will also provide basic information on all dependents, including name, date of birth, social security number, relationship to the applying individual, and residency. F ull legal name s of the applicant and any dependent s should be used on the application to assure that the information can be verified by the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . Individuals will be asked o n the application for information on any 66 Note: Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) authori zed representatives are different than authorized representatives assisting with Indiana Applications for Health Coverage (IAHCs). Additional information on FFM authorized representatives is available on the FFM website at www.healthcare.gov/glossary/authorized - representative . 67 Incarcerated individuals may also have the same option to purchase a QHP plan directly. However, individuals that are not state residents and do not intend to reside in Indiana are not eligible for Indiana insurance products based on state insurance law. These individuals should seek an insurance product through their home state. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 226 of 291 membership in federally -recognized tribes. 68 Finally, individuals will si gn and date the application attest ing that all information provided is accurate. In addition , individuals applying for the PTC will be asked if they are pregnant, have a health condition that impacts their activities of daily living, information about employment, and s tudent loan interest payments. Individuals that are applying for themselves and their dependents will be asked to provide this i nformation for every individual who is applying for the premium tax credit. If an individual has access to employer -sponsored coverage, a page of the application will need to be completed by every employer that offers coverage. Individuals cannot be eligib le for the PTC if they have access to employer -sponsored insurance that is affordable ( e.g., costs less than 9.66 % of household income) and provides minimum value (MV). Individuals will also be asked to provide permission for the FFM to access their tax information on file with the I nternal Revenue Service (IRS). To receive an eligibility determination for PTC, individuals must provide this authorization in the yea r they are requesting the premium tax credit . However, individuals are not required to provide this authorization for any longer time period. Individuals will be asked to provide authorization for the FFM to access their tax inform ation in subsequent years. Individuals may approv e this request for up to a five -year period , may limit the period to shorter than five years, or may not provide the FFM authorization to access their tax in formation in subsequent years. In addition, individuals that provide the FFM with authorization to access their tax information in subsequent years may revoke t his authorization at any time. Tax information is accessed to verify income and household size for the purposes of PTC eligibility. Having access to other MEC may not disqualify the individual from receiving PTCs , however, individuals will be asked to report where they have acc ess to coverage. In addition, individuals will have to indicate that they and/or their dependents are not cl aimed on any other tax returns. When the application is complete, the FFM will verify the information with avai lable electronic data sources , including IRS tax data . If there are any inconsistencies between the provided information and the electronic data sources, individuals may have to provide additional documentation . Data inconsistencies will occur for some appl ying individuals, even if they have provided correct and valid data, due to administrative errors and lag in compiling administrative data. Individuals who submit applications where data cannot be verified through ele ctronic means should submit the requested verification documentation as quickly as possible to minimize the delay of enrolling in coverage. Additional information on additional documents that may be required and how to submit documents is available on th e FFM website at www.healthcare.gov/verify -information/send -more -info. Eligible individuals that accept PTC to help pay their health plans will not receive the funds directly; rather, these funds will be paid from the CMS to the QHP issuer and the individual will experience the benefit in the form of a reduced monthly premium. The individual will reconcile any overpayments o r underpayments of PTC with the IR S at tax filing. The FFM PTC -eligibili ty determination will allow individuals to apply their maxi mum estimated amount of premium tax credit to their monthly premium . If, after filing taxes for the year, it is discovered that the individual has acce pted too little PTC, it will be refunded to him or her at tax filing, and if the in dividual has accepted too much PTC he or she will be liable to return these funds at tax filing up to reconciliation limits . 68 A list of federally -recognized tribes can be www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federally -recognized Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 227 of 291 Individuals that expect that their income will increase or their household size will decrease throughout the year may consider accept ing a lesser initial amount of PTC to avoid owing m oney to the IRS at tax filing. Individuals that expect an income decrease or a household size increas e may want to accept the maximum PTC and request a PTC redetermination from the FFM upon the income decrease or household size increase. Individuals with question s about how much or how little PTC they should accept should contact a tax professional or the FFM at www.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1 - 855-889-4325) . Individuals that apply for PTC will also be assessed for cost-sharing r eductions . Individuals do not apply for CSR separately. Households with inc omes below 2 50% FPL that meet the PTC eligibility requirements will receive CSR if they enroll in a silver -level plan. No additional action is required on the part of the individual. If an individual does not kn ow what other types of coverage the individu al may be eligible for, the individual is still free to submi t an application to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . In Indiana, the FFM will complete an assessment of Medicaid eligibility, and if the applicant or any of the applicant's dependents are d eemed to be eligible for Medicaid, the information will be forwar ded to the appropriate program. Individuals that apply for Medicaid and are not eligible but may be eligible for insurance affordability programs will have their application forward ed to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . While certain additional information may be asked of these individuals, they will not be required to complete an entire additional application for coverage , as the information they provide on their original application wi ll be transfer red to the appropriate program. ii. Enrollment While individuals may apply and receive their eligibility determination at any time after open enrollment or their SEP , individuals may only enroll in QHPs through the FFM during open enrollment and special enrollment periods . Information on when the most recent open enrollment period is, as well as a link to SEP information, is available on the FFM website at www.h ealthcare.gov/glossary/open -enrollment - period . When enrolling in a plan, individuals will have to choose a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum plan based on AV and will need to analyze what plan options offer unique features tha t are of interest to the indiv idual including: benefits, cost -sharing, and health care provider options. Individuals that are eligible for CSRs must enroll in a silver plan to receive the cost-sharing reduction . Individuals that are not eligible for or do n ot want CSR may enroll in a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum plan and still rece ive the premium tax credit . The FFM will have a built -in plan compare function that will assist individuals to evaluate the features available in different plans. Individuals that need additional assistance in selecting a plan may contact the FFM at www.healthcare.gov or by calling 1 -800-318-2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) and ask for a listing of FFM -certified insurance agents and brokers. iii. Plan Termination Individuals may terminate their enrollm ent in a QHP at any time, for any reason. To terminate enrollment in a QHP the individual should cont act their QHP issuer directly. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 228 of 291 QHPs may terminate enrollees for non -payment of premiums, enroll ment in another QHP, or fraud. Coverage under the QHP does not initiate until the first premium payment is received. After the first payment, individuals enrolled in a QHP that do not receive APTC will have a 30 -day grace period fo r subseq uent premium payments. After their initial premium payment, individuals t hat receive APTC will have a 90 -day grace period to pay their premiums. Individuals who do not pay outstanding premiums in full by the end of this grace period may be liable for the f ull cost of any health services received in days 31 to 90. In general, premium payments are due on a monthly basis, though individuals may be able to work out weekly or multi -month payment arrange ments by contacting their QHP issuer . Qualified health pla ns are required to accept a variety of payment method s for the payment of premiums. Individuals concerned about the method with which to pay their QHP premiums should contact their QHP issuer directly. iv. Mid-Year Changes Individuals may report changes that impact their el igibility throughout the year. If income changes, individuals may be newly eligible for insurance affordability programs or have access to more or less APTC, which will decrease or increase their monthly premium payments. Indivi duals may also add or remove a dependent on their policy, change location, or experience another significant event that qualifies them for a special enrollment period. Some changes may allow individuals to change their QHP selection or modify their APTC or CSR amount, while reporting other changes ensures that the FFM has up-to-date information for completing annual redeterminations and will limit the amount of additional information the individual will have to provide during the annual redetermination. In addition to changes reported by individuals, the FFM will also conduct periodic data queries to see if enrollee's circumstances have changed, and if they are still eligible for QHP enrollment through the FFM and for insurance affordability programs. Individuals that have had a change in circumstance may receive a notification from the FFM asking them to verify this change. Depending on the change, this may impact their amount or eligibility for APTC, CSR, or their eligibility for enrollment in FFM qualif ied health plans . Individuals should respond to all FFM queries regarding eligibility and may contact the FFM directly with questions at www.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) . v. Churn Individuals that experience a change in circumstances during the year that impacts their eligibility may experience \"churn \" to another health coverage program for t hemselves or their d ependents. For exam ple, a family that receives a PTC through the FFM that experiences an income decrease or a household size increase may find that their children are newly eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) . Similarly, a woman covered by a QHP with PTC that becomes pregnant may become eligible for Medicaid during her pregnancy . For i ndividuals enrolled in QHPs or PTC through the FFM , all changes relating to income, location, household size, and health or disability status should be reported to the FFM at www.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) . Individuals may also transition from Medicaid progra ms to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . Medicaid and the FFM will coordinate this transitio n and individuals may contact either Indiana Medicaid at www.in.gov/fssa or 1-800-403-0864 , or the FFM with questions or concerns around these transitions. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual III. Federally -facilitated Marketplace IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 229 of 291 vi. Re-enrollment Qualified health p lan enrollm ent lasts for a calendar year. Even individuals who experienced a plan change during a SEP will complete the re -enrollment process during the next enrollment period. All individuals enrolled in through the FFM will receive a notice prior to the next open enrollment period asking them to report any changes in circumstances. Any changes reported will be considered by the FFM in the annual eligibility redeterm ination. Individuals that do not report changes will have the ir eligibility re -determined based on the information available to the FFM through electronic data sources. Once their eligibility is re -determined, individuals will receive a re -determination notice. Individuals that did not report changes will have an other chance to report changes in circumstance at this point. Individuals that do not report changes and are re -determined eligible will remain enrolled in their previously selected QHP opti on, if this remains available. If the individual's QHP is no longe r available, the ind ividual may be auto -reenrolled into a new plan or may select a new qualified health plan . Even if their current plan is still available the next year, i ndividuals may always change their QHP coverage during an open enrollment period. Individuals accepting A PTC will have their eligibility re -determined similarly to individuals that are enrolled in FFM QHPs without advanced payment of the premium tax credit . If these individuals have not provided authorization for the FFM to access their tax information in subsequent years, they will be asked to authorize this access for the year the eligibility det ermination is being conducted. Individuals may no t receive A PTC without providing authorization for the FFM to access their tax information and may not receive A PTC after their initial year, if they did not file taxes for the year of receipt. If an individual who receives A PTC does not provide authorization in a subsequent year for the FFM to access their tax i nformation, then they will not receive a redetermination until th ey provide this authorization. Individuals may reque st a redetermination to enroll in a QHP without APTC without providing the authorization to provide tax data. Individuals re -determined el igible for APTC will receive a notice of their eligibility determ ination and their APTC amount. As discussed, these individuals may choose to accept less APTC than the full amount, and may change QHPs during the open enrollment period . Individuals eligible for APTC that do not respond to their eligibility redetermination notice will be reenrolled in their same QHP, if it is still available. Both APTC and premium amounts may change at reenrollment, so individuals should watch for reenrollment notices and tak e appropriate action. IMPORTANT NOTE: Individuals enrolled in a QHP with or without APTC need to be aware that their QHP premium and/or APTC amount s may change upon reenrollment. Individuals will experience out - of-pocket premium changes at enrollment as QHP premiums and/or APTC change. Therefore, individuals should be very cautious before re -enrolling or auto -reenrolling in their qualified health plan and should be encouraged to evaluate69 what new options may be available to them. New QHPs may be available with lower plan premiums and greater premium tax credits. 69 One tool available to consumers when evaluating whether to keep or change FFM coverage is the short quiz available on the FFM website at www.healthcare.gov/downloads/compar ing-plans -to-re-enroll.pdf .

Appeals Individuals that believe their eligibility determination for a QHP, or eligibility for or amount of an APTC or CSR is incorrect, should contact the FFM to file an appeal. The FFM can be contacted through www.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1 -855-889-4325) . Individuals may file appeals relating to eligibility for or amount of an APTC for up to three years after they experienced the triggering event. Individuals that believe they have been denied a prov ider or service they should have had access to through their QHP, should c ontact the plan administrator. Qualified health plan s have grievance procedures in place to address individual complaints. Individuals should contact their QHP issuer as soon as th ey become aware of the problem. Individuals who do not feel their situation is resolved through the QHP grievance procedure may request an appeal from the QHP issuer, as applicable. An external grievance or review may follow if the appeal is not resolved. Individuals can contact the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) at 317 -232-2395 or www.in.gov/idoi/2547.htm#6 for more information on filing a consumer complaint against an insurance company .Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV.

For 2017 FFM coverage, the open enrollment p eriod is November 1, 2016 - January 31, 2017. People may qualify for special enrollment periods (SEPs) allowing them to enroll on the FFM outside of open enrollment. Individuals may apply for Indiana Health Coverage Progr ams (IHCPs) at any time of the year. 17. Preliminary Eligibility Screening is a technique that Indiana Navigators may use to evaluate whether a consumer would be better suited to apply for an Indiana Health Coverage Pro gram (IHCP) or for health coverage through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) before assisting with a health coverage application. The Indiana Navigator may ask basic questions about United States citizenship/legal residen t status, household incom e, household composition, and refer to the eligibility screening charts (see Table 73 , Table 74, and Table 75), in order to better direct the consumer to the type of coverage for which the consumer is most likely eligible. 18. Presumptive Eligibility (PE) (also referred to as PE for (PEPW) Hospital PE (HPE) , or PE for Inmates ) is a determination by a qualified provider (QP) that an individual is eligible for Medicaid benefits on the basis of prelim inary self -declared information that the individual has gross income at or below the applicable Medicai d income eligibility standard. Indiana operates the following PE programs: Presumpt ive Eligibility (PE), PE (HPE), and PE for Inmates . See Table 27 showing the comparisons between these programs . 19. Redetermination (also referred to as Eligib ility Redetermination ) is the process by which an enrolled consumer is re -enrolled, terminated, or transferred into an Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) or the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM). E ligibility redetermination s are to ensure that consumers are still eligible and in the right programs . The process is done every 12 months or when the enrollee reports any changes to household income, household size, or residence. 20. Re-Enrollment is th e annual process by which consumers are redetermined eligible for Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) or Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) coverage and the steps consumers must take to re -enroll in coverage. All individuals enrolled in an IHCP or the FFM will receive a notice asking them to report any changes in circumstances. Any changes reported will be considered in the annual eligibility re determination. 21. Social Security Administration (SSA) is a federal agency through which Indiana Medicaid disability applications go t hrough to determine if an individual is el igible for Medicaid disability. Direct applications to Indiana Medicaid may be made if the applicant is a child, has a recognized religious objection to applying for fe deral benefits ( e.g., Amish), seeks eligibility under the M.E.D. Works medically improved category, or cites other \"good cause\" for not applying through the Social Security Administration . 22. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a federal insurance program that provides benefits to qualified indiv iduals who can no longer work. To be eligible, the individual must meet the SSA's definition of disabled. Disabled individuals with SSDI are eligible for Medicaid disability insurance in Indiana and need not undergo the state Medic al Review Team (MRT) process. SSDI is also a source used to determine a consumer's disability status through the federal Marketplace application. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Health Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 234 of 291 23. Special Enrollment Period is a timeframe outside of the open enrollment period in which a consumer may enroll in health coverage through the Marketplace due to certain qualifying life events, such as losing access to employer -sponsored coverag e, marriage, divorce, a birth or adoption of a child, etc . A list of life events that qualify for a special enrollment period is outlined in Table 70. 24. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a federal program that pays benefits to adults and children determined disabled by the U.S. Social Security Administration ( SSA) and who hav e limited income and resources. Individuals receiving SSI are automatically deemed eligible for Medicaid disability insurance in Indiana . SSI is also a source used to determine a consumer's disability status through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM)/ www.healthcare.gov application. C. Preparing to H elp Consumers Apply for Health Coverage Indiana Navigators and Application Organizations (AOs) may assist consumers seeking health coverage in several different ways. They may conduct outreac h efforts to educate the public about available health coverage options and the avail ability of Indiana Navigators \u2014individuals trained and certified to help consumers complete applications for health coverage. Outreach efforts could include, but are not limited to, the following activities: Media and public relation s efforts Mailings Integration of Indiana Navigator services with other services the organization provides A presence at community events, such as health fairs, ba ck-to-school events, and others Additionally, consumers may locate an Indiana Navigator or an AO by county via the Indiana Healthcare Reform website at www.in.gov/healthcarereform/2468.htm . Before helping a consumer complete an application through the Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) portal (www.dfrbenefits.in.gov ) or through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) (www.healthcare.gov ), an Indiana Navigator should complete each of the following three steps (discussed in more detail in the following sections) : (1) inform the consumer o f any actual or potential conflicts of i nterest and the Indiana Navig ator's roles and responsibilities; (2) complete a preliminary eligibility screening to determine whether the con sumer should apply through the s tate health coverage portal or the FFM ; and (3) recommend which health coverage application the consumer should complete. 1. Step One: Inform the Consumer of Any Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest and of the Indiana Navigator's Roles and Responsibilities Before assisting a consumer with an application for health coverage, an Indiana Navigator should first disclose in writing any actual or potential conflicts of interest pursuant to the Conflict of Interest Policy .70 The Indiana Navigator should also clearly describe the Indiana Navigator's role in the health 70 An Indiana Navigator and Application Organization (AO) is also required to disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest to the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) as part of the initial application for certificati on or registration as well as within 30 days of a new actual or potential conflict of interest that arises. Navigators may make disclosure on the Navigator Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form posted online at www.in.gov/idoi/files/Navigator_Conflict_of_Interest_Disclosure_Form.pdf , and AOs may make disclosure on the Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Health Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 235 of 291 coverage application process and highlight limitations, including the inability to advise on plan selection and to present all health -plan options available to the consumer in a fair, accurate, an d impartial manner in the consumer's best interests . All explanations should be stated in clear, concise language, and should help the consumer understand the nature of assistance the Indiana Navigator can and cannot provide. 2. Step s Two and Three : Comp lete Preliminary Eligibility Screening and Recommend the \"Best Door\" for the Consumer to take Consumers may choose to complete an Indiana Application for Health Coverage (IAHC) at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov OR apply to purchase a plan offered through the FFM at www.healthcare.gov . However, by asking some basic questions about United States citizenship/legal resident status, household income, and household composition, the Indiana Navigator may be able to better direct the consumer to the form of coverage for which the consumer is most likely eligible. When completing the basic eligibility screening, the Indiana Navigator should inform the consumer that there are limitations to the assessment questions asked, and that the result of the preliminary screening does not definitively determine actual eligibil ity for either form of health coverage. The Indiana Navigator should specifically state that the purpose of this basic eligibility screening process is simply to determine the program(s) for which the consumer is most likely to be eligible . The consumer can then decide if completing an IAHC is the right choice, or if the FFM is the \"best door\" to begin the application process. The screening is intended to be a guide and the results are not binding. If the results reveal that a consumer is likely eligible for one form of coverage and the consumer would rather apply for the othe r form of coverage, it is acceptable to do so. The Indiana Navigator should also explain that both the IAHC and the FFM application are considered \"single streaml ined applications, \" meaning that if a consumer completes an IAHC and is found ineligible, the application will be auto matically routed to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . The FFM will then contact the consumer regarding eligibility to purchase covera ge, as well as eli gibility for premium tax credits (PTC s) and/or cost-sharing r eductions (CSR s). Conversely, if the applicant c ompletes the FFM application and that application reveals that the consumer may be eligible for an IHCP , it will be routed to the state Department of Family Resources (DFR) for processing. The tables on the following three pages (see Table 73, Table 74, and Table 75) outline the inc ome ranges and household sizes at which consumers and their families are likely to be eligible for an IHCP and for subsidized and non -subsidized coverage on and off the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . Adults wit h household income at approximately 138% of the federal poverty l evel (FPL) or less should apply for an IHCP at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov . Adults with household income over approximately 138% and up to or including 400% FPL may be el igible for subsidize d coverage (PTCs and/or CSR s) through the FFM and should apply through the FFM at www.healthcare.gov . Adults with household incomes over 400% FPL may apply for coverage through the FFM or through the outside commercial insurance market. AO Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form posted at www.in.gov/idoi/files/AO_Conflict_of_Interest_Disclosure_Form.pdf . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Health Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 236 of 291 Pregnant women with household income 213% FPL or l ess should apply for IHCP coverage at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov . Pregnant women with household income over 213% FPL up to and including 400% FPL may be eligible for subsidized coverage through the FFM and should app ly through the FFM at www.healthcare.gov . Pregnant women with household incomes over 400% FPL may apply for cove rage on the FFM or seek coverage on the outside market. Note: for IHCP coverage a pregnant woman's household size is always at least two as the woman's unborn child is included in the household size calculation. Children under age 19 with household income up to 255% FPL should apply for IHCP coverage through www.dfrbenefits.in.gov . Children under age 19 with household income over 255% FPL and up to or including 400% FPL may be eligible for subsidized coverage through the FFM and should app ly at the FFM at www.healthcare.gov . Children under 19 with household incomes over 400% FPL may apply for cove rage on the FFM or seek coverage through the outside market. United States citizenship, national, or legal residency status is also an eligibili ty requirement for both IHCP and FFM coverage. However, if a consumer is not a citizen, national, or legal resident of the United States, the consumer may still apply for coverage on behalf of dependents if they are citizens, nationals, or legal residents. India na Navigators may refer to the following tables (see Table 73, Table 74, and Table 75) after asking preliminary questions about consumers' household income and size and then provide information regarding potential eligibility for different coverage options. With this information, the consumer can then choose the \"best door\" (IHCP, FFM, or outside market ) through which the consumer would like to enter the application process. The advantage to choosing the \"best door\" based on the preliminary screening is that even if the consumer is found ineligible for the program for which the consumer applies, the application will be automatically sent through the other \"door\"/program with no additional action required. The only disadvantage of using the \"best door\" based on preliminary eligibility screening instead of completing two separ ate application s is that processing may take longer if the \"best door \" was not initially chosen; however, it saves the applicant the time of comple ting two separate applications. More detailed scr eening tools to determine preliminary eligibility for IHCPs and the FFM are available on the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) website at www.ifcem.com/CitizenPortal/application .do and on the FFM website at www.healthcare.gov/screener .

Medicaid (Hoosier Healthwise or Traditional, Fee -for-Service) If the eligibility screening indicates that the applicant falls into the yellow section of the eligibility screening charts (see Table 73, Table 74, and Table 75), an Indiana Application for Health Coverag e (IAHC) \u2014located at online www.dfrbenefits.in.gov \u2014is likely the best application to use. In addition to household income requirements, a consumer must also meet the United States citizen, national, or legal resident requirements and be an I ndiana res ident to be eligible for an Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) . Applications are accepted online, by mail or fax, by telephone, or in person at local Division of Family Resources (DFR) office s. The o nline application i s recommended, both for consumers applying on their own behalf and for Indiana Navigators assisting consumers. The following table (see Table 76) gives more details on the different methods available for application.

The consumer should come prepared with as much of this information as p ossible. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 241 of 291 Table 77: Consumer Information Needed to Complete Indiana Application for Health Coverage Information Category Specific Information Demographic information Full name Date of birth Social Security Number, if applicable Gender Marital status Home address, phone number E-mail address Language Race and Ethnicity Citizenship/Immigration information Information about any existing health coverage Type of coverage (e.g., employer insurance, COBRA, Medicare, TRICARE, VA health car e program, Peace Corps, etc. ) Name of health insurance company Policy/ID number Income and household information Tax filing information Current employment and wages/salaries Any other fo rm of income (social s ecurity, child support, alimony) Deductions Assets and resources Whether the following statuses apply Pregnancy Blindness or disability In a nursing or residential care facility In jail In foster care IMPORTANT NOTE : An Indiana Navigator assisting the consumer in completing the IAHC must include on the application the navigator's name and state certification number as they appear on the navigator's state certification issued by the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI). An individual's state certification through IDOI is different than the individual's federal certification through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ( e.g., the Certified Application Counselor (CAC) or federal Navigator certifications) to conduct Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) services . In addition to entering the navigator's name and state certification number on the IAHC, the navigator must also enter the name and state registration number of the navigator's associated Application Organi zation (AO ), if applicable , as they appear on the AO's registration certificate issued by the Indiana Department of Insurance . a. Using the Online Medicaid Application As discussed, the IAHC is accepted via multiple avenues; however, the online version is the preferred method and may be accessed at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov . The online app lication is dynamic in nature. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 242 of 291 That is, the questions that are asked of the applicant are determined based on re sponses to previous questions. To expedite processing time by preventing the need for additional information due to application incompleteness, applicants should provide as complete of information as possibl e. Paper documentation is not required to be submitted up front with the application; however, individuals may attach and send with the app lication. As discussed further in the Verifying Factors of Eligibility section , DFR will access federal and state data sources to verify and val idate application information. The applicant will be notified when additional information or documentation is needed and provided with instructions on how to submit. b. Checking Medicaid App lication Status Upon completion of the online application, a summary of the submitted appl ication data will be provided. Applicants may check the status of their application by accessing www.dfrbenefits.in.gov , clicking on the \"Manage Current Benefits\" link, and entering the following information. Case number Case name Date of birth Last four digits of social security number With authorization, an Indiana Navigator may check the status of an application on behalf of the consumer. Consumers can expect to hear from the DFR regarding their eligibility d ecision within 45 days (90 days if the Medicaid application is based on blindness or disability). This notice, sent via U.S. mail, will inform the consumer that the application either : (a) has been approved; (b) has been denied (and may be routed to the FFM for assessment for QHP coverage and /or insurance affordability programs ); or (c) needs more information to make a decision. Indiana Navigators should remind co nsumers to look for this notice and respond promptly and fully to all instructions and requests for information. If a consumer receives a denial notice, the consumer may appeal DFR's decision . The following figure (see Figure 9 ) depicts the process of filing an eligibility appeal .71 Consumers who are already covered under Medicaid -Hoosier Healthwise may also appeal termination, reductions, and suspension of benefits, in which case benefits are still in effect during the appeals pro cess. Indiana Navigators may advise a consumer on how to file appeals. 71 Additional information on filing an IHCP eligibility appeal with FSSA is online at http://member.indianamedicaid.com/members -rights --responsibilities/appeals -and-grievances.aspx and www.in.gov/fssa/dfr/3094.htm .

Medicaid Eligibility Based on Blindness or Disab ility The process for eligibility determination under the blindne ss and disability category under went significant changes effective June 1, 2014 due to Indiana's transition to a state with 1634 status . Individuals may apply for coverage under the Medicaid blindness and disability categories through three different avenues, depending on their personal situation. 1. Receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI): The consumer will be automatically enrolled in Medicaid without any additional steps. This individual should not need to complete a separate Medicaid application for consideration for coverage. 2. Determined disabled by the Social Security Administration (SSA) but not eligible for SSI: Although a person may be declared disabled by the SSA, excess income may prevent the individual from get ting SSI. The individual may s till be eligible for Medicaid. To find out if the individual is eligible for Medicaid coverage, the individual will need to complete a separate Medicaid application. After the consumer submits the Medicaid application, the s tate will verify disability status with the SSA and will consider other factors of eligibility. 3. Not receiving SSI and not determined disabled by the SSA: This consumer may apply directly to Medicaid; and Medicaid will require the individual to file an application for disability with the SSA within 45 days of submittin g the application to Medicaid. The application will be processed through the Indiana Medical Review Team (MRT), and if the individual is considered disabled AND meets the other eligibility criteria, the individual will be enrolled in Medicaid. If the individual does not submit an application to the Notify state of desire to appeal Limited time to appeal Scheduling: Family and Social Services Administration schedules hearing with administrative law judge Individual may: 1) Hire a lawyer OR 2) Represent self Appeal Hearing: Usually in county DFR office May be conducted by phone Individual receives notice of appeal decision *May request agency review if unhappy with hearing outcome Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 244 of 291 SSA for benefits within 45 days of submitting the Indiana Medicaid application, the individual will be denied for failure to comply with the requirements of the process. While the SSA applicat ion is pending, the MRT process will run concurrently and MRT will render its own decision. The MRT's disability determination will be effective until the SSA renders its decision. Effective June 1, 2014, the state will defer to the SSA's disability determination for Medicaid eli gibility purposes. That is, if the SSA's disability determination differs from that of the state MRT, the SSA decision is considered final. As a 1634 state, Indiana is required to defer to all SSA disability determinations. For example, if the MRT determin ed an individual to be non -disabled but SSA later determined that same individual to be disabled, the individual would be considered disabled for Medicaid eligibility purposes. The following figure (see Figure 10 ) summarizes the scenario in which an individual without an SSA disability determination applies directly to Indiana Medicaid for coverage under the blindness or disability categories, effective June 1, 2014. Figure 10: Medicaid Applications without SSA Disability Determ ination Source: Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, 2014 Disability Eligibility Changes (1634 Transition) , www.in.gov/fssa/files/1634_Stakeholder_Presentation_FINAL.pdf Effective June 1, 2014, individuals with a disability denial from SSA will not typically qualify for Medicaid under the blindness and disability categories. However, there will be two cases in which the MRT will process a Medicaid disability application in spite of a SSA disability denial on file: 1. If an applicant alleges a new disabling condition or a change or worsening of the applicant's prior condition since the unfavorable SSA determination and more than 12 months have passed, Indiana Medicaid will accept and process a n Indiana Medicaid application. In this case, the state may require the individual to re -apply to SSA as one of the requ irements of the Medicaid application process. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 245 of 291 2. If the applicant alleges a change of condition within the last 12 months and SSA has refused to consider new evidence, the state will accept and process a n Indiana Medicaid application. Individuals that meet th ese criteria will go through the separate MRT disability determination process. If the state finds the individual disabled and the individual meets all other criteria the individual will be enrolled in Medicaid. NOTE : According to CMS, an individual with a Medicaid disability waiver can purchase Marketplace coverage but is not eligible for a premium tax credit (PTC) . Furthermore, a family that is eligible for a PTC can still get the PTC even if a family member has a Medicaid disability waiver. That family member would be excluded as a member of the household for purposes of calculating the PTC amount. 2. Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) Adults between the ages of 19 and 64 who fall at or below 1 38% of the federal poverty level (FPL)72 and are not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid may be eligible for the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0). If an Indiana Navigator is working with someone who falls into this category, the \"best door\" for coverage is likely the HIP 2.0/Indiana Application for Health Coverage . If the consumer's income is too high to be eligible for HIP 2.0, the application will be re-routed to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . Additional information on HIP 2.0 eligibility and the differ ent HIP 2.0 \"pathways to coverage\" is available in the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0) section of Chapter Three. The IAHC application methods (see Table 76) and type s of information needed to complete the IAHC are also used for the HIP 2.0 application. Applications are available online at www.dfrbenefits.in.gov , by phone, mail, or by visiting a local DFR office. Hoosiers may call 1-877-GET-HIP-9 to find more information about the application pro cess or to find their local DFR office. Indiana Navigators should work with consumers to ensure they have the required application information prior to starti ng the process. Applications are processe d within 45 business days once all required informa tion is received. After an application is processed, the individual will rece ive a letter by mail telling them if they qualify for HIP 2.0 . Once an individual is approved for HIP 2.0, they will be assign ed to the health plan they chose on their application. If they did not choose a health pl an, one will be selected for them. Their health plan will mail them a welcome packet, and they will receive an invoice for their POWER accou nt contribution. HIP POWER account contributions must be paid by the due date stated on the invoice to become enrolled in HIP Plus . If they selected a health plan on their application, they will also receive an invoice f or a \"Fast Track \" payment while their application i s being processed, which can expedite their enrollment in HIP Plus. Lower income members who choose not to make POWER account contributions will be enrolled in HIP Basic . Those with incomes above the federal poverty level (FPL) who do not make their POWER account contributions by the due date will not be enrolled and would have to reapply. Coverage for HIP P lus members begins in the month when their first POWER account contributions or Fast Track payments are received and processed. HIP Basic coverage begins the first of the month after 72 See the HIP 2.0 income eligibi lity chart at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2460.htm . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 246 of 291 the invoice payment period. All HIP 2.0 members will receive a letter inf orming them when coverage starts and how to get the most out of their HIP 2.0 benefits. Note: Under HEA 1269 -2015 , county jails and sheriffs, as Authorized Representatives and/or Indiana Navigators, must make best efforts to apply for healthcare coverage on behalf of prisoners whose incarceration is greater than 30 days. An online video tutorial on the application pr ocess is available through the HIP 2.0 website at www.in.gov/fssa/hip/2507.htm . 3. Home and Community -Based Services Waiver Programs Consumers who are at risk of being institutionalized (in a nursing home or residential care facility) due to age, blindness, or mental or physical disability may be eligible for Indiana Medicaid home and community -based s ervices (HCBS) waiver p rograms. These individuals have special needs, and there are specific resources dedicated to assisting them. See the Home and Community -Based Services Waivers section in the Medicaid portion of the manual for more details on eligibility for these waivers. If an Indiana Navigator encounters someone in this situat ion, it is best to seek guidance for assisting the individual at the following resources (see Table 78): Table 78: Home and Community -Based Services Waiver Contacts Aged, Disabled, and Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver Community Integ ration and Habilitation Waiver; Family Supports Waiver Where to Go Area Agency on Aging Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services Phone number 1-800-986-3505 1-800-545-7763 Web site to locate an office: www.iaaaa.org/icontent.asp?id=27 4. Presumptive Eligibility Indiana Navigators may encounter some individuals whose services will be able to be cov ered by Medicaid \"presumptively,\" that is, without receiving an official eligibility notice or determination from the state. In the period when the consumer has \"presumptive eligibility \" (PE), Medicaid will cover all health care services received regardless of whether the consumer is defin itively determined eligible after the consumer's application has gone through the entire application process. Consumers with income in the yellow (preliminary assumed Medicaid -eligible) sections in the \"best door\" eligibility screening charts (see Table 73, Table 74, and Table 75) may be presumptively eligible for certain Indiana Health Coverage Programs (IHCPs). See the Presumptive Eligibility section in the Medicaid chapter of the manual for more details on presumptive eligibility. Before January 1, 2014, PE applied only to pregnant women, intending to encourage timely prenatal care. Beginning on January 1, 2014, qualified providers (QPs ) started assessin g PE for Medicaid for the following additional populations: Children under 19 Low-income parents/caretakers Family Planning Eligibility Program Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 247 of 291 Former foster care children up to 26 years Only QP s may make PE determinations for those groups. To be determin ed presumptively el igible, the QP will collect basic demographic, household income, and citizenship/legal resident status information. If it appears that the consumer will be eligible for Medicaid based on this information, the consumer will be deemed pres umptively eligible and will be able to receive benefits for a limited time while the applicant completes and submits a full IAHC and that application is processed for ongoing Medicaid eligibility. Even if the full application is subsequently denied, servic es performed during the PE period are covered. If the consumer is deemed not presumptively eligible for Medicaid based on the information provided to the QP, the consumer cannot appeal this decision. However, the consumer still has the option to complete a full Indiana Application for Health Coverage . The following table (see Table 7 9) provides a list of resources for applying for and reporting changes for Indiana Health Coverage Programs.

How to Help Consumers Apply for Coverage and Insurance Affordability Programs on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace If, when conducting a preliminary eligibility screening, an Indiana Navigator determines that a consum er falls into the blue or red section of the eligibility screening charts (see Table 73, Table 74, and Table 75), an applicati on to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) is likely the \"best door\" for the application process. If a consumer falls into the blue section, the consumer may also be eligible for premium tax credits (PTC s) or cost-sharing reductions (CSRs ) to lower the costs of coverage. Regardless of whether a consumer falls into this range, the consumer may wish to complete an application for PTCs/CSRs to verify possible eligibility. The FFM makes all determinations about whether a consum er is eligible f or PTCs and cost -sharing reductions . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 248 of 291 It is important to note that, while many IHCPs accept new applicants year -round, the FFM has set enrollment periods ; so individuals will need to be eligible for one of those enrollment periods if they wish to p urchase coverage on the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . 1. Federally -facilitated Marketplace Applications Basics a. Be ginning the FFM Application When completing the FFM application, the type of application a consumer compl etes will depend on the number of people on whose behalf the consumer is applying and whether the consumer wants to apply for insurance affordability programs (PTCs and CSRs). If the application is completed online, the dynamic format will direct consumers and Indiana Navigators to the appropriate application based on answers to questions designed to gather this information. Indiana Navigators may want to advise consumers to have the following documents for each mem ber of the household on hand to provide the most accurate information during the application process: Social s ecurity cards or immigration documents W2 forms or pay stubs Any existing health coverage policy information Information on additional documentation that may be required for FFM applications is available online at www.healthcare.gov/verify -information/documents -and-deadlines To complete an application to the FFM , consumers must create an account on the FFM website at www.healthcare.gov .73 To create an account , a consumer must provide contact information and complete questions to verify the c onsumer's identity. Additional information required for the application may include: Income (if t he consumer wants to apply for insurance affordability p rograms) o Regular and one -time payments received o Income that the consumer pays out (deductions) Alimony Student loan i nterest Educator e xpenses Moving e xpenses Contributions to an individual retirement account (if consumer has no retirement through a job) Tuition costs, if paid out -of-pocket and deducted on tax return (line 34) o Any expected income changes during the year o Additional information on what is included or excluded as income and helpful tools for estimating income are available on the FFM website at www.healthcare.gov/ income - and-household -information/income . The number of other people in the household 73 The direct link to log in or create an FFM account is www.healthcare.gov/marketpl ace/global/en_US/registration . Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 249 of 291 Common Activities of Daily Living: Eating Bathing Dressing Toileting Transferring o Applying for coverage o Not applying for coverage Already have coverage Applying separately o Relationship to other household members Dependents Whether or not the consumer plans to file a tax return Any recent changes in health insurance coverage. Some types of income and deductions are not considered for eligibility for PTCs and/or CSR s, so it is important to follow application instructions on the type of income and deduct ions to report and which to exclude. Applicants should report all income unless the application or federal call center employee states otherwise. b. Disability Ques tion on the FFM Application When completing the application, the Indiana Navigator and co nsumer may come across questions screening for disabilities of the primary applicant or other family members. These questions are intended to help determine if the consumer or the consumer's household members may be eligible for an Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) based on disability. The consumer should answer \" yes\" to the FFM disability question if the consumer and/or a household member : Is blind, deaf, or hard of hearing Receives Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI) Has physical, intellectual, or mental health condition causing: o Serious difficulty completing activities of daily living o Difficulty doing errands o Serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions o Difficulty walking or climbing stairs. Additional information on what constitutes disabilities on the FFM application is available online at www.healthcare.gov/people -with -disabilities/marketplace - application c. Employer Coverage Quest ions on the FFM Application The FFM application may require consumers who are currently employed to provide the following information on the application: Employer name Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) Employer contact information (address, phone number, e -mail address) The FFM application may require additional information from individuals with access to employer - sponsored coverage, including: Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 250 of 291 Who (with employer) to contact about employee health co verage (usually someone in the human r esources department) Amount employee pays for premium cost Any known changes in future employer coverage Whether employer -sponsored coverage meets minimum value (MV) (whether the policy covers at least 60% of healthcare costs for the covered pool, on average, after premiums) A consumer may also need to provide information about futu re individual and dependent eligibility for employer -sponsored coverage. d. Sources of Information N eeded for the FFM A pplication Indiana Navigators may direct consumers to and consult the resources listed in the following table (see Table 80) for information needed to c omplete the FFM application for coverage and i nsurance affordability p rograms.

After Completing an Application Indiana Navigators should inform consumers that, after completing an application, the FFM will contact the consumer about eligibility or may need additional inform ation to determine eligibility. The FFM will notify the consumer of the consumer's eligibility or need for mor e information through notices. These notices may be paper and/or electronic, based on the consumer's indicated preference, and consumers may sign u p to receive alerts that they have a notice by opting in to text message, e -mail, and U.S. mail notifications. If consumers choose to receive electronic notices, they can typically view the notifications by logging into the account they used to complete th e application at www.healthcare.gov . Additional information regarding FFM eligibility notices at www.healthcare .gov/marketplace -appeals/your -eligibility -notice . b. To Challenge a Decision A consumer may challenge a FFM decision in the following circumstances: The consumer disagrees with a FFM eligibility decision regarding enrollment in a qualified health plan (QHP), premium tax credit, (PTC) or cost-sharing reduction (CSR). The consumer disagrees with the amount of PTC o r CSR determined by the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . Information on how to appeal a FFM decision will be included on most notices, and consumers wishing to appeal such decisions should follow the instructions on the notice or may call the FFM call cent er for additional information. It is important to note that ap peals usually have a time lim it, so consumers wishing to appeal a FFM decision will need to be aware of those time limits and comply with them in order to receive consideration for their appeal. Concerns related to a QHP decision not to cover a particular provider or service are outs ide the jurisdiction of the Federally -facilitated Marketplace . If a consumer wants to file an appeal regarding a QHP decision to not cover a service or provider, the consumer should follow the appeal process outlined in the QHP's Certificate of Coverage. If the consumer is unable to resolve the grievance within the QHP's appeal process, the consumer may contact the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) at www.in.gov/idoi/2547.htm to arbitrate the dispute. Addi tional information on filing an appeal with the FFM is available online at www.healthcare.gov/marketplace -appeals/ways -to-appeal . c. Reporting Changes Consumers' life circumstan ces affect their continued eligibility for enrollmen t in QHPs, PTCs , and cost- sharing reductions . Indiana Navigators should encourage consumers with whom they work to report changes to the FFM in a timely manner to ensure continued QHP coverage and the proper level of affordability subsidy. Applicants should report the following changes to the FFM , or to their Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP), as soon as possible to avoid owing subsidies back at tax filing ( FFM ) or Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 252 of 291 committing fraud ( IHCP ). Changes in income, household size, and citizenship circumstances could also increase the amount of subsidy available for FFM plans or render a child or family eligible to enroll in a QHP or an Indiana He alth Coverage Program . The following table (see Table 81) shows the possible reasons for changes in household size, income, location, citizenship or immigration status , or health coverage : Table 81: Changes to Report to the Federal ly-Facilitat ed Marketplace Change s to Report Example s Household Size Birth or adoption Someone becomes pregnant Someone moves out of the house Someone passes away Marriage or divorce Child on plan turns 26 Household Income Someone gets a new job Someone loses a job Someone gets raise Household Location Household moves into a new home \u2014this is particularly important to report when moving out -of-state or to a different part of the state, as many QHPs offer local or regional coverage that may have a broad provider network, but is available to residents of a limited service area. If a consumer moves, the consumer may need to select a new QHP; and if the consumer moves out -of-state, the consumer may need to re -apply for coverage on that state's Marketplace . Citizenship or Immigration Status Someone becomes a United States citizen , national or legal resident Health Coverage Someone in your household getting an offer of job -based coverage, even if they do not enroll in it Someone in your household getting coverage from a public program like Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare, or HIP 2.0 Someone in your household losing coverage, like job -based coverage or Medicaid Source: HealthCare.gov, Which changes to report , www.healthcare.gov/reporting -changes/which -changes -to- report Periodically, the FFM and the state of Indiana will run eligibility checks using databases to determine if consume r circumstances have changed and if the y are still eligible for QHPs, PTCs, CSRs, and/or Indiana Health Coverage Programs . However, Indiana Navigators should encourage consumers to notify the FFM Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 253 of 291 and/or state Division of Family Resources ( DFR) as soon as c ircumstances change. Timely communication of changes helps to avoid future problems with coverage. More information on reporting changes to the FFM is available online at www.healthcare.gov/reporting - changes/which -changes -to-report . d. Eligibility Redeterminations Both the state and the FFM will check at least once a year to ensure consumers are still enrolled in the appropriate program for their income level, household s ize, residence, and citizenship . A consumer with coverage on the FFM may authorize the FFM to access the consumer's tax information to automatically assess eligibility for PTC and cost-sharing reductions . Allowing access to this information reduces the chances the FFM will need additional information from the consumer to make an eligibility redetermination. If the state or the FFM can find enough data electronically to assess continued eligibili ty for enrollment in an IHCP, QHP, or insurance affordability programs, they will renew coverage with minimal response required from the consumer. In some cases, it may be that the consumer only needs to respond to an eligibility determination if the consumer wishes to challenge a decision or m ake a change. As was the case with other appeals, the consumer will need to be aware of any deadlines and act in accordance with the instructions on the noti ce to make any needed changes . If the state or the FFM is unable to find enough information electr onically to make a continued eligibility reassessment, the consumer will be contac ted to provide the needed data.Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual IV. Helping Consumer Apply for Heal th Coverage IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 254 of 291 Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual Glossary IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 255 of 291 Glossary 1115 (c) Waiver is a vehicle by which the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) may waiv e certain Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) regulations, allowing a state to test new or existing ways to deliver and pay for healthcare services under these two programs. In Indiana, the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) 2.0 operates under an 1115 (c) waiver. 1634 Status is a federal designation given to states for determining Medicaid eligibility for the aged, blind, and disabled populations. Under this program, recipients o f Supplemental Security Income (SSI) through the federal Social Security Administration (SSA) obtain automatic Medicaid enrollment and need not complete a separate state Medicaid application. Indiana became a 1634 Status state in 2013. Actuarial Value (AV) is the average percentage of allowed medical cost expected to be paid by a health plan over all covered enrollees . All health plans of fered on and off of the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) in the individual and small group markets are required t o meet certain AV standards that are to be displayed to consumer s. In general, plans with higher AV s will have higher premiums and lower cost sharing . Adverse Selection is when individual s wait until they become sick or need health care services to enroll in a plan. Off-marketplace plans can restrict purchase of plans to the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) open enrollment periods , which gives the plans the abili ty to limit adverse s election. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated health plan's ability to screen for health status and exclude preexisting c onditions prior to enrollment. Affordable Care Act (ACA) (also known as Patient Protection and Af fordable Care Act (PPACA) or Obamacare ) is a federal statute that was signed into law ( Public Law 111 -148) by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010 and later amended by the federal Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ( Public Law 111 -152). The law provides fun damental reforms to the United States healthcare and health insurance systems, including the establishment of health insurance Marketplaces and federal consumer assistance programs (such as federal Navigator s, CACs, and non -Navigator Assistance Personnel). Agency (see Producer ) Agent (see Producer ) Aid C ategory (see Eligibility Group ) Administrative Action (also known as Enforcement Action ) refers to a disciplinary action the Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) may take against a certified Indiana Navigator or registered Application Organization (AO) for violation of Indiana laws or regulations pertaining to Indiana Nav igators and Application Organizations. An administrative action may include any of the following, or a combination of the following: (a) reprimand; (b) civil penalty; (c) probation; (d) suspension; (e) revocation; (f) permanent revocation; or (g) a cease a nd desist order. Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual Glossary IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 256 of 291 Appeal is a consumer's right to request an evaluation and re -determination of the consumer's health plan eligibility or features.

Broker (see Producer ) Bronze Plan is a type of qualified health plan (QHP) offered to consumers on a marketplace. It is designed so that an insurance carrier will pay 60% of covered healthcare expenses with the remaining 40% to be paid by the consumer. The consumer' s expenses will be in the form of out -of-pocket fees over and above the cost of the plan's monthly premium (which is the lowest of the three QHPs/Metal Plans offered in Indiana). Out -of-pocket expenses in 201 7 are capped at $ 7,150 for individual plans and $14,300 for family plans. Carrier (see Insurer ) Catastrophic Plan is a health pl an available on and off the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) for individuals who are under the age or 30 or who received an exemption from the Individual Mandate to maintain minimum essential coverage (MEC). It is exempt from actuarial value (AV) re quirements. The individual is responsible for most healthcare costs until deductible/out -of-pocket maximum is met. It qualifies as MEC for the Individual Mandate, and the individual is not eligible for premium tax credits (PTCs) or cost -sharing reductions (CSRs). Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers Medicare , works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid and the Children 's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and oversees the federal Marketplace/ healthcare.gov .

Individuals that experience a change in circumstances during the year that impacts their eligibility in the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) or a state insurance affordability program may experience churn to another health coverage program for thems elves or their dependents. COBRA Insurance (also known as Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ) is a type of temporary health insurance coverage authorized under federal law (COBRA) that may allow an individual to elect to keep the individual's insurance coverage if the individual's employment ends, the individual loses coverage as a dependent of the covered employee, or another qualifying event occurs. If an individual elects COBRA coverage, the individual pays 100% of t he premiums, including the share the employer used to pay, plus a small administrative fee. Coinsurance is a consumer's share/percentage of the cost of a healthcare service, paid in addition to the deductible amount. For examp le, after the consumer has met the deductible amount the consumer's coinsurance may be 20% ( i.e., \"80/20\" - health plan pays 80% and consumer pays 20%) of healthcare costs up until the consumer reached the out -of-pocket maximum. Common -Law Employee (or Employee ) is an individual who the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would consider an employee based on the degree of control an em ployer has over the individual and the overall relationship between th e employer and the individual.

The ACA requires plans and issuers that offer dependent coverage to make the coverage available until a child reaches 26 years old . Both married and unmarr ied chil dren qualify for this coverage. This rule applies to all plans in the individual market and to new employer plans. It also applies to existing employer plans unless the adult child has another offer of employer -based cover age (such as through the a dult child's job). Children up to age 26 may stay on their parent's employer plan even if they have another offer of coverage through an employer.

Works members pay premiums based on their income and receive full Medicaid benefits. Metal Level (see Metal Tier ) Metal Plan (see Metal Tier ) Metal Tier (also referred to as Health Plan Category , Metal Level , or Metal Plan ) refers to any of the four categories of health plans offered in a marketplace ( i.e., Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum). The plans are categorized based on the percentage the plans pay of the average overall cost of providing essential health benefits (EHBs) to consumers. The plan a consumer chooses affects the total amount the consumer will likely spend for EHBs during the year. The percentages the plans will spend, on average, are 60% (Bronze), 70% (Silver), 80% (Gold), and 90% (Platinum). Miller Trust (also referred to as Qualified Income Trust (QIT) ) is a legal arrangement for holding funds that allows an individual with income that exceeds 300 percent of the federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit rate (also known as the Special Inc ome Limit ) to become eligible for Medicaid coverage of institutional or home and community -based services. Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) is a type of health insurance coverage that an in dividual and the individual's dependents must have to meet the Individual Mandate under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) . The list of MEC types (see Table 50) is determined by the federal government and is subject to change. Types of coverage not currently considered ME C may apply for recognition as minimum essential coverage. Individuals m ay receive an exemption fr om the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage. Minimum Value (MV) is the lo west threshold for the value of a health plan under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A plan with MV should cover, on average, at least 60% of the medical c osts of a standard population. Individuals offered employer -sponsored coverage that provides MV and that's affordable are not eligible for a premium tax credit (PTC). Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual Glossary IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 271 of 291 Modified Adjusted Gro ss Income (MAGI) is an eligibility methodology for ins urance affordability programs. MAGI equals adjusted gross income (AGI) plus tax excluded foreign earned income, tax exempt interest and tax exempt Ti tle II Social Security income. MAGI methodologies are appli ed to individuals applying for premium tax c redits (PTCs) and in the Medicaid program to children, pregnant women, parent and caretaker relatives and adults. Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Conversion refers to states ' requirements to convert current Medicaid income eligibility standards to a MAGI equivalent as part of the transition to MAGI -based methodologies in 2014 . The goal of the MAGI conversion process is to establish a MAGI -based income standard that is n ot less than the effective income eligibility standard as applied on the date of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA) enactment for each eligibility group. Navigator Assessment (see Navigator Examination ) Navigator Continuing Education (CE) (also referred to Continuing Education (CE) ) is education and training programs approved by the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) that may be completed by certified Indiana Navigators to satisfy their yearly Navi gator CE requirement.

Out-of-Network Provider is a healthcare provider that is not contract ed with a particular insurer to provide healthcare/medical services at a discounted rate for con sumers covered by the insurer. Some out-of-network providers may not accept an individual's health insurance, and paym ent may be requested up front. For provide rs that do not accept an individual's health insurance, an individual may submit a form directly to their insurer showing what they paid for the service. If this form is submitted, the amount the enrollee spent for covered services will count toward the pl an deductible and out -of- pocket maximum, and if the enrollee has met the deductible the i nsurer may issue compensation. To determine whether a provider is in -network or out -of-network with a n insurer , a list of in -network providers can be accessed through the health insurer's website or by calling the health insurers consumer help desk. Out-of-Pocket Limit (see Out-of-Pocket Maximum ) Out-of-Pocket Maximum (also known as Out-of-Pocket Limit ) is the greatest amount that a consumer pays for healthcare services in any plan year before the insurance carrier pays 100% of healthcare costs. This limit never includes premiums paid or healthcare services not covered by the policy. Out-of-pocket maximum is set by the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For 201 7, this maximum amount is $ 7,150 for an individual and $1 4,300 for a family. Partnership Exchange (see Partnership Marketplace ) Partnership Marketplace (also referred to as Partnership Exchange ) is a mix between the Federally - facilitated Marketplace (FFM, or Federal Marketplace) and a State -based Marketplace , which allows a state to assume primary responsibility for certain functi ons of the Federal Marketplace permanently or Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual Glossary IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 274 of 291 as the state work s toward operating a State -based Marketplace . These functions may include, for example, plan management and/ or consumer assistance and outreach . Indiana does not follow this marketplace model, but rather operates as a Federal Marketplace at healthcare.gov . Pathway to Coverage is a phrase used to describe the four different plan options under the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0). The four HIP 2.0 pathways to coverage include HIP Plus, HIP Basic, HIP Employer Link, and HIP State Plan. See Table 17 showing a comparison of these differen t HIP 2.0 pathways to coverage. Patient Protection and A ffordable Care Act (PPACA) (see Affordable Care Act (ACA) for Inmates Presumptive Pregnant Women (PEPW) (see Presumptive Eligibility (PE)) Pediatric refers to children under the age of nineteen.

Personal Wellness and Responsibility Account (see POWER Account ) Platinum Plan is a type of qualified health plan (QHP) offered to consumers on a marketplace. It is designed so that the insurance carrier will pay 9 0% of covered healthca re expenses with the remaining 10% to be paid by consumers. The consumer' s expenses will be in the form of out -of-pocket fees over and above the cost of the plan's monthly premium (which is the highest of the four QHPs/metal tiers). Out-of-pocket exp enses in 201 7 are capped at $ 7,150 for individual plans and $1 4,300 for family plans. Policy Year is either: (1) the 12 -month period that is designated as the policy year in the policy documents of a grandfathered health plan offered in the indi vidual health insurance market. If there is Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual Glossary IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 275 of 291 no designation of a policy year in the policy document (or no such policy document is available), then the policy year is the deductible or limit year used under the coverage. If deductibles or other limits are not imposed on a yearly basis, the policy year is the calendar year. Or (2) A calendar year for a non - grandfathered health plan offered in the individual health insurance market, or in a market in which the state has merged the individual and small group ri sk pools. POWER Account (also referred to as Personal Wellness and Responsibility Account ) is an account used to pay medical costs for HIP 2.0 members.

Expenses for additional health services over $2,500 are fully covered at no additional cost to the member (except in the HIP Basic program where the member is responsible for any required copayments). Contributions to the account are made by the state of Indiana and each member. Monthly POWER account contributions by members are determined by income and family size and are approximately two percent of annual family income. Pre-Existing Condition is a health issue (such as cancer, diabetes, asthma, etc.) that an individual has prior to obtaining health insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as of January 1, 2014 health insurance issuers can no longer deny someone coverage, offer less cove rage, or charge more for coverage based on a pre -existing condition. The pre -existing conditions rule does not apply to \"grandfathered\" health plans. Precertification Education (PE) (see Navigator Precertification Education (PE) ) Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) is a type of health plan that contract s with certain providers (referred to as in \"network providers \"). Individuals may choose to receive service from among the network provider s or may choose to go to an out -of-network provider and in general be subject to greater cost sharing. Preliminary Eligibility Screening is a technique that Indiana Navigators may use to evaluate whether a consumer would be better suit ed to apply for an Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) or for health coverage through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) before assisting with a health coverage application. The Indiana Navigator may ask basic questions about United States citi zenship/legal residen t status, household income, household composition, and refer to the eligibility screening charts (see Table 73, Table 74, and Table 75), in order to better dire ct the consumer to the type of coverage for which the consumer is most likely eligible. Premium is the amount that a consumer must periodically pay to the insurance carrier for a health insurance plan. Individuals pay the premium regardless of whether or not they use the health insurance. It is meant to compensate the insurer for bearing the risk of a payout should the insurance agreement's coverage be required. Premiums are usually paid on a monthly basis, but may be quarterly or yearly. Premium Rating Factors (see Rating Factors ) Premium Tax Credit (PTC) (also referred to as Subsidy ) is a tax credit that lowers premium costs for certain eligible individuals to help them afford hea lth coverage purchased through a marketplace. An individual may apply for a PTC through the Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM), and the FFM determines the individual 's PTC eli gibility and maximum PTC amount. To be eligible for a PTC on the FFM operati ng in Indiana, an individual must: (1) be a U.S. citizen, national or legal resident of the U.S.; (2) be Indiana Navigator Training Resource Manual Glossary IDOI Version 3.0 (January 2017) Page 276 of 291 an Indiana resident; (3) be non -incarcerated; (4) have a household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL); and (5) have no oth er minimum essential coverage (MEC) or an available MEC with a premium more than 9.66 % of household income or that does not provide minimum value (MV) (at least 60% actuarial value (AV)). A PTC can be either claimed retroactively when the consumer's taxes are filed or may be paid in advance directly to the heal th insurer to reduce premiums (this advanced PTC is referred to as an Advanced Premium Tax Credit or APTC ). Presumptive Eligibility (PE) (also referred to or PE for Inmates ) is a determination by a qualified provider (QP) that an individual is eligible for Medicaid benefits on the basis of prelim inary self -declared information that the individual has gross income at or below the applicable Medicai d income eligibility standard. Indiana operates the following PE programs: Presumptive Eligibility (PE), (HPE), and PE for Inmates . See Table 27 showing the compari sons between these programs . Presumptive Eligibility (PE) Qualified Entity (see Qualified Provider (QP) ) Primary Medical Provider (PMP) is a healthcare provider selected or assigned to a beneficiary of a managed care entity (MCE) ( i.e., Hoosier Healthwise (HHW) or Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP 2.0)). Once a beneficiary is enrolled in a MCE, the beneficiary then selects a PMP or, if one is not selected within 30 days, the MCE will assign a PMP to the enrollee. Enrollees must see their PMP for all medical care; if specialty services are required the PMP will provide a referral. The PMP receives a monthly administration fee for each member active ly assigned to the PMP. Other services are reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. Prior Authorization (PA) is a process under which the medical necessity of a requested service is reviewed . This is required for certain covered services to document the medical necessity for those services. To determine whether a procedure code requires PA for members in the fee -for-service (FFS) delivery system, members should access the Indiana Health Coverage Programs (IHCP) provider Fee Schedule . To determine whether a procedure code requires PA for members enrolled in managed care programs, members should contact the managed care entity (MCE) with which the member is enrolled.

Qualified Income Trust (QIT) (see Miller Trust ) Qualified Provider (QP) (also referred to as Presumptive Eligibility (PE) Qualified Entity ) is an entity that is determined by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) to be capable of making determinati ons of presumptive eligib ility (PE) and meets all the qualifications established by the state. See Table 27 showing the different types of QPs under each PE program. Rate Review is the process by which a state ins urance depar tment may review and approve, deny , or negotiate health insurance premiums offered by insur ers on or off a marketplace. Under its authority granted by the Indiana Code and federal Effective Rate Review Status , the Indiana Department of Insurance (IDOI) reviews and approves/denies /negotiates premiums for all health insurance policies sold to Hoosiers. Rating Factors (also referred to as Premium Rating Factors ) are the information insurance companies use to decide what premium to cha rge any particular individual. Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the premium cost for major medical plans could vary based on health status, gender, age, weight, tobacco or alcohol us e, location, or other factors. Beginning in 2014, the ACA limits the allowable rating factors to a ge, location, and tobacco use. These plans may no longer charge different rates bas ed on gender or health status. Re-Enrollment is the annual process by which co nsumers are redetermined eligible for Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) or Federally -facilitated Marketplace (FFM) coverage and the steps consumers must take to re -enroll in coverage.
