From the late 1800s, when the Department developed sanitation programs to im prove living conditions in tenement neighborhoods, to the early 1900s, when public health physicians were dispatched door-to-door in poor areas of the City, to the 1990s, when new programs were developed to fight tuberculosis andHIV/AIDS, the Health Department has recognized that social and economic factors are inextricably linked to health. While great gains have occurred in improving overall health and reducing health disparities, the persistence of racial, ethnic, economic, or other social inequalities in health is unacceptable. Eliminating health inequalities m ust involve investment on four fronts: improving access to and the quality of preventive health care, promoting healthy life choices,creating social and physical environments supportive of healthy living, and reducing the burden of poverty and other social disadvantage. Reaching these goals requires a broad and detailed understanding of which groups are most vulnerable, the patterns of illnesses and risk factors among these groups, and how disparities change over time. We hope thisreport is useful to all our partners in this effort. Thomas R. Frieden, MD, MPH CommissionerNew York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Adam M. Karpati, MD, MPH Division of Epidemiology Key Findings in This Report GMuch progress has been made in reducing health disparities in New York City, but substantial inequalities remain among New Yorkers of different economic and racial/ethnic groups. GPoor New Yorkers, as well as African-American and Hispanic New Yorkers, bear a disproportionate burden of illness and premature death. IThe poorest New Yorkers are 4 times more likely to report poor overall health than the wealthiest. IThe rate of new HIV diagnoses is about 6 times as high among Blacks as among Whites. IHispanic New Yorkers are more than twice as likely to have diabetes as White New Yorkers. IDisparities in diabetes are widening: From 1999-2001, Black New Yorkers were about 3 times as likely to die from diabetes as White New Yorkers. GPoor health is concentrated in certain New York City neighborhoods. IIn 2001, the life expectancy in New York City's poorest neighborhoods was 8 years shorter than in its wealthiest neighborhoods. IIf the all-cause mortality rate in the wealthiest neighborhoods existed in the poorest neighborhoods, more than 4,000 deaths could be prevented each year. GFactors associated with poor health, such as poor access to medical care, unhealthy behaviors, and poor living conditions, are more common among certain economic and racial/ethnic groups. IIn every racial/ethnic group, poor New Yorkers are the most likely to not have received needed medical care in the past year. IWealthy New Yorkers are about twice as likely to exercise as poor New Yorkers. I94% of elevated blood lead cases in children in New York City are among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. GEliminating health disparities in New York City would save thousands of lives each year.1 HHeeaalltthh DDiissppaarriittiieess iinn NNeeww YYoorrkk CCiittyyOverview Although there have been great advances in the health of New Yorkers and the U.S. population over the past cen-tury, not all groups have benefited equally. Differences inpeople's health may be caused by many factors, but whendifferences reflect social inequalities, they are referred toas health disparities and are of particular concern to the public health community and society as a whole. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and The Commonwealth Fund are committed toeliminating health disparities. This commitment supportsa larger national movement, articulated in the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services' HealthyPeople 2010 objectives. These objectives have two over-arching goals: \"to improve health for society as a whole,and to eliminate health disparities among segments ofthe population, including differences that occur bygender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability,geographic location or sexual orientation.\" In this report, we focus on race/ethnicity and income as ways to analyze health data and identify disparities.These categories often overlap, but each has importantimplications to understanding and finding ways to elimi-nate health disparities. For example, Black and HispanicNew Yorkers are generally poorer than White NewYorkers. As a result, racial/ethnic comparisons are usuallya comparison of a poorer to a wealthier group. For somehealth outcomes, when income is taken into account,apparent racial/ethnic differences fall away. This meansthat, in each income category, Whites face similar healthconditions to their Black and Hispanic counterparts. Forother indicators, however, the racial/ethnic gaps persistin ways not accounted for by income alone. This meansthat race and ethnicity influence health in ways notmeasured by income. Overall, the neighborhoods thatexperience the highest disease burdens are populatedmainly by people who are Black, Hispanic, and poor. This report is not intended to definitively explain the com- plex mechanisms through which poverty and race/ethnicityinfluence health and produce health disparities. But thereport does highlight some factors that are important inunderstanding why illness is more common in poor, African-Introduction American, and Hispanic communities: unequal access tohealth care, different balances of healthy and unhealthybehaviors, and varying social and environmental conditions. In This Report To understand health disparities between economic andracial/ethnic groups in New York City, it is helpful tounderstand the economic and racial/ethnic diversity ofCity residents. So, we begin the report with a social anddemographic description of the City. Then, we examinehealth disparities across a wide range of topics, such aslife expectancy, leading causes of death, mental illnessand substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, obesity and diabetes,asthma, and maternal/infant health. Finally, we exploresome of the social and physical conditions that influencehealth and health disparities. This report could not include discussions of all types of health disparities. Inequalities in health exist amongmany groups, including those defined by gender, immigra-tion status, and other social and cultural factors. Each ofthese disparities merits its own detailed exploration. Inaddition, racial/ethnic disparities as described in thisreport are lim ited to major subgroups \u2014 non-Hispanic Black or African American, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic \u2014 with populations largeenough to permit meaningful statistical comparisons. Forsome health indicators, values for the Asian populationare not shown because conclusions could not be drawnfrom relatively small populations. Only statistically signi-ficant, robust findings are discussed in the text. Morefocused attention to smaller populations will be animportant next step towards a complete understandingof health disparities in New York City. 2 HHeeaalltthh DDiissppaarriittiieess iinn NNeeww YYoorrkk CCiittyyPoverty and health. Being poor affects health in many ways. Poverty makes it difficult to find and maintain high-quality medical care. Finding and taking advantage of opportunities for physical activity and good nutrition are harder in poor neighborhoods. Low-quality housing also exposes poor New Yorkers to environmental health risks, such as lead paint. And, low-paying jobs, unavailability of child care, and fear of crime make it difficult to maintain a safe, healthy home. All of the se aspects of being poor in New York City contribute to stress and anxiety, which, in addition to being bad for people's health, al so can lead to unhealthy habits like smoking and drug and alcohol use. The relationship between poverty and health, however, is atwo-way street. Poor health makes it difficult for people to achieve high education levels and to obtain and keep well-paying j obs, which, in turn, can lead to poverty. Health care costs can also directly contribute to income levels.Income and Race/Ethnicity in New York City Income and Poverty New York City residents are, on average, poorer than the nationalpopulation. According to the 2000Census, 21% of New York City residentslive below the poverty line, an increasefrom 19% in the 1990 Census. Incontrast, 12% of the U.S. populationlive in poverty. More than one third ofNew York City households had anincome less than $25,000 in 1999.How is poverty measured? The U.S. Census defines poverty using a \"set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition . . . If a family's totalincome is less than that family's threshold, then that family, and every individual init, is considered poor.\" This threshold is known as the \"poverty line.\" (For moreinformation on how the U.S. government defines poverty, visit www.census.gov/hhes/poverty/povdef.html.) In contrast, household income measures the amount of money earned in a household in a given year, and does not account for how many people are in thehousehold. Though imperfect, considered together, these measures provide a pictureof how well the needs of individuals and families are being met. 1221 19 0510152025New Yorkers are nearly twice as likely as other Americans to be living in poverty Source: U.S. Census 2000 / NYC Department of City PlanningNYC 1989 NYC 1999 U.S. 1999Percent living in povertyMore than one third of New York City households had an income less than $25,000 in 1999 Source: U.S. Census 2000 / NYC Department of City Planning35% average median household income in New York City's poorest neighborhoods was $23,000 in1999. The poorest neighborhoods in New York City are in the South Bronx,East and Central Harlem, and Northand Central Brooklyn, where morethan 1 in 3 residents live in poverty.In the poorest neighborhoods, more than 1 in 3 residents live in poverty What makes a neighborhood healthy? The neighborhood in which people live can have important effects on health. Healthy neighborhoods are those with civic resources such as libraries and parks, easy access to high-quality medical care, adequate an d high-quality housing, and strong community connectedness. A healthy neighborhood also feels safe and has places to exerciseand purchase healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables.5% - 12% Census 2000/NYC Department of City PlanningIncome is not distributed equally among New York City residents \u2014a large amount of total earnedincome is enjoyed by relatively fewpeople.

Although certain racial/ethnic groups are poorer than others, economics alone does not account for the racial and ethnic disparities found in health. Historically, explanations for such disparities focused on biological differences. Diseases that have a clear genetic component, however, account for only a tiny part of racial disparities in healt h. One way that race/ethnicity can influence health is through discrimination. Discrimination can result in stress and psychologic al trauma, leading to poor physical and mental health. Discrimination can also limit access to the quantity and quality of important servi ces, includ- ing health care, housing, and recreational facilities. (For more information please see the Institute of Medicine report, \"Uneq ual T reatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health Care,\" available at www.iom.edu/report.) Beyond discrimination, culture and tradition also can affect health. These norms can affect behavioral choices, such as smoking or sexual practices, which, in turn, can greatly influence health.New York City is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse citiesin the U.S. In 2000, 2,800,000New Yorkers were White, 1,960,000were Black, 2,160,000 wereHispanic, and 780,000 were Asian;230,000 non-Hispanic peopleidentified themselves as belongingto 2 or more races.New York City is racially and ethnically diverse Source: U.S. Census 2000 / NYC Department of City PlanningWhite 35%Other races < 1%2 or more races Asian 10% Hispanic 27% Black 25%3% Household IncomeEconomics and race: a complex story in New York City Source: U.S. Census 2000, PUMS File/NYC Department of City out of every 3 New Yo rkers were born outside the United S tates, compared to 11% of residents nation- wide. New York City has a broad mix of immigrants. HalfMeasuring race and ethnicity. Racial/ethnic categories are socially, not biologically, determined. Because genetics cannot distin- guish among racial/ethnic groups, there is no scientific way to measure these categories. While race is generally identified by physical characteristics (such as skin color), ethnicity refers to cultural identities. In the past, surveys such as the Census required individuals to choose only one answer to the question of race. As a result, individuals often had to choose between two categories with whi ch they identified (such as Black and White). As of 2000, however, the Census allowed people to indicate more than one race. of New Yorkers who are foreign-born are from Latin America, but a greater proportion of Asians in New York City areforeign-born than any other racial/ethnic group.Immigration 76 7144 2124 2956 020406080100Most foreign-born New Yorkers are from Latin America Source: U.S. Census 2000 / NYC Department of City PlanningAlmost 4 out of 5 Asian New Yorkers were born outside the U.S. Source: U.S.Census 2000, PUMS File/ NYC Department of City PlanningPercent of population White Black Hispanic AsianU.S. Born Foreign BornPercent of NYC foreign-born populationImmigration Status expectancy in New York City's poorestneighborhoods was 8 yearsshorter than in itswealthiest neighborhoods. 85 80757065605550 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Very low LowModerateHighLife expectancy varies with neighborhood income in New York City Sources: Bureau of Vital Statistics, NYC DOHMH, 1990-2001; U.S. Census 1990 and 2000/NYC Department of City PlanningLife expectancy at birth (years)General Health Life Expectancy Life expectancy \u2014 the average age to which a newborn is expected to live \u2014 is a fundamental measure of acommunity's health. In New York City, life expectancyincreased in every neighborhood income group from1990-2001.

Among New Yorkers,Black males, on average, live 6 years less than Whitemales, compared to a 7-year disparity nationwide. For A closer look at Hispanic life expectancy It is important to understand that differences within racial/ethnic communities also exist. In New York City's Hispanic communities, for example, great disparities female New Yorkers, the difference is 3 years, compared to a 5-year disparity nationwide. This is an improvementfrom 1990, when, for example, Black m ale New Yorkers lived 10 fewer years than White males. exist between Puerto Rican and other Hispanic groups.

For example, deaths due to AIDS andassault/homicide are 6 times higher in the poorestneighborhoods. For conditions such as liver disease,diabetes, and high blood pressure, the disparity is 3-foldor higher. Only suicide is more common in wealthiercommunities.

One way of measuring \"premature\" death is to calculatethe difference between 75 years and the age that aperson dies; this is known as \"Years of Potential LifeLost.\" The rate of premature death is more than twice as high in poor neighborhoods than in wealthy neigh-borhoods. And, even among those who die prematurely,people in poorer neighborhoods die younger: For everypremature death, 5 more years of life are lost in poorneighborhoods than in wealthy neighbor hoods.

Again, similar patterns areseen between colon cancer deathsand neighborhood income level.Rates of colon cancer mortality arehigher among those living in low-income areas compared withhigh-income areas at youngerages, but those differences aresmaller at older ages.

Moreover, conditions that influencehealth, such as access to health care and quality of housing, are related to these factors as well. Regardless ofthe exact mechanisms through which poverty andrace/ethnicity affect health, the disparities are striking.The key question, then, is: How can individual New Yorkers,health care providers, comm unity organizations, advo- cacy groups, and government agencies use this informationto improve health and reduce disparities? There are no easy answers to this question. Acknowledging that social conditions profoundly affecthealth forces us to also acknowledge that the challengeof reducing disparities is daunting. Nevertheless, in manyways, the information in this report can be used to moveus closer to the goal affected by more than genetics and medical care. Education, housing, parks,employment, welfare, social equity, and economicdevelopment are all important for health, and healthdisparities cannot be addressed successfully withoutprogress in, and collaboration across, these fields. Asthe Healthy People 2010 guidelines state: \". . . com-munities, States and national organizations will needto take a multidisciplinary approach to achievinghealth equity \u2014 an approach that involves improvinghealth, education, housing, labor, justice, transporta-tion, agriculture, and the environment, as well on improved social and economic conditions to reduce health disparities is unrealistic. Programs andservices aimed directly at particular health problemscan be highly effective and are absolutely necessary.Not only can addressing specific issues (e.g., HIV,diabetes, drug use, depression, and smoking) improvehealth conditions, but effective health and mentalhealth interventions can also help reduce poverty andimprove community resilience. Toward this end, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has established TTaakkee CCaarree NNeeww YYoorrkk, a strategy of 10 key health ventions. The 10 components of TTaakkee CCaarree NNeeww YYoorrkkaddress the City's leading preventable causes of illness and death and can significantly improve NewYorkers' health. Most of the areas highlighted in thisstrategy have been described in this report, but evenfor conditions not included in this document, sub-stantial economic and racial/ethnic disparities exist.The 10 areas are: have a regular doctor or other health care provider, be tobacco-free, keep yourheart healthy (control blood pressure, cholesterol,and weight), know your HIV status, get help fordepression, live free of dependence on alcohol anddrugs, get checked for cancer, get the immun izations you need, make your home safe and healthy, andhave a healthy baby. Progress in the specific areas identified by TTaakkee CCaarree NNeeww YYoorrkk, coupled with initiatives to address root causes of poor health, would be the most effec- tive way to improve health and this report, certain communities consistently have poor health outcomes and would benefit most fromtargeted efforts to improve health and well-being.25 HHeeaalltthh DDiissppaarriittiieess iinn NNeeww YYoorrkk CCiittyyAppendix A Comparisons Between New York City and National Data: Selected Conditions Table 2: Income disparities < $25,000 *For U.S. population, the percentages were averaged across smaller income categories.

All other mortality data only include deaths that occurred within NYC. How neighborhoods and neighborhood income were defined and calculated Neighborhoods were generally defined by NYC's 59 Community Districts, which are political boundaries based on groupings ofcensus tracts. When Community District level data were not available for any variable in an analysis (such as hospitalization or HIV diagnoses data), neighborhoods were defined with the United Hospital Fund's 42 zip code aggregations. To calculateneighborhood income level, the neighborhoods were ranked by median household income and then divided into 4 groups,ranging from poorest to wealthiest. Roughly 25% of the NYC population falls into each neighborhood income group. Preventive health questions Mammogram: Survey respondents were asked: Have you ever had a mammogram?
