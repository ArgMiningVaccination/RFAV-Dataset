Based on recent data (2018), suicide is a top 10 leading cause of death in Indiana for people aged 10 -64 years and is the 11th overall le ading cause of death for all ages.1 While each suicide death or attempt is different , there are ways to address the multiple factors involved. Suicide prevention efforts must utilize different strategies, require a wide range of partners, coordinate commun ity response language, and draw on a diverse set of resources and tools. This toolkit is aimed to help address the need for practical, and when possible, Indiana -specific tools for various sectors/professionals . The first portion of this document details new suicide trends based on 2018 data , and the second portion of the document includes best practice tools for the following groups: healthcare, first responders, government, stakeholder groups, justice, employers, faith -based, media, coroners, family , education , and populations of special consideration . This toolkit was developed in partnership by the Suicide Learning Collaborative, a multi - disciplinary working group addressing suicide in Indiana, and the Indiana Department of Health's Fatality Review and Prevention Division. Throughout the development process, members of the Collaborative were ask ed to supply relevant tools to their topical area as well as provide feedback on proposed tools. The hope for this document is that professionals from these various subgroups can utilize these tools in their work. While none of these sections are fully c omprehensive for suicide prevention, there are many toolkits that specialize in just one of these topics. This toolkit serves as a simplified, action -oriented version of the other toolkits. The tools highlighted in this toolkit are primarily based off existing national toolkits and best practice guides. We do recommend professionals read through other profession -specific toolkits referenced for further context and detail. 3 Data Suicide is the most preventable cause of death and yet it continues to be a tragic, frustratingly neglected issue for Indiana. According to the CDC Web -based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), the average 1 -year rate of suicide in the US overall between 2015 and 2018 was 14.25 per 100,000 people. The suicide rate in Indiana was slightly higher, at 15.66 per 100,000 people . Likewise , suicide has continued to surpass both motor vehicle -related deaths and homicides, per the graph below. Suicides occurred at twice the rate of homicides. In Indiana , based on 2018 data, suicide is the 11th leading cause of death among all age groups.1 Death due to suicide is most prevalent among individuals ages 10 to 54 years , for whom suicide ranks in the top 5 causes of death. According to IDOH Vital Records data, between 2015 and 2018 there were 4,177 deaths by suicide in Indiana. This equates to around 3 deaths a day in the state of Indiana alone. 2001 2006 2011 2016Indiana has a consistently higher suicide rate when compared with the national rate.

Among individuals aged 10 to 54, for whom suicide ranks... 4 Means of deaths: There are multiple means used in death s due to suicide . Firearm related deaths account for the greatest share of suicide deaths in Indiana . This is followed by deaths due to hanging, strangula tion and suffocation, which account for another 27.4% of suicide deaths. Self-poisoning and intentional overdoses account for 11.4% of suicide deaths. Other means of intentional self -injury deaths are much less common but include intentional drowning, jumping from a high place, jumping before a moving object, and crashing a motor vehicle. Collectively, these other causes account for only 6.1% of suicide deaths in Indiana. Race: The prevalence and risk of suicide differs by race/ethnicity in Indiana. White, non -Hispanic people account for 90% of all suicide deaths in Indiana during 2015 -2018 . Black non -Hispanic people accounted for 6% of suicide deaths , followed by Hispanic (any race) with 3% . All other races account for 1% of suicide deaths. These percentages, however, must be looked at proportionally in comparison to the entire population. That is why, in the graph to the left, rates were used. Firearm related Hanging, strangulation, and suffocation Self- poisoning and intentional overdose OtherThe majority of suicide deaths in Indiana are firearm - related.

Commented [SC2]: Wording? 5 Education: One key demographic difference in suicide deaths in Indiana is individuals' education levels at the time of their death. From 2015 -2018, the data shows that 64% of individuals who died by suicide in the state of Indiana had a high school diploma or less. This is high when compared to the general population's percentage of 38.6%. Gender: Deaths due to suicide occurred much more frequently among males than females in Indiana. During 2015 -18, Indiana saw over four times as many male lives lost to suicide as female lives as shown in the graph to the left. This disparity between genders cannot be overlooked as it ha s significant influence on other trends. For example, national research has shown that more women atte mpt suicide, but more men die by suicide.18 One reason being that men use more lethal means.17 In Indiana, men are more likely to die by suicide through firearm -related self - injury or hanging, strangulation and suffocation self -injury deaths. This inform ation is reflected in the graph on the next page. This trend in men being more likely to utilize firearms is seen on a national level as well.17 <=8th grade9-12th gradeHigh school or GED gradSome college creditAssociate Bachelor Master Doctorate UnknownOf individuals who died by suicide in Indiana from 2015 -2018, 64% had a high school diploma or less .

IDOH, Vital Records, Count, 2015 -2018. 6 Age: Women who died by suicide were on average younger than men, with an average age of 43.5 years compared to 45.4 years among men. When broken down into age groups, 70% of suicide deaths in Indiana occurred between the ages of 25 and 64. Deaths within these age categories have significant impact s on the population as these ages are typically reflective of working -aged adults. Youth suicide rates have recently been increasing, with Indiana ranking in the top ten states for percentage increase in suicide death rates among persons aged 10 -24. The percentage increase rate from 2007 -2009 to 2016 -2018 was 59.2.20 In 2016 -2018, the suicide death rate for persons aged 10 -24 in Indiana was 12.1 per 100,000, falling above the U.S. ra te at 10.3.20 Firearm-related Hanging, strangulation, and suffocationSelf-poisoning and intentional overdoseOtherMales in Indiana had higher numbers of suicide deaths due to all means when compared to females.

Male Female 7 Marital status: Relationship troubles or changes in relationship status are thought to be major stressors in life . These stressors can factor into the circumstances behind deaths by suicide. In suicide deaths between 2015 -2018, at least 512 individuals (27%) were documented to have experienced interpersonal violence , and 127 individuals (5.4%) were documented to have a family relatio nship issue. The marital status of people at the time of their death can estimate this effect, though it does not measure how recent changes in marital status may have occurred. The different rates of suicide among marital groups differs between genders. Married Divorced Separated Widowed SingleMales in Indiana died by suicide at a higher rate than females in Indiana for all marital status types. While the rate of death by suicide was high among divorced men and women, the rate for widowed males and females had the widest gender gap. IDOH, Vital Married Divorced Separated Widowed SingleIndividuals who were married at the time of death had the lowest rate of death by suicide, compared to individuals who were divorced who died at a rate almost 3x as high. IDOH, Vital Records, Rate per 100,000, 2015 -2018. Male Female 8 Veteran status: Among adult deaths due to suicide in Indiana, 701 (21.2%) were noted as having ever been a part of the US Armed Forces. Using 5 -year Census estimates, the rate of suicide among veteran adults in Indiana was found to be significantly higher the non-veteran adult rate. Circumstances : The I DOH Division of Trauma and Injury investigates deaths due to injury, including those due to intentional self -injury. This information is all input into the Indiana Violent Death Reporting System (INVDRS) - a database run in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While data on circumstances is limited from the INVDRS, well - detailed reports provide some circumstantial information. For example, from 2015 -2018, 46.4% of cases where circumstances were available documented some type of ment al illness. The identified mental illnesses from that data are shown in the graph on the left. The most frequent diagnosis among individuals where circumstances were reported was depression or dysthymia. Firearm-related Hanging-related Overdose-related OtherWhen comparing veteran and civilian suicide death rates, veterans were more likely to have a firearm -related suicide. IDOH, Vital Records, Rate per 100,000, 2013 -2018. Of individuals who died by suicide with a documented mental health diagnosis, 75% were diagnosed with depression. IDOH, INVDRS, Count, 2015 -2018.

Veterans Civilians Other 9 5% Motor Vehicle 4% Natural Area 78% House/Apartment This type of investigation captures measures surrounding the circumstances of the death beyond the demographics listed on the death certificate. The circumstances to every question are not always available or known ; however, looking at what is kno wn can give a picture of common circumstantial trends. For example, in the same sample looked at previously (2015 -2018), it was found that at least 633 individuals who later died by suicide had a history of suicidal thoughts (27%), and at least 462 indiv iduals expressed suicidal intent (19.7%) . Though th ese statistics are not reflective of all suicide deaths in 2015 -2018, they help to illustrate some of the circumstances surrounding the death. 75%25%Of individuals who died by suicide in Indiana, the majority of cases did not include a suicide note .

As such, healthcare professionals should be prepared to treat a patient experiencing suicidal ideation or following a suicide attempt. Being prepared can simply mean screening every patient and having the policies and protocols in place to assist patients presenting with suicide risk. On an individual level , this can be having a protocol in place after a patient discloses they are experiencing suicidal ideation. On a population -level, this can mean evaluating the current hospital screening and discharge protocol. Data trends clear ly show the need for greater healthcare engagement. For example, after patients leave inpatient psychiatric care, their suicide death rate is 300 times higher in the first week and 200 times higher in the first month than that of the general population.2 The individual's suicide risk remains high for up to three months after discharge and , for some, their elevated risk persists longer.3-5 Additionally, a recent study found that individuals who presented in emergency departments (EDs) with deliberative self -harm had a suicide rate of 56.8 times higher than demographically similar individuals the year after their visit.19 Those with suicidal ideation had a 31.4 times higher rate.19 In fact, one out of seven people in the United States who died by suicide had contact with inpatient mental health services in the year before their death.6 Of individuals who later died by suicide , 46% had a mental health diagnosis and 90% had shown symptoms of a known mental health condition.7 Healthcare Resources : Warning Signs of Suicide Screening Tools Guide Safety Planning Guide Suicide Safety Planning Template Discharge Protocol After a Suicide Attempt: What Famil y Members Need to Know After a Suicide Attempt: What Family Members Need to Know o *Also included in the Family and First Respo nder sections of the toolkit Provider Self -Care Checklist Suicide Training: Healthcare (p. 20 5-208) 12 Warning Signs of Suicide Talking about wanting to die or to kill oneself Looking for a way to kill oneself Talking about feeling hopeless or having no purpose Talking about feeling trapped or being in unbearable pain Talking about being a burden to others Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs Acting anxious, agitated, or reckless Sleeping too little or too much Withdrawing or feeling iso lated Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge Displaying extreme mood swings If a patient is showing some or all of these signs, the provider should connect the patient with further care. This was adapted from SAVES's \"Warning Signs,\" which can be found 13 SCREENING TOOLS GUIDE There are several different screening tools that healthcare facilities can utilize to decide what course of action needs to be taken with a patient presenting with suicidal ideation or following a suicide attempt. Below is a guide of the tools that will be mentioned in the subsequent pages. Of course, this screening process may look different depending on the healthcare facility's admission process , and none of these tools should ever replace a provider's best judgment or experience. If providers are implementing a screening protocol in a clinical practice, it can be helpful to refer to tools such as the Suicide Prevention Resource Center's Suicide Prevention Toolkit for Primary Care Practices. http://www.sprc.org/sites/default/files/Final%20National%20Suicide%20Prevention%20Toolkit%202.15 .18%20FINAL.pdf . Type of Tool Used With Tells You Primary Screening Tool Every ED patient or patients with known risk factors Whether suicide risk is present or absent Secondary Screening Tool (Decision Support Tool) Patient with some suicide risk as identified through primary screening, patient disclosure, or other indicators Whether discharge following ED -based interve ntions may be appropriate or further assessment by a mental health specialist is needed to make a disposition determination Comprehensive Suicide Risk Assessment Patients with suicide risk who score positive (greater than or equal to 1) on the Decision Support Tool Note: If resources permit, a suicide risk assessment may be used with any patient with suicide risk. Information about a patient's risk and protective factors, immediate danger, and treatment needs This was adapted from SPRC's \"Caring for adult patients with suicide risk: A consensus guide for ED's,\" which can be found here: https://www.sprc.org/edguide page, found here: http://zerosuicide.edc.org/toolkit/identify . . 14 Primary Screening Tool Different healthcare entities use different types of primary screening tools . Sometimes, this can be explained by examining whether the organization itself will provide the comprehensive care after a patient is found to be at risk. Some initial primary screening tools organizations can use include: Patient Health Questionnaire (P HQ) Suicide Assessment Five -Step Evaluation and Triage (SAFE -T) Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) Ask Suicide -Screening Questions (ASQ) PatientSafety Screener (PSS -3) If organizations hare having difficulty choosing a primary scree ning tool, they can refer to: http://zerosuicide.edc.org/webinar/screening -and-assessment -suicide -health -care -settings . Secondary Screening Tool (Decision Support Tool ) The Decision Support Tool is a secondary screening instrument developed to help ED providers make decisions about the care of adult patients with suicide risk. It indicates whether a patient's health and safety needs may be met in the outpatient environment following a brief ED -based intervention or whethe r evaluation from a mental health specialist may be needed first. The tool is designed for use with adult patients who have been identified as having suicide risk and who have the capacity to make health care decisions. In the Decision Support Tool, the f ollowing questions are asked: Transition Question: Confirm Suicidal Ideation (not a part of scoring) o Have you had recent thoughts of killing yourself? o *Is there other evidence of suicidal ideation , such as reports from family or friends? Thoughts of carrying out a plan o Recently , have you been thinking how you might kill yourself? o *If yes, consider the immediate safety needs of the patient. Suicide intent o Do you have any intention of killing yourself? Past suicide attempt o Have you eve r tried to kill yourself? Significant mental health condition o Have you had treatment for mental health problems? o Do you have a mental health issue that affects your ability to do things in life? Substance use disorder o Have you had four or more (female) or five or more (male) drinks on one occasion in the past month , or have you used drugs or medication for non -medical reasons in the past month? o Has drinking or drug use been a problem for you? Irritability/Agitation/Aggression o Recently, hav e you been feeling very anxious or agitated? o Have you been having conflicts or getting into fights? o Is there direct evidence of irritability, agitation, or aggression? A quick guide of the Decision Support Tool can be found here: https://www.sprc.org/sites/default/files/EDGuide_quickversion.pdf . Commented [SC3]: Ever been? 15 Comprehensive Suicide Risk Assessment Mental health evaluations conducted during the ED visit should include a comprehensive suicide risk assessment that goes beyond the secondary screening . The purpose of the risk assessment is to determine whether the patient is in immediate danger and to make decisions about treatment. Three direct warning signs , listed below, predict the highest likelihood of suicide -related behaviors occurring in the future. Observing these warning signs warrants immediate attention, mental health evaluation, referral, or consideration of hospitalization to ensure the safety, stability and security of the individual. Communication with Signs of Suicidal Ideation - writing or talking about suicide, wish ing to die, or talking about death (threatening to hurt or kill self) or intention to act on those ideas . Patients should be directly asked if they have thoughts of suicide and to describe them. The evaluation of suicidal ideation should include the following: o Onset (When did it begin) o Duration (Acute, Chronic, Recurrent) o Intensity (Fleeting, Nagging, Intense) o Frequency (Rare, Intermittent, Daily, Unabating) o Active or passive nature of the ideation ('Wish I was dead' vs. 'Thinking of killing myself') o Whether the individual wishes to kill themselves or is thinking about or engaging in potentially dangerous behavior for some other reason (e.g., cutting oneself as a means of relieving emotional distress) o Lethality of the plan (No plan, Overdose, Hanging, Firearm) o Triggering events or stressors (Relationship, Illness, Loss) o What intensifies the thoughts and what distracts the thoughts? o Association with states of intoxication (Are episodes of ideation present or exacerbated only when individual is intoxicated? This does not make the m less serious; however , may provide a specific target for treatment) o Understanding regarding the consequences of future potential actions Preparations for Suicide - evidence or expression of suicide intent, and/or taking steps towards implementation of a plan, making arrangements to divest responsibility for dependent others (children, pets, elders), or making other preparations such as updating wills, making financial arrangements for paying bills, saying goodbye to loved ones, etc. Patients should be asked about the following: o The evaluation of intent to die should be characterized by: Intensity of the desire to die Intensity of determination to act Intensity of impulse to act or ability to resist the impulse to act o The eval uation of intent should be based on indication that the individual: Wishes to die Means to kill him/herself Understands the probable consequences of the actions or potential actions Has thought about a lethal plan, is able to engage that plan, and is likely to carry out the plan 16 Seeking Access or Recent Use of Lethal Means - such as weapons, medications, toxins, or other lethal means. Clinicians should evaluate preparatory behaviors by inquiring about: o Preparatory behavior like practicing a suicide plan. For example: Mentally walking through the attempt Walking to the bridge Handling the weapon Researching for methods on the internet o Thoughts about where they would do it and the likelihood of being found / interrupted? o Action to seek access to lethal means or explored the lethality of means. For example: Acquiring a firearm or ammunition Hoarding medication Purchasing a rope, blade, etc. Researching ways to kill oneself on the internet o Action taken or other steps in preparing to end one's life: Writing a will, suicide note Giving away possessi ons Reviewing life insurance policy o Obtain information from sources such as family members and medical records. Through out all these steps, keep in mind the following: Treat patients with suicide risk in the same manner you would treat those with other medical emergencies. Express care for his or her comfort and dignity, such as allowing a person to wear \"street clothes\" unless it is necessary to disrobe. Build rapport. This increases trust and may help patients share information more readily and honestly. Collaborate with the patient. Ask for his or her opinion. Attempt to engage patients in decision making even if they do not initially agree , and only make promises you can keep. Check in with the patient regularly to see how the ED visit is going. Provide information about what to expect during the visit and patient rights. When possible , maintain provider continuity for patients experiencing suicidal ideation or notify the patient in advance when provider assignments change. With the patient's permission, involve trusted informal caregivers ( e.g., family, friends) and outpatient providers in treatment decisions and discharg e planning. Offer the support of a certified peer specialist for the patient during his or her visit. Keep in mind some individuals may not be as forthcoming with suicidal ideation, depending on their background and situation. This could be due to religious reasons ( e.g., believing those who die by suicide go to hell) or fears of confidentiality ( e.g., living in a small inter -connected community). Reassure the individual that help is available, and they are not alone. Throughout all healthcare settings, it is vital to reinforce resources like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Call 1 -800-273-8255 [TALK] or text \"IN\" to 741 -741). 17 ASSESS the likelihood that the overall safety plan will be used, and problem solve with the patient to identify barriers or obstacles to using the plan. DISCUSS where the patient will keep the safety plan and how it will be located during a crisis. EVALUATE if the format is appropriate for patient 's capacity and circumstances. Consider if there should be any social media element of protection included if this is a sensitive point for the patient. REVIEW the plan periodically when the patient's circumstances or needs change. This tool was originally developed by the WICHE Center for Rural Mental Health Research and the Suicide Prevention Research Center.

A Safety Plan is a prioritized written list of coping strategies and sources of support patients can use who have been deemed to be at high risk for suicide. Patients can use these strategies before or during a suicide crisis. The plan is brief, is in the patient's own wor ds, and is easy to read. WHO SHOULD HAVE A SAFETY PLAN? Any patient who has a suicide crisis should have a comprehensive suicide risk assessment. Clinicians should then collaborate with the patient on developing a safety plan. HOW SHOULD A SAFETY PLAN BE DONE? Safety planning is a clinical process. Listening to, empathizing with, and engaging the patient in the process can promote the development of the Safety Plan and the likelihood of its use. While this is a clinical process, anyone can create safety pl an as this is a vital step in suicide prevention. Individuals do not need to be mental health professionals. DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING THE SAFETY PLAN The following section outlines the six steps in building and putting into action a safety plan.What are the steps after the plan is developed? Safety Planning Guide A Quick Guide for Clinicians 18 Warning Signs *Ask: \"How will you know when the safety plan should be used?\" *Ask: \"What do you experience when you start to think about suicide or feel extremely depressed?\" *List warning signs (thoughts, images, thinking processes, mood, and/ or behaviors) using the patient's own words. Internal Coping Strategies *Ask: \"What can you do, on your own, if you experience suicidal ideation again, to help yourself not to act on your thoughts?\" *Assess likelihood of use: Ask: \"How likely do you think you would be able to do this step during a time of crisis?\" *If doubt about use is expressed, ask: \"What might stand in the way of you thinking of these activities or doing them?\" *Use a collaborative, problem solving approach to address potential roadblocks and identify alternative coping strategies. Social Contacts Who May Distract from the Crisis *Instruct patients to use Step 3 if Step 2 does not resolve the crisis or lower ri sk. *Ask: \"Who or what social settings help you take your mind off your problems at least for a little while?\" \"Who helps you feel better when you socialize with them?\" *Ask for safe places they can go to be around people (i.e. coffee shop). *Ask patient t o list several people and social settings in case the first option is unavailable. Keep in mind the potential for online supports. *Remember, in this step, the goal is distraction from suicidal ideation. *Assess likelihood that patient will engage in this step; identify potential obstacle and problem solve, as appropriate. Family Members or Friends Who May Offer Help *Instruct patients to use Step 4 if Step 3 does not resolve crisis *Ask: \"Among your f amily or friends, who do you think you could contact for help during a crisis?\" or \"Who is supportive of you and who do you feel that you can talk with when you're under stress?\" *Ask patients to list several people, in case one contact is unreachable. Pri oritize the list. In this step, unlike the previous step, patients reveal they are in crisis to others. *Assess likelihood patient will engage in this step; identify potential obstacles and problem solve. Role play and rehearsal can be very useful in this step. Professionals and Agencies to Contact for Help *Instruct the patients to use Step 5 if Step 4 does not resolve the crisis or lower risk. *Ask: \"Who are the mental health professionals that we should identify to be on your safety plan?\" and \"Are there other health care providers?\" *List names, numbers of clinicians and urgent care services. *Assess likelihood patient will engage in this step; identify potential obstacles and problem solve. *Role play and rehearsal can be very useful in this step. Making the Environment Safe *Ask patients which means they would consider using during a suicidal crisis. *Ask: \"Do you own a firearm, such as a gun or rifle?\" and \"What other means do you have access to and may use to attempt to kill yourself?\" *Collaboratively identify ways to secure or limit access to lethal means: Ask: \"How can we go about developing a plan to limit your access to these means?\" *For low lethality methods, clinicians may ask patients to remove or limit their access t o these methods. *Restricting the patient's access to a highly lethal method .Developing and Implementing the Safety Plan: A Six Step Process Commented [SC4]: Left off here 19 SUICIDE SAFETY PLANNING TEMPLATE Step 1: Recogni zing warning signs that signal that you need to find help: Identify specific thoughts, feelings, situations , and behaviours that may predict a crisis. Examples include feeling that emotional pain will never end or having persistent thoughts that others would b e better off without you. Step 2: What can you do by yourself to take your mind off the problem? What obstacles might there be to using these coping skills? List activities that may take your mind off thoughts related to suicidal ideation . This allows time to pass and for the impul ses to subside. Simple, engrossing activities can be surprisingly helpful. Examples include listening to calming music, exercising, going for a walk , or playing a musical instrument. Step 3: If you are unable to deal with your distressed mood alone, contact trusted family or friends and think of social settings that offer support as well as distraction from the crisis. Name: Phone number: Name: Phone number: that provides distraction: Place that provides distraction: Step 4: Contact local health professionals or emergency services if you continue to have thoughts of suicide . Create a list of names, phone numbers , and locations that can be contacted during a suicide emergency. A crisis is no time to begin searching for this type of information. Clinician Name: Phone number: Clinician Name: Phone number: Local Urgent Services: Phone number: Suicide Prevention Lifeline Phone : 1-800-273-8255 or text \"HELLO\" to 741741 This plan has been developed using information from Reach Out and 'Safety Planning Intervention' by Barbara Stanley and Gregory Brown from National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. A copy of this plan can be found here: https://www.template.net/business/plan -templates/plan -sample/ 20 Step 5: Make sure that access to any deadly means of self -harm is minimized. For example, limiting the number of pills available at any one time and removing any potentially harmful implements considered in plans. It is a myth that if someone wants to die by suicide, they will, no matter what. In fact, limiting access to deadly mea ns makes a real difference. The strongest of feelings tied to suicidal ideation typically last only a brief period. If it is more difficult to act during these periods, there is a good chance that the feelings will subside. Step 6: What is most important to me and worth living for: 21 This was adapted from the Action Alliance's \"Best Practices in Care Transitions for Individuals with Suicide Risk: Inpatient Care to Outpatient Care,\" which can be found here: https://theactionalliance.org/sites/default/files/report_ - _best_practices_in_care_transitions_final.pdf . It was also adapted from SAMHSA's \"After an Attempt: A Guide for Medical Providers in the Emergency Department Taking Care of Suicide Attempt Survivors,\" which can be found here: https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/d7/priv/sma18 -4359.pdf DISCHARGE PROTOCOL The emerging standard in suicide care requires innovative approaches to creating smooth and uninterrupted care transitions from one setting to another with support and contact provided throughout by the behavioral health provider, physician, or other desig nated staff from the organization. Keep in mind that if the patient has Medicaid, they can be connected to their managed care company in this process. Specifically, the referring staff member should do the following : One of the most important things healthcare professionals can do for a patient or family member after having been in a healthcare facility is to offer hope. Patients and families will look to healthcare professionals to determine the prognosis and for some assurance that this will not happen again. If a patient does have a re occurrence of suicidal ideation, as i t is possible when people recover, it is not a sign that the treatment is not working. This is a sign that the brain is still healing and that the individual needs to use the plan that was built and reach out. Assure th e patient that they are not alone and that help is available. Talk with the patient about the risk of suicide during the post-discharge timeframe, including warning signs of a worsening condition, what to do, and when to return to the hospital . . Provide every patient with crisis center information upon discharge from treatment with their safety plan, explaining the purpose, utility, and services offered by the crisis cent er. Provide every patient with crisis center information upon discharge from treatment with their safety plan, explaining the purpose, utility, and services offered by the crisis center. Ensure the patient has spoken over the phone with the new provider . Consider innovative approaches for connecting the two such as meeting in person or bridging the therapy through a case manager. Encourage family participation and engage all community supports such as schools to ensure a smooth transition for the patient. Possible partners could include schools, workplaces, etc. Schedule the first outpatient session before the patient is discharged, optimally scheduling 24 -72 hours after discharge. Call the new provider and share patient records before the first appointment. Contact the patient within 24 -48 ho urs after they have transitioned to the next care provider . Provide ongoing caring contacts within seven days of discharge and for at least 12 months or more. 22 This was adapted from \"After an Attempt: A Guide for Taking Care of Your Family Member After Treatment in the Emergency Department.\" This can be found here: https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/d7/priv/sma18 -4357eng.pdf . The graphics are from Noun Project (Check Mark by P.J. Onori, US) AFTER AN ATTEMPT: What Family Members Need to Know Suicide is a traumatic experience for both the individual who attempted and the family. As a family member, you may feel numb and lost, not knowing where to turn. Experiencing a range of emotions is completely normal . When it comes time for that individual to come home, it can be good to start thinking about safety. Research shows that when an in dividual has previous ly attempted, they do have higher risk of later dying by suicide. As a family member, you can help your loved one by reducing risk . Reduce the Risk at Home \u2014To help reduce the risk of self -harm or suicide at home, here are some thing s to consider: Guns are high risk and the leading means of death for individuals experiencing suicidal ideation \u2014they should be taken out of the home and secured. Overdoses are common and can be lethal \u2014if it is necessary to keep pain relievers such as as pirin, Advil, and Tylenol in the home, only keep small quantities or consider keeping medications in a locked container. Remove unused or expired medicine from the home. Alcohol use or abuse can decrease inhibitions and cause people to act more freely on their feelings. As with pain relievers, keep only small quantities of alcohol in the home, or none . Create a Safety Plan \u2014Following a suicide attempt, a safety plan should be created to help prevent another attempt. The plan should be a joint effort between your relative and his or her doctor, therapist, or the emergency department staff, and you. As a family member, you should know your relative's safety plan and und erstand your role in it, including: Knowing your family member's \"triggers,\" such as an anniversary of a loss, alcohol, or stress from relationships. Building supports for your family member with mental health professionals, family, friends, and communit y resources. Working with your family member's strengths to promote his or her safety. Promoting communication and honesty in your relationship with your family member. Remember that safety cannot be guaranteed by anyone \u2014the goal is to reduce the risks and build supports for everyone in the family. However, it is important for you to believe that the safety plan can help keep your relative safe. If you do not feel that it can, let the emergency department staff know before you leave. Maintain Hope and Self-Care \u2014Families commonly provide a safety net and a vision of hope for their relative experiencing suicidal ideation , and that can be emotionally exhausting. Never try to handle this situation alone \u2014get support from friends, relatives, and organization s such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and get professional input whenever possible. Use the resources on the back pages of this brochure, the Internet, family, and friends to help you create a support network. You do not have to travel this road alone. 23 AFTER A SUICIDE LOSS: What Family Members Need to Know Life as you know it has changed forever. You may feel numb and lost, not knowing where to turn. Experiencing a range of emotions is common: fear, anger, relief, abandonment, guilt, shame, and perhaps even responsibility for your loved one's death. These feelings can change rapidly, and family members may have different reactions at different times which sometimes can lead to conflict. Know that others have walked this difficult path before you. Reach out to those who have survived a suicide loss. Move forward step by step at your own pace and do not allow anyone to rush or criticize your grieving process. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. There are many ways to connect to others \u2014staying in contact with others can help you through your grief. Reach out for support: Attend a support grou p for suicide loss survivors (in person or online) Talk to a professional grief counselor Seek a licensed mental health provider, if needed Talk with those you trust (family, friends, faith leader, neighbors) to share your loss and pain Continue to ask the \"why?\" questions if you need to Grieving can take over your life, so taking care of yourself is important: Try to get plenty of sleep, rest, and be gentle with yourself Eat healthy food and drink water Keep yourself busy by doing something you en joy Continue your exercise routine When a loved one passes away, it can be a very difficult time. Trying to remember all the details that must be taken care of related to a person's death is hard. In the next few pages, there are a list of items marked a s things to do immediately, within a few days, and within a few weeks . This was adapted from \"Health & Hope: For Survivors of Suicide Loss.\" from Ever Loved's \"What to Do When Someone Dies: A Checklist,\" found here: https://everloved.com/articles/end - of-life-affairs/what -to-do-when -someone -dies-checklist/ 24 What to do immediately 1. Get a death certificate . If your loved one died in a hospital, a doctor can take care of this for you. However, if your loved one passed at home or in another location, you'll need to know who to call. If your family member wasn't at a hospital, call 911. 2. Arrange for organ donation, if applicable. Check your loved one's driver's license and/or advance directive (living will or health care proxy) to see if he or she was an organ donor. If so, let hospital staff know immediately (or call a nearby hospital if your loved one died at home). 3. Contact im mediate family. Every family is different, and there's no one right way to do this. For some families, sharing the news in -person or over the phone is critical. For others , an email or text message may be alright. 4. Enlist help from family and friends. There are multiple ways family and friends can help you, such as: answering the phone , collecting mail , caring for pets , finding important items (such as keys, insurance policies, claims forms, addresses for magazine subscriptions, etc. ), staying at the home during the wake, funeral, and/or memorial services to guard against break -ins, and organizing food for family and friends after the services. 5. Notify the individual's religious leader, if applicable . Contact the deceased's Pastor, Rabbi, Priest , or other religious leader if there is one. He or she can help with counseling for surviving family and friends. They can also help you make funeral arrangements or services. 6. Decide what you'd like to do with your loved one's body and arrange transportation. First, check to see if your loved one expressed any wishes about final disposition or had made prepayments to a funeral home or cemetery . Ideally, there wil l be documentation with other medical documents. If no wishes or plans have been stated, you have three main options: o Call a funeral home. A funeral home can help you arrange either a burial or cremation. Check reviews and prices for a few different funeral homes before making a decision. o Call a crematory. While you can arrange a cremation through a funeral home, there are also crematories that will work with you directly if you aren't interested in the added services of a funeral director. o Call a full -body donation organization. Your loved one may have already registered t o be a body donor , so check for paperwork. If he or she hasn't, there are still many programs that accept donations from next of kin. 7. Arrange care for any pets or dependents. If your loved one was responsible for caring for one or more people or pets, quickly find someone who can care for them temporarily . 8. Secure major property. If your loved one lived on their own, make sure his or her home and any vehicles are locked up. If it will sit vacant for some time, consider notifying the landlord and/or the police, so they can help to keep an eye on it. 9. Notify the person's employer. If the deceased was employed (or actively volunteering), call to let them know that your loved one has passed away. This is also a good time to ask about pay owed, benefits , and life insurance. 25 What to do within a few days 1. Decide on funeral plans. If you decided to work with a funeral home, meet with the funeral director to go through your options. If you opted for an immediate burial (burial without any ceremonies), cremation , or donation to science, you may also choose to hold a memorial service or celebration of life at a later date. 2. Order a casket or urn. You may choose to purchase a casket or urn directly through the funeral home. However, you can often find caskets online for hundreds (even thousands) of dollars less, and some websites even offer free overnight delivery. 3. For a veteran, ask about special arrangements. A range of benefits can help tailor a veteran's service. You may be able to get assistance with the funeral, burial plot , or other benefits. You can find many details about options as well as potential survivor benefits at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website. 4. Consider whether you need or want other financial assistance for the funeral and burial. Help might be available from different sources, including a church, a union , or a fraternal organization that the deceased belonged to. 5. Ask the post office to forwar d mail. If the person lived alone, this will prevent mail from piling up and showing that no one is living in the home. The mail may also help you identify bills that need to be paid and accounts that should be closed. You'll need to file a request at the post office and show proof that you are an appointed executor and authorized to manage his/her mail. 6. Perform a check of the person's home. Throw out any food that will expire, water plants, and look for anything else that may need regular care. 7. Update the utilities . Tell local utilities (telephone, gas, electricity, cable) about the death, only if someone else wants to be put on the accounts. Otherwise wait until you decide if and when the utilities are to be turned off. 8. Prepare an obituary. The funeral home might o ffer the service, or you might want to write an obituary yourself. If you want to publish it in a newspaper, check on rates, deadlines , and submission guidelines. 26 What to do within a few weeks 1. Order a headstone. Since headstones are rarely ready in time for a burial, you can save this until after the funeral when you have some more time. You can order a headstone through the cemetery, but you'll have more options (and often lower prices) if you look online. 2. Order several copies of th e death certificate. You will likely need anywhere between 5 -10 copies (but possibly more), depending on the accounts that your loved one had open. Your funeral director may be able to help you order them, or you can order them yourself from city hall or another local records office. Your certified copies should dis play an official seal and say, \"This is an exact copy of the death certificate received for filing in County .\" 3. Start the probate process with the will. If the estate is relatively small, doesn't contain unusual assets , and i sn't likely to be disputed by family members , you may be able to handle it your self. 4. Contact the Social Security office . Your funeral director may have already done this, so find out if this is the case. If you need to contact Social Security yourself, you can reach them by phone at 1-800-772-1213. Through Social Security , you may be able to apply for survivor benefi ts. 5. Handle Medicare. If your loved one received Medicare, Social Security will inform the program of the death. If the deceased had been enrolled in Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage (Part D), Medicare Advantage plan , or had a Medigap policy, contact t hese plans at the phone numbers provided on each plan membership card to cancel the insurance. 6. Notify any banks or mortgage companies. If you are unsure of what accounts your loved one held, use their mail and any online accounts you have access to in order to identify what accounts may be open. Then, take copies of the death certificate to each bank and change ownership of the accounts. 7. Reach out to any financial advisors or brokers. Try to identify any additional financial and investment accounts that your loved one held. Work with each one to transfer ownership. You'll likely need a death certificate for each account. 8. Contact a tax accountan t. You'll need to file a return for both the individual and the estate. 9. Notify life insurance companies. Fill out the claim form for any life insurance policies that the deceased had. Also, suggest that friends and family who may have listed your loved on e on their own life insurance policies update theirs. 10. Cancel insurance policies. This could include health insurance, car insurance, homeowner's insurance , or other policies . Depending on the policy, reach out to either the insurance company or your loved one's employer to stop coverage. 11. Determine any employment benefits. If your loved one was working at the time of their death, contact their employer to find out about union death benefits, pension plans , and credit unions. Commented [SC5]: Left off 27 12. Identify and pay important bills. Make a list of bills that are likely to be due (e.g. mortgage, car payments, electricity), track ing them down via the person's mail and online accounts. 13. Close credit card accounts. Leverage your loved one's mail, wallet , and any online ac counts you have access to in order to identify open credit card accounts. For each one, you'll likely need to call customer service and then email or mail a copy of the death certificate. 14. Notify credit reporting agencies. Provide copies of the death certi ficate to Experian, Equifax , and TransUnion to reduce the chances of identity theft. It's also a good idea to check your loved one's credit history in another month to confirm that no new accounts have been opened. 15. Creditors. Letters should be sent to all creditors informing them of the person's death. If any life insurance coverage can pay off the balances, a copy of the death certificate will be needed. Do not tell any of them you will be paying the balances with your own money. The estate needs to pay t hese, not family members, no matter what the creditors tell you. If nothing is left in the estate to pay off debts, then tell the creditors this. 16. Contact a tax preparer. A return will need to be filed for the individual, as well as for an estate return. Keep monthly bank statements on all individual and joint accounts that show the account balance on the day of death. 17. Cancel the person's driver's license. Go online or call your state's DMV for instructions , having a copy of the death certificate ready. Additionally, n otify the local election board. This will help to prevent identity theft and voter fraud . 18. Memorialize your loved one's Facebook account. If your loved one was on Facebook, you can memorialize their account . This will let current friends continue to post and share memories but will keep anyone from logging into it in the future. 19. Close email accounts. Once you feel confident that you have necessary information on other accounts, it's a good idea to permanently close your loved one's email accounts as an additional step to prevent fraud and identity theft. 20. Dispose of personal items and clothing. It is hard, but as soon as possible, you should try to dispose of items which will no longer be used by the survivors. Everyone does this at a different time. Ask for help with this if you need it. No items should be moved, sold, or given away if they have been identified in the person's will to be given out to survivors. 21. Find important documents. There are some documents that may be needed or at least helpful in settling the estate of the deceased. Documents might include: safe deposit rental agreement and keys; trust agreements; licenses/prenuptial agreements/divorce or statements; pension, IRA, retirement statements; income tax returns for the past three years/W -2 form; loan and installment payment books and contracts; gift tax returns; birth and death certificates; social security card ; military records and discharge papers; budgets; bank statements, checkbooks, check registers, certificates of deposits; deeds, deeds of trust, mortgages and mortgage releases, title policies, leases; motor vehicle titles and registration papers; stock an d bond certificates and account statements; unpaid bills; health/accident and sickness policies; bankruptcy papers. 28 PROVIDER SELF -CARE CHECKLIST Each provider may have a different way of coping with work -related stress.

Depending on one's definition, this group can involve firefighters, law enforcement , EM S professionals , paramedics , dispatch , and emergency department personnel. It is vital that first responders know the best practices when it comes to suicide intervention and postvention as they are often the first to interact with the individual or the family. Each responder needs to understand how suicide prevention fits into their role and learn how to best address it. Beyond their role in responding, it is also critical for first responders to embrace suicide prevention within their units. In a recent study examining law enforcement and firefighters, it was found that law enforcement officers and firefighters are more like ly to die by suicide than in the line of duty.8 When looking at law enforcement agencies, it was estimated that only 3 -5% had established suicide prevention training programs.8 Given the trauma that first responders are exposed to on a regular basis, it is vital that they (1) know how to respond to a suicide event and (2) are supported in their own mental health.

Review the protocols and standard operating procedures required by the first responder's agency and in the state and local area for responding to a person with a suicide -related situation. 2. Meet with the local first responder partners to discuss how to work together to help persons who have attempted or are having thoughts of suicide , including those who refuse to be transported. 3. If the community has a crisis intervention team (CIT) or if the agency work s closely with mental health p roviders, meet with them regularly to discuss strategies . When responding to any type of suicide -related incident, the first responder should : Suicidal Ideation Establish rapport with the person Follow local established protocols. Some examples include c learing the scene and e liminating access to lethal means (i.e. firearms, toxic substances) Assess the person for need of medical treatment Address any serious medical needs Ask direct questions such as, \"Are you thinking about killing yourself?\" and \"Do you have a plan?\" Contact Law Enforcement trained in suicide prevention or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) Determine next steps Connect the individual with the appropriate level of care Enga ge family members and friends at the scene.

Below are a few steps that first responders can go through when interacting with children on the scene. When first responders arrive on the scene, first responders should: Account for and locate all children, anticipating that some children may hide . Avoid exposing the children to traumatic situations . Ask whether other children may return later to the home and arrange for their care in the absence of the parent . When children are present and there are multiple first responders , one responder should: Talk with children present in a separate area . Speak to any children present using developmentally informed and age -appropriate language and conversation styles . Reduce children's anxiety by discuss ing what will happen next . Help children calm themselves by providing distractions and, when appropriate, an item to hold (e.g., a teddy bear) . When an alternate caregiver is available, first responder s should: Inform the remaining caregiver that children are often traumatized by observing or hearing about the suicide -related incident . Where possible, provide referrals to child, family and youth services to address the trauma of the experience and help mitigate its effects . Help physically transfer the child to another location, if n ecessary, while giving the child the opportunity to bring comforting objects from home . When the parent is a sole caregiver, responders should: Follow local protocol for transferring custody of children to a state agency . Ensure the transfer of custody occurred as required . After a situation is resolved, departments should: Where possible and appropriate, enable a responder to return to the home and visit children affected to demonstrate concern for their safety and well -being . Follow up with service providers . Confer with the interagency team about outcomes. If first responders are interested in expanding communication b etween agencies in events whe re a child is present, those agencies m ay want to research the Handle with Care program.

There are two primary ways that people become admitted to a mental health facility: voluntary and involuntary commitment. There are four types of i nvoluntary admissions: 1. Immediate detention 2. Emergency detention 3. Temporary commitment 4. Regular commitment It is important to know that an immediate or emergency detention can become a temporary or regular commitment after the person has seen a judge. Based on the information given at a hearing, the judge may decide that it would be best to issue the individual a temporary or regular commitment. With that in mind, more detailed explanations of each involuntary admission type of commitment are bel ow. Immediate Detention (Indiana Code sec. 12 -26-4) This type of involuntary admission happens if a person with a mental illness is believed by law enforcement to need hospitalization. A person can be held for 24 hours if a law enforcement officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is: Mentally ill Dangerous to self or others or gravely disabled, and In immediate need of hospitalization and treatment. The officer may take the person into custody and transp ort him or her to the nearest appropriate facility that is not a state institution. The officer must submit a written statement to the facility containing the reasons for immediate detention. This statement will be filed in the individual's records at th e facility. Either the superintendent of the facility or a physician may provide emergency treatment necessary to preserve the health and safety of the person. A person cannot be held under immediate detention for more than 24 hours from the time of a dmission without further action. However, if the superintendent or attending physician believes the person should be held longer, an application for emergency detention can be sought. The application must be filed immediately upon the availability of a jud ge or within 72 hours of admission to the facility, whichever is earlier. This was adapted from Indiana Disability Right's document, \"Right of Adults Receiving Treatment in an Indiana Mental Health Facility,\" which can be found here: in.gov/idr/files/IDR108 -PurpleBook -2017 -09-25-V05-Small.pdf 35 Emergency Detention (Indiana Code sec. 12 -26-5-1) A person can be kept in a facility for up to 72 hours (excluding weekends and legal holidays) if a written application is made to the facility stating the belief that the person is: Mentally ill Either dangerous or gravely disabled, and In need of immediate restraint. The application must include a written statement by at least one physician that, based on either an examination or information given by that physician, the person meets the above criteria. Temporary Commitment (Indiana Code sec. 12 -26-6) A person ca n be temporarily committed to an appropriate facility or outpatient treatment program for up to 90 days if he/she is found by a court to be: Mentally ill, and Either dangerous or gravely disabled. Prior to the end of the temporary commitment, proceedings for an extension can be filed with the court. The extension, if granted, cannot exceed 90 days. (Indiana Code sec. 12 -26-6-10). Regular Commitment (Indiana Code sec. 12 -26-7) Regular commitment may apply to a person: Alleged to be mentally ill, Either dangerous or gravely disabled, and Whose commitment is reasonably expected to require custody, care , or treatment in a facility for more than 90 days. These conditions must be included in the written statement of a physician who has examined the individual within the past 30 days. This statement must explain why the physician believes the individual meets the above criteria. If the person is committed to a state institution, a community mental health center must have first evaluated the individual and reported that the commitment is appropriate. The court may order the individual's custody, care, or treatment in an appropriate mental health facility until that person has been discharged or the court terminates the commitment. Mental illness (Indiana Code 12 -7-2-130 (1)) - A psychiatric disorder that substantially disturbs an individual's thinking, feeling, or behavior and impairs the person's ability to function. In this case, the term mental illness includes intellectual disability, alcoholism, and addiction to narcotics or other drugs. Dangerous (Indiana Code 12 -7-2-53) - A condition in which an individual, as a result of mental illness, presents a substantial risk that the individual will harm him/herself or others. Gravely disabled (Indiana Code 12 -7-2-96) - A condition in which an individual, as a result of mental illness, is in danger of coming to harm because he/she: Is unable to provide for his/her food, clothing, shelter, or other essential human needs; or has a substantia l imp airment or an obvious decline of his/her judgment, reasoning or behavior that results in an inability to function independently. 36 RESOURCE \"TUCK\" CARDS TEMPLATE If first responders are responding to a scene, but are not providing any additional transportation, it can be helpful to provide a resource list to affected individuals -- not a multi -page resource list that is difficult to read, instead a \"tuck\" card where the handout is small enough to fit in side the individual's pocket. Bel ow is a sample template that communities can use to create their own \"tuck\" cards (the grey portions indicate customizable sections).

The graphics are from Noun (Check Mark by P.J. Onori, US) AFTER AN ATTEMPT: What Family Members Need to Know Suicide is a traumatic experience for both the individual who attempted and the family. As the family member, you may feel numb and lost, not knowing where to turn. Experiencing a range of emotions is completely normal . When it comes time for that individu al to come home, it can be good to start thinking about safety. Research shows that when an individual has previous ly attempted, they do have higher risk of later dying by suicide. As a family member, you can help your loved by reducing risk . Reduce the Risk at Home \u2014To help reduce the risk of self -harm or suicide at home, here are some things to consider: Guns are high risk and the leading means of death for individuals who die by suicide \u2014they should be taken out of the home and secured. Overdoses are common and can be lethal \u2014if it is necessary to keep pain relievers such as aspirin, Advil, and Tylenol in the home, only keep small quantities or consider keeping medications in a locked container. Remove unused or expired medicine from the home . Alcohol use or abuse can decrease inhibitions and cause people to act more freely on their feelings. As with pain relievers, keep only small quantities of alcohol in the home, or none at all. Create a Safety Plan \u2014Following a suicide attempt, a safety plan should be created to help prevent another attempt. The plan should be a joint effort between your relative and his or her doctor, therapist, or the emergency department staff, and you. As a family member, you should know your relative's safety plan a nd understand your role in it, including: Knowing your family member's \"triggers,\" such as an anniversary of a loss, alcohol, or stress from relationships. Building supports for your family member with mental health professionals, family, friends, and community resources. Working with your famil y member's strengths to promote his or her safety. Promoting communication and honesty in your relationship with your family member. Remember that safety cannot be guaranteed by anyone \u2014the goal is to reduce the risks and build supports for everyone in th e family. However, it is important for you to believe that the safety plan can help keep your relative safe. If you do not feel that it can, let the emergency department staff know before you leave. Maintain Hope and Self -Care \u2014Families commonly provide a safety net and a vision of hope for their relative experiencing suicidal ideation , and that can be emotionally exhausting. Never try to handle this situation alone \u2014get support from friends, relatives, and organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and get professional input whenever possible. Use the resources on the back page s of this brochure, the Internet, family, and friends to help you create a support network. You do not have to travel this road alone. 38 AFTER A SUICIDE LOSS: What Family Members Need to Know Life as you know it has changed forever. You may feel numb and lost, not knowing where to turn. Experiencing a range of emotions is common: fear, anger, relief, abandonment, guilt, shame, and perhaps even responsibility for your loved one's death. These feelings can change rapidly, and family members may have different reactions at different times which sometimes can lead to conflict. Know that others have walked this difficult path before you. Reach out to those who have survived a suicide loss. Move for ward step by step at your own pace and do not allow anyone to rush or criticize your grieving process. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. There are many ways to connect to others \u2014staying in contact with others can help you through your grief. Reach out for support: Attend a support group for suicide loss survivors (in person or online) Talk to a professional grief counselor Seek a licensed mental health provider, if needed Talk with those you trust (family, friends, faith leader, neighbors) to share your loss and pai n Continue to ask the \"why?\" questions as long as you need to Grieving can take over your life, so taking care of yourself is important: Try to get plenty of sleep, rest, and be gentle with yourself Eat healthy food and drink water Keep yourself busy by doing something you enjoy Continue your exercise routine When a loved one passes away, it can be a very difficult time. Trying to remember all of the details that must be taken care of related to a person's death is hard. In the next few pages, there are a list of items marked as things to do immediately, within a few days, and within a few weeks . This was adapted from \"Health & Hope: For Survivors of Suicide Loss.\" This from Ever Loved's \"What to Do When Someone Dies: A Checklist,\" found here: https://everloved.com/articles/end - of-life-affairs/what -to-do-when -someone -dies-checklist/ 39 What to do immediately 10. Get a death certificate . If your loved one died in a hospital, a doctor can take care of this for you. However, if your loved one passed at home or in another location, you'll need to know who to call. If your family member wasn't at a hospital, call 911. 11. Arrange for organ donation, if applicable. Check you r loved one's driver's license and/or advance directive (living will or health care proxy) to see if he or she was an organ donor. If so, let hospital staff know immediately (or call a nearby hospital if your loved one died at home). 12. Contact immediate family. Every family is different, and there's no one right way to do this. For some families, sharing the news in -person or over the phone is critical. For others an email or text message may be alright. 13. Enlist help from family and friends. There are multiple ways family and friends can help you, such as: answering the phone , collecting mail , caring for pets , finding important items (such as keys, insurance policies, claims forms, addresses for magazine subscriptions, etc. ), staying at the home during the wake, funeral, and/or memorial services to guard against break -ins, and organizing food for family and friends after the services. 14. Notify the individual's religious leader, if applicable . Contact the deceased's Pastor, Rabbi, Priest , or other religious leader if there is one. He or she can help with counseling for surviving family and friends. They can also help you make funeral arrangements or services. 15. Decide what you'd like to do with your loved one's body and arrange transportation. First, check to see if your loved one expressed any wishes about final disposition or had made prepayments to a funeral home or cemetery . Ideally, there will be documentation with other medical documents. If no wishes or plans have been stated, you have three main options: o Call a funeral home. A funeral home can help you arrange either a burial or cremation. Check reviews and prices for a few different funeral homes before making a decision. o Call a crematory. While you can arrange a cremation through a funeral home, there are also crematories that will work with you directly if you aren't interested in the added services of a funeral director. o Call a full -body donation organization. Your loved one may have already registered t o be a body donor , so check for paperwork. If he or she hasn't, there are still many programs that accept donations from next of kin. 16. Arrange care for any pets or dependents. If your loved one was responsible for caring for one or more people or pets, quickly find someone who can care for them temporarily . 17. Secure major property. If your loved one lived on their own, make sure his or her home and any vehicles are locked up. If it will sit vacant for some time, consider notifying the landlord and/or the police, so they can help to keep an eye on it. 18. Notify the person's employer. If the deceased was employed (or actively volunteering), call to let them know that your loved one has passed away. This is also a good time to ask about pay owed, benefits , and life insurance. 40 What to do within a few days 9. Decide on funeral plans. If you decided to work with a funeral home, meet with the funeral director to go through your options. If you opted for an immediate burial (burial without any ceremonies), cremation or donation to science, you may also choose to hold a memorial service or celebration of life at a later date. 10. Order a casket or urn. You may choose to purchase a casket or urn directly through the funeral home. However, you can often find caskets online for hundreds (even thousands) of dollars less, and some websites even offer free overnight delivery. 11. For a veteran, ask about special arran gements. A range of benefits can help tailor a veteran's service. You may be able to get assistance with the funeral, burial plot , or other benefits. You can find many details about options as well as potential survivor benefits at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website. 12. Consider whether you need or want other financial assistance for the funeral and burial. Help might be available from different sources, including a church, a union , or a fraternal organization that the deceased belonged to. 13. Ask the post office to forward mail. If the person lived alone, this will prevent mail from piling up and showing that no one is living in the home. The mail may also help you identify bills that need to be paid and accounts that should be closed. You'll ne ed to file a request at the post office and show proof that you are an appointed executor and authorized to manage his/her mail. 14. Perform a check of the person's home. Throw out any food that will expire, water plants, and look for anything else that may need regular care. 15. Update the utilities . Tell local utilities (telephone, gas, electricity, cable) about the death, only if someone else wants to be put on the accounts. Otherwise wait until you decide if and when the utilities are to be turned off. 16. Prepare an obituary. The funeral home might offer the service, or you might want to write an obituary yourself. If you want to publish it in a newspaper, check on rates, deadlines , and submission guidelines. 41 What to do within a few weeks 22. Order a headstone. Since headstones are rarely ready in time for a burial, you can save this until after the funeral when you have some more time. You can order a headstone through the cemetery, but you'll have more options (and often lower prices) if you look online. 23. Order several copies of the death certificate. You will likely need anywhere between 5 -10 copies (but possibly more), depending on the accounts that your loved one had open. Your funera l director may be able to help you order them, or you can order them yourself from city hall or another local records office. Your certified copies should display an official seal and say, \"This is an exact copy of the death certificate received for filing in County .\" 24. Start the probate process with the will. If the estate is relatively small, doesn't contain unusual assets , and isn't likely to be disputed by family members , you may be able to handle it your self. 25. Contact the Social Security office. Your funeral director may have already done this, so find out if this is the case. If you need to contact Social Security yourself, you can reach them by phone at 1-800-772-1213. Through Social Security , you may be able to apply for survivor benefits . 26. Handle Medicare. If your loved one received Medicare, Social Security will inform the program of the death. If the deceased had been enrolled in Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage (Part D), Medicare Advantage plan , or had a Medigap policy, contact these plans at the phone numbers provided on each p lan membership card to cancel the insurance. 27. Notify any banks or mortgage companies. If you are unsure of what accounts your loved one held, use their mail and any online accounts you have access to in order to identify what accounts may be open. Then, take copies of the death certificate to each bank and change ownership of the accounts. 28. Reach ou t to any financial advisors or brokers. Try to identify any additional financial and investment accounts that your loved one held. Work with each one to transfer ownership. You'll likely need a death certificate for each account. 29. Contact a tax accountant. You'll need to file a return for both the individual and the estate. 30. Notify life insurance companies. Fill out the claim form for any life insurance policies that the deceased had. Also, suggest that friends and family who may have listed your loved one on their own life insurance policies update theirs. 31. Cancel insurance policies. This could include health insurance, car insurance, homeowner's insurance or other policies . Depending on the policy, reach out to either the insurance company or your loved on e's employer to stop coverage. 32. Determine any employment benefits. If your loved one was working at the time of their death, contact their employer to find out about union death benefits, pension plans , and credit unions. Commented [CM7]: Left off 42 33. Identify and pay important bills . Make a list of bills that are likely to be due (e.g. mortgage, car payments, electricity), track ing them down via the person's mail and online accounts. 34. Close credit card accounts. Leverage your loved one's mail, wallet , and any online accounts you have access to in order to identify open credit card accounts. For each one, you'll likely need to call customer service and then email or mail a copy of the death certificate. 35. Notify credit reporting agencies. Provide copies of the death certificate to Exper ian, Equifax and TransUnion to reduce the chances of identity theft. It's also a good idea to check your loved one's credit history in another month to confirm that no new accounts have been opened. 36. Creditors. Letters should be sent to all creditors informing them of the person's death. If any life insurance coverage can pay off the balances, a copy of the death certificate will be needed. Do not tell any of them you will be paying the balances with your own mon ey. The estate needs to pay these, not family members, no matter what the creditors tell you. If nothing is left in the estate to pay off debts, then tell the creditors this. 37. Contact a tax preparer. A return will need to be filed for the individual, as w ell as for an estate return. Keep monthly bank statements on all individual and joint accounts that show the account balance on the day of death. 38. Cancel the person's driver's license. Go online or call your state's DMV for instructions , having a copy of the death certificate ready. Additionally, n otify the local election board. This will help to prevent identity theft and voter fraud . 39. Memorialize your loved one's Facebook account. If your loved one was on Facebook, you can memorialize their account . This will let current friends continue to post and share memories but will keep anyone from logging into it in the future. 40. Close email accounts. Once you feel confident that you have necessary information on other accounts, it's a good idea to permanently close your loved one's email accounts as an additional step to prevent fraud and identity theft. 41. Dispose of personal items and clothing. It is hard, but as soon as possible, you should try to dispose of items which will no longer be used by the survivors. Everyone does this at a different time. Ask for help with this if you need it. No items should be moved, sold, or given away if they have been identified in the person's will to be given out to survivors. 42. Find important documents. There are some documents that may be needed or at least helpful in settling the estate of the deceased. Documents might include: safe dep osit or statements; pension, IRA, retirement statements; income tax returns for the past three years/W -2 form; l oan and installment payment books and contracts; gift tax returns; birth and death certificates; social security card; military records and discharge papers; budgets; bank statements, checkbooks, check registers, certificates of deposits; deeds, deeds of t rust, mortgages and mortgage releases, title policies, leases; motor vehicle titles and registration papers; stock and bond certificates and account statements; unpaid bills; health/accident and sickness policies; bankruptcy papers. 43 Safety - Proofing Your Home A guide to keeping families safe Suicide in Indiana Death rates for suicide have continued to rise both nationally and in Indiana, despite efforts to curtail these trends. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in Indiana for people ages 10 -64 and was the 11th overall leading cause of death for all ages. Suicide prevention efforts must be diverse and draw on a varied set of resources and tools. While each suicide attempt is different, th ere are multiple ways to address the factors involved. One evidence - based suicide prevention strategy that an individual can use to prevent suicide is safety -proofing their own home.

Examples include exposure (direct or indirect) to death, grief, injury, pain, or loss as well as direct exposure to threats to personal safety, long hours of work, frequent shift s and longer shift hours, poor sleep, physical hardships, and other negative experiences. In fact, PTSD and depression rates among firefighters and law enforcement officers are nearly five times higher than the civilian population. Here are a few suggestio ns first responder leaders and personnel could follow before, during, and after an incident: Leaders c an take these steps to support their teams before an incident : \u007f Plan in advance of incidents and develop clear written protocols and strategic plans. This is important for the behavioral health of first responders because the feeling of being well - prepared and the sense of doing a job well serve as protective factors against behavioral health issues and conditions. \u007f Include all team members in the development of the protocol , and ensure they are all adequately trained. Teamwork and sense of community serve as major protective factors . High sense of team accomplishment and assurance of personal and team capabilities are associated with reduced stress levels . \u007f Develop a clearly defined leadership cadre , establish sub -teams, and determine factors that could prevent some of the team members from participating . Organizations should put the welfare of their te am at the forefront and move toward a more supportive attitude . \u007f Ask potential responders before the incident to be aware of the stress they are dealing with and to assess whether they have the capacity to deal with the additional stress the situation will involve. Recognize good work during incidents, empower staff, and assign responsibility to staff to have a protective effec t. First responders can take these steps to support themselves before an incident : \u007f Be aware of personal vulnerability and signs of burnout and compassion fatigue or profound psychological pain observed in therapists working for long periods with people who have been directly traumatized. \u007f Make plans for self -care and plan on taking breaks, sleeping adequately, eating nutritious meals , and exercising during relief work . This was adapted from SAMHSA's \"Disaster Technical Assistance Center Supplemental Research Bulletin First Responders: Behavioral Health Concern s, Emergency Response, and Trauma,\" which can be found here: https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/dtac/supplementalresearchbullet in-firstresponders - may2018.pdf and \"Preventing Suicide here: https://www.usfa.fema.gov/operations/infograms/080819.html#:~:text=The%20Ruderman%20White%2 0Paper%20on,line%2Dof%2Dduty%20death.&text=PTSD%20and%20depression%20rates%2 0among,high er%20than%20the%20civilian%20population. . 47 Leaders can take these steps to support their teams during and after an incident : \u007f Assess the welfare of the team , resolve any conflicts between team members, and rotate assignments. The role of leadership is crucial in maintaining the mental health of their team . \u007f Encourage workers to pair up in a \"buddy system\" to support each other and monitor each other's stress reactions and provide support to each other if needed. o There are new models of this type of system happening across the country. Chicago implemented a peer support program in April 2020. More information about Chicago's program can be found here: https://home.chicagopolice.org/information/employee - assistance -program -eap/peer -support/ . \u007f Provide mental health and resilience training, and promote counseling and debriefing following stressful situations . \u007f Provide team group sessions upon return to home base, as well as staff support services . No further assignments should be given before workers have had sufficient time to recover; relief workers need some time to adjust, ease back into personal life, and t ake some time before returning to work . Additional resources addressing suicide prevention in law enforcement can be found on Suicide Awareness Voices of Education's (SAVE) law enforcement safety guide education page on Facebook, found here: https://www.facebook.com/securityguides/lesafety . 48 Government Introduction Government agencies and elected leaders have a vital role in addressing the behavioral health needs of their communities. Important programs such as social services, homelessness programs, and criminal justice system services, if operated well, can serve t o address various behavioral health issues. Based on 2018 data outlined in the data section of this toolkit, it was calculated that one person dies by suicide every eight hours in the state of Indiana. Overtime, this has totaled 23,559 years of potentia l life lost (YPLL) in Indiana.9 This is all to say that there is clear space for societal, community, and governmental engagement in suicide prevention work.

For example , asking questions such as \"What is the treatment infrastructure ?\" and \"What is the c ity's history with suicides ?\" can be key to identifying potential prevention initiatives. Context Questions Is there an existing suicide prevention coalition in the area? If so, is it better to join forces across groups? Have there been suicide s and suicide attempts in the community? If yes, how many? Which ages, which sex? What are the risk factors, and what are the protective factors relevant to your community? Which methods of suicide are most used in your community? Is there good access to quality health and mental health services in your community? Have health workers been trained in suicide prevention? Has there been gatekeeper training for first responders? What is the quality of services for persons who made a suicide attempt or who ar e bereaved by suicide (e.g. , in-patient care), and to what extent can persons access these services (e.g. , 24/7)? Are there any existing programs in place? If there are, have the service providers received training (type of training, number of hours)? Are there any efforts to coordinate services in order to make a continuity of care? Describe the communication infrastructure and the resources of your community. What are the most prominent channels of communication? Which are the most prominent media out lets? Are there guidelines for responsible reporting of suicide by the medi a? Have media professionals been trained? Describe your community's resources for suicide prevention. What could be barriers and facilitating factors for your activities? Are there policies and procedures that are inhibiting people from getting care? How can we mitigate those challenges? Future -focused Questions What do you think are the most urgent needs for suicide prevention in your community? Describe the population you wish to serve in suicide prevention ( i.e., location, population, ethnicity, age groups) Write down activities that could be undertaken in your community to foster a supportive environment (i.e. , have champions speak out about suicide, build partnerships, explore social/cultural/political/ethnic/economic tensions in the community) .

While a score will be assigned, there is no rigid rubric. Instead, communities should assess based on their conversations. The assessment serves to jumpstart conversations. Dimension Score (5 - excellent, 4 - good, 3 - average, 2 - below average, 1 -poor ) Degree of community readiness and community knowledge How much does the community know about the current suicide prevention programs and activities? Leadership What is the leadership's attitude towards addressing suicide prevention? Community climate What is the community's attitude towards addressing suicide prevention? Community knowledge of the issue How much does the community know about suicide prevention? Resources What resources ( i.e., human, financial, infrastructure) are being used or could be used to address suicide prevention? Form a Steering Committee - At this point, organizers may want to be thinking about key stakeholders to engage. Th e chart below can serve as an information gathering tool. Name Organization Nature of the Collaboration (How do your organizations work together?) Resources Shared (Knowledge, skills, access to priority populations) Level of Involvement (networking, cooperating, coordinating, leading) Next Steps - Develop a strategic plan moving forward for the group. Utilize existing tools such as the Indiana Suicide Prevention Netwo rk's suicide prevention planning tool, found here: https://indianasuicideprevention.org/ . For a strategic planning framework in this toolkit , utilize the \"Strategic Planning with Suicide Prevention Initi atives Guide \" found on page 65. 51 This was adapted from \"After an Attempt: A Guide for Taking Care of Your Family Member After Treatment in the Emergency Department.\" This can be found COMMUNITY RESPONSE PLAN As a community , it important to have a coordinated plan in place before a suicide death occurs. This will help to mobilize support in a timely manner and ensure that the situation is appropriately addressed . The first step is determining which entity/agency in the community should c oordinate a postvention response. Once the agency is determined, they should consider doing the following: Task Actions Who Notes 1 Establish, confirm , and document facts and circumstances. Ideally determine name, age, gender, method, location of death, & contact information for loss survivors/witnesses. Also useful are race/ethnicity, marital status, family information, employment, veteran/military stat us, and health history. This information can be captured in a psychological autopsy. 2 Designated team member contacts other team members to share information and coordinate responses. 3 Mobilize support to those directly affected. Verify that loss survivors are followed up with. Talk to first responders to determine if loss survivors and witnesses agreed to being contacted and to learn any other information about survivor needs. Two weeks or more after the death , ensure that survivors have been reached out to by bereavement teams (if those are in place). If a broader community response is planned within a year of the death, reach out to immediate survivors to inform them . Offer support to affected entities (businesses, schools, workplaces, etc.) about planning for anniversaries or other events. 4 Identify if there are agencies or organizations that should be prepared to provide support. 5 Monitor news and social media and respond as needed via public communications. 6 Reach out to community groups, agencies, and schools to which the deceased belonged. Work with them to assess and monitor contagion risk. 7 Assess and monitor contagion risk. 8 Identify and implement broader community response options as needed. Notify the suicide prevention coalition. Advise and/or issue a public statement . Host and participate in a community memorial , if appropriate. Meet with groups of potentially affected individuals to provide education, healing, and support. Identify training needs or requests. Provide support for obituaries, services, or memorials. 52 This was adapted from CIBHS's \"After Rural Suicide: A Guide for Coordinated Community can be found here: https://www.cibhs.org/pod/after -rural -suicide . Be clear about the goal . The goal of a community meeting is to promote healing . To many survivors who have recently lost a loved one, discussion of prevention can feel like an accusation, when they may already be feeling like they should have seen the signs. Whenever the meeting is held, it is important to acknowledge the loss(es) that h ave occurred and to reassure the community that no one is to blame for a suicide death. Set the agenda with the purpose in mind. The purpose of a community meeting is to facilitate a conversation about suicide or suicide prevention (e.g., promote healing, alleviate anxiety, gather input on what is needed). If a meeting is convened, it is vital to invite a skilled facilitator to lead the meeting. Develop a set of specific questions that will shape the conversation. In either case, make sure notes are taken during the meeting so that follow -up can be provided, and that information is gathered which can feed back into prevention planning with the suicide prevention coalition. Any community meeting should include information about the help that is available, including the Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) or local accredited crisis center. It should also avoid discussing details of any particular incident. Consider inviting a loss or attempt survivor whose loss or suicidality is several years behind them to share a story of hope. Reach out to recent loss survivors . When first planning the meeting, contact recent survivors to let them know about the plans and help them prepare for any issues that may arise as a result. Talk with them about how they are coping with the death and remind them of available services and supports. Ensure they understand the goal of the meeting is to promote healing. It is not recommended that these individuals play an active role in the meeting as their loss is recent. Identify meeting personnel. Assign a skilled facilitator and one or two greeters. Determine who will take notes on the issues raised or questions that arise during the meeting to facilitate follow -through and to compile information for prevention planning. Include a trained counselor or other mental health professional that will be on hand to offer support to anyone showing distress and/or offer professional input to the meeting. If the meeting is smaller and part of a targeted response to those directly impacted, this person may take a lead role in discussing complicated grief, how to know when professional help is needed, and what service s are available locally. GUIDANCE: CONSIDERATIONS FOR COMMUNITY MEETINGS After a suicide, there may be movement to hold a community meeting. Given the sensitivity of the situation, it is important to keep the following in mind : 53 Identify an appropriate location and meeting space. Offer a \"neutral\" meeting space, such as in community centers, park buildings, libraries, or senior center s. In most cases, neutral spaces do not include places such as churches, mental health or crisis centers, or hospitals, where some individuals may have negative/painful memories or associations. Within the meeting space, have an ancillary quiet space available for anyone who needs it. Identify this space with a welcoming indication of some kind, such as flowers, rather than a sign. During the meeting. Open the meeting with a clear statement of the purpose and what will be achieved, as well as with what will not be addressed. Assure participants that they can leave the meeting at any time if their feelings overwhelm them and can rejoin when they are able. Make clear how people can find the ancillary quiet space set aside for this purpose. Ask the cou nselor to be sure and check in on anyone who spends a lot of time there to see if they would like to talk. The facilitator may choose to offer an acknowledgment of the person(s) who have died and/or to hold a moment of silence. Be sure to include resource s on how help is available, such as the resources listed below. This box below can be included as a slide in a rotating screen or a presentation. Resources are vital to highlight as these gatherings can be difficult for attendees. Also, as mentioned above, it is vital to have counselors present during the event for individuals immediately seeking or needing help. Help is available.

Suicide affects people of all ages, genders, races, and ethnicities. For e very person who dies by suicide annually, there are another 280 people who have thought seriously about suicide who don't kill themselves , and nearly 60 who have survived a suicide attempt. The overwhelming majority of these individuals will go on to live out their lives. Suicide is complicated and tragic, but it is preventable. Knowing the warning signs for suicide and how to help can save lives. For helping someone in emotional pain , consider the following: Help is available if you're concerned that someone you care about i s at risk of suicide. National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) In case of emergency: Call 911 or visit your local emergency room. 1 1 4 4 3 3 2 2 5 5 ASK: \"Are you thinking about killing yourself?\" It's not an easy question , but studies show that asking at -risk individuals if they are experiencing suicidal ideation does not increase suicide attempts or suicidal thoughts. KEEP THEM SAFE: Reducing a person experiencing suicidal ideation's access to highly lethal items or places is an important part of suicide prevention. While this is not always easy, asking if the at -risk person has a plan and removing or disabling the lethal means can make a diffe rence. Be There: Listen carefully and learn what the individual is thinking and feeling. Research suggests acknowledging and talking about suicide may in fact reduce rather than increase suicidal ideation. Help Them Connect: Save the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline's number in your phone so it's there when you need it: 1 -800-273-TALK (8255). You can also use the Crisis Text Line by texting \"HELLO\" to 741741. Additionally, it always helps to make a connection with a trusted individual like a famil y member, friend, spiritual advisor, or mental health professional. Stay Connected: Staying in touch after a crisis or after being discharged from care can make a difference. Studies have shown the number of suicide deaths goes down when someone follo ws up with the at -risk person. 59 Stakeholder Groups Introduction A community coalition or stakeholder group is formed if enough people recognize the need for change and action in a community, about a specific issue . A stakeholder group is a multi -disciplinary diverse group focused on examining a certain issue and creating/implementing actionable steps to bring about change. In Indiana , suicide coalitions across the state are organized into ten regions. One can find out more information about the suicide coalitions here: https://www.in.gov/issp/2377.htm . Beyond suicide coalitions in Indiana, there are many other groups focused on similar topics. For example, Systems of Care groups are focused on improving the access to and quality of behavioral and mental health services for youth and families , and Local Coordinating Councils are focused on planning and coordinating ways f or addressing alcohol and oth er drug problems. These groups help to implement prevention, intervention, and postvention initiatives across the state of Indiana and all have similar aims when it comes to coalition work and community change .

The more you know about your potential partner, the more likely you will be to reach out to the right person and make a case for collaboration that resonates with your partner's priorities and experiences. Be judicious about with whom you connect first. Start with someone who can help you get the lay of the land, who has decision - making authority, or who has positive experiences collaborating in the past. Review the organization's past media presence as th is can help you figure out which issues matter most to them and who their key players are. Has the organization recently experienced a change in leadership? Has the group expressed a need that your collaboration could address? Phase 2: Establish a Rela tionship People are more likely to work with people they know and trust. Plus, collaborations built on existing relationships are more likely to be sustained over time. So, take the time to build a relationship before moving in for the \"ask.\" Whenever you can, make a personal connection. Find a mutual contact who can introduce you to the person with whom you want to connect. \"Break bread\" with your potential partner by asking him to coffee or lunch. Connect with your potential partner's organization on social media and share or retweet the organization's posts. Ask if you can begin attending meetings at your potential partne r's organization or invite them to attend yours. Phase 3: Develop your pitch Develop a short, convincing message that clearly describes what you want from your potential partner, and how you will both benefit. Will working together provide the partner with access to needed resources? Help access hard -to-reach populations? Prevent duplication of efforts? Be concrete. What will collaboration look like? Remember that one size does not fit all when it comes to making a pitch. Your reasons for collaborating with different partners may vary, and your partners may have different reasons for collaborating with you. Phase 4: Choose a Delivery Approach When it finally comes time to ask your potential partner to do something, how will you do so (i.e. send an email)? When choosing an approach, consider your existing re lationship with the person and what you know about their communication style. Although face -to-face meetings are a nice way to add a personal touch, calling or writing potential partners can be effective if you are short on time or need to engage several partners. Consider using a combination of delivery methods. For example, begin by providing background information via email, then follow up with an in -person meeting. IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDER S GUIDE Very few stakeholder groups happen spontaneously. More often, individuals need to actively persuad e or recruit potential partners to work with them. Although recruitment can be as simple as placing a phone call or sending an email, successful recruitment takes time and intentionality if you are looking to build a more long -term, sustainable collaboration. Below are a few steps to go through when thinking through which partners to engage. 61 When convening a stakeholder group, it is important to keep in mind a strategic planning approach that incorporates long -term goals and evaluates outcomes. In the subsequent pages, there are step -by-step instructions on how to utilize a strategic planni ng approach to suicide prevention. These sections follow the outline on the left, with six steps in total. At the end of the document, there is a health equity evaluation tool so teams can check whether their interventions are designed with a n anti -racism health equity lens. This framework was largely adapted from the Suicide Prevention Resource Center's (SPRC) online training \"A Strategic Planning Approach to Suicide Prevention.\" For individuals interested, SPRC offers this free two - to three -hour train ing online, here: https://training.sprc.org/enrol/index.php?id=31 .

STRATEGIC PLANNING WITH SUICIDE PREVENTION INITIATIVES GUIDE , 62 2. Choose long-term goals Without long-term goals, ideas, and strategies, groups can lose direction and not address the ultimate goal. That is why it is vital to choos e a long-term strategy initially before choos ing prevention strategies. As stated below, this long term goal shoul d be specific and actionab le. If one choos es too broad a goal, it may be difficult to implement the goal. For example, betweenthetwo sentences below, the first sentence is a better long term goal as it targetsaspecific group of people and a specific circumstance or setting. Long term goals should surround reduction in suicidal behavior in a... specific group of people, associated with a specific risk factor specific circumstance or setting\"Reduce suicidal behavior in LGBTQIA+ youth in our county.\" \"Reduce suicide deaths in our county.\" Additional ly, does this long-term goal answer the questions listed below. Extent -How widespread is the problem? Disparity -Does the problem represent a health disparity? Capacity -Are there resources that can be directed at the problem? Und erstanding -Is enoug h know n about the problem to take action? * *LGBTQIA+ refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and asexual or allied. Commented [CM10]: Not editable need to find original 63 64 65 Finally,getting to the implementation stage, the group implements all they have planne d. Once the implementation begins, it is vital to simultaneously start evaluation efforts to determine whether goals are being met.Once all of this is completed, the process can start over againand thegroup canoutline new goals and strategies. Regardless of the interventions chosen, it is vital that communities begin having these conversations and determining what can be done with suicide prevention in their area.6.

LOGIC MODEL TEMPLATE As mentioned in the previous pages, it is important to have a logic model wh en strategically planning initiatives and programs. Below is an example of a completed logic model . On the next page is the same logic model, but blank. 67 68 MANAGING COALITION DYNAMICS In a perfect world, every prevention collaboration would come together effortlessly: members would agree right away on goals and processes, then work together harmoniously and efficiently to produce lasting change. But as anyo ne who has started or managed a coalition knows, the reality of group functioning is often a whole lot messier. This tool offers an overview of four stages (originally from the Stages of Development Team Theory ) of team development , accompanied by tips for maximizing productivity and cohesion, reducing conflict, and steering group members toward long -term success. Stage 1: Forming - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - When new groups first come together, members are likely to feel both excited and anxious: eager to get started but also unsure of what will be expected of them an d/or how they might contribute. To support group functioning at this stage, leaders should focus on guiding members toward ownership and investment in the newly formed group. Tips for doing this include the following: \u007f Define the group's mission and goals. The fastest way to give members a voice and reason for participating is to have them help define the direction of the group. Having a clear mission and goals will also help to allay the anxiety of members who are unclear about the group's direction. \u007f Focus on creating group identity and a sense of belonging, rather than accomplishments. Until members develop a sense of shared ownership, any accomplishments will feel false and may be attributed to the leader rather than to the efficacy of the group . \u007f Build trust. Prevention -focused collaborations often bring the same players to the table . These groups often hold deeply held opinions about one another and may or may not feel comfortable working together. Recognizing potential \"turf\" issues early on, and then working collaboratively to build an atmosphere of respect and trust, will lay the foundation for open dialogue and productivity over time. Stage 2: Storming - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Groups in the Storming stage are figuring out how to meet their goals and define their processes. For some members \u2014especially those who are uncomfortable with ambiguity \u2014this phase can generate some frustration. They may vocalize concer ns about the direc tion the group is heading and/or have doubts that identified goals will be met. For leaders, successfully managing the Storming stage and addressing member concerns is crucial to the longevity of the collaboration. Some tips for managing dynamics during th is stage include the following: This was adapted from Prevention Solutions @ EDC's Dynamics\" document, found here: https://pscollaboration.edc.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Manag ing-Coalition from EDC's \"Managing Coalition Dynamics\" document, found here: 69 \u007f Break down larger goals into smaller, achievable steps. This will help members identify clear opportunities for participation and concrete ways to contribute and realize immediate, short - term success. \u007f Redefine goals with concrete, measurable outcomes. Members who are uncomfortable wit h vague processes will rejoice at knowing exactly how success is defined. It is also helpful to begin creating the evaluation design in this phase \u2014and to involve interested members in this process. \u007f Invite members to voice their concerns openly and honestl y. Let members know that their feedback is important and that the input of all members is valued equally. Work together to develop a process for sharing ideas and concerns . Stage 3: Norming - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - In Norming, members begin working independently and/or in small, task -oriented groups, clarifying processes and objectives along the way. Groups in this phase welcome constructive criticism: members feel like they can say what they are thinking, have a sense of belonging to the group, and are realistically optimistic about meeting the group's overarching goals. Though it may appear that the group is now functioning autonomously, groups in the Norming phase benefit enormously fro m smart leadership. Tips for success at this stage include the following: \u007f Delegate responsibility. The Norming phase is a great time to identify and build potential leaders. One way to do so (and increase productivity at the same time) is to delegate tasks to subgroups headed by the collaboration's rising stars. \u007f Refine processes (as needed). While lead ers may feel good about the swell of productivity that often marks the beginning of the Norming phase, be vigilant about identifying and reviewing processes that may hamper workflow or cause frustration for members. \u007f Encourage members to get feedback and s upport. Much of the leadership work of Norming is establishing a culture of positive support. Creating a space for sharing and soliciting feedback as members move toward goals is a great way to do this. Stage 4: Performing - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Groups in the Performing phase are working steadily toward their long -term goals and have a solid number of \"wins\" under their belt. Members are enthusiastic about their work, feel confident about the group's abilities, and are able to anticipate and effectively address potential roadblocks. Leaders may be tempted to take a hands -off approach ; instead, leaders should ensure that members remain engaged and prepare d for potential changes in focus, direction, or leadership. Tips for managing group dynamics in the Performing phase include the following: \u007f Allow group members to assume new roles organically \u2014especially those related to leadership. This will not only help members contin ue to grow and remain engaged but is also critical to the group's long -term sustainability. \u007f Provide opportunities for professional or personal development. Share information about relevant conferences and trainings and invite speakers in to share their expertise. Encouraging professional and personal development not only builds the capacity of your group but also shows members that you are invested in their continued growth and learning. \u007f Celebrate coalition successes a nd wins. Devote dedicated time to praising hard work and letting members know how much they are valued and appreciated. \u007f Identify and tackle new prevention challenges. Collaborations with a proven track record of success are ideally suited to taking on new projects and shifting their focus to address issues. 70 ENSURING CULTURALLY COMPETENT COLLABORATION Cultural competence describes the ability of an individual or organization to interact effectively with people of different cultures. It also means being re spectful and responsive to the health beliefs, practices, and cultural and linguistic needs of diverse population groups. Effective collaboration depends on cultural competence. Although cultural competence is not a quick fix and can not be accomplished simply by following a set of culturally sensitive rules and recommendations, here are some tips for increasing the cultural competence of your collaborative efforts: Make sure that all printed, digital, and audiovisual materials reflect the culture, preferred language, and background of the populations they are meant to serve. For example, in tribal communities, symbols have language; therefore, some terms and their uses can vary depending on the audience's country of origin. Understanding an d using the most appropriate terms and phrases for your intended audience helps to ensure that materials are welcomed and not deemed offensive. Invite a member from the community to co -present. This will help to ensure that your audience feels like they are being heard and represented in a discussion and conveys the message that the knowledge and experiences of community members are respected. For example, if the presenter was speaking about suicide prevention at a church made up of largely Spanish -speaking congregants, it may be helpful to have a Spanish -speaking individual with lived experience speak as well. This was adapted from Prevention Solutions @ EDC's \"Tips for Ensuring a pscollaboration.edc.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Tips -for-Ensuring -a-Culturally - Competent -Collaboration_508compliant.pdf. The graphics are from Noun Project (Languages by supalerk laipawat, shake hands by fajar hasyim, pre sentation by Gregor Cresnar, Language by the Icon Z) Connect with culturally relevant organizations to be your outreach ambassadors. For example, if an organizat ion focuse d on suicide prevention among college students and would like to reach Latino college students, it may partner with a Latino organization on campus to help reach these students. The Latino organization will know the best ways to communicate to La tino college students and help outreac h. If making a presentation, practice remarks with an interpreter (if using one) to rehearse pacing and translation pauses \u2014that is, the time it takes for the interpreter to translate content from one language to another. For example, Spanish uses more words than other languages. As a result, when translating from one language to Spanish, there is a median duration pause of 100 milliseconds longer than for other languages. This helps to reduce confusion among individuals. 71 WORKSHEET: CREATING A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT A memorandum of agreement (MOA) is a written document that describes how two parties will work together to meet a common objective. MOAs help partners specify the purpose of their collaboration, as well as the roles and responsibilities of each partner in achieving articulated goals. MOAs can range from informal (a firm handshake) to formal (a binding legal document that holds parties responsibl e to their commitment). The terms memorandum of agreement and memorandum of understanding (MOU) are often used interchangeably. This tool presents the major sections of a standard MOA, accompanied by a template that can be adapted. Purpose and Scope. This section conveys the \"big picture\" of why and how all parties will work together. It typically includes a clear mission or vision statement that defines the primary purpose of the collaboration and how it will benefit the community. It may also include th e goals and objectives that the collaboration hopes to achieve. Other components may include name s of all parties involved in the collaboration , a brief description of the scope of work and desired outcomes , financial obligations of each party, if applicab le, dates that the agreement is in effect , and key contacts for each party. Background. This section contains a brief description of the agencies participating in the collaboration, as well as any current or historical ties between partners. Responsibi lities under this MOA. This section contains a brief description of how partners will work together (i.e., what they will be doing), as well as individual partner responsibilities. It can also describe expectations for meetings and communication (e.g., fre quency and approach) and the types of management and decision -making processes that will be used. It may also include descriptions of: o How information will be shared across agencies, including any policies or procedures that inform and/or dictate the selected approach. o Partner responsibilities related to evaluation, data collection, data sharing, and reporting. o Who has decision -making a uthority? Some MOAs may benefit from a delineation of decision -making authority. Funding. This section describes each partner's fiscal duties, if any, ensuring that these are consistent with the stated goals and planned activities. Effective Date and S ignature, including: o Duration of the Agreement \u2014the effective date that the agreement begins and how long it will be in effect, as well as circumstances under which the agreement can be modified or terminated. o Signatures \u2014the MOA is not considered in effec t until all parties have signed. Each party should keep an original signed copy.

That is why it is vital to blend and braid funding. Blending funding involves co-mingling the funds into one \"pot ,\" whereas braiding funding involves using multiple s treams to pay for different things. The subsequent templates help to navigate these complex funding frameworks. Step 1: Prior to developing the funding model, you r group must identify what you hope to accomplish by blending and braiding funding. Fiscal coordination strategies are only a means to an end, and to be successful, the end needs to be well defined. Regardless of the scope of your goals, you need to clearly define them and outline what you will be funding. Fill out the questions below. This was adapted from the Spark Policy Institute's Colorado Guide 1: Blending and Braiding: A step by step instructions to develop and expand fiscal coordination. 75 Step 2: Fill in the \"population\" column with the answers to the questions. In the example below, based on a homeless services program, the population includes two age ranges and two types of need - at risk and already homeless. The example program also noted that their population is likely to b e lower income and that some of the youth would be runaways without families. Step 3: Collect information about your funding streams from your fiscal staff, the funder's documentation sent to your organization, the funder's website, or by talking to the funder directly. Review the information and start to enter the specific information that tells you what is allowed and not allowed in the context of your program design . Write that information in the \"funding stream\" columns. EXAMPLE: Population Fundi ng Stream 1 Funding Stream 2 What population do we need to serve? Youth ages 12 -18 Eligible if parent/guardian is income eligible Yes, if homeless At risk of losing their housing Yes, provided the risk of losing housing is leading to risk related to self- sufficiency, out -of-wedlock pregnancy, or keeping a two -parent family together Not eligible, must be homeless TEMPLATE: Population Funding Stream 1 Funding Stream 2 What population do we need to serve? What are the services or interventions that are part of our program? What will our services accomplish , and how will we know? Where are we delivering the services? Who will deliver the services? What infrastructure is needed to support the program? What is the time frame for our funding streams? (including allowability of no -cost extensions) 76 Step 4: Create a list that breaks out into distinct subgroups all the populations and services you want to fund. The goal is to have non -overlapping groups. In the example below, based on a homeless services program, the population includes two age ranges -- (youth ages 12 - 18, young adults ages 19 - 24); two types of need (at risk of being homeless, homeless) ; and three demograph ic factors (low - income, runaway, ha s children). Step 5: Using the template below, place an X for what is allowable by each funding stream. You should end up with a grid that clearly shows what each funding stream can and cannot fund. EXAMPLE: Population Funding Stream 1 Funding Stream 2 What population do we need to serve? Ages 12 -18, at risk of losing housing, low -income families X Ages 12 -18, at risk of losing housing, non -low-income families X Ages 12 -18, at risk of losing housing, runaway (no family income known) X Ages 12 -18, homeless, low -income families X Ages 12 -18, homeless, non -low-income family X X Ages 12 -18, homeless, runaway (no family income known) X TEMPLATE: Population Funding Stream 1 Funding Stream 2 What population do we need to serve? Step 5: Using the previous templates, complete the plan. Make sure to engage the fiscal and programmatic staff in the design of the plan, as they will be responsible for implementing it. 77 COORDINATED FINANCING PLAN __________( enter program/organization name )__________ ___________________( date created )____________________ PROGRAM DESIGN Provide a short overview of the program design, including eligible populations, direct services, and nonservice delivery activities. FUNDING SOURCES Briefly list each funding source, the contact information, the amount, duration, and any critical informa tion to understand the purpose of the funding stream in supporting the program. For example, one funding stream might be comprehensive, supporting all components, while another funding stream might be for primary health care services only. PROGRAM BUDGET Briefly describe the Program Budget . Indicate any key decisions made that relate to the budget, such as the total population served. COST ALLOCATION Briefly describe your overall cost allocation model . Indicate whether you are blending or braiding. Include a list of all the sources of financial information and how to access them. TRACKING AND REPORTING Include a timetable for your reports to your funders, including fiscal and programmatic reporting. Include your tracking and reporting tools. These tools should capture all the information needed for all of your funders. They must include a timesheet to track personnel time spent on specific clients and on non -client -based activities. Include your prot ocol for completion of reports using the information collected. You will want to indicate how frequently programmatic staff must complete the tracking tools and the process for inputting data into various funders' databases or reporting templates. FINANCI AL SYSTEMS Include a brief description of how your Coordinated Financing Plan aligns with existing financial practices and systems. Indicate where the Coordinated Financing Plan requires additional practices or systems and include protocols for those. Address potential need for segregating your funding in your accounting systems. This is critical for many public funding streams -- and particularly important if you are a faith -based organization. CONTRACTING Include an explanation of your contracting sy stem (pre -approved providers, fixed price contracts, capitated contracts, case -rate contracts for multiple services , etc. ). Include an explanation of your reporting requirements to ensure contractors provide sufficient information to meet reporting needs . 78 COALITION ANNUAL REPORT TEMPLATE An annual report is a great way for groups to report out on outcomes. This report can begin with a review of the group's missions, goals, and structure and then summarize the various activities - usually task forces objectives , activities, and outcomes for the year .

Accept their feelings , be compassionate and patient , and provide support without criticism. Use sensitivity during holidays and anniversaries: Events may bring forth memories of the lost loved one and emphasize this loved one's absence. Use the lost loved one's name: Use the name of the person who has die d when talking to survivors. This shows that you have not forgotten this important person and can make it easier to discuss a subject that is often stigmatized. There are numerous postvention resources available to suicide loss survivors. A few are listed below.

If they show any warning signs for suicide, be direct. Tell them it's OK to talk about suicidal ideation . Practice active listenin g techniques and let them talk without judgment. Be understanding: Do not make them feel guilty. Do not make it about you. Listen and be as understanding as possible. Give a hug: Let them know that they are still loved and that you still want them in y our life. Sometimes, a hug can say more than a thousand words. Get them help and take care of yourself: Don't be afraid to get your loved one the help they might need. The Lifeline is always there to talk or chat -- both for crisis intervention and to su pport allies. Helping a loved one through a crisis is never easy.

WORKING WITH SUICIDE LOSS AND ATTEMPT SURVIVORS Supporting someone who has lost a loved one (suicide loss survivors) and individuals with lived experience (suicide attempt survivors) can feel overwhelming and complex. There are ways to help.

In fact, suicide is a leading cause of death in state and federal prisons as well as local jails. Throughout all correctional facilities, the suicide rate is hi gher than that of the general population. In state and federal prisons across the US, the suicide rate is 17 and 13 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively.10 In comparison, jails are 45 and 29 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively.11 This trend of suicide rates being higher for those in jail compared with those in prison is a consistent trend. When looking at correctional facilities, individuals with justice system involvement often have histories of mental health conditions and substanc e use. While it is estimated that approximately 5 percent of people living in the community have a serious mental illness, comparable figures in state prisons and jails are 16 percent and 17 percent, respectively.12 The prevalence of substance use disorde rs is notably more disparate -- with estimates of 8.5 percent in the general public (aged 18 or older) but 53 percent in state prisons and 68 percent in jails .12 Thus , it is clear there is both need and ample opportunity for intervention within both jails and prisons. Justice R esources : Suicide Prevention Frameworks for Correctional Facilities Strategies for Primary Prevention of Suicide Suicide Prevention is Everyone's Business Creating a Supportive Physical Environment for the Mental Wellness of Individuals who are Justice -Involved High Risk Times for Suicide: Individuals who are Justice -Involved Correctional Officer Care Checklist Suicide Training: Individuals Who Work in Correctional Facilities (p. 214 -215) 83 SUICIDE PREVENTI ON FRAMEWORK S FOR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES There are numerous suicide prevention frameworks that have been developed for justice -related settings. In the next few pages, two are outlined. The first is the National Commission on Correctional Health Care 's (NCCHC) standards for both jails and prisons . Listed below are the key components that every suicide prevention program should have, per the NCCHC. Training. All staff members who work with i ndividuals with justice involvement are trained to recognize verbal and behavioral cues that indicate potential suicide and how to respond appropriately. Initial and at least annual training is provided. Identification. The receiving screening form contains observation and interview items related to potential suicide risk. If a staff member identifies someone who is experiencing suicidal ideation, the in dividual is placed on suicide precautions and is referred immediatel y to mental health staff . Referral. There are procedures for referring individuals experiencing suicidal ideation and those who have experienced a suicide attempt to qualified mental health professionals or facilities. The procedures specify a time frame for response to the referral. Evaluation. An evaluation, conducted by a qualified mental health professional, determines the level of suicide risk, level of supervision needed, and need for transfer to an inpatient mental health facility or program. Pati ents are reassessed regularly to identify any change in condition indicating a need for a change in supervision level or required transfer or commitment. The evaluation includes procedures for periodic follow -up assessment after the individual's discharge from suicide precautions. Treatment. Strategies and services to address the underlying reasons (e.g., depression, auditory commands) for an individual's suicidal ideation are to be considered. The strategies include treatment needs when the patient is at heightened risk for suicide as well as follow -up treatment interventions and monitoring strategies to reduce the likelihood of relapse. Housing. Unless constant supervision is maintained, a n individual experiencing suicidal ideation is not isolated but is housed in the general population, mental health unit, or medical infirmary and located in close proximity to staff. All cells The first framework was adapted from NCCHC's frameworks for jails and prisons, found here: NCCHC's webpage on suic ide prevention https://www.ncchc.org/suicide -prevention - resources . The second framework was adapted from SAMHSA's, \"Guidelines for Successful Transition of People with Mental or Substance Use Disorders from Jail and Prison: Implementation Guide\" rooms housing individuals experiencing suicidal ideation are as suicide resistant as possible (e.g., without protrusions that would enable hanging). Monitoring. There are procedures for monitoring an individual identified as \"non-acutely suicidal .\" Unpredictable, documented supervision is maintained, with National Commission on Correctional Health Care 40 irregular intervals no more than 15 minutes apart. Although several protocols exist for monitoring individuals experiencing suicidal id eation , when an individual experiencing suicidal ideation is housed alone in a room, continuous monitoring by staff should be maintained. Other supervision aids (e.g., closed circuit television, companions, or watchers) can supplement, but never substitute for, direct staff monitoring. Communication. Procedures for communication between mental health, medical, and correctional personnel are in place to provide clear and current information. These procedures include communication between transferring autho rities (e.g., county facility, medical/psychiatric facility) and facility correctional personnel. Intervention. There are procedures addressing how to handle a suicide attempt in progress, including appropriate first -aid measures. Notification. Procedures state when correctional administrators, outside authorities, and family members are notified when an individua l has attempted suicide or has died by suicide. Reporting. Procedures for documenting the identification and monitoring of situations involving suicide attempts are detailed, as are procedures for reporting a death by suicide. Review. There are procedu res for mental health, medical, and administrative review, including a psychological autopsy, for deaths by suicide. Debriefing. There are procedures for offering timely debriefing to all affected individuals . Debriefing is a process whereby individuals are given an opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings about an incident (e.g., suicide or attempt), develop an understanding of stress symptoms resulting from the incident, and develop ways to deal with those symptoms. Debriefing can be done by a n in-house response team or outside consultants prepared to handle these highly stressful situations.

Commented [SC12R11]: In this sentence Commented [SC13R11]: 85 The second is the Assess, Plan, Identify, and Coordinate (APIC) framework developed by SAMHSA's GAINS Center's Re -Entry Initiative to provide procedural guidelines for recidivism reduction , successful reentry, and individual recovery. The APIC framework is outlined below. ASSESS individual clinical and social needs and public safety risk \u007f Guideline 1: Conduct universal screening as early in the booking/intake process as feasible and throughout the criminal justice continuum to detect substance use disorders, mental disorders, suicidal ideation, co-occurring substance use and mental disorders, and criminogenic risk. Valid , reliable , and evidence -based screening instruments for the target population should be used (e.g. , Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire) . \u007f Guideline 2: For individuals with positive screens, follow up with comprehensive assessments to guide appropriate program placement and service delivery. The assessment process shou ld involve obtaining information on the following: o Basic demographics and pathways to criminal involvement o Clinical needs (e.g., identification of probable or identified diagnoses, severity of associated impairments, and motivation for change) o Strengths an d protective factors o Social and community support needs (e.g., housing, education, employment, and transportation) o Public safety risks and needs, including changeable (dynamic) and unchangeable (static) risk factors or behaviors and attitudes that research indicates are related to criminal behavior. PLAN for the treatment and services required to address the individual's needs, both in custody and upon reentry. \u007f Guideline 3: Develop individualized treatment and service plans using information obtained from the risk and needs screening /assessment process. o Determine the appropriate level of treatment and intensity of supervision for individuals with behavioral health needs. o Identify and target individuals' multiple criminogenic needs to have th e most impact on recidivism o Address the aspects of individuals' disorders that affect ability to promote effectiveness of interventions. o Develop strategies for integrating appropriate recovery support services into service delivery models. o Acknowledge dosage of treatment as an important factor in recidivism reduction, requiring the proper planning and identification of what, where, and how intensive services provided to individuals will be. 86 \u007f Guideline 4: Develop collaborative responses between behavioral health and criminal justice that match individuals' levels of risk and behavioral health need with the appropriate levels of supervision a nd treatment. IDENTIFY required community and correctional programs responsible for post -release services. \u007f Guideline 5: Anticipate that the periods following release (the first hours, days, and weeks) are critical and identify appropriate interventions as part of transition planning practices for individuals with co -occurring mental and substance use disorders leaving corr ectional settings. Consider the individual's support system and access to social capital. \u007f Guideline 6: Develop policies and practices that facilitate continuity of care through the implementation of strategies that promote direct linkages for post - release treatment and supervision agencies. COORDINATE the transition plan to ensure implementation and avoid gaps in care with community -based services . \u007f Guideline 7: Support adherence to treatment plans and supervision conditions through coordinated strategies. o Provide a system of incentives and graduated sanctions to promote participation in treatmen t, ensure that goals and decisions are made by the individual , and employ problem -solving strategies to encourage compliance, promote public safety, and improve treatment outcomes. o Establish clear protocols across systems on handling behaviors that constitute technical violations of community supervision c onditions. \u007f Guideline 8: Develop mechanisms to share information , mindful of confidentiality, from assessments and treatment programs across different points in the criminal justice system to advance cross -system goals. \u007f Guideline 9: Encourage cross traini ng to facilitate collaboration between workforces and agencies working with people with co -occurring mental and substance use disorders who are involved in the criminal justice system. \u007f Guideline 10: Collect and analyze data to evaluate program performance , identify gaps in performance , and plan for long -term sustainability. The third guideline is the American Correctional Association's (ACA) standards. To find out more information about the ACA's framework , visit their website at www.aca.org or complete their \"Understanding and Preventing Suicides guideline? 87 STRATEGIES FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION OF SUICIDE Primary prevention strategies reduce suicide risk for individuals who are involved in the justice system . This impact occurs directly (such as increasing opportunities for individuals to connect with others) and indirectly (such as promoting hope). More information can be found about this through the University of Oklahoma's Hope Research Center here: https://www.ou.edu/tulsa/hope . This was adapted from AFSP's, \"Suicide Prevention Resource Guide: National Response Plan for Suicide Prevention in Corrections\" document, found here: ncchc.org/filebin/Publications/NCCHC -AFSP_Suicide_Prevention_Resource_Guide.pdf Create a healthy correctional facility - Each facility is like a \"village behind walls.\" - Encourage the following: provide safe housing, reduce emotional/physical trauma (e.g., celebrate the individual's strengths, define treatment options with individuals), promote gender and cultural awareness, and support healthy activities and daily routine Promote connectedness - Ensure that incarcerated persons, especially those housed alone, can maintain regular contact with family and other supports, regardless of administrative status or financial resources. - Reduce isolation of individuals with justice involvement, given the n egative psychological . - - Lower barriers to seeking mental health care - Embrace reducing stigma, ensuring confidentiality, and maintaining an effective referral system Reduce access to the means for suicide - Focus on locations where individuals with justice involvement are isolated Reduce the harmful use of alcohol and drugs - Provide addictions treatment that includes treatment options and follows NCCHC guidelines Promote resilience - Educate individuals with justice involvement about coping with stress and asking for help o Emphasize the opportunity for each individual to experience himself or herself as part of a community whose members can make a difference to others. o Promote peer -to-peer outreach such as, \"Suicide is Forever: Recognizing & Preventing Suicide,\" produced by individuals with justice system involvement. - Provide work skills development and opportunities, educating individuals with justice involvement about life skills, coping skills, and money management. Promote general health - Encourage healthy physical activities and healthy nutrition - Ensure restorative sleep and control noise levels - Lower barriers to primary care, ensuring access to effective management of chronic illness /pain 88 SUICIDE PREVENTION IS EVERYONE'S BUSINESS All staff members who work with individuals with justice involvement must be trained in suicide prevention. Everyone should be provided at least a basic knowledge about risk factors, warning signs, what to do if they think someone may be at risk, and the ov erall suicide prevention plan. While some training needs overlap, each group has its own priorities and roles in suicide prevention. Custody st aff These individuals are the eyes, ears, and leaders of every correctional and detention facility -- the first to see and first to respond. Training should enable them to: Recognize and respond effectively to warning signs of impending suicide or self -harm Intervene to interrupt a suicidal a ct in progress Recognize when an individual needs to be referred for mental health care and ensure the referral is made in a timely and effective manner Qualified mental health professionals These individuals need to possess up -to-date knowledge and skills necessary to assess and treat individuals experiencing suicidal ideation or displaying self -harming behaviors in a manner that ensures appropriate safety precautions are in pl ace. Training should enable them to: Interview and build a therapeutic alliance with vulnerable in dividuals while eliciting the information necessary to determine if the individual is \"acutely or non -acutely suicidal \" Perform and document a thorough sui cide risk assessment Formulate and implement a treatment plan that addresses safety and treatment needs using the least restrictive means consistent with clinical guidelines and institutional policies Qualified health care professionals These individuals a re on the front line of health care; in dividuals who die by suicide have often recently been treated for primary medical problems, including chronic disorders, substance use disorders, or pain conditions. Training should enable them to: Screen for suicide risk while providing primary care Recognize the warning signs of a mental health crisis, including risk of suicide or self -injury Recognize signs and symptoms of common mental health conditions Refer patients in need of mental health services in a timely and effective manner Executive leaders hip These individuals are responsible for creating regulations, policies, and procedures . They need training focused on the public health dimensions of suicide prevention, including primary preventive measures that have the potential to reduce risk throughout an entire system. Training should enable them to: Review risk factors and warning signs for suicide and institutional procedures for identification and intervention for individuals at risk Ensure that individuals have easy access to mental health care (including crisis/emergency care) to meet their needs in a safe manner This was adapted from AFSP's, \"Suicide Prevention Resource Guide: National Response Plan for Suicide Prevention in Corrections\" document, found here: ncchc.org/filebin/Publications/NCCHC -AFSP_Suicide_Prevention_Resource_Guide.pdf This was adapted from AFSP's, \"Suicide Prevent ion Resource Guide: National Response 89 CREATING A SUPPORTIVE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE JUSTICE -INVOLVED Planning Considerations It is essential for staff to be able to perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner. Facilities should think through how staff will perform their rounds, respond to emergencies, and maintain visual and audial control of their surroundings. This may change things like location of staff and nurse workstations in relation to observed cells, corridor locations and connection s, and glazed window openings. Physical Characteristics Facilities need to review the physical environment to identify items that could be used for a suicide attempt (e.g., bed sheets). Visibility is critical when monitoring individuals experiencing suicidal ideation . Cells should be glazed to the greatest extent possible, allowing trained supervisors to view the interior of a cell in its entirety (shown in the diagram below). Floor drain s and air vents, plumbing and lighting fixtures, and furniture must be carefully selected to prevent any opportunity for an individual with justice involvement to attempt suicide . Where small gaps or voids may be present, tamper -resistant security -grade ca ulking or grout should be used . Environmental Aspects Environment has a profound impact on wellness. For example, e xcessive noise, which is prevalent in correctional institutions, can lead to sleep loss and fragmentation. Such noise should be mitigated through the strategic use of acoustical materials. Optimally, o bservation cells should have natural light and exterior views, as there is evidence that greater exposure to daylight can reduce stress and depression, and the absence of windows has been linked to higher rates of anxiety. Germany does an excellent job applying this model -- learn more here: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/opinion/what -we-learned -from -german - prisons.html . By eliminating the features of a space that might be considered vulnerabilities with reg ard to safety, and including features that improve wellness, the design of a facility can meet the mission of health and safety.

Following new legal problems (e.g., within 48 hours of a court appearance, new charges, additional sentences, institutional proceedings, denial of parole) After the receipt of bad news regarding self or family After admittance to segregation or single -cell housing After suffering humiliation (e.g., sexual assault) or rejection Upon admission (e.g., 2 to 14 days following inca rceration) This was adapted from AFSP's, \"Suicide Prevention Resource Guide: National Response Plan for Suicide Prevention in Corrections\" document, found here: ncchc.org/filebin/Publications/NCCHC -AFSP_Suicide_Prevention_Resource_Guide.pdf It is important to understand that suicide can occur at any time, so focusing too narrowly on the \"typical\" risks and times can be dangerous. However, certain times and situations are particularly high - risk for individuals with justice involvement who may be experiencing suicidal ideation. 91 CORRECTIONAL OFFICER CARE CHECKLIST Given the many duties and stressors of the job, it is vital that correctional officers practice self -care. Below is a list that was originally developed for COVID but was adapted to fit all situations for the purpose of this toolkit. The first half of the document explains how officers can care for themselv es and the second explains how officers can care for others on their team. Take care of yourself as much as you possibly can: \u007f Prioritize your basic needs while working o Take breaks to eat, even snacks, and drink water or other healthy fluids o Pause and take a moment to mindfully deep breathe, especially after stressful situations o Check in with yourself about how you are doing/feeling at the beginning, middle, and end of each shift or at least every 6 hours when working an extended shift o Ask for help when you need it Consider seeking support from spiritual care providers in your setting Talk with allies/trusted co -workers and receive support from one another o Practice m indfulness Set aside 5 -10 minutes daily to process uncomfortable emotions Use \"accept the things you cannot control \" Acknowledge, accept, and find time to process things that are not in your control Accept your anxious, helpless, and hopeless thoughts and let them wash through you like a wave as you turn your attention to the present Remind yourself that any stressful feelings you experience are understandable Exercise self -compassion , saying \"I am doing the best I can in any given moment \" o Use \"both/and \" statements to promote self -compassion and clarify distressing contradictory feelings - e.g. \"I'm both a dedicated healthcare worker or correctional officer expected to care for individuals with justice involvement no matter what, and I am an involved fam ily member who wants to care for loved ones at home\" \u007f Prioritize your basic needs outside of work o Make sleep a priority and m ake time to move or exercise o Engage in activities you find pleasurable and/or calming/relaxing o Spend time with people you care about and who understand/value your feelings o Limit your substance use o Ask for help when you need it (symptoms of critical stress include struggling for mean ing and purpose, ruminating over incident(s), loss of sleep or appetite, distancing from friends or family, inability to focus, and finding no pleasure in hobbies/activities) Seek out spiritual care support resources in the community Seek individual thera py and/or medication if you feel too distressed This was adapted from Caring Communities' \"COVID -19 Psychological Wellness Guide: Staff at Facilities\" document, found here: https://med.emory.edu/departments/psychiatry/_documents/tips.staffforensicfacili ties.pdf . The symptoms here: https://ww w.lexipol.com/resources/blog/causes -of-stress -for-correctional -officers/ 92 Take team: Take care of your team: \u007f Look out for each other \u007f Check -in regularly (informally and formally) with team members o Use huddle time to see how providers and staff are emotionally and physically coping with stress and demands o Talk informally with colleagues about things happening at work o Chat with colleagues about what they are doing to relax outside of work \u007f Be intentional about good communication o Respect differences and interact with tolerance, patience, and compassion o Take time to listen to others , talking clearly and calmly with colleagues o Address tensions, concerns, problems, or conflicts and strive to resolve them \u007f Foster team unity o Prioritiz e collaboration o Try to help your colleagues to problem solve o Step forward to help when you can and allow others to step forward when they can o Use humor when appropriate o Construct a gratitude box where team members can write small notes to each other o Be intentional, pause, debrief, and support one another after tough cases/ situations o Seek out peer and team consultation when needed \u007f Recognize and celebrate the helpful and/or creative contributions of colleagues o Encourage formal recognition by starting a sticky -note wall in a break room o End shifts with a huddle , having everyone thank team member s for something they did o Thank team members throughout the shift for small and large ways they were helpful o Recognize formally people who go above and beyond th e call of duty \u007f Develop mental health and trauma -informed practices o Request support and debriefings from a trained mental health provider o Have leadership set the example in self -care practices o Develop trauma -informed trainings so staff can understand thei r own triggers \u007f Continue developing skills for managing high -stress situations o Ensure you're up to date with information about how to handle high -risk situations o Stop, breathe, think, and then act when confronted with a high -risk situation o Take the extra t ime and effort to ensure your own safety o Recognize and manage anticipatory anxiety Remember that you are not alone, and your reaction is understandable Process your reactions Visualize packaging up and throwing away the anxiety Keep moving forward mentally o Be attuned to situations that raise moral concerns and discuss and address those with your colleagues and consultants o Tell yourself what you would tell a friend when they are most scared o Provide colleagues distressed about high -risk situations : Your presence and listening ear A genuine human and emotional response Empathy Positive regard 93 Employers Introduction Over 70% of individuals who die by suicide in Indiana are within working ages of 25 -64, based on the data section at the beginning of this toolkit. In the same way that we look to schools to enact youth -focused suicide prevention programs, em ployers can play a similar role for their employees. Employers can reduce suicides in their workforce by becoming aware of the real threat of suicide to their workforce, creating policies to prevent suicides, and developing a protocol, should a suicide o ccur. Business leaders also have significant leadership status in the community. It is a best practice in prevention spaces to include business leaders in the community in prevention work. That being said, it is easy to see why workplaces would need to be engaged in this work.

High job demands (long hours, workload, time pressure, poor management) 2. Lack of role clarity, job responsibilities, and expectations 3. Unsupportive job environment (low pay, lack of recognition and few career advancement opportunities, low job security) 4. Unfair workplace pra ctices and lack of management transparency 5. Misalignment of job functions with skills and personal values Actionable strategies for management and staff: 1. Stay positive and reinforce the value that employees bring to the organiz ation 2. Set a regular employee check -in to address job concerns and give/receive constructive feedback 3. Recognize and reward achievements 4. Provide explanation/rationale for decisions/changes in workplace practices 5.

Six Key Areas for a Mentally Healthy Workplace 97 Implementing a Workplace Mental Health Initiative As an employer, it can be overwhelming to think through a workplace mental health prevention initiative. Luckily, a lot of the work has already been done by the American Psychiatric Foundation's Center for Workplace Mental Health and Employers Health's Right Direction program, found here: https://www.rightdirectionforme.com/for -employers/ . This website outlines, for employers, the steps that need to be taken to address depression and mental health in the wo rkplace. To fully implement the Right Direction framework, the following steps need to be taken: Activity Description Rationale Personnel Form the project team Engage a diverse team of stakeholders Broad representation creates ownership, customization, and consensus Leadership, EAP, HR, marketing and communications, organizational development Set success measures Establish project objectives and how you will measure results Gain project team consensus on what will be measured and desired results to sustain team engagement Leader (C-suite level, director, team leader, business owner) Develop communications plan Create project name, branding graphics, and customized messages Sustained and consistent promotion communicates commitment Marketing, Communications Share roll -out plan Engage key trusted leaders from the project team before launch on expectation of their roles Employees will ask key trusted leaders about the project. Responses will greatly influence employee receptivity and engagement Organizational development and/or EAP Launch Hold \"town hall\" meetings, conference calls, electronic messages to promote education and train employees Reinforce that leadership is fully supportive, a diverse team developed the initiative, and career opportunities will not be jeopardized by seeking help All project team members Measure results Collect data on a quarterly basis and share with the project team, including leaders Data and positive results provide the basis for increased investment in growing the initiative, tools, resources , and more. Don't forget to celebrate success! HR or another designated project team member This was adapted from Right Direction's \"Checklist for Planning the Impl ementation of Right Direction as Part of Your Workplace Mental Health initiative\" document, which can be found here: https://www.rightdirectionforme.com/wp -content/uploads/2020/04/Mental -Health - Initiative -Checklist.pdf 98 Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) It is well known that not all EAPs are built the same. There are 1 -800-EAPs, embedded EAPs, and full service or \"top tier\" EAPs. Employers should remember that they are customers of their EAP, and they should do their due diligence to ensure the best benefits. Have an EAP? Evaluate the EAP's suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention capabilities Promote EAP services and evaluate impact Hold the EAP s accoun table by asking the following questions Don't have an EAP? Find an EAP that is right for your business Make sure the EAP is prepared to deal with situations involving suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and deaths by suicide This was adapted from Workplace Suicide Prevention's \"Workplace Suicide Prevention & The Role and Potential of the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), found here: What services does your EAP cover? Are these services available 24/7? 2. Who answers the calls of the EAP and how are they trained and supervised? What professional education, preparation, and certifications do they have? Are they licensed? 3. How are counselors selected and trained? Are certain licenses or other credentials required to be a part of the EAP provider network? 4. What types of training have EAP providers received? Speci fically, when was the last time they received training in suicide risk formation and treatment? 5. How is the EAP reporting utilization? How does your workplace's utilization rate compare to others in your industry , and what can be done by the EAP and by you as the employer to encourage more utilization ? 6. Do your employees know about your EAP services and how to access them? 7. For those who havve used the EAP, how satisfied were they with the services? Did the services have a positive impact on the problem for wh ich they were seeking support? 8. When employees completed EAP services, did the EAP follow -up (or attempt to follow -up) with the employee to make sure all needs were adequately met? 9. How does your EAP interact with health plans? Are EAP providers also provide rs of outpatient mental health ? If not, are they well -versed in the benefits of employees to make effective and seemless referrals ? 10. How is your EAP measuring outcomes? Can they also provide you with return -on-investment and other cost-benefit analysis? 11. How is the EAP promoting upstream mental health efforts like prevention, resilience, p ositive psychology, and work -life integration? 12. Are there general mental health screening or other wellness tools the EAP can offer the workers to help them understand and monitor their menta l wellness? Does the organization also assess its own culture of system -level mental wellness? 13. Does the EAP have experience serving clients in your industry? If yes, what are some recommendations that they have to improve how EAP servic es are promoted and offered at your workplace? 14. Is the employer receiving regular reports (i.e. bi -annual, annual) from the EAP on utilization, presenting problems, satisfaction, and other workplace outcomes? 15. Does the EAP provider manager or HR offer a trai ning on how to best support an employee experiencing a mental health or suicide crisis? Are there additional staff training on skills needed to idenitify and assist employees in distress? 99 HIERARCHY OF CONTROLS ONE -PAGER Organizations often can feel overwhelmed sorting through how to tackle suicide prevention in their organization. One way to think through different strategies is the number of people the intervention would impact and the effectiveness of the intervention. The chart below, adapted from NIOSH's Hierarchy of Controls, illustrates this thought process . This was adapted from Workplace Suicide Prevention's \"A Report of Findings to Direct the Development of National Guidelines for Workplace Suicide Prevention.\" The original document can be found here: https://workplacesuicideprevention.com/wp -content/uploads/2019/10/National -Guidelines -Report.pdf . Eliminate Substitute Redesign Educate Encourage Most Effective Eliminate threats to psychological safety Bullying, toxic management practices, etc. Substitute mental health promotion/protective factors Cultivating a sense of belonging, volunteering, etc. Redesign work culture for optimal well -being Access to quality mental healthcare, changing the process of performance reviews to be more collaborative, mindful of how psychological distress impacts work abilities, etc. Encourage personal resilience and recovery Individual services, single work adaptations, etc. Educate workers on mental health and suic ide prevention Gatekeeper trainings, lunch and learn sessions, etc. Least Effective Commented [SC15]: The IDOH logo on this page is different. Should it be? 100 POSTVENTION GUIDE FOR MANAGERS After a suicide, it is vital for workplaces to act. Below is a 10 -step postvention guide for managers after a suicide. There are three phases explained: immediate, short -term, and long -term. IMMEDIATE: Acute Phase \u007f Coordinate: Contain the crisis. o Identify a main point person to coordinate all postvention efforts and related communication o Contact for professional clean up (after the investigation is completed) if required by a suicide in the workplace. o Contact victims ' assistance. \u007f Notify: Protect and respect the privacy rights of the deceased employee and their loved ones during death notification. o Distribute death notification memo to staff \u007f Communicate: Reduce the potential for additional suicide deaths. o Review safe messaging guidelines for external and internal communication strategies and media recommendations for reporting on suicide for help developing public communications plans. o Develop an internal communication plan to document what is and is not k nown and what to say if the family does not want the cause of death revealed . o Develop an external communication plan that identifies a spokesperson and draft a statement for the media . \u007f Support: Offer practical assistance to family. o Bring easy -to-heat and nutritious frozen meals to grieving family. o Offer the family of the deceased assistance by packing up the personal belongings at the workplace and bringing them by the home. Always call ahead to be sure the family will be there when you deliver the items. o Ask the bereaved person or family what can be done to help and, when possible, arrange to provide the support. Some common supports that help are: Keep a list of phone calls, visitors, and people who bring food and gifts Organize the mail ( e.g., bills, cards, newspaper notices) Offer to make calls to people they wish to notify Help with errands ( e.g., childcare, house -sitting, lawn care, laundry) This was adapted from the Workplace Postvention Task Force of the American Association of Suic idology and the Workplace Task Force of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention's \"A Manager's Guide to Suicide Postvention in Phase \u007f Link: Identify and link impacted employees to additional support resources and refer those most affected to professional mental health services. o Contact EAP to develop customized response s (e.g., grief counseling, education, and community counseling resources) . o Compile and promote a list of suicide bereavement -specific support resources. \u007f Comfort: Support, comfort, and promote healthy grieving of the employees who have been impacted by the loss. o Participate in mourning activities (e.g., funerals, memorial serv ices, etc.). o Instead of enshrining the desk or other workspace, suggest to co -workers that they help create a memory album or quilt for the bereaved family or donate to a charity appreciated by the deceased (or the deceased's family). \u007f Restore: Restore equ ilibrium and optimal functioning in the workplace. o Develop a return -to-work schedule for those most profoundly impacted. Conduct peer supervision with other managers to evaluate postvention process. \u007f Lead: Build and sustain trust and confidence in organiza tional leadership. o Leadership provides personalized, reassuring communication , helping team transition from crisis to healing. LONGER -TERM: Reconstructing Phase - Honor: Prepare for anniversary reactions and other milestone dates. o Convene group most affected to see if honoring the loss around the anniversary or milestone event would be appreciated and follow safe memorialization practices supported by research. - Sustain: Transition postvention to suicide prevention. o Review comprehensive approach to suicide prevention for next steps. o Investigate state and local suicide prevention efforts for volunteer opportunities.

Sincerely, [Name of CEO] 104 Faith -based Introduction While faith -based entities have not historically been involved with suicide prevention work, they offer a unique opportunity for prevention. Faith -based entities often provide individuals with counseling and serve as central community -building entities. In fact, the research has shown that religion is a protective factor in suicide prevention .13 As a faith -based entity, these organizations already have a lot on their plates , so suicide prevention can seem like a lot o n top of typical goals. However, the good news is that suicide prevention can be easily integrated into existing organizational efforts. Of course, the interventions may vary depending on the traditions of the particular faith.

Below is a quick reference guide on mental illness for faith leaders. Mental Illness is Common In the United States, 1 in 5 people have a mental illness 1 in 25 people have a serious mental illness 1 in 12 people have a substance use disorder OBSERVABLE SIGNS : Some Signs that may Raise a Concern about Mental Illness These observations may help identify an individual with mental illness; they are not definitive signs of mental illness. Further mental health clinical assessment may be needed. Categories of Observation Examples of Observation Does something not make sense in context? Cognition: Understanding of Situation, memory, concentration Seems confused or disoriented to person, time, and place Has gaps in memory, answers questions inappropriately Affect/Mood: Eye contact, outbursts of emotion/indifference Appears sad/depressed or overly high -spirited Overwhelmed by circumstances, switches emotions abruptly Speech: Pace, continuity, vocabulary (Is there difficulty with English language?)

Find a good, safe place (for both) to talk Express willingness to be t here for the person Seek immediate assistance if a person poses a danger to self or others; call 911 SUICIDE : Thoughts of suicide should always be taken seriously. A person who is experiencing suicidal ideation is a psychiatric emergency. Call 911. Warning Signs of Suicide Risk Factors for Suicide Often talking or writing about death or suicide Comments about being hopeless, helpless, or worthless, no reason for living Withdrawal from friends, family, and community Reckless behavior or engaging in risky activities Dramatic mood changes Loss and other risk events (e.g., death, financial or legal difficulties, relationship breakup, bullying) Previous suicide attempts History of trauma or abuse Having firearms in the home Chronic physical i llness, chronic pain Exposure to the suicide -related behavior of others History of suicide in family REFERRAL : Making a Referral to a Mental Health/Medical Professional When to Make a Referral Dealing with Resistance to Help Assessing the Person Level of distress - How much distress, discomfort, or anguish is he/she feeling? How well is he/she able to tolerate, manage , or cope? Level of functioning - Is he/she capable of caring for self? Able to problem solve and make decisions? Possibility for danger - danger to self or others, including thoughts of suicide or hurting others Tips on making a mental health referral Identify a mental health professional, have a list Communicate clearly about the need for referral Make the referral a collaborative process between you and the person and/or family Reassure person/family you will journey with them Be clear about the difference between spiritual support and professional clinical care Follow -up; remain connected; support reintegration Offer community resources, support groups Resistance to seeking help may come from stigma, not acknowledging a problem, past experience, hopelessness, cultural issues, or religious concepts . Learn about mental health and treatments to help dispel misunderstandings Continue to journey with the person/family; seek to understand barriers Use stories of those who have come through similar situations; help the person realize he/she is not alone and that people can recover Reassure that there are ways to feel better, to be connected, and to be functioning well If a person of faith, ask how faith can give him or her strength to take steps toward healing If you believe danger to self or others is imminent, call 911. 107 TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE GUIDE There is a commonly held fear that talking about suicide might make matters worse by further upsetting the person or even putting the idea in their head. Research has consistently proven this theory wrong and has proven instead that talking about suicidal ideation can be a relief to a person experiencing suicidal ideation . However , it can be helpful to keep the following in mind when talking to someone experiencing suicidal ideation. Ask the person directly about suicidal ideation , such as, \"Are you having thoughts of suicide\" or \"Are you thinking about killing yourself?\" Asking the person about suicide - related thoughts will allow them the chance to talk about their problems and show them that someone cares. Avoid asking in leading or judgmental ways such as , \"You're not thinking of doing anything stupid, are you?\" Listen to the person's responses without judgement. Let them talk about why they want to die. This can be a relief to the person. Don't try to convince the person that suicide is wrong or tell them how much they would hurt their family if they died. Such judgmental approaches will shut down communication an d the opportunity for the person to get support. Tell the person at risk that you care and want to help . Ask them how they would like to be supported and if there is anything you can do to help. For further training in this area, please look into g etting trained in QPR or SAFE TALK. 3. 5. 2. 4. 1. 3. This was adapted from an article on the Conversation called \"How to ask someone you're worried about if they're thinking Model Suicide Prevention Policy If a leader learns of an individual considering suicide or talking about self -harm, they are to contact ___(individual)____ for instruc tions on how to proceed. If ___(individual)____ cannot be reached immediately or the concern appears to be an emergency, immediately contact 911. Below are five things you must do before the individual leaves. If they do leave before you are able to have a full conversation with them, you must contact 911 immediately: Ask them the tough questions. Research shows you asking them if they are experiencing suicidal ideation will not \"give them the idea\" or \"make them shy away from talking to you.\" Here are s ome ways you can ask it: oDo you ever wish you could go to sleep and never wake up? oSometimes when people feel sad, they have thoughts of harming or killing themselves. Have you had such thoughts? oAre you thinking about killing yourself? Recognize the limits of confidentiality . There may be something s you should keep confidential -- self-harm and suicide are not . If they ask you to keep it secret, your response needs to be , \"I understand this is difficult for you to talk about, but I want to make sure you are safe. I can't make any promises about what we are about to talk about.\" Start a support network with others . Connect them with someone in their life at home who they feel safe to talk to about their suicidal ideation . If they are und er the age of 18, you must inform their legal guardian(s). Use good judgment because not everyone is a good fit to be a support. Also, when you find someone, make sure they understand what you are asking of them and get their confirmation they are willing to do it. See if they have professional counseling. Ask if the individual is already in counseling . If they are, get the name and phone number of who they are seeing. If a person is talking about self -harm and/or suicidal ideation, there is a need for therapy. We encourage church leadership and congregation members to take the role of support and refer th is person to licensed professional counseling for mental health treatment. Counselors are bound to HIPPA, so make sure , as the lead support from the church for thi s person , you ask the parent or individual (if they are over the age of 18) to sign a release so you can check in on how you can support the person. Offer transportation, mentorship, and any other resources that are available and communicate this to the counselor. MODEL FAITH -BASED ORGANIZATI ON PREVENTION POLICY If an individual presents with suicidal ideation at a faith -based institution, it is vital that the institution have some sort of suicide prevention policy in place. A sample policy is listed below. This was adapted from Church and Mental Health's \"Church Suicide Prevention Policy,\" which can -suicide - prevention -policy -free-digital -download/ 109 Do not leave a person at imminent risk of suicide alone. If you have any suspicions that a person is seriously considering harming himself or herself, let the person know that you care, that he or she is not alone, and that you are there to help. You may have to work with the person's family to ensure that he o r she will be adequately supported until a mental health professional can provide an assessment. In some cases, you may have to accompany the person to the emergency room at an area hospital or crisis center. If the person is uncooperative, combative, or o therwise unwilling to seek help, and if you sense that the person is in acute danger, call 911 or (800) 273 -TALK. Tell the dispatcher that you are concerned that the person with you \"is a danger to [himself or herself],\" or \"cannot take care of [himself or herself].\" These key phrases will alert the dispatcher to locate immediate care for this person with the help of police. Do not hesitate to make such a call if you suspect that someone may be a danger to himself or herself. It could save that person's lif e. There are specific things you can do to help in the moment when someone talks about self - harm or suicide. Take these tips that come from the Suicide Prevention Lifeline: Take your loved one seriously: Some people feel that kids who say they are going to hurt or kill themselves are \"just doing it for attention.\" But if your child, friend, or family member confides thoughts of suicide, believe them, and get them help. Listen with empathy and provide support: A fight or breakup might not seem like a bi g deal, but for a young person it can feel immense. Sympathize and listen. Minimizing what your child or friend is going through can increase his or her sense of hopelessness. Learn the warning signs: Friends sometimes let friends know if they are thinki ng about suicide or dying. Other times, changes in behavior may show that someone is struggling. Don't keep suicide a secret: If your friend is considering suicide, don't promise to keep it a secret. Tell him or her you can help, but you need to involve other people, like a trusted adult. Neither of you have to face this alone. Make sure you have the following resources always available to give out to people who ma y inquire or you feel need to have them: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (available 24/7) https://twitter.com/800273TALK 110 Crawl Crawl steps do not require money, training, resources, or paid staff. They are beginner steps for easing into creating your mental health ministry. All faith -based entities can implement crawl steps. Educate yourself on suicide prevention strategies for faith -based communities with resources such as \"Mental Health: A Guide for Faith Leaders\" from the American Psychiatric Association Foundation, found Refer to mental illness within sermons or messages Within wee kend services , pray for people who are living with mental illness and their families Invite people who are living with mental illness to share their testimony in a service Give the members of the faith -based organization a survey that asks them questions r elated to mental health Provide a referral list of mental health resources available in your community and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) Educate and raise awareness in your organization by inviting mental health professionals to speak about mental illness Provide space for free NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) support groups and substance use -related groups like Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Take a meal to someone newly diagnosed with mental ill ness Befriend someone living with mental illness - go to a movie together or get a cup of coffee Give hope to people who are mentally ill b y providing encouraging connections: call, text, e - mails, letters, etc. ORGANIZATION MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGY : Crawl, Walk, Run A faith -based organization's mental health strategy can be built over time, adapting to address existing needs in the organization and community . It is recommended that entities start small and gradually expand, following the se three stages : crawl, walk, and run. CRAWL RUN WALK This was adapted from Kay Warren's site. The specific document was called \"A Church - Initiated Mental Health Strategy,\" which can be found here: http://kaywarren.com/mentalhealthandthechurch/ 111 Walk Walk steps require some training and minimal financial support. There is a greater level of commitment, but most faith -based entities can take these steps. Preach sermons or messages specifically about mental illness Start mental health -specific ministries such as support groups for adults and youth Start a Celebrate Recovery or other support group as a ministry Create care teams of three or four individuals who will commit to an on -going relationship with an individual or family to help with basic needs (helping with household tasks, transportation to doctor visits, basic home repairs, etc.) Train volunteers to be \"companions\" during a service to anyone appearing distressed, depressed, or lonely Regularly connect members of your faith -based organization with opportunities to serve Help connect people in your faith -based entity with individuals who have similar mental health challenges (with their permission) Build a mental health library with books and resources available Use local mental health professionals to offer frequent educational meetings for your staff, volunteers, and parents Run Run steps require a higher level of commitment, more extensive training, financial support, and trained staff. Some faith -based organizations can take these steps.

Below is a checklist for faith leaders to work through to determine whether they feel equipped. Prevention Attitudes \u007f I preach/teach my congregation about suicide with an awareness that some members may have suicide -related thoughts or experiences. \u007f When with someone who has been affected by suicide, I am aware of my attitudes about suicide that may help or hinder help -giving or help -seeking.

Utilizing safe messaging helps to mitigate the risk of suicide contagion. The following are some practical Do's and Don'ts when crafting public messaging. DO'S - Helpful Practices for Public Messaging DON'TS -Problematic Practices in Public Messaging DO use proper language. Use the phrase \"died by suicide\" rather than words like \"committed\" or \"completed\" suicide. DO encourage help -seeking behavior. Make concrete recommendations to referral sources and offer steps that can be taken to seek out crisis service providers. One way to offer a concrete resource is to suggest the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. DO emp hasize prevention. Emphasize that suicide is a preventable tragedy and steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of suicide -related crises in the community . DO educate the community about warning signs, risk factors , and protective factors about suicid e. Share how people might be able to identify people experiencing a suicide -related crisis. DO highlight effective treatments for mental health and mental illness. 90% of suicides can partially be linked to mental health conditions. Encourage stories of people who have sought out help. Discuss openly how the community can help to strengthen supports and help those in crisis. DON'T glorify or romanticize the stories and experiences of those who have died by suicide. People in vulnerable states (such as youth) may identify with the attention and sympathy attributed to the person who died by suicide. Caution needs to be exercised in m inimizing the contagion effect of suicide, especially when describing an after -life destination or the current state of \"peace\" the deceased may have found through death. DON'T normalize suicide by presenting it as common. It is important not to present s uicide as a common or normal event that is depicted as acceptable. Instead, emphasize that an acceptable and normal action is to find constructive ways of dealing with suicidal ideation. DON'T overly simplify the complex nature of suicide by concluding t hat one or two things caused the death or by saying that it is completely unexplainable. DON'T discuss overly descriptive details of the method of suicide. Vulnerable individuals may be more likely to imitate the act if they are able to envision the meth ods previously used.

WRITING AN OBITUARY for a loved one who has died by suicide You've lost a loved one to suicide. You want people to know your loved one has died but don't know how to tell them. The decision to include this information in an obituary is a personal one that only you and your family can make. This pamphlet provides some basic guidelines and suggestions that can help you write an obituary that will honor your loved one, while protecting your family's privacy at this very difficult time. Commented [SC16]: \"we can help you identify an appropriate recipient\" in second paragraph under w here to start on next page. Who is we? 117 Where to Start You first need to decide whether or not you want to use the word suicide. It is no longer \"taboo\" to mention suicide in an obituary. Some people choose to name suicide as the cause of death, others may not. There is no right or wrong way. As an alternative to naming suicide as the cause of death, you might choose to suggest a donation to a suicide prevention program or support group. This can be a positive legacy to your loved one, as it can help increase public understanding and support others who have lost someone to suicide. We can help you identify an appropriate recipient. Why you Might Choose to Acknowledge the Suicide Openly acknowledging the suicide in an obituary can help you and your family in the grieving process. Friends a nd family who have also lost someone to suicide may be better able to support you and your family during this difficult time. Using the word suicide in an obituary might be easier than telling others directly and can help end any rumors that might surround an unexpected death. When people openly acknowledge suicide in an obituary, it helps to reduce the stigma associated with suicide. How to Include Suicide in an Obituary Here are some examples of words you might use: \"John will always be remembered for his courage during difficult times. Unfortunately, this time the pain was too difficult, and John died by suicide on Saturday evening.\" \"After a courageous and long battle with depression, the pain became unbearable, and Sarah took her lif e.\" \"Mary Lee, her life taken too soon by her own hand.\" \"John Horn, who we lost due to suicide on Wednesday, April 30.\" \"Jeff died by suicide on Thursday, November 10. He was no longer just sad; he was imprisoned in a powerful darkness.\" \"On August 22, Trevor was only 17 years old when he died by suicide. Trevor will be forever in our hearts.\" Words or Information to Avoid Mental health professionals encourage you to use non -judgmental words and phrases when writing an obituary. This can help reduce the stigma and discourage others from considering suicide. Here are some suggestions: Use the phrase \"died by suicide,\" rather than words like \"committed\" or \"completed\" suicide. Do not share specific details of the means and how to obta in them, as it may contribute to teenagers already at risk for acting on suicidal ideation. Do not try to offer simplistic reasons or explanations for the suicide. Avoid describing the suicide as unexplainable. Avoid words and phrases that \"romanticiz e\" suicide. Help is available if you're concerned that someone you care about is at risk of suicide. National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-TALK ( 8255 ) In case of Emergency: Call 911 or visit your local emergency room. 118 SELF -CARE CHECKLIST FOR FAITH LEADERS It is vital that faith leaders stay on top of their own care; the list below is a usable self -care checklist. Self -Care Checklist for Faith Leaders \u007f Make Adequate Time for Yourself. It's easy to be consumed by all the various demands in our lives. Regularly scheduling time for yourself can make a big difference. \u007f Do Something you Enjoy. Do something just for you. This can range from pleasure reading, to taking a class u nrelated to your profession just because you have an interest in that area . \u007f Take Care of Yourself Physically and Spiritually. Take the time to undergo regular physical exams and dental care, exercise regularly , get adequate rest, maintain a healthy diet , get a massage, take a yoga class, meditate, or attend to your spiritual needs in some other more personal way. Keep in mind th at self -care is a good thing. Self -care is not selfish. The better job we do in taking care of ourselves, the better job we can do in taking care of our communities. \u007f Say NO! Setting reasonable limits and having realistic expectations for yourself is of g reat importance. Have firm boundaries and limit the number of individuals you counsel . \u007f Don't Isolate. Stay involved in outside organizations (e.g., local ministerial association) and community projects. Schedule regular lunch meetings with other faith com munity leaders in your area. Attend national conferences. Build a network of support outside the walls of your individual faith community. Consider peer supervision among pastoral care providers. \u007f Watch Out for Warning Signs of Burnout. These include violating boundaries, self -medicating, wishing those who are in need would not show up, finding it difficult to focus on the needs of your faith community, and being preoccupied with o ne's own needs and issues. \u007f Be your Brothers' and Sisters' Keeper. Wat ch out for warning signs of distress, burnout, and impairment in colleagues. Don't overlook the signs or think they will work it out on their own. \u007f Conduct Periodic Distress and Impairment Self -Assessments and Seek Help When Needed. Be aware of your careg iver blind spot. We can see others' needs but often overlook our own. If assistance is needed , consult with a trusted colleague. \u007f Focus on Prevention. Stress is a part of our lives. Accept it and respond .

Over the years, research worldwide has shown that unsafe media reporting can be correlated with an increase in suicide.14 That is why it is vital for news organizations to follow safe reporting guidelines. Covering suicide carefully can change perceptions, dispel myths, and inform the public on the complexities of the issue. Contrar y to popular opinion, a recent study found that when articles covered suicide correctly, the article was more likely to be shared and have positive engagement.14 By utilizing this approach, the content is less sensationalized, and individuals can be connec ted with care.

Online content can include anything from social media sites, blogs, and online content , to traditional media organization s. Below are a few tips to follow when writing online content. This was adapted from Reporting on Suicide's \"Online Media\" webpage which can be found here: https://reportingonsuicide.org/onlinemedia/ . 1.Include hyperlinks to resources, such as suicide warning signs and risk factors, or to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to help inform readers and reduce the risk of suicide. 2.Think about reporting on suicide as a health issue, not just in response to a recent death. For example, you can report about: a.Effecti ve suicide prevention programs b.New research on suicide prevention or mental illness c.Advocates working to reduce suicide d.Individual stories of people who have overcome suicidal ideations e.Stories on families bereaved by suicide loss who are helping others co pe or working to prevent suicide in their community f.New treatments for depression or other mental illnesses that can lead to suicide g.Steps local/federal government agencies are taking to prevent suicide 3.Remember that most online stories also allow for pub lic commentary. Websites and bloggers should develop policies and procedures for safe message board comments and monitor them for hurtful messages or comments from posters who may be in crisis. It might be helpful for webmasters, bloggers, or message board moderators to post the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline information in the first comment box in any story about suicide. 4.Traditional media journalists who also blog, either for their news organization or as an individual, should follow the media reco mmendations and be consistent. Try not to be sensational in your online coverage just because there is more space or less oversight. 123 RESOURCES FOR CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS WITH CARE When reporting on suicide, it is vital that news organizations share resources.

It's important for editors to have specific care practices in place to help staff during thes e difficult moments. Staff Care Checklist for Editors \u007f Create an open newsroom culture. To encourage trauma -informed self -care practices among your staff, your newsroom should nurture and reinforce an open and supportive newsroom culture. Encourage your staff to speak openly with you and with each other and to feel able to do so without sharp criticism or backlash. \u007f Trauma awareness - educate. Set aside time to educate your staff on trauma, traumatic stress, PTSD, and the effects of coverin g traumatic news events. By educating your staff and making them \"trauma -aware,\" they will be better prepared to respond and cope when a n event occurs. \u007f Emergency Contact Lists. Create an emergency contact tree for your newsroom. This emergency contact tr ee should lay out the protocol of who to call during a traumatic news event. This should be accessible to everyone on staff via print copy and digitally. \u007f Check -in often. Before any of your staff go out to cover a traumatic event, let them know that you appreciate and value their work. This will remind them that they have your support as they tackle challenges that lie ahead. Let them know that being in regular contact with you and others in the newsroom is encouraged. They should check in with you and oth er staff members while out reporting on the event so that you know they are safe. \u007f Listening ear. When your staff is out in the field covering a traumatic event, or even when they are behind the desk, make sure that they know that you are there for them an d that the newsroom is a supportive environment. Those who feel alone or lack other support networks are more likely to be at risk for traumatic stress than those who have other sources of support. Provide encouragement as they are working on a difficult s tory and let them know that they should not hide their stress, feelings , or emotions in these moments. Let them know that it's important for them to acknowledge difficult feelings and to express them to you or others in the newsroom. \u007f Encourage healthy se lf-care practices and be a role model. Remind your staff before, during , and after covering a traumatic event that they should do their best to take care of themselves -- eat healthy food, get exercise, take breaks, and sleep. You should also encourage th em to talk with family and friends about their experiences. Make sure that you also serve as a role model who is following these same self -care practices. This was adapted from the Dart Center for Journalism & Trauma's \"Editor Perspective: Self -Care Practices and Peer Support for the Newsroom\" webpage which can be found \u007f Be on the lookout for trouble signs. Pay attention to any trouble signs your staff members may be showing while covering a traumatic event or afterwards. Some examples are: o Sleeplessness o Upsetting dreams o Intrusive images or thoughts of the event o Avoidance of reminders of the trauma or feeling numb o Feeling that bad things are about to happen o Being jumpy and easily startled , anger o Difficulty concentrating ; feeling \"hyper\" o Physical reactions such as sweating, rapid heartbeat, dizziness , or nausea when reminded of a traumatic event If your staff members show any of these signs, find a way to have a conversation and offer a listening ear. Keep an eye on them and monitor their wellbeing. If they are show ing any of these signs for several weeks or months after covering a traumatic event, you might want to refer them to a trauma specialist. Teach your staff members to look out for these signs among their peers - the more people on your staff who are educate d about signs of distress, the easier it will be to ensure they get the help they need. \u007f Remind your staff of the impact of trauma. Remind your staff that the adrenaline of the chaos can impair their judgment and they must try to remain centered throughout the experience. They should be reminded that the way they cover the story, how they interview sources, and the way the story is presented to the public can impact those affected by the event as well as the general public. It is essential to convey the imp ortance of reporting in an ethical, humane , and respectful way. 128 Coroners Introduction Coroners frequently respond to cases where an individual has died by suicide. Though these are often some of the most difficult cases, the coroner is a vital and valued part of the investigation process. Once a coroner arrives on scene, they are the highes t authority and are in control of the scene. The only situation where this is not the case is in the event of a fire whe rein firefighters control the scene. Coroners are an integral partner in the gathering and development of accurate data . Coroners' effo rts in suicide death investigations inform suicide prevention strategies throughout the state, ultimately driving prevention initiatives. Given the importance of coroners in responding to a suicide death, this section of the toolkit includes practical tool s that can be utilized during the death investigation process. Coroner Resources: National Criteria for Determining Suicide Best Practices for Talking with Families Suicide Investigation Form Suicide Investigation Sample Forms Coroners Death Investigations: A Guide for Families 129 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicides are defined as the following : Self -Inflicted: There is evidence that death was self -inflicted. This may be determined by pathologic (autopsy), toxicologic, investigatory, and psychologic evidence and by statements of the decedent or witnesses. Intent: There is evidence (explicit and/or implicit) that, at the time of injury, the decedent intended to kill himself/herself or wished to die and that the decedent understood the probable consequences of his/her actions. This evidence may include: o Explicit verbal or nonverbal expression o f intent to kill self. o Implicit or indirect evidence of intent to die, such as: preparations for death inappropriate to or unexpected in the context of the decedent's life expression of farewell or the desire to die or an acknowledgment of impending death expression of hopelessness expression of great emotional or physical pain or distress effort to procure or learn about means of death or to rehearse fatal behavior and precautions to avoid rescue evidence that decedent recognized high potential lethality o f means of death, previous suicide attempt, or previous suicide threat stressful events or significant losses (actual or threatened), or serious depression or mental disorder.

Begin by saying, \"I am very sorry, but your ______ has died,\" Be brief and only share what is most important and known at the that time with the family. Avoid sharing details of suicide method with youth , or unnecessary details. Do not speculate or try to explain why the suicide happened, rather be patient with them as the shock sets in. Be prepared for them to have a range of em otions and be in denial and be angry with you, someone else, God, etc. They might demand to see their loved one. Help families with their grief by assuring them that what they are thinking and feeling is normal when someone dies by suicide. We may never kn ow the exact reason(s) why it happened. Let the family know it is normal to ask \"why\" for as long as they need to. Ensure that they know that there is no right or wrong way to grieve when someone has died -- everyone grieves differently. Avoid using medi cal or legal terms. Be aware that you may have to repeat things several times. Let survivors know that it is not uncommon for family members left behind to think about suicide. Tell them that if suicidal ideation happen s to them or another family member, help is available, they should talk about it with trusted loved ones, and to contact a crisis service immediately. BEST PRACTICES FOR TALKING WITH FAMILIES When a coroner arrives at the scene after a suicide death, they often talk with the family. It can be helpful to keep the following in mind when talking with families: Address Expressed Feelings of Guilt: Survivors of suicide loss almost always experience a deep sense of guilt. Let families know that this is very common. Help them by explaining that there are many factors that contribute to a person taking their life, and no one person or event causes suicide. Remind the family that sometimes people die of an illness regardless of th e treatment they seek or how much they are loved and cared for. Handle Suicide Notes Carefully : Be aware of how suicide notes are handled in your jurisdiction. Sometimes a note will need to be held as evidence by police. Try to obtain a copy of the note for the family. Prepare the family that the contents of the note may not answer their questions. Remind the spouse or parent next -of-kin to keep the note in a safe place. When no note is left, inform the family this is common and that only 20 -25% of those who die by suicide leave a note.

WHER E: When possible, it is best to have the conversation with survivors in a place that is familiar to them ( e.g., home), where they feel safe. Try to do this in a room where families can be sitting down . You should be sitting as well , looking at them, rather than standing over them and looking down on them. If home is not an option, find a quiet room away from police , EMTs, media, and other disruptions. 131 Respond Ethically to Requests to Change Manner of Death : Sometimes family members will place pressure on a coroner to change the manner of death so that it is not suicide. Let them know that you cannot submit to such a request. For example, if they say that insurance will not cover a death by suicide, explain that it would be unethical and illegal to change the manner to help them collect on a policy and recommend they call their insurance agent or an attorney. Others may ask you to change the manner to protect children or the family's reputation. Let them know that you cannot do this and that they wil l find caring and supportive people in their community to help them in their grief, no matter the manner of their loved one's death. Finally, let them know that if more information becomes available in the future, the manner of death can be changed. When talking with children, keep the following in mind: Always have permission from parents or guardians before talking about a suicide death. When poss ible, have a guardian present. Ensure a child knows that the suicide death was not their fault. Children often feel it happened because of something they did. Be direct and speak in short, simple sentences appropriate for the age of the child. Use words that the children know and can understand. Do not speak in medical or legal terms. Ask the child if they understood what you told them before you leave. Ensure you are comfortable talking with various age groups of youth. Reassure children that suicide is not common, not contagious, and will not happen to them. Reassure children that they are not alone and will be taken care of. When a parent or guardian dies, children often are afraid their other parent or guardian will leave . Let c hildren know that they might have more questions later and that it's ok to keep talking about the suicide death and to continue to ask questions as long as they need. Reassure a chi ld that there are people there to help them at any time. Refer families to additional resources for talking to children about suicide and grief. Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (www.save.org Suicide Prevention (https://afsp.org/ive -lost-someone ) Resources for Families Proactively Inform Families that the Manner of Death is Public Record : In some cases, families may wish to keep the manner of death secret due to the stigma, shame, and guilt that persists surrounding a death by suicide. It is important, therefore, that you inform the family up front that the death of their loved one is publi c record, and that the true manner of death may not remain secret. Be familiar with the public records laws to help the family make an informed decisio n. 132 1. Administrative information: a. Date report completed (MM/DD/YYYY) : b.

Life as you know it has changed forever. You may feel numb and lost, not knowing where to turn. Experiencing a range of emotions is common: fear, anger, relief, abandonment, guilt, shame, and perhaps even responsibility for your loved one's death. These feelings can change rapidly, and family members may have different reactions at different times which sometimes can lead to conflict. Know that others have walked this difficult path before you. Reach out to those who have survived a suicide loss. Move forward step by step at your own pace and do not allow anyone to rush or criticize your grieving process. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. There are many ways to connect to others \u2014staying in contact with others can help you through your grief. As a part of this process, you wi ll be working with the Coroner's Office. This brochure is meant to be used as a guide to learn more about this process. Again, you are not alone. 146 Coroner Information The Coroner's Office is contacted in the following situations. The coroner will then determine whether to investigate . Sudden death of a healthy child Death occurring within 24 hours of admission at a hospital or health care facility Physician unable to state cause of death, after careful review of medical chart, or deceased had no physician Known or suspected homicide Known or suspected su icide Related to or following known suspected self -induced or criminal abortion Following an accident or injury primary or contributory, either old or recent Drowning, fire, exposure , acute alcoholism, substance use disorder , strangulation, aspiration, or malnutrition Accidental poisoning (food, chemical, drug, therapeutic agents) Occupational disease or occupational hazards Known or suspected contagious disease constituting a public hazard, excluding AIDS All deaths where patient is under anesthetic Incarceration All deaths of unidentified persons Autopsies Autopsies are performed mainly to determine the medical cause of death and to gather evidence for court. The coroner typically will not perform an autopsy if the manner of death is \"natural\" and the cause of death can be determined by past medical history or an external exam. Funeral arrangements Contact a funeral director to arrange a funeral for your loved one. A funeral director will coordinate further arrangements with the Forensic Pathology Department and help you prepare for the funeral. You may visit a loved one only at the funeral home, not at the Forensic Pathology Department because of legal and health reasons. Contact us: types fall into the following categories below. Autopsy: Autopsy performed by a forensic pathologist External: Body taken into custody; only external examination performed SOS: Body released at scene to next of kin Consults: The office is notified of the death, but the case is declined due to not fitting coroner's investigation criteria Death investigation process Death scene investigation by the Deputy Coroner During the death scene investigation, the Coroner gathers scene information, takes photographs, and arranges for the removal of the body. The family should contact the funeral home at their earliest convenie nce. The funeral home begins the death certificate process. Post -mortem examination A certified forensic pathologist does the post - mortem physical exam. The forensic pathologist also does an autopsy, if needed. Body fluids/tissues may be sent for lab anal ysis such as toxicology and histology. The body is made available for pickup by the funeral home after the exam. Then the forensic pathologist will complete a comprehensive pathology report identifying the cause and manner of death. Death certification The Coroner's Office reviews the results of the exam. The Coroner's Office certifies the cause and manner of death in the death certificate. Contact the Coroner's Office with any questions.

In 2018, 83 youth died by suicide ; this represents an increase from 71 deaths in 2017 and 57 deaths in 2016.15 It is evident that suicide prevention strategies would be well utilized in the hands of youth workers, coaches, and youth. Youth services, for the purpose of this document, serve to support schools, afterschool activities, out -of-school programs, parents, guardians, and youth. As far as the intersection between Hoosier youth and suicide: Youth are most likely to attempt a suicide between 5 -7pm on weekdays.16 The highest rate of suicide attempts is between the ages of 14 and 17.16 19.8% percent of Hoosier youth have seriously considered attempting suicide at some point in the past year .15 This section of the toolkit is to provide both youth and parents needed suicide pre vention resources. The beginning portion is for parents, the pocket cards are for both, and the ending portion is for youth.

It is important to keep the following questions in mind: 1. What are the current trends in social media? 2. How many accounts does my youth/child have? Which sites/apps? 3. Which are for talking to friends and which are just for fun? Monitor the child's usage When a parent or caregiver is monitoring the child's usage, be sure to keep this in line with developmental level and mental health status. 1. Be aware of violent and self -harm images that youth come into contact with (some children are going to be more vulnerable than others) . 2. Ask youth /child about their digital lives: how it affects them and what is their experience. Be sure to ask about both positive and negative experiences. Ask them questions like, \"What's your favorite thing about social media?\" and \"What's the worst thing about soc ial media?\" Control and limit the usage on social media If you determine that it would be in the child's best interest to curtail their social media use, there are several different avenues parents and caregivers can pursue. 1. Carriers: Major cell phon e carriers can limit the time on specific apps. 2. Hardware: Many options available for limiting Wi -fi on certain devices. 3. Internet filter: most browsers/apps allow for restrictive access based on age. PARENT GUIDE ON SUICIDE AND SOCIAL MEDIA Mental health, non -suicidal self -harm, and suicide themes on social media continue to be an issue both youth and adults face on a daily basis. Experts recognize that youth engagement with social media includes positive and negative aspects , and our goal is to help maximize the benefits while reducing any potential harm s.

Ask them, \"Are you thinking of suicide?\" Being able to openly discuss these thoughts and feelings is critical. DO reassure. Let your child know that there is help and that this feeling wil l not last forever. Ask your child what you can do for them during moments of distress, whether it is sitting with them, giving them a hug , or doing a shared activity together. Talk with other siblings in the house to help them understand what is going on. DO remove means for self -harm. Work to keep the home environment safe by removing unsafe items such as weapons, sharp objects, medications, belts, ropes , and cords. If these items cannot be removed, having a safe place where they are locked is an altern ative option. DON'T judge. Create a safe space for your child and show them that talking about suicide and safety are things they can do with you. The thoughts and feelings they are experiencing reflect the pain they are experiencing. As a parent, you can show empathy and va lidation , which will help your child feel heard and increase their comfort talking about these difficult feelings. DON'T leave them alone. If your child is expressing thoughts of harming themselves, do not leave them on their own. Encourage your child to keep the ir bedroom door open and monitor them regularly. DO connect the child to resources . Ensure that they know the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255 [TALK]) or the text line (Text \"IN\" to 741 -741). Create a safety plan together in the event of suicidal ideation. 151 Risk Factors Characteristics at the biological, psychological, family, community, or cultural level that precede and are associated with a higher likelihood of negative outcomes.

The graphics are from Noun (Check Mark by P.J. Onori, US) AFTER AN ATTEMPT: What Family Members Need to Know Suicide is a traumatic experience for both the individual who attempted and the family. As a family member, you may feel numb and lost, not knowing where to turn. Experiencing a range of emotions is completely nor mal. When it comes time for that individual to come home, it can be good to start thinking about safety. Research shows that when an individual has previous ly attempted, they do have higher risk of later dying by suicide. As a family member, you can help y our loved one by reducing risk . Reduce the Risk at Home \u2014To help reduce the risk of self -harm or suicide at home, here are some things to consider: Guns are high risk and the leading means of death for individuals experiencing suicidal ideation \u2014they should be taken out of the home and secured. Overdoses are common and can be lethal \u2014if it is necessary to keep pain relievers such as aspirin, Advil, an d Tylenol in the home, only keep small quantities or consider keeping medications in a locked container. Remove unused or expired medicine from the home. Alcohol use or abuse can decrease inhibitions and cause people to act more freely on their feelings. As with pain relievers, keep only small quantities of alcohol in the home, or none at all. Create a Safety Plan \u2014Following a suicide attempt, a safety plan should be created to help prevent another attempt. The plan should be a joint effort between your relative and his or her doctor, therapist, or the emergency department staff, and you. As a family member, you should know your relative's safety plan and understand your role in it, including: Knowing your family member's \"triggers,\" such as an anniversary of a loss, alcohol, or stress from relationships. Building supports for your family member with mental health professionals, family, friends, and community resources. Working with your famil y member's strengths to promote his or her safety. Promoting communication and honesty in your relationship with your family member. Remember that safety cannot be guaranteed by anyone \u2014the goal is to reduce the risks and build supports for everyone in th e family. However, it is important for you to believe that the safety plan can help keep your relative safe. If you do not feel that it can, let the emergency department staff know before you leave. Maintain Hope and Self -Care \u2014Families commonly provide a safety net and a vision of hope for their relative experiencing suicidal ideation , and that can be emotionally exhausting. Never try to handle this situation alone \u2014get support from friends, relatives, and organizations such as the National Alliance on Me ntal Illness (NAMI), and get professional input whenever possible. Use the resources on the back pages of this brochure, the Internet, family, and friends to help create a support network. You are not alone. 153 AFTER A SUICIDE LOSS: What Family Members Need to Know Life as you know it has changed forever. You may feel numb and lost, not knowing where to turn. Experiencing a range of emotions is common: fear, anger, relief, abandonment, guilt, shame, and perhaps even responsibility for your loved one's death. These feelings can change rapidly, and family members may have different reactions at different times which sometimes can lead to conflict. Know that others have walked this difficult path before you. Reach out to those who have survived a suicide loss. Move forward step by step at your own pace and do not allow anyone to rush or criticize your grieving process. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. There are many ways to connect to others \u2014staying in contact with others can help you through your grief. Reach out for support: Attend a support group for su icide loss survivors (in person or online) Talk to a professional grief counselor Seek a licensed mental health provider, if needed Talk with those you trust (family, friends, faith leader, neighbors) to share your loss and pain Continue to ask the \"wh y?\" questions as long as you need to Grieving can take over your life, so taking care of yourself is important: Try to get plenty of sleep, rest, and be gentle with yourself Eat healthy food and drink water Keep yourself busy by doing something you en joy Continue your exercise routine When a loved one passes away, it can be a very difficult time. Trying to remember all the details that must be taken care of related to a person's death is hard. In the next few pages, there are a list of items marked a s things to do immediately, within a few days, and within a few weeks . This was adapted from \"Health & Hope: For Survivors of Suicide Loss.\" from Ever Loved's \"What to Do When Someone Dies: A Checklist,\" found here: https://everloved.com/articles/end - of-life-affairs/what -to-do-when -someone -dies-checklist/ 154 What to do immediately 19. Get a death certificate . If your loved one died in a hospital, a doctor can take care of this for you. However, if your loved one passed at home or in another location, you'll need to know who to call. If your family member wasn't at a hospital, call 911. 20. Arrange for organ donation, if applicable. Check your loved one's driver's license and/or advance directive (living will or health care proxy) to see if he or she was an organ donor. If so, let hospital staff know immediately (or call a nearby hospital if your loved one died at home). 21. Contact im mediate family. Every family is different, and there's no one right way to do this. For some families, sharing the news in -person or over the phone is critical. For others , an email or text message may be alright. 22. Enlist help from family and friends. There are multiple ways family and friends can help you, such as: answering the phone , collecting mail , caring for pets , finding important items (such as keys, insurance policies, claims forms, addresses for magazine subscriptions, etc. ), staying at the home during the wake, funeral, and/or memorial services to guard against break -ins, and organizing food for family and friends after the services. 23. Notify the individual's religious leader, if applicable . Contact the deceased's Pastor, Rabbi, Priest , or other religious leader if there is one. He or she can help with counseling for surviving family and friends. They can also help you make funeral arrangements or services. 24. Decide what you'd like to do with your loved one's body and arrange transportation. First, check to see if your loved one expressed any wishes about final disposition or had made prepayments to a funeral home or cemetery . Ideally, there wil l be documentation with other medical documents. If no wishes or plans have been stated, you have three main options: o Call a funeral home. A funeral home can help you arrange either a burial or cremation. Check reviews and prices for a few different funeral homes before making a decision. o Call a crematory. While you can arrange a cremation through a funeral home, there are also crematories that will work with you directly if you aren't interested in the added services of a funeral director. o Call a full -body donation organization. Your loved one may have already registered t o be a body donor , so check for paperwork. If he or she hasn't, there are still many programs that accept donations from next of kin. 25. Arrange care for any pets or dependents. If your loved one was responsible for caring for one or more people or pets, quickly find someone who can care for them temporarily . 26. Secure major property. If your loved one lived on their own, make sure his or her home and any vehicles are locked up. If it will sit vacant for some time, consider notifying the landlord and/or the police, so they can help to keep an eye on it. 27. Notify the person's employer. If the deceased was employed (or actively volunteering), call to let them know that your loved one has passed away. This is also a good time to ask about pay owed, benefits , and life insurance. 155 What to do within a few days 17. Decide on funeral plans. If you decided to work with a funeral home, meet with the funeral director to go through your options. If you opted for an immediate burial (burial without any ceremonies), cremation , or donation to science, you may also choose to hold a memorial service or celebration of life at a later date. 18. Order a casket or urn. You may choose to purchase a casket or urn directly through the funeral home. However, you can often find caskets online for hundreds (even thousands) of dollars less, and some websites even offer free overnight delivery. 19. For a veteran, ask about special arrangements. A range of benefits can help tailor a veteran's service. You may be able to get assistance with the funeral or burial plot or other benefits. You can find many details about options as well as potential survivor benefits at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website. 20. Consider whether you need or want other financial assistance for the funeral and burial. Help might be available from different sources, including a church, a union , or a fraternal organization that the deceased belonged to. 21. Ask the post office to forwar d mail. If the person lived alone, this will prevent mail from piling up and showing that no one is living in the home. The mail may also help you identify bills that need to be paid and accounts that should be closed. You'll need to file a request at the post office and show proof that you are an appointed executor authorized to manage his/her mail. 22. Perform a check of the person's home. Throw out any food that will expire, water plants, and look for anything else that may need regular care. 23. Update the utilities . Tell local utilities (telephone, gas, electricity, cable) about the death, only if someone else wants to be put on the accounts. Otherwise wait until you decide if and when the utilities are to be turned off. 24. Prepare an obituary. The funeral home might offer the service, or you might want to write an obituary yourself. If you want to publish it in a newspaper, check on rates, deadlines , and submission guidelines. 156 What to do within a few weeks 43. Order a headstone. Since headstones are rarely ready in time for a burial, you can save this until after the funeral when you have some more time. You can order a headstone through the cemetery, but you'll have more options (and often lower prices) if you look onl ine. 44. Order several copies of the death certificate. You will likely need anywhere between 5 -10 copies (but possibly more), depending on the accounts that your loved one had open. Your funeral director may be able to help you order them, or you can order t hem yourself from city hall or another local records office. Your certified copies should display an official seal and say, \"This is an exact copy of the death certificate received for filing in County .\" 45. Start the probate process with the will. If the estate is relatively small, doesn't contain unusual assets , and isn't likely to be disputed by family members , you may be able to handle it your self. 46. Contact the Social Security office. Your funeral director may have already done this, so find out if this is the case. If you need to contact Social Security yourself, you can reach them by phone at 1-800-772-1213. Through Social Security , you may be able to apply for survivor benefits . 47. Handle Medicare. If your loved one received Medicare, Social Security will inform the program of the death. If the deceased had been enrolled in Medicare Presc ription Drug Coverage (Part D), Medicare Advantage plan , or had a Medigap policy, contact these plans at the phone numbers provided on each plan membership card to cancel the insurance. 48. Notify any banks or mortgage companies. If you're unsure of what accounts your loved one held, use their mail and any online accounts you have access to in order to identify what accounts may be open. Then, take copies of the death certificate to each bank and change ownership of the accounts. 49. Reach out to any financial advisors or brokers. Try to identify any additional financial and investment accounts that your loved one held. Work with each one to transfer ownership. You'll likely need a death certificate for each account. 50. Contact a tax accountant. You'll need to file a return for both the individual and th e estate. 51. Notify life insurance companies. Fill out the claim form for any life insurance policies that the deceased had. Also, suggest that friends and family who may have listed your loved one on their own life insurance policies update theirs. 52. Cancel insurance policies. This could include health insurance, car insurance, homeowner's insurance , or other policies . Depending on the policy, reach out to either the insurance company or your loved one's employer to stop coverage. 53. Determine any employment b enefits. If your loved one was working at the time of their death, contact their employer to find out about union death benefits, pension plans , and credit unions. 157 54. Identify and pay important bills. Make a list of bills that are likely to be due (e.g. , mortgage, car payments, electricity), track ing them down via the person's mail and online accounts. 55. Close credit card accounts. Leverage your loved one's mail, wallet , and any online accounts you have access to in order to identify open credit card accounts. For each one, you'll likely need to call customer service and then email or mail a copy of the death certificate. 56. Notify credit reporting agencies. Provide copies of the death certificate to Experian, Equifax , and TransUnion to reduce the chances of iden tity theft. It's also a good idea to check your loved one's credit history in another month to confirm that no new accounts have been opened. 57. Creditors. Letters should be sent to all creditors informing them of the person's death. If any life insurance co verage can pay off the balances, a copy of the death certificate will be needed. Do not tell any of them you will be paying the balances with your own money. The estate needs to pay these, not family members, no matter what the creditors tell you. If nothi ng is left in the estate to pay off debts, then tell the creditors this. 58. Contact a tax preparer. A return will need to be filed for the individual, as well as for an estate return. Keep monthly bank statements on all individual and joint accounts that show the account balance on the day of death. 59. Cancel the person's driver's license. Go online or c all your state's DMV for instructions , having a copy of the death certificate ready. Additionally, n otify the local election board. This will help to prevent identity theft and voter fraud . 60. Memorialize your loved one's Facebook account. If your loved one was on Facebook, you can memorialize their account . This will let current friends continue to post and share memories but will keep anyone from logging into it in the future. 61. Close emai l accounts. Once you feel confident that you have the necessary information on other accounts, it's a good idea to permanently close your loved one's email accounts as an additional step to prevent fraud and identity theft. 62. Dispose of personal items and clothing. It is hard, but as soon as possible, you should try to dispose of items which will no longer be used by the survivors. Everyone does this at a different time. Ask for help with this if you need it. No items should be moved, sold, or given away if they have been identified in the person's will to be given out to survivor s. 63. Find important documents. There are some documents that may be needed or at least helpful in settling the estate of the deceased. Documents might include: safe deposit rental agreement statements; pension, IRA, retirement statements; income tax returns for the past three years/W -2 form; loan and installment payment books and contracts; gift tax returns; birth and death certi ficates; social security card; military records and discharge papers; budgets; bank statements, checkbooks, check registers, certificates of deposits; deeds, deeds of trust, mortgages and mortgage releases, title policies, leases; motor vehicle titles and registration papers; stock and bond certificates and account statements; unpaid bills; health/accident and sickness policies; bankruptcy papers. 158 POCKET CARDS: \"FACTS\" OF SUICIDE AWARENESS If an individual is concerned that someone they know may be at risk for suicide , the first step in helping may be as simple as learning the FACTS or warning signs.

Per the Indiana Youth Institute's Data Book, 33.5% of Indiana high school students reported feeling sad or hopeless in the past year. Needless to say, there is ample room for education to intervene.15 Suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention are complex issues to tackle -- especially in schools. Schools already have numerous competing requirements, they are under resourced , and are full of students most of the day . That is why we have put together an assortment of various tools for those in education to use when addressing suicide prevention. Education Resources: Indiana Requirements for Youth Suicide Prevention Suicide Prevention in School s Poster Suicide Prevention Ideas Model School District Policy Checklist and Sample Suicidal Ideation Protocol Re-Entry Protocol Sample Guidelines for Staff Meetings after a Suicide Sample Death Notification Statements for Students Dos and Don'ts when Talking to your Students about Suicide Parent Letter Script Suicide Resources: Education (p. 218-219) 164 Suicide Prevention Policy (IC 20 -26-5-34.4) Per IC 20 -26-5-34.4, school corporations shall adopt a policy addressing measures intended to increase child suicide awareness and prevention. The policy must address the following: 1. Counseling services for the child and the child's family related to suicide prevention. 2. Avai lability of referral information for crisis intervention to children, parents, and school corporation staff. 3. Increasing awareness of the relationship between suicide and drug and alcohol use. 4. Training on warning signs and tendencies that may evidence that a child is considering suicide. 5. Availability of information concerning suicide prevention services in the community. 6. Cooperation among the school corporation and suicide prevention services in the community. 7. Development of a plan to assist survivors of attempted suicide and to assist children and school corporation staff in coping with an attempted suicide or death of a student or school employee. 8. Development of any other program or activity that is appropriate. Youth Suicide Awareness and Prevention Training (IC 20 -28-3-6) Per IC 20 -28-3-6, superintendents, principals, teachers, librarians, school counselors, school psychologists, school nurses, and school social workers employed at schools that provide instruct ion to students in grades 5 -12 are required to participate in at least 2 hours of youth suicide awareness and prevention training every 3 school years. The training must be during the employee's contracted day or at a time chosen by the employee , shall cou nt toward professional development requirements , and must be demonstrated to be an effective or promising program and recommended by the Indiana Suicide Prevention Network Advisory Council. INDIANA REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUTH SUICIDE PREVENTION When thinking through different prevention and intervention strategies to pursue, it is vital that Indiana schools know what is required from them legally. Below are the various policies that must be followed when it comes to suicide prevention.

Drastic change in mood Depression Loss of interest Irritability Anxiety TALK WITH AT RISK STUDENTS 1. ASK Pull the student aside and share what you have noticed. Ask them if they are experiencing suicidal ideation. \"I've noticed _________. Sometimes when someone is _______ they are t hinking about suicide. Are you thinking about suicide?\" 2. LISTEN Listen to what the student shares with you. Validate and acknowledge their feelings. \"Let's talk about this.\" \"Tell me more.\" \"It sounds like you're going through a really difficult time.\" 3. CONNECT If the student shares they are experiencing suicidal ideation or you suspect they are in danger of hurting themselves, connect them with someone to help keep them safe. DO NOT leave the student unsupervised.

Student's School Counselor: ________________ This template was provided by Hamilton SE to ID OH for purposes of this toolkit. 173 Goals of Ini tial Meeting (allow at least one hour to do the following): Take attendance and make note of any staff who are not present and plan to reach out or contact those staff members Share accurate information about the death, honoring the family's request for privacy. Have a trained professional present at the meeting so th at staff may access them for support if needed. Allow staff an opportunity to express their own reactions and grief; identify anyone who may need additional support and refer them to appropriate resources. Have substitute teachers available to replace any teachers who are too upset to teach (a task for the principal or designee). Remind staff of the school's policy or response following a student death and any considerations specifically for a suicide death. Share with staff how to handle parent inquiries and plans for communicating with parents, including who parents should contact for further information and resources. Explain plans for the day, how classroom meetings will be conducted, and locations of crisis counseling rooms or other supports that will be present in the building. Remind all staff of the following: o How they respond to the crisis can have a strong impact on their students. They need to project that they are in control and are concerned about their students' mental health . If their emotions become too strong , encourage them to reach out to admin for support and classroom coverage. o They can play an important role in identifying changes in students' behavior. Discuss a plan for handling students who are having difficulty. Brief s taff about identifying and referring at -risk students as well as the need to keep records of those efforts (letting school counselor know of students of concern). Remind staff to be on the lookout for rumors and to notify an individual leading the crisis response immediately if they hear rumors. Staff should not engage in discussions that may contribute to the spread of rumors. Remind staff to limit use of social media and to avoid tagging those who may be close to the incident. Furthermore, encourage staf f to wait to post information so family, students, and staff can be made aware before learning about the incident on social media. Identify which Crisis Response Team member has been designated as the media spokesperson and instruct staff to refer all medi a inquiries to them. SAMPLE GUIDELINES FOR STAFF MEETINGS AFTER A SUICIDE When a suicide completion occurs, a school needs to be ready to respond. The initial staff meeting (outlined below) should be held as soon as possible, ideally before school starts. This information was found in SPRC's \"After a Suicide: A Toolkit for found here: https://www.sprc.org/sites/default/files/r esource - program/AfteraSuicideToolkitforSchools.pdf 174 SAMPLE DEATH NOTIFICATION STATEMENT FOR STUDENTS Depending on how the school wants to address the suicide death, an announcement may be made to students. This death notification statement should be shared with students in small groups, such as homerooms or advisories, not in assemblies or over loudspeakers. Option 1 : When the Death Has Been Ruled a Suicide \"I am so sorry to tell you all that one of our students, [NAME], has died. I'm also very sad to tell you that the cause of death was suicide. Many of you may also feel very sad. Others may feel other emotions such as anger or confusion. It's okay to feel whatever emotions you might be feeling. When someone takes their own life, it leads to a lot of questions, some of which may never be completely answered. While we may never know why [NAME] ended [HIS/HER] life, we do know that suicide has many causes. In many cases, a mental health condition is part of it, and these conditions are treatable. It's really important if you're not feeling well in any way to rea ch out for help. Suicide should not be an option. Rumors may come out about what happened, but please don't spread them. They may turn out to be untrue and can be deeply hurtful and unfair to [NAME] and [HIS/HER] family and friends. I'm going to do my be st to give you the most accurate information as soon as I know it. Each of us will react to [NAME]'s death in our own way, and we need to be respectful of each other. Some of us may have known [NAME] well, and some of us may have not. But either way, we may have strong feelings. You might find it difficult to concentrate on schoolwork for a little while. On the other hand, you might find that focusing on school helps take your mind off what has happened. Either is okay. I want you to know that your teac hers and I are here for you. We also have counselors here to help us all cope with what happened. If you'd like to talk to one of them, just let me or one of your teachers know , or look for the counselors in [NOTE SPECIFIC LOCATION] between classes or duri ng lunch. We are all here for you.

Sincerely, Option 3 : Parent Letter Script When the Family has Requested the Cause of Death not be Disclosed 182 Populations of Special Consideration Introduction While the majority of this toolkit is broken into profession -specific groupings, it is important to acknowledge the populations of special consideration . Therefore, we have chosen to create a n additional section to encapsulate some of the pertinent tools and resources available. While many groups are at risk for suicide, research shows that individuals who are LGBTQIA+, people of Tribal Nations, and individuals who are veterans are at a higher risk of suicide wh en compared with the general population. That is why it is vital to have actionable population -specific tools readily available . In this next section, each group's shared risk and protective factors are highlight ed along with several usable tools. None o f these tools fully encapsulate a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention ; it is recommended that professionals read through other resources referenced in the following pages for further context and detail. Populations of Special Consideration Resources: LGBTQ IA+ resources o LGBTQ IA+ risk and protective factors o Checking in on your Mental Health poster o Suicide Prevention for LGBTQ IA+ Youth and Young Adults Brochure o LGBTQ IA+ resources Veteran resources o Veterans ' risk and protective factors o 10 things you can do to prevent veteran suicide o Safe firearm storage poster o Veteran resources People of Tribal Nations resources o People of Tribal Nations risk and protective factors o Zero suicide for People of Tribal Nations o Men tal health support guide for native families o People of Tribal Nations resources 183 LGBTQ IA+ RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS Individuals transgender, queer, intersex, asexual other sexual orientation s (e.g., MSM or Men Who have Sex with Men) and gender identities (individuals who are nonbinary) frequently experience prejudice and discrimination. Research indicates that mental health problems, misuse of alcohol and other drugs, and suicidal ideation are more common in this group than in the general population . Suicide prevention efforts seek to reduce risk factors for suicide and strengthen the factors that help strengthen individuals and protect them from suicide (protective factors ). Here are a few examples: Depression and other mental health problems (i.e., substance use disorder) Feelings of social isolation Stress from prejudice and discrimination (family rejection, harassment, bullying, violence) Sense of safety Connections to friends and others who care about them Family acceptance This information was adapted from SPRC's \"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and/or Transgender People,\" found here: https://www.sprc.org/populations/lgbt 184 Have You Felt...? Unimportant Trapped and/or hopeless Overwhelmed and/or unmotivated Alone , angry , and/or irritable Thoughts of suicide Have You Been ...? Using drugs or alcohol more than usual Acting differently than usual Giving away your most valuable possessions Losing interest in your favorite things to do Planning for death by writing a will or letter Eating or sleeping more or less than usual Feeling more sick, tired, or achy than usual Do You ...? Not care about the future Put yourself down (and think you deserve it) Plan to say goodbye to important people Have a specific plan for suicide Feeling sad or alone can be overwhelming, especially if people in your life are unsupportive. While these feelings are completely normal, it's important to keep an eye out for warning signs of larger mental health struggles. You are not alone and asking fo r help is a sign of strength. If you answered yes to any of these questions , you can reach out to a trained crisis counselor for support by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1.800.273.8255 [TALK]) or texting \"IN\" to 741741.

Experiencing suicidal ideation (e.g., \"I want to kill myself,\" \"I wish my life were over,\" or \"Life isn't worth living\" ). Making final arrangements, talking about their funeral , and giving away valued possessions. Displaying signs of depression (e.g., loss of pleasure in activities they used to enjoy, prolonged sad mood, changes in eating or sleeping patterns, expressing feelings of hopelessness or guilt). Engaging in self -destructive behavior (e.g., start of or increase in alcohol or drug use, risky sexual behavior, reckless driving). Expressing that they are suffering a great deal and feel that there is no hope for a better future with phrases such as , \"It won't matter soon anyway.\" Pulling away from family and friends . Suicide is PREVENTABLE . Most young people having thoughts of suicide give some sort of clue about their intentions.

The military services include an Active Component (Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Space Force, Coast Guard ) and a Reserve Component (Army National Guard, Air National Guard ). Suicide prevention effo rts seek to reduce risk factors for suicide and strengthen the factors that help strengthen individuals and protect them from suicide (protective factor s). Here are a few examples: Prior suicide attempt Stressful situations (i.e., childhood trauma, relations hip problems, legal issues, financial troubles) Mental health issues (i.e., mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder) Life skills training (i.e., financial management, communication, family relationships, conflict resolution) Social connectedness Effective care for mental and physical health problems This information was adapted from SPRC's \"Military Service Members and Veterans,\" found here: https://www.sprc.org/populations/military -veterans Physical health problems 189 1. Recognize warning signs of suicidal ideation. Many veterans may not show any signs of intent to harm themselves before doing so, but some actions can be signs that they need help. Veterans who are considering suicide often show signs of depression, anxiety, low self -esteem, and/or hopelessness. Signs includ e: - Appearing sad or depressed, feeling anxious or agitated, and being unable to sleep - Having trouble sleeping and eating, or showing loss of interest, which doesn't go away or continues to get worse - Deteriorating physical appearance and neglecting person al welfare - Withdrawing from friends, family, and society, or sleeping all the time - Losing interest in hobbies, work, school, or other things one used to care about - Frequent and dramatic mood changes - Feelings of failure or decreased performance and exces sive guilt or shame - Feeling that life is not worth living, having no sense of purpose in life - Talking about feeling trapped, like there is no way out of a situation - Feelings of desperation, saying that there's no solution to their problem Their actions may be dramatically different from their normal behavior, or they may appear to be actively contemplating or preparing for a suicide attempt . Unusual behaviors include: - Performing poorly at work or school - Acting recklessly or engaging in risky activities such as driving fast or running red lights - Showing violent behavior, such as punching holes in walls, getting into fights, or engaging in self-destructive violence , and feeling rage or uncontrolled anger o r seeking revenge - Looking as though one has a \"death wish\" - Putting affairs in order or making out a will and giving away prized possessions - Seeking access to firearms, pills, or other means of harming oneself Signs of suicide may appear to be very simi lar to Post -traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms; however, PTSD symptoms slightly differentiate to include h aving nightmares, vivid memories, or flashbacks of the event that make the individual feel like it's happening all over again , feeling constant ly on guard , and being jumpy or easily startled . The determination of whether the individual was experiencing suicidal ideation and/or PTSD would be made by a medical provider. 10 THINGS YOU CAN DO TO PREVENT VETERAN SUICIDE Recent estimates suggest that 22 veterans may die by suicide each day. It is important to know that suicide is preventable , and there are things you can do to prevent veteran suicide. If a veteran has not gone through a transition back to civilian life program, this tool can also be useful. This information was adapted from the VA's \"Community Toolkit,\" which can be found here: https://www.va.gov/ve/docs/outreachToolkitPreventingVeteranSuicideIsEveryonesBusiness. pdf https://www.maketheconnection.net/conditions/ptsd?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlYi8 - v2e7AIViovICh33_AEmEAAYASAAEgK7MfD_BwE 190 2. Validate the veteran's experience: Show compassion. Crisis provides an opportunity to help people and give them hope. Suicide is preventable. Be willing to listen and allow the veteran to express his or her feelings. Recognize that the situation is serious. Do not pass judgment. Reassure the veteran that he lp is available and offer hope. Show compassion by looking at the person talking or telling them that you care; compassion can be heard through your voice and translates through your nonverbal communication. 3. Ask the question: Are you having thoughts of suicide? Many people fear that asking about suicide puts people more at risk. This is not true. By asking if someone is having thoughts of suicide or has hurt himself or herself, you are giving the person in need an opportunity to open up and s hare his or her feelings. DO ask the question if you've identified warning signs or symptoms. DON'T ask the question as though you are looking for a \"no\" answer: \"You aren't thinking of killing yourself, are you?\" 4. Means do matter: Know how to saf ely store firearms in your home. Most veterans who die by suicide use firearms. Though many veterans are well -versed in gun safety, all veterans and their families should understand how to properly handle and store firearms in the home. The risk of uninten tional firearm deaths among youth drops by 80 percent when guns are stored separately from ammunition in a lock box . Veterans also tend to inflict self -harm by overdosing on medication. Encourage health care providers to limit the number of pills in any s ingle prescription, especially if there is a significant risk of overdose. People who have recently been in an inpatient psychiatric unit or an emergency room for mental health or substance use are at increased risk for suicide 90 days following discharge. 5. Encourage treatment and expedite getting help. Take the veteran to a local walk -in crisis center or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Try to get the person to seek immediate help from his or her doctor or the nearest hospital emergency room or call 911. Once you have gotten the veteran to seek help, reach out to them to show that you care. Follow up with the person after the eve nt; let him or her know that treatment works, and life can get better. Use the resource locator: VeteransCrisisLine.net/ResourceLocator and use SAMHSA's Find Help and Treatment Locator: -help. 6. Promote veteran employment: Help t ransition servicemembers to civilian life. Finding employment, understanding the opportunities available from vocational rehabilitation programs, and financial stress can be overwhelming for anyone. Employers can work with VA community employment coordinat ors (CECs) \u2014 based at nearly every VA medical center \u2014 to share job openings and set up interviews with qualified veterans. 191 7. Intentionally connect with female veterans. Female veterans have a significantly higher suicide risk than their non -Veteran civilian counterparts: Adjusting for differences in age, risk for suicide is 2.4 times higher among female veterans when compared with U.S. civilian adult females. Consider reaching out to partners to ensure that any messaging for Veterans considers women and men. Host an event for female veterans and consider reaching out to key leaders in the community who can help connect them to one another. Health care providers should take care to assess all women in crisis against the same criteria used for men: veteran status, access to firearms, substance misuse, and level of connectedness. 8. Connect veterans to each other and to service. Veterans who have served the ir country have a range of skills and values that can benefit their communities. Encourage members of your community to host service days or other opportunities for veterans to support fellow veterans, servicemembers, and the community at large. Male veterans over the age of 65 are at increased risk for suicide. This is a time in life that can include retirement, loss of family members, or long -term depression, which can all lead to increased substance use and social isolation. Inquire about what skills a veteran has gained during and after military service and offer him or her opportunities to connect with others. 9. Get technical: Using technology to reach veterans and enhance connectedness. Reach out to your community to find people, companies, and nonprofit organizations that are using social media, email, or text messages to reach out and connect to people. Some health care providers are using video technology, referred to as telehealth, to improve how people receive health care -- especially those who live in more rural settings. 10. Treatment works: Promoting substance use treatment and mental health recovery. Many communities are unaware of the resources they already have to help people who are facing an emotional crisis or s ubstance use problems. Consider hosting community events where local providers can offer education and resources to veterans and their families . Promote sobriety with family -friendly events, such as block parties, farmers markets, and athletic events like a 5K walk/ run. Work to engage substance use disorder prevention organizations and treatment centers in the event, promoting recovery. Most peop le who die by suicide were last provided health care in a primary physician's office. Connect with health professionals in your area and give them information on military and veteran culture. Encourage providers to have direct discussions with their patien ts about preventing suicide and amplify suicide prevention messaging in their clinics. Direct them to training and resources from their local VA Suicide Prevention Coordinator or other online sources. 192 Safe firearm storage matters... Because no one can un -fire a firearm For someone in crisis, a locked firearm can mean the difference between a tragic outcome and a life saved. Though many veterans are well -versed in firearm safety, all veterans and their families should understand how to properly handle and store firearms i n the home. Firearm injuries were the second leading cause of injury -related deaths nationwide in 2015. - CDC Report, 2017 A 2014 study showed that firearms could be found in roughly 31% of households nationwide. - General Social Survey, 2014 Research shows there is a 70% lower risk of unintentional firearm -related injury and death among youths when guns are stored safely. - Journal of the American Medical Association, 2015 Take these simple steps to keep your family safe: \u007f Make sure firearms cannot be accessed by children and unauthorized adults by keeping guns locked and unloaded when not in use. \u007f Store ammunition separately from firearms and out of reach of children and unauthorized adults. \u007f Regularly reassess steps to ens ure safe storage and use of firearms, especially during periods of increased stress or emotional crisis. \u007f Request a gunlock from your local VA Suicide Prevention Coordinator.

Suicide preve ntion efforts seek to reduce risk factors for suicide and strengthen the factors that help strengthen individuals and protect them from suicide (protective factors ). Here are a few examples: Substance use and community violence Cultural identification and connectedness (i.e., religion, culture) This information was adapted from the SPRC's page on \"American Indians and Alaskan Natives) which can be found here: sprc.org/populations/aian Alienation (i.e., disconnection from their family of origin or culture) or acculturation Historical trauma and discrimination (forced relocation, removal of children to boarding schools, etc.) Spirituality (commitment to tribal spirituality) Mental health services access and use Community control (ability to implement programs and have centralized forms of governance and structure) 195 ZERO SUICIDE FOR PEOPLE OF TRIBAL NATIONS Zero Suicide's Indian Country toolkit contains recommendations for the implementation of Zero Suicide in Tribal Nations. It is important to note that there is no such thing as \"Native Culture\" ; rather, there are thousands of unique cultures into which \u2014if done with cultural humility and with focused attention on the Tribe itself, its healing ways, and its leadership (i.e., chief, governor, president, and/or chairperson, as well as the tribal council and its youth and elders councils) \u2014Zero Suicide may be implemented effectively and appropriately.

People who have been through many difficult experiences (especially if these happen in childhood) are more likely to face health, ment al health, and substance use challenges. Individuals from Tribal Nations... experience serious psychological distress 1.5x more often than the general population experience PTSD more than twice as often experience substance use disorder at younger ages, and at higher rates, than in all other ethnic groups \"By reflecting on how these experiences may have shaped our families, we are taking the first step in recognizing both the strengths we have as a community, and the ways of coping th at may no longer be serving us. With this self -knowledge and historical knowledge, we can help our children draw from our community's strengths and find new ways of healing and living that will allow them to have better mental health and wellbeing. Our his tory does not define our destiny.\" - Circles of Care California Cohort 197 People from Tribal Nations are the product of a resilient, strong people and culture. Th is resilience and strength can help future generations to heal, grow, and thrive . For example, many Native people have a strong sense of connectedness, reciprocity, balance, and completeness that frames their view of health. This holistic worldview can be the basis of healthy coping skills and improved mental well -being. This worldvie w and sense of community can also give people of Tribal Nations a strong foundation when facing mental health challenges. Although adults may feel comfortable seeking support from a spiritual leader - for depression, anxiety, or alcohol and drug problems - young people may not have such strong ties to their ancestry, even though they still need welcoming community support to thrive. When young people can call upon their community for support and reach out for additional tools like counseling from a mental health provider, they have the best opportunity for healing. Approaches to Healing Social support from parents, other caring adults, and peers is vital for Native youth to feel empowered to seek help for their mental health concerns. All children are unique, and a one-size-fits-all approach should never be forced onto someone seeking car e. Healing happens when the child is provided with unconditional support . For many young people, the most effective care is a mix of cultural tradition and medical intervention. Seeking different types of support doesn't make a person any more or less a part of their community . Every step toward better mental health should be celebrated, and everyone's path to wellness is unique. Parents and professionals should respect the young person's self - knowledge and chosen way to heal. If a therapist or medication isn't working for someone, parents and young people have the right to b e discerning consumers and ask for alternatives or seek care that is a better fit. Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
