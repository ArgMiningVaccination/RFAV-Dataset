Biodynamics may not be thecure-all that some practitioners claim it to be, but the BD systemclearly holds potential to improve agricultural and horticulturalproduction and to teach us about beneficial microorganisms andbiochemistry.What is Biodynamics, and What is it Used For?Biodynamics is an esoteric approach to agriculture created byAustrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner. Steiner was also the fatherof the philosophy \"anthroposophy,\" anthroposophic art,anthroposophic medicine, Waldorf schools, Camphillcommunities, Eurythmy dance, and several other movements inscience and culture. In 1924 a group of farmers concerned withdeclining soil and food quality approached Steiner for a solution.The Science BehindBiodynamicsLast Updated: July 16, 2010Organic Agriculture HomeSteiner, neither a farmer nor a scientist, drew on traditionalEuropean farming mythology and new impulses fromanthroposophy to build BD. Biodynamics was envisioned to notonly produce ample food and fiber, but also to heal and nourishthe people who depend on these products by healing the soil,plants, animals, and earth.Biodynamic farming has much in common with organicagriculture. Both systems disallow synthetic pesticides andfertilizers and require a 3-year transition period. Farms can becertified as biodynamic by Demeter USA. Some farms are co-certified as both organic and biodynamic. Demeter biodynamiccertification does have requirements in addition to those fororganic certification, such as a minimum of 10% farm area forbiodiversity preservation, reduction in off-farm inputs, and use ofthe BD preparations. Some, but not all, biodynamic farms useastrological calendars and other cosmic indicators to determinethe timing of farm activities such as planting and harvesting.Biodynamic farming is not only a set of methods; it is also aphilosophical system relating to the overall structure of the farm.Biodynamics is at its heart based on the creation of a farm thatfunctions holistically as an intact organism with its soil, animals,humans, and plants acting as \"organs of a living organism.\" Thehealth of the farm organism depends on each organ workingproperly in concert with the others, as well as with itsenvironment. Energies must flow between the human, animal,plant, mineral, and the cosmic. Following these ideals createsagriculture that is, as far as possible, self-supporting.Biodynamic farms attempt to form a nearly closed system, withas much of its inputs (such as fertilizers) as possible comingfrom within the farm. For instance, compost and legumes supplymost fertilizer needs, and control of weeds and pests isgenerally achieved through mechanical or physical controls,homeopathy, rotations, and other non-commercial means. Cropgrowth depends on organic soil fertility, which depends in turnon well-managed livestock. Demeter-certified farms mustinclude livestock or have a close relationship with a nearbylivestock farm.Biodynamic management has been shown to benefit overall soilquality, increase available N and P in soil, and increaseearthworm and/or microbial populations as compared toconventional agricultural management (Reganold al., 1993;Carpenter-Boggs et al., 2000c; Zaller and K\u00f6pke, 2004;Flie\u00dfbach et al., 2007). Most of these benefits are likely due toincreased use of compost, legumes, and other organic inputs tothe soil. Large changes in soil chemistry or crop production dueto use of the BD preparations are generally not observed inshort-term studies (Carpenter-Boggs et al., 2000b), but growingpopulations of BD growers claim to have increased soil fertility.Biodynamic PreparationsBiodynamic farms are unique in their use of the homeopathicBD preparations (Table 1). The preparations are made fromcommon plants and materials (Table 1), but each undergoes aunique fermentation process before use. For instance, the bestknown preparation, Preparation 500 (the \"cow hornpreparation\"), is made by stuffing a well-formed cow horn withmanure from a healthy cow, burying this horn in the ground inthe fall, and uncovering it in spring. The material is transformedover winter to a fine, rich compost-like material that is then usedat a very low dose. Approximately 2 Tbsp is intensively stirredinto water for 1 hr, then sprayed onto 1 acre of soil just prior toplanting. Preparation 500 is said to prepare the soil to supportseedling and plant growth. Preparations 501 and 508 are usedto increase the effect of light on the plants and reduce plantdisease, particularly foliar fungal diseases.Table 1. Main preparations have also been thesubject of a few studies, which have usually found them tocause slightly higher temperature, slightly faster decomposition,and retention of more of the initial nutrients (Heinze and Breda,1978; Reeve et al., 2010). In my own research, we could detectdifferences in the microbial communities between compostmade with and without the BD compost preparations(Carpenter-Boggs et al., 2000a), as well likely primary for BD preparations are:nutrient addition (primarily micronutrient), microbial inoculation,plant immunity stimulation, plant hormones, and microbialsignaling.BD preparations do contain some nutrients, but in extremelysmall amounts. The small amount of preparation material usedcannot account for any measurable effect on soil macro- ormicronutrient content. It is essentially impossible thatapplications of preparations onto soil will have any measurableeffect on macronutrient or even micronutrient content. Usingfoliar application, however, small amounts of nutrients can bedirectly applied to and taken up by plants. Micronutrients canhave significant benefit to plants when applied even at very lowconcentrations if that particular nutrient is not yet adequate forthe plant's growth stage. Foliar fertilization, whether bycommercial or alternative materials, should be guided by planttissue nutrient analysis or known nutrient deficiencies.BD preparations could change the plant or soil microbialcommunity directly, through inoculation, or indirectly, bychanging the habitat or by stimulating microbial growth. Achange or increase in microbial community could cause eitherdetriments, such as disease, or benefits, such as increasedavailability of nutrients from the soil. The organisms in BDpreparations are added to the microbial community on the plantor soil surface. Typically, any added microbes will be short-livedwithout the proper environment. Available food and habitat willdetermine the size and make-up of the microbial communityover the long term. Repeated application combined with habitatenhancement is usually necessary to cause a lasting change inthe soil microbial community (Fig. 1).Figure 1. General effects of soil inoculation. Figure credit: LynneCarpenter-Boggs, Washington State University.Although it is difficult to directly change microbial communities,the community make-up and/or its activities can be affected bymicrobial signaling. Microorganisms communicate with eachother by several means, including through volatile or diffusiblemolecules. Individual microbes can release tiny amounts ofhormones, signals, and other chemicals that may induce achange in the activities of neighboring microbes. Antibiotics area well-known example, and are produced by many soil andcompost microbes to reduce the growth of other populations.The chemistry and complexity of microbial signaling is a newfrontier in microbiology.Another reason BD preparations are gaining popularity andinterest is for disease inhibition. Preparations may suppressplant pathogenic organisms through competition, predation,antagonism of microbes in the preparations, or inhibitorycompounds from the microorganisms. Some materials can alsoinduce \"systemic resistance\" in plants. This is similar to a plantvaccination or overall immune system stimulation. Typical plantresponses to pathogenic attack such as production of chitinase(an enzyme that breaks down fungal cell walls) and thickeningof plant defensive cell walls can be stimulated PRIOR to actualattack by a pathogen. When and if a pathogen does attack, theplant is primed for defense, and stands a much better chance ofsurvival. This systemic resistance has been found to be inducedby many materials such as soluble silica solutions (Fig. 2)(Ch\u00e9rif et al. 1994; Fauteux et al., 2005). Biodynamicpreparation 501 is made by finely grinding and fermentingquartz or feldspar, and may represent a traditional method ofinducing plant systemic resistance.Figure 2. Plant immunity stimulation after treatment with silicaspray. Figure credit: Lynne Carpenter-Boggs, Washington StateUniversity.Plant hormone applications are not uncommon in horticulturalproduction. They are used to induce budding, induce rooting, orchange plant physiology in other ways. Several studies haveidentified plant hormones, such as auxins and cytokinins in BDpreparations, or documented hormone-like effects 1976).Testing BD on the FarmThe use of BD methods and preparations on thousands of farmssuggests that there can be real benefits. Successful use of anynew material should be accompanied with on-farmexperimentation and diligent record keeping. List the materialsor methods you'd like to compare. Always include a \"negativecontrol,\" an area or set of plants that receives no treatment oronly water spray, and a \"positive control\" or your usual method.You may want to try several variations on the new material ormethod, such as using three different composts in addition toyour usual fertilizer \"positive control\" and unfertilized \"negativecontrol\". Apply each treatment to several (preferably 3-4) fieldareas or sets of plants to assure that results are consistent.Take note of the timing and conditions during application of thematerials or method, and during the season. Collect data suchas crop yield, temperature of compost, disease level on plants,or whatever factor you want to improve. The more care taken inexperiments, the more reliable the results. Then the results ofyour treatments can be compared side-by-side.For more information about on-farm testing, useful guides areprovided by SAREhttp://www.sare.org/publications/research/research.pdf andSTEEP http://pnwsteep.wsu.edu/onfarmtesting/oftman.htm.
