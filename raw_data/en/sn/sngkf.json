If so, join Jenni Byrd Grier for her new guided meditation series. Originally created as a live course, it was so popular, we decided to make it an online course. In the course, Jenni guides you through specific meditations to shift your energy and bring healing to each of your chakras. Chakras are energy centers located along your spine that correspond to different physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of your being. Each chakra has a specific color, sound, and quality that can be activated and balanced through meditation. By focusing on your chakras during meditation, you can release blockages, increase flow, and harmonize your energies. Learning how to shift your energy is a valuable practice that can help you transform your life from the inside out. Guided meditation is a powerful tool that can support you on your journey towards self-discovery, healing, and growth. Whether you are new to meditation or an experienced practitioner, we encourage you to join Jenni in this series and see how it can benefit your mind, body, and spirit.
