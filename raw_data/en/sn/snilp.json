The shine or polish or your opal can wear down when exposed to the earth elements. It is not a good idea to wear your opal ring when gardening or at the beach. Dirt and sand granules can dull its sheen, or even scratch it. An opal may not fare well in extreme cold or heat. If an opal is kept in a glass display case under a heated lamp, it could crack. Opals should be moistened often with a natural oil or water. If all the water evaporates out of the stone it will become fragile and break. Because there are so many different types of opals, it is best to ask the gem dealer about special care at the time of purchase.
