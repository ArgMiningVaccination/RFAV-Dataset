For moderate to severe cases, stronger oral prescription drugs may be needed. While herpes can't be cured, your doctor may provide topical anaesthetics for managing throat pain. It's always better to prevent health issues than to treat them. This goes for the issues that cause throat spots, too. Even if prevention depends a lot on the underlying cause, there's one rule that holds for all cases: Good personal hygiene is key.
