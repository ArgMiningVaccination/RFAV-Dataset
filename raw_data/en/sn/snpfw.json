Learn from integrative dermatologists and experts in integrative medicine. The LearnSkin Integrative Esthetician Certificate Program provides standardized post-graduate education. We created this program to ensure that all estheticians get quality skin education. Our dermatologists teamed up with some of the industry's most noted esthetics educators to create a curriculum that brings a holistic approach to the esthetics industry. [LearnSkin Premium Membership](https://www.learnskin.com/membership/pricing) ($499 value) is included in tuition for additional access to educational resources on skin health topics. Introduction to Integrative Esthetics Integrative Esthetics is a holistic approach to skin care, taking into account the whole person. It is the practice of utilizing various complementary modalities as well as the conventional clinical approach to esthetics. The Clinical Approach With the exception of a few holistic esthetics schools, most programs teach a clinical approach to skin care. This forms the foundation of how students view traditional esthetics. This module reinforces the clinical foundation before students move on to complementary approaches to esthetics. Select Principles of Ayurveda The increased popularity of yoga has ignited an interest in its sister science, Ayurveda. Dating back 5,000 years, Ayurveda is thought to be one of the most ancient and complete forms of natural healing on the planet. In this module, students are introduced to the basic principles, so they can better converse with clients and other practitioners about Ayurveda. Key Principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine The benefits of Traditional Chinese Medicine are well documented. It outlines the relationship between the five elements\u2014wood, fire, earth, metal, and water\u2014and the life force known as \"qi.\" Understanding this approach helps the esthetician identify their client's innate nature and devise a treatment plan that addresses their skin concerns. Nutritional Skincare The connection between nutrition and skin health often goes unaddressed in undergraduate esthetics schools. This course introduces students to how they are intrinsically connected and how you can assist clients in their lifestyle choices to improve health and skin conditions. Renowned estheticians and educators have developed the Integrative Esthetician Certificate Program with emphasis in skin of color and holistic skincare. 2022 Application Thank you for registering for the Integrative Esthetician Certificate Program.
