Words From Our Patients \"I could fill pages and pages of how Dr. Ham changed my life.\" \"She is my guardian angel and a miracle worker. She has addressed my health on so many levels to improve my quality of life including hormonal issues, gut issues, weight loss, anxiety, food allergies, and acne, just to name a few. Dr. Ham gave me the confidence that I could take control of my health again and my dream of being a mommy would come true, even when other doctors told me otherwise. Her treatment strategies have been very effective, as varied as home therapies, diet plans, and homeopathic remedies tailored perfectly to my needs. These went a long way, improving my hormonal panel and blood sugar, and erasing my anxiety, which was our focus. I had a follow-up visit after 8 months of treatment and shared with Dr. Ham my BIG news that I was carrying a little miracle. That moment for me was so special, seeing my doctor so emotional and so genuinely happy for me. With her help, my pregnancy was very easy and I ended up delivering a very healthy baby girl of almost 10 lbs. She is an expert in her field and a Genius naturopath!!!\" Camelia E. \"I am grateful every day for Dr. Ham and for the healing power of homeopathy.\" \"When I had my first appointment with Dr. Ham, I was in a state of desperation. I had been previously diagnosed with major depression and anxiety and had been on various prescription drugs since I was a teenager, none of which truly helped me. At my first appointment, Dr. Ham said she suspected I had a condition called PCOS\u2014something I'd never heard of and no doctor had ever mentioned to me before. When I realized the symptoms matched up to my other complaints, and the diagnosis was confirmed with lab work and an ultrasound, I was relieved.There was a name for what was wrong with me and depression was just a symptom of it! Unfortunately, this also meant that my irregular periods were not just because I had been on birth control for years. This also meant that there was a reason I hadn't been able to get pregnant. Because Dr. Ham was able to balance my hormones naturally using homeopathy and a few supplements, I am thrilled to say that I am free from the depression that nearly destroyed my life, and I am pregnant with a child who was conceived naturally.\" Heather P. - Healing the body with fresh organic foods, exercise and a healthy environment. - Healing the mind with coaching and creating healthy relationships. - Healing the soul with meditation/prayer, yoga and healing of past traumas.
