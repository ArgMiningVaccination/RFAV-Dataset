The state of medical knowledge is evolving, but it is clear that the virus is believed to spread from through the air, person-to-person contact, and/or by contact with contaminated surfaces and objects. People reportedly can be infected and show no symptoms and therefore spread the disease. Evidence has shown that COVID-19 can cause serious and potentially life-threatening illness and even death. The safety measures and guidelines listed above are being implemented consistent with current guidance issued by federal, state, and local public health officials.
