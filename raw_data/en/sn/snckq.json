Most of all, a big thank-you to the Green Nations, the plants and trees that have sustained our bodies and spirits for millions of years: A Blessing on the plants, algae of the oceans, wet mosses, and Forest ferns. A Blessing on the shady trees, protective Oaks, holly and rowan that feed the birds, cedar and juniper, spicebush and maple. A Blessing on the fruitwoods, and the woods that build our homes, our furniture, our sailboats and spoons, and give us leaves for books. A Blessing on the herbs of the fields, damp in summer mornings, and on all the plants that fill the table, giving their lives in silent sacrifice: the carrots and tomatoes, the rice and the plums, blessings on them all. Deep in the forest, in a circle of trees Is where they bless me, close by a running brook and weathered stone. Quiet and still their beauty, roots running deep, I bless them and thank them every day.

FOREWORD by Matthew Wood Knowledge comes in threes according to the ancient Celts, and the herbal knowledge in this book comes in three dimensions. First, plants are healers, and Secret Medicines from Your Garden teaches us how to use them for healing in a great diversity of ways. Second, the lore of herbs is fascinating and, like the healing properties, almost without end. This book demonstrates that fact. It contains lore from all sorts of sources. Finally, herbs are fun. Although modern drug companies\u2014with their disinformation campaigns on the Internet and control of the media\u2014would like us to hesitate and bow down to the gods of seriousness, the truth is otherwise. Herbalism can be a fun, do-it-yourself project. Our little green friends are safe\u2014if well selected or directed by a good book such as this one. Herbs are lore-filled-fascinating-fun-healing. And that is the main point of this book. Looking at the book as a whole, however, we see that it is also an account of a journey, a master herbalist's notebook, and an autobiography written in green script. We find here not the facts of Ellen's life, but the things that thrilled her. And we feel the thread of the writer's experience and life running through the pages, unifying diverse lessons into a flowing and almost living narrative. Ellen Hopman is an herbalist, Druidess, student, teacher, writer, and lore mistress, and all those facets contribute to this master herbalist's journey-notebook-green-script-autobiography. This book could only have been written by one who has been collecting information\u2014and using it\u2014for a very long time. Ellen reveals that she was called. A real teacher does not brag; she just mentions what happened. Ellen simply describes how the green path called her and took her on a lifetime journey. And something of that calling enters into this book. This is my favorite Ellen Evert Hopman book precisely because it is not one more herbal written in an organized manner\u2014herb by herb or condition by condition\u2014but flows from topic to topic, giving us a kaleidoscopic view of herbalism that reflects, in a real sense, what it feels like to be an herbalist. This book is closer to the green world in its unorganized, raw, primal origins, before human beings drew up boxes and organized it for their own consumption. I could relate to it so deeply; it could have been my story or that of any other herbalist revealing the things that thrilled us on the path. Here Ellen unwinds the organization enough to see the raw green woods that inspire each and every savant of this art. But if the reader wants organizational themes, you can also find these\u2014collected like little treasures\u2014in chapters such as The Signatures of Plants and elsewhere. If the reader wants scientific evidence, look at the sources listed in the bibliography. And if the reader simply wants a fun read, just plunge into any chapter, anywhere. Ellen is an experienced herbalist who has worked with thousands of people, but we can tell a true doctoress of the art because she can heal unintentionally, by mistake, and after the lights have been turned off. Ellen healed me in just such a manner. I had enjoyed the winding California road that took me from Ukiah down into the Anderson Valley and on to the herb school and home of my friend, Mary Pat Palmer, just past the small village of Philo. My back was extra stiff from the drive over the moderately dangerous roads of the California coastal ranges, but I'd suffered from back pain for over forty years. One particular type of pain I considered incurable. The muscles attaching to the iliac crest had grown stiff a long time before, compensating for other stiff muscle groups. Then small cysts of cartilage, fats, and serous fluid had developed at the juncture of the bone and the muscle. I'd heard from chiropractors and massage therapists that these are sometimes curable with a lot of work. Ellen had just taught a class at Mary Pat's the month before and I was shown a bottle of salve the class had made from the characteristic local trees of the area\u2014Ellen is a tree herbalist, one more feather in her hat. The ingredients were Oak, Black Walnut, Bay Laurel, Eucalyptus, and Redwood. A note on the bottle opined that it might be helpful for the lungs and pain. Ridiculous, I thought. What a waste of time to just throw together a bunch of local trees. What was Ellen thinking? I am, however, a big believer in Bay Laurel, which gives me great dreams (it contains DMT) and is an excellent muscle relaxant. So I smeared a bunch of the green salve across the top of my iliac crest. Wow! The pains I had always felt across there melted in seconds. In a few weeks the cysts had disappeared. For the first time in decades I could reach my toes. How was this possible? Ellen might rely on her special relationship with the spirits of the trees, but I needed an explanation. There must be a synergism of trees: Oak bark to remove scar tissue, Black Walnut to remove effusions of serum, Bay Laurel to relax the muscles and probably direct the formula, Eucalyptus to diffuse the remedies through the tissues, and Redwood for\u2014I think\u2014dissolving fats in the cyst. But it took a magician to put the group together and leave them on the table for me after she'd left the theater. Thank you, Ellen.

INTRODUCTION WALKING THE GREEN PATH An Herbalist Discovers Her Calling I never set out to be an herbalist. As a graduate student I was offered a scholarship to study art history in Rome. My plan was to explore Neoplatonism as it was expressed in Renaissance sculpture and to make a catalog of dolphins on baptismal fonts. Since early childhood I had been mystically inclined, and the iconography of the dolphins seemed fascinating. They were carved on the fonts because according to ancient tradition they ferried the souls of the dead across the water to the other world. Never mind that these were Christian baptismal fonts. I dutifully began to photograph and read, spending days studying in the dim Hertziana and Vatican libraries and exploring ancient churches. But, being me, I soon felt a pull to go to the countryside. I took the train to Assisi, in Umbria, to look at the famous frescoes of Giotto in the local cathedral. What I saw there were sumptuously laid-out depictions of the life of the saint known as Il Poverello, the Poor One. I knew that Saint Francis had lived a life of dedicated simplicity and poverty, eating gruel with ashes mixed in and wearing simple brown robes. It seemed incongruous to me that there was gold leaf on the lavishly painted images. I ran into a monk in a brown wool cassock as I was leaving the church. Where can I find out more about how Saint Francis actually lived? I asked. He looked at me for a moment before replying. Go to San Masseo. What is San Masseo? I asked. Don't ask any questions, just go, he said, pointing down the road. I dutifully took off down the street. The road led out of town and eventually I saw a small wooden sign that pointed off to the right. There was a muddy little path through some bushes and then a small clearing where I saw groups of young men and women, mostly Germans, all roughly my age, lolling around on the grass. Have you come here to stay? one of them asked in a friendly tone. I don't know, I replied. I ended up staying for four days. Then I returned to Rome to pack up my belongings and took the train right back to Assisi. Art history research was put on the back burner as I learned the ways of the Franciscan community I had stumbled upon. I soon began to take part in community activities such as baking bread in the stone oven and feeding the ducks and chickens that were given free rein to wander the kitchen and dining room. I went to Mass twice a day (never telling anyone that I wasn't a Catholic) and on Wednesdays and Sundays I fasted. Those were the days when we were supposed to wander in the wilderness, walking out of the community with no thoughts of a destination, because God would lead us to wherever or whomever we were supposed to meet. I would clamber around the hillsides at those times, taking in the beauty of the flowers and trees and grasses, delighting in the bright green life that expressed itself in the ancient olives and tiny wildflowers. I never missed human companionship, feeling that the plants were my friends and companions. One day I found myself on Mount Subasio, a place the saint himself used to frequent. (Keep in mind that this was a saint who once preached naked and who talked to wolves and birds. He also thought of the sun, moon, and fire as his brothers and sisters.) I was wandering around up there, high above the tree line, when a sudden storm came up. Next thing I knew, there was thunder and lightning and snow coming down. I was terrified because I was all alone. What to do? So I did something that in hindsight was actually rather stupid\u2014I found a tiny pine tree and wrapped myself around it for comfort. It was the only living thing on the mountainside other than the grass. The storm passed quickly and I was soaked. I remember looking at my shoulders and seeing snow caked on them. The whole experience was so exhilarating that I sang out loud as I made my way back down the mountain. Right across from the path to San Masseo was a little Romanesque church that Saint Francis had repaired with his own hands. Being pre-Gothic, it had no stained glass windows to let in the light. It was very dark in there as I slipped inside to rest and meditate. I settled myself on a wooden bench in the darkness, and suddenly I heard a voice coming from inside and outside of my body all at once. Everything you have been doing until now has been for status and intellect and to please your parents, the voice said. You are supposed to be working with plants. I instantly knew that this was true. I had felt a bond and a companionship with the herbs and grasses that went far beyond anything I had experienced in museums and dry libraries. I began to mentally throw out everything I was doing: the master's degree in art history, the thesis on dolphins on baptismal fonts, and my parents' ambition that I be a college professor. As I mentally threw out each item I felt lighter and lighter. Soon my chest was glowing with a kind of inner fire. I walked back to the little community of San Masseo and told them what I had experienced. You need to go to Findhorn, everybody there is just like you, a man said. I knew that I was on a vision quest at that point and so I did not ask any questions. I went back to the States, sold all my possessions, and made my way to Findhorn, Scotland, one of the first New Age communities in the world. I spent five weeks learning about fairies and studying massage and flower essence counseling. Then I spent two weeks on Erraid and Iona in the Hebrides (islands that eventually inspired my second novel, The Druid Isle). I came back to the States and immediately began an herbal apprenticeship with William LeSassier in New York City. After I finished my studies I set up a practice in Philadelphia and began writing herbal articles and doing radio shows. My spiritual path was Earth based; I had found a group of like-minded people with whom I did rituals in nearby forests. I also began to study with Native American elders like Wallace Black Elk, Ron Evans, and others, deepening my relationship with the herbs and trees and grasses, and with the animals, rocks, water, and fire. After I had studied with the First Nations for five years, one of the elders said to me: It's great that you are learning our ways and honoring our ancestors. But you need to honor your own. At the time I had no idea what he meant. A client of mine happened to mention that she had met a Druid. She told me that she had been to several Pagan festivals but had not been terribly impressed. Then she met Isaac Bonewits and liked his clean robes and academic knowledge about the Celts. The moment I heard the word Druid it was as if a harp string were being plucked in my heart. I had heard about the ancient Druids who once lived on Iona, but I had no idea that there were still Druids in this world. I knew deep inside that this was my path, and so I set out to find Druids. I eventually located Isaac and ADF (A Druid Fellowship), the group he was forming. That was in 1983. By 1984 I was one of the first members. After two initiations, the second supervised by Isaac himself at Pagan Spirit Gathering in Wisconsin, I went on to cofound the Henge of Keltria in 1986 with four other people. Lady Olivia Robertson of the Fellowship of Isis made me an Archdruidess of the Druid Clan of Dana after my first book, Tree Medicine Tree Magic, came out in 1991. In 1996 I started the Whiteoak mailing list and then became a cofounder and later co-chief of the Whiteoak Druid Order (Ord na Darach Gile) in 1997. Starting in the winter of 2013 I "}
