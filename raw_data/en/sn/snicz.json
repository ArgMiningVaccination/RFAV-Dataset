AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 The Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc. (\"PLAC\") is a nonprofit pro fessional association with scores of corporate members from a broad cross-section of American and international product manufac- turing. 2 These companies seek to contribute to legal improvement and reform in the United States and elsewhere, emphasizing la w governing liability of product manufacturers and others in the supply chain. PLAC's perspective is derived from the experiences of a corporate membership spanning a diverse group of industries in various facets of the manufacturing sec- tor. In addition, several hundred leading product lia-bility defense attorneys are sustaining (non-voting) members of PLAC. PLAC's primary purpose is to file amicus curiae briefs in cases affecting the development of product re- lated litigation that impact PLAC's members. Since 1 The parties submitted blanket amicus curiae consent let- ters, and timely notice has been provided, pursuant to S.Ct. Rule 37.2. Pursuant to S.Ct. Rule 37.6, amicus states that no counsel for a party wrote this brief in whole or in part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the prepa-ration or submission of this brief. No person or entity, other than the amicus curiae , its members, or its counsel, has made a mone- tary contribution to this brief 's preparation or submission. 2 PLAC's current corporate membership is listed at https:// plac.com/PLAC/Membership/Corporate_Membership.aspx. 2 1983, PLAC has filed more than 1,200 briefs as amicus curiae in both state and federal courts, including this Court, presenting the broad perspective of its mem- bers, and product suppliers generally, and seeking fair-ness and balance in the application and development of the law as it affects product risk management. PLAC's interest in this matter is the profound im- pact on federally regulated businesses of state-law claims seeking to impose conflicting obligations. Many PLAC members, especially FDA-regulated entities, are subject to federal restrictions governing what they can, and cannot, state in product labeling. To avoid being sitting ducks in litigation, regulated businesses de- pend on federal supremacy to preclude state-law lia- bility where they comply wi th federal requirements. Here, FDA denied, as scie ntifically unfounded, two citizen petitions that sought precisely the same la- beled warning that the State of Mississippi now de-mands. The federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended , 21 U.S.C. through FDA's expert determinations. Thus , this matter presents express preemption questions under cases such as Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC , 562 U.S. 223 (2011) (vac- cines), and Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc. , 552 U.S. 312 (2008) (medical devices). PLAC's federally-regulated members cannot serve two masters imposing conflicting obligations. If forced 3 by massive state-law liability to ignore FDA labeling decisions, their products will eventually resemble un- regulated consumer products - festooned with multi- ple warning about questionable risks that consumers tend to ignore. In Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Al- brecht , 139 S.Ct. 1668 (2019) (\" Albrecht \"), the Court recognized that, to enforce the FDCA, FDA has repeat-edly sought to prevent over warning in labels of prod- ucts it regulates. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT As the Petition argues, this appeal presents criti- cal preemption issues. Indisputably: (1) the relief sought by the State of Mississippi directly contradicts FDA's scientific determination that cosmetic talc labels should not warn about ovarian cancer; and (2) FDA considered and rejected the very risk warning the State demands. FDA did so by denying two citizen pe- titions after \"careful review.\" Pet. App. at 4a. Although that decision was final and appealable, 21 U.S.C \u00a710.45(d), nobody appealed. Rather, within months, the Mississippi Attorney General commenced the current collateral attack on FDA's decision. 1. The Decision Below. As discussed more fully in the Petition, plaintiff/ respondent, Attorney General of the State of Missis- sippi, brought this state-law consumer protection 4 action against defendants/petitioners (collectively \"J&J\") in 2014. The State contends that J&J's talc-con- taining cosmetics not warning about a claimed risk of ovarian cancer violated Missi ssippi's statute and ex- posed J&J to liability - $10,000 for each unit sold in Mississippi since 1974. Pet. App. 3a-4a. J&J raised federal preemption, arguing that Mis- sissippi's suit differed from FDA's scientific-basis re- quirement, as applied to talc labeling by denial of two citizen petitions involving the same risk. The State ad- mittedly demanded the same warning that FDA had rejected. Pet. App. 13a-15a. Nevertheless, the Missis-sippi Supreme Court found no preemption, following a presumption against federal preemption - \"a duty to accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption\" in cases implicating \"the historic police powers of the States.\" Pet. App. 11a, 16a-17a. Under this presumption, the court narrowly inter- preted an FDA \"requirement\" to exclude agency ac- tions this Court has found preemptive. \"[T]o be binding on the public, the [FDA] mu st follow the notice and comment rule making process.\" Pet. App. 15a. 2. State-Law Demands For Scientifically Un- supported Warnings Creates Overwarning And Reduces The Effecti veness Of FDA-Re- quired Warnings. The FDCA expressly preempts state cosmetic \"requirements\" that fail to meet the degree of scien- tific support mandated by FDA. \"[N]o may 5 establish . . . any requirement for labeling or packag- ing of a cosmetic that is di fferent from or in addition to, or that is otherwise not identical with, a[n FDA] re- quirement specifically applicable to [that] cosmetic un-der this chapter.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7379s. 3 In addition to the deep and profound differences of opinion, thoroughly discussed in the Petition, between federal appellate courts and state high courts on the two key preemption-related issues, the Mississippi court ruling is inimical to long-held FDA labeling pol- icy. For over forty years, the Agency has developed and enforced requirements that all warnings for regulated products have specified levels of scientific support. FDA's scientific requiremen ts have been developed, inter alia , to prevent excessive and unsupported warnings from drowning out more important label in- formation and from diluting the impact of warnings generally. This Court has joined the vast majority of lower courts, as well as commentators and the Ameri- can Law Institute, to recognize the validity of FDA's concerns. The Mississippi court's refusal to give preemptive effect to a recent FDA labeling decision that the warn-ing in question was, and is , scientifically unsupported strikes at the heart of this longstanding basis for FDA decisionmaking. Even more than private litigation, un-trammeled state enforcement of disparate and less 3 The three exceptions in \u00a7379s(b,d-e), an FDA-approved state exemption, product liability litigation, and certain state in- itiatives, are inapplicable. 6 rigorous warning requirements - backed by potentially astronomical liability - is especially likely to cause reg- ulated product manufacturers to engage in precisely the sort litigation-averse overwarning that FDA has spent decades trying to prevent. 3. The Presumption Against Preemption Ap- plied Here Directly Flouts The Court's Con-trary Precedents. The Mississippi court negated preemption clause, and disregarded this Court's prec- edents, first by applying a presumption against pre- emption, Pet. App. 15a (invoking \"a duty to accept the reading that disfavors preemption\"). In Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust , 136 S.Ct. 1938 (2016), the Court explicitly repu- diated such presumptions in cases involving express preemption clauses, as such presumptions fail to ac-cord due respect to statut ory language. Congress' words control over extratextual considerations, such as whether the subject is of \"his toric\" state concern. Pet. App. 11a. \"Only the written word is the law.\" Bostock v. Clayton Cty., Georgia , 140 S.Ct. 1731, 1737 (2020). Indeed, even before Puerto Rico v. Franklin 's ex- plicit rejection, the Court twice declined to apply such presumptions in prescription medical product express preemption cases, despite dissents urging that it do so. For example in Bruesewitz v. Wyeth , the Court's even- handed construction of an express preemption clause required finding that the National Childhood Vaccine 7 Injury Act of 1986 preempted design defect claims. But in an almost identical case, a state high court applying a legally improper presumption reached a directly con- trary result . 4. Limiting Preemption To Notice-And-Com- ment Rulemaking Would Eliminate Most Ex- isting Grounds For Preemption And Disrupt Federal Decisions. Second, the Mississippi court held it could disre- gard FDA's decision altogether, since denial of citizen petitions seeking identical relief did not involve \"no- tice-and-comment rule making.\" Pet. App. 15a. That re- strictive rationale would eliminate preemption for most of what FDA does, including actions that the Court held supported preemption in previous FDA-re- lated cases. Notice-and-comment rulemaking has not been the exclusive basis for preemption. Other recog- nized grounds include formally rejecting a warning la- bel, and any agency action carrying the force of law. The Court has consistently recognized FDA re- quirements as supporting both express and implied preemption. For decades, FDA has regulated product warnings as it did here, through product-specific label- ing decisions, including adjudication of citizen peti- tions. FDA has not approved a product-specific label through notice-and-comment rulemaking in decades. The ruling below is incompatible with virtually all of the Court's recent FDCA preemption precedent. 8 The ramifications extend well beyond the FDCA. The Public Readiness & Emergency Preparedness Act, 119 Stat. 2818, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7247d-6d, et. seq . enforced by fed- eral preemption, for persons responding to public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Id. \u00a7247d-6d. This immunity is not created through no- tice-and-comment rulemaking, but rather by formal administrative \"declarations\" that are published in the Federal Register. Id. \u00a7247d-6d(b). Making notice-and- comment rulemaking a prerequisite to express federal preemption would expose everyone responding to the current pandemic to state-law litigation and liability. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- REASONS FOR GRANTING CERTIORARI I. Allowing States To Require Warnings FDA Finds Scientifically Unsupported Would Lead To Overwarning And Reduce The Ef- fectiveness Of All Product Warnings. A primary function of FDA, and other federal agencies regulating products, is to evaluate the risks and benefits of those products and to ensure that their labeling accurately warn s of product dangers. See Merck KGaA v. Integra Lifesciences I, Ltd. , 545 U.S. 193, 196 (2005). Where, as here, the agency formally acted, \"[i]t is enough for us that the expert agency charged with the enforcement of remedial legislation has determined [what] is desirable for the public health, for we are hardly qualified to second-guess 9 [FDA].\" United States v. Article of Drug information is designed to 'prevent overwarning' so that less important information does not 'overshadow' more important information.\" Albrecht , 139 S.Ct. at 1672 Therefore, FDA labeling re-quirements are \"designed to exclude '[e]xaggeration of risk, or inclusion of speculative or hypothetical risks,' that 'could discourage appropriate [product] use.' \" Id. 4 More generally, a product label's \" [m]eaningful disclosure does not mean more disclosure. Rather, it de- scribes a balance between competing considerations of complete disclosure and the need to avoid informa- tional overload.\" Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin , 444 U.S. 555, 568 (1980) (citation and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis original). Likewise, the Court re- jected an overbroad foreseeability-based approach to asbestos warnings as \"impos[ing] a difficult and costly burden on manufacturers, wh ile simultaneously over- warning users.\" Air & Liquid Sys. Corp. v. DeVries , 139 S.Ct. 986, 994 (2019). The national economy is greatly burdened when manufacturers of products sold nation- wide are subjected to \"diverse, nonuniform, Group, Inc. , 505 U.S. 504, 514 (1992) (footnote omitted). 4 Quoting 73 Fed. Reg. 49603, 49 605-606 (FDA Aug. 22, 2008), and 73 Fed. Reg. 2848, 2851 (FDA Jan. 16, 2008). 10 Dilution of significant product warnings through overwarning is a well-known and longstanding prod- uct liability concern: Requiring too many warnings trivializes the[ir] entire purpose . . . , drown- ing out cautions against latent dangers of which a user might not otherwise be aware. Such a requirement would neutralize the ef- fectiveness of warnings as an inexpensive way to allow consumers to adjust their behavior based on knowledge of a product's inherent dangers. Liriano v. Hobart Corp. , 700 N.E.2d 303, 308 (N.Y. 1998) (citation omitted). In a case involving an FDA-regulated over-the- counter product, another state high court held that \"a truthful warning of an uncertain or remote danger may mislead the consumer into misjudging the [prod- uct's] dangers,\" leading to \"medically SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare 88 P.3d 1, 14 (Cal. 2004). \"Requiring man- ufacturers to warn their products' users in all in-stances\" would create \"an onerous burden\" and \"invite mass consumer disregard and ultimate contempt for the warning process.\" Johnson v. American Standard, Inc., 179 P.3d 905, 914 (Cal. 200 8) (citation and quota- tion marks omitted). In a prescription drug case: [C]ommon sense and experience suggest that if every report of a possible risk, no mat- ter how speculative, conjectural, or tentative, imposed an affirmative duty to give some 11 warning, a manufacturer would be required to inundate physicians indiscriminately with notice of any and every hint of danger, thereby inevitably diluting the force of any specific warning given. Finn v. G.D. Searle & Co. , 677 P.2d 1147, 1153 (Cal. 1984) (citations omitted). Additional warnings can be \"ineffective or even counte rproductive if the warning inserts became so large and cumbersome that a user could not easily find the warning.\" Ramirez v. Plough, Inc., 863 P.2d 167, 175-76 (Cal. 1993). 5 Numerous federal courts of appeal agree. Applying Mississippi law, Thomas v. Hoffman-LaRoche , Inc., 949 F.2d 806 (5th Cir. 1992), no ted that \"forc[ing] drug manufacturers to list, and perhaps contraindicate, every possible risk\" would be unwise: [P]hysicians will begin to ignore or discount the warnings provided by the drug manufac- turers.

District court decisions decrying overwarning are legion, and most common in preemption contexts. Last year, preemption vindicated a federal agency order re- jecting scientifically unfounded cellphone radiation risk warnings, contrary to a municipal ordinance: Given the specificity of the warning required . . . , the implied risk to safety if the warning is not followed (a risk the FCC has concluded does not exist), and the acknowledged contro- versy . . . , the FCC could properly conclude that the [local] ordinance - as worded - over- warns. CTIA - The Wireless Ass'n v. City of Berkeley , 487 F. Supp.3d 821, 834 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (citation and quo- tation marks omitted). This year, \"FDA's approach to warning labels\" preempted multi-district litigation demanding scien-tifically unsupported cancer warnings. Unlike unregu- lated products bearing \"dozens of warnings, with little regard for . . . remoteness or obviousness\": FDA is concerned not with avoiding in- sufficient warnings . . . , but also avoiding over-warning (that is, warning against risks that are unduly speculative, hypothetical, or not adequately supported by science). . . . FDA takes a more measured approach that is 14 intended to provide accurate information to medical professionals and patients without unduly discouraging the use of the product.

Md. 2006) (\"warnings must be brief and focuse d to be effective\"). 15 As this case demonstrates, prevention of over- warning has a strong regulatory component. For over 40 years, FDA has opposed warnings about unsubstan- tiated risks. In 1975, it caut ioned that scientifically du- bious warnings \"would result in such uncertainty and confusion that the usefulness of [existing] warnings in protecting the public against possible harm would be severely undermined, if not destroyed.\" 40 Fed. Reg. 28582, 28583 (FDA July 7, 1975). Four years later FDA rejected inclusion of \"general statements on good pro-fessional practice\" because they could \"transform la- beling into small text-books of medicine.\" 44 Fed. Reg. 37434, 37436 (FDA June 26, 1979). This remains FDA's bottom-line position. Support includes, of course, the 2008 Federal Register state-ments cited in Albrecht , supra . 7 Current agency guid- ance on Including too many warnings and precau- tions, over-warning, dilu tes the strength of all of the hazard alerts. . . .

The American Law Institute's Third Restatement of Torts recognizes that excessive warnings \"ma y be ignored by users and consumers and may diminish the significance of warn-ings about [other] risks\" and \"could reduce the efficacy of warnings generally.\" Restatement (Third) of Torts, Products Liability \u00a72, comment j (1998). Professors Prosser and Keeton criticized overwarning as reflect- ing a \"naive belief that one can warn against all signif- icant risks. Too much detail can be counterproductive.\" W. Page Keeton, et al. , Prosser & Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a796, at 686 (5th ed. 1984). 8 The cited FDA documents are available at: https://www. fda.gov/media/71030/download (las t visited Sept. 23, 2021), and http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drug s/guidancecomplianceregulatory information/guidances/ucm069984.pdf (last visited Sept 23, 2021), respectively. 17 Law review articles by the ALI's reporters for the Third Restatement exemplify academic commentary on overwarning. \"[T]he greatest part of the costs of over- warning are nonmonetary and easily ignored.\" James A.

Multiple studies have shown that too many warnings . . . decrease the effectiveness of each warning, lead to information overload for patients, and discourage patients from using an otherwise beneficial drug. . . .

The risks of overwarning are only magnified here, where plaintiff is a political branch of government, not a private litigant. Although this litigation involves an FDA-regulated cosmetic, Mississippi's next target could easily be an essential vaccine. Some state gov- ernments have participated in the torrent of attacks on COVID-19 vaccines (and vaccination generally) de- spite the vaccines being approved or authorized by FDA based on the best available scientific evidence. One state has prohibited mandatory COVID-19 vac- cination of school children, 11 and another state's De- partment of Health \"issued a directive halting all child vaccination outreach efforts.\" 12 In this environment, should the decision below stand, it is hardly far-fetched to envision state attor- neys general, or other state actors, suing to demand scientifically questionable vaccine warnings that flunk FDA's rigorous standards. Overwarning has always been an issue in vaccine litigation. See Dunn v. Lederle Laboratories , 328 N.W.2d 576, 580-81 (Mich. App. to is in- dividualized; \"excessive wa Meghan Mangrum, \"As Tenne ssee Halts Vaccine Outreach to Kids, Nashville Youth Still Get COVID-19 Shots,\" Nashville Tennessean (July 16, 2021). 21 overload\" and \"may be counterproductive\") (citation omitted). Even before the Court rejected presumptions against express preemption, it recognized preemption where it could not \"imagine 50 different labeling re- gimes prescribing the color, font size, and wording of warnings.\" Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC , 544 U.S. 431, 452 (2005). II. Presumptions Against Preemption In FDCA Express Preempt ion Cases Conflict With This Court's Preemption Precedent. In Puerto Rico v. Franklin , 136 S.Ct. 1938, the Court flatly rejected any \"presumption\" where, as here, Congress expressly mandates preemption. Where a federal \"statute contai ns an express pre-emption clause, we do not invoke any presumption against pre- emption.\" Id. at 1946 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Instead, courts \"focus on the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evi- dence of Congress' pre-emptive intent.\" Id. (citations and quotation marks omitted). The Court \"has ex- plained many times\" that \"people are entitled to rely on the law as written, without fearing that courts might disregard its plain terms based on some extra- omitted). When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations 22 suggest another, it's no contest. Only the writ- ten word is the law. Id. at 1737. Even before abolishing presumptions against ex- press preemption, the Court twice declined to apply such a presumption in prescription medical product cases. Like this case, Riegel involved the term \"require- ment,\" as used in a similar FDCA preemption clause for medical devices. 552 U.S. at 323-25. 13 Despite the dissent's criticism for not \"a ccept[ing] the reading that disfavors preemption,\" id. at 335 (Ginsburg, J., dissent- ing) (citation and quotation marks omitted), Riegel gave \"requirement\" its ordinary meaning. Id. at 325 (refusing to \"turn somersaults to create\" a preemption limitation \"not required or even suggested by the broad language Congress chose\"). \"[G]eneral tort duties\" im- posed preempted \"requirements.\" Id. at 327-28. The Mississippi court here did what Riegel would not - impose an extratextual limit on the \"broad\" term \"requirement,\" as employed by Congress in an FDCA express preemption clause. It invoked the identical \"ac- cept the reading that disfavors pre-emption\" presump-tion as the Riegel dissent. Bruesewitz likewise eschewed any presumption against preemption in holding that the Vaccine Act ex- pressly preempted state-law claims attacking vaccine 13 See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7360k(a)(1) (preempting state \"require- ments\" that are \"different to, [FDA] re-quirement applicable . . . to the device\"). 23 design. The statutory preemption clause barred suits over \"side effects that we re unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared\" and carried \"proper directions and warnings.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300aa-22(b)(1). Despite Congress not explicitly mentioning \"design,\" Bruesewitz held that \"[i]f a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a different design, the word 'un-avoidable' would do no work.\" 562 U.S. at 232. Almost simultaneously, the same supposed obliga- tion to \"disfavor[ ] preemption,\" led the Georgia Su- preme Court to a conclusion diametrically opposed to Bruesewitz . The Georgia court unanimously found no preemption - with the same presumption a central el- ement. See Ferrari v. Am. Home Prods. Corp. , 668 236, 242 (Ga. 2008), vacated Ferrari wrongly ute \"does not preempt all desi gn defect claims against vaccine manufacturers.\" Id. 14 Riegel and Bruesewitz demonstrate how this pre- sumption against preemption a cts as an invitation to error and presaged such presumptions' outright aboli- tion in Puerto Rico v. Franklin . Otherwise, vaccination - \"one of the greatest achievements of public health in the 20th century,\" Bruesewitz , 562 U.S. at 226 14 Ferrari was decided while Bruesewitz was pending. This Court vacated and remanded Ferrari in light of Bruesewitz , Am. Home Prods. Corp. v. Ferrari , 562 U.S. 1254 (2011), and the Geor- gia court reversed its position, Am. Home Prods. Corp. v. Ferrari , 710 S.E.2d 771, 772 (Ga. 2011). 24 (quotation marks and footnote omitted) - could be at- tacked in innumerable lawsuits. Granting certiorari will prevent perpetuation of an obsolete preemption standar d that still frequently leads courts into serious error. \"Congress is entitled to know what meaning this Court will assign to terms regularly used in its enactments.\" Riegel , 552 U.S. at 324 (the term \"requirement\"). III. Presumptions Agains t Preemption Create Unavoidable Conflicts With Agency Deci-sions Having Force of Law. Limiting preemptive agency actions to only those decisions reached by notice-and-comment rulemaking would be a recipe for chaos. Such rulemaking, which usually takes several years, is not normally how FDA or other agencies regulate product warnings. Tampons are the only FDA-regulated product in the last forty years with l abeling created by notice- and-comment rulemaking. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7801.430(c-e) (specifying exact text of tampon labeling for toxic shock syndrome). The rule was proposed on October 21, 1980. 45 Fed. Reg. 69840 (FDA Oct. 21, 1980). It became ef-fective on December 20, 1982. 47 Fed. Reg. 26982, 26990 (FDA June 22, 1982). Even in an extraordinary situation, creating a product warning through notice-and-comment rulemaking took more than two years. Ordinary FDA product-spec ific regulations simply incorporate general labeling requirements. E.g., 21 C.F.R. \u00a773.1550(d) (labeling for talc, used as a color 25 additive, \"shall conform to the requirements of \u00a770.25 of this chapter\"). Since FDA regulates tens of thousands of prod- ucts,15 creation of individual product labeling through notice-and-comment rulemaking would be an impossi- bility. Moreover, Court's FDCA-related preemp- tion cases since Hillsborough Cty., Fla. v. Automated Med. Lab'ys, Inc. , 471 U.S. 707 (1985), address agency requirements created by means other than notice-and- comment rulemaking: Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr , 518 U.S. 470 (1996), FDA medical device clearance; Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs Legal Committee , 531 (2001), FDA medical device clear-ance; Riegel , 552 U.S. 312, FDA medical device pre- market approval; Wyeth v. Levine , 555 U.S. 555 (2009), FDA-ap- proved prescription drug label change; PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing , 564 U.S. 604 (2011), FDA abbreviated generic drug approval; 15 See Fact Sheet: FDA at a Glance (listing approximate number of FDA-regulated products by category), available at https://www.fda.gov/ab out-fda/fda-basics/fa ct-sheet-fda-glance (last visited Sept. 23, 2021). 26 Mut. Pharm. Co. v. Bartlett , 570 U.S. 472 (2013), FDA abbreviated generic drug ap- proval; Albrecht , 139 S.Ct. 1668, FDA-approved Court recently identified FDA's \"formal[ ] re- jecti[on of ] a warning label,\" and any \"other agency ac- tion carrying the force of law\" as preempting state law. Albrecht , 139 S.Ct. at (citations omitted). If notice-and-comment rulemaking were essential to preemption, as the Mississippi court held, then all the above decisions would have reached the same result - no preemptive FDCA \"requirement,\" and therefore, no preemption. However, the that the vast was \"wrongly decided.\" Mut. Pharm. , 570 U.S. at 489. It should do so again, here. Again, the ramifications of the Mississippi court's decision extend well beyond the FDCA. No notice-and- comment rulemaking occurred in Bruesewitz , 562 U.S. 223, only an individual va ccine compensation pro- ceeding. Id. at 230-31. The governmental action found potentially preemptive in Bates , like here, was an agency's registration of an individual product label un- der generally applicable labeling regulations. 544 U.S. at 434-35, 440. The Mississippi court's reasoning would also sink ongoing efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic into 27 a swamp of state-law litig ation. The PREP mmune from suit law,\" for U.S.C. PREP Act immunity is triggered by a formal \"declara-tion\" from the Secretary of Health & Human Services - not by notice-and-comment rulemaking. Id. \u00a7247d- 6d(b)(1-6). Immunity is enfo rced by Act's express preemption clause, which, as here, uses \"requirement\" to describe preemptive federal actions. Id. \u00a7247d- 6d(b)(8)(A-B). In March 2020, the HHS secretary is-sued the statutorily authorized declaration, which has been broadened and extended multiple times. 16 In Mississippi, without notice-and-comment rule- making, the COVID-19 PREP Act declaration provides no immunity because it is not a preemptive federal \"re-quirement[ ] applicable under this section.\" Id. \u00a7247d- 6d(b)(8)(A). Unless the Petition is granted and that de- cision reversed, everyone combatting the COVID-19 pandemic - from vaccine manuf acturers to hospital ad- ministrators faced with limited treatment resources - remains exposed to state-law litigation and liability, in direct contravention of manifest congressional intent. 16 See 85 Fed. Reg. 15198 (HHS March 17, 2020), as amended , 85 Fed. Reg. 21012 (April 15, 2020); 85 Fed. Reg. 35100 (June 5, 2020); 85 Fed. Reg. 52 136 (Aug. 24, 2020); 85 Fed. Reg. 79190 (Dec. 9, 2020); 86 Fed.

Reg. 51160 (Sept. 14, 2021). 28 Thus, this case is of criti cal importance, not only to FDA's regulatory scheme, but to public health gener- ally. --------------------------------- --------------------------------- CONCLUSION The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari should be granted.
