[molecular mimicry and therapeutic vaccines](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/molecular-mimicry-and-therapeutic-vaccines/) If molecular mimicry is at work in the rheumatoid synovium (assuming the presence of a foreign antigen), can a therapeutic vaccine (or several vaccines) be developed to \"retrain\" the immune system into choosing a different, unambiguous epitope? I assume each vaccine so devised (either peptide or DNA based) would have to be antigen specific. There are several well known suspected antigens that could serve as targets for such an approach. [Rheumatoid Arthritis and Injuries](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-injuries/) Being a cancer survivor (GI-FAP) and having a low bone desity due to HRT complications and thrpugh a bone marrow tap done as a youth I was diagnosed with RA. Now in the late 30's and seeing signs now since a serious injury. That being said, my questions is: Can injuries cause RA complications or to be more prevalent? [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/rheumatoid-arthritis-7/) What is the common age for the onset of rheumatoid arthritis and is there a genetic component? [Vitimans and Nutrition](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/vitimans-and-nutrition/) I am the middle of 7 siblings. So far 5 of my siblings have been diagnosed with RA. This went further into my family with Aunts and Uncles and grandparents on both sides. I've been fighting this since I was 17 when all of my joints flamed up. I am almost 46 now. Once in a while I will have inflamed joints and they would go away. Since November 2003 my joints had shown more and more signs of the onset of RA. My right thumb was locking up. My knees were hurting on and off. My hand joints were red and imflamed on and off and very painful. I started looking into nutritional solutions which have once again stopped the progression of my worst nightmare. I started taking fish oil, vitiman E, vitiman D and a product called Juice Plus which gives my body 17 fruit and veggs servings per day. Within 2 weeks of utilizing these nutritional methods my hands and feet have improved at least 75 percent. I am a firm believier that the Juice Plus has been a major factor in stopping the random flaming joints. Is there any studies that I can look at regarding nutrition and RA? My mother was one who excaped this dreaded RA as well. I am hoping to be the next in my family. Know what my brothers and sisters are induring, I have a real need to know as much about this as I can. I have children who could be effected. My 26 year old daughter has some signs. Help!!!!! [Zyban cause of RA](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/ask-the-expert/zyban-cause-of-ra/) Any info would be great. I was prescribed Zyban for smoking cessation. Approx. 3 weeks later got hives. Per md delayed hypersensitivity reaction. 2 days after that awoke with severe pain, swelling in fingers and wrists. Blood test confirmed RA. Arthritis is listed as a rare side effect of Zyban, but not RA. Could Zyban have caused RA, just triggered it, or could blood test be wrong? No symptoms at all of arthritis before this. Been off Zyban 3 weeks, just finished 10 days of Prednisone, still having mild pain in all joints. "}
