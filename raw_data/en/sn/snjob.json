This powerful plant also has the potential to help with some major environmental problems. While this ancient wonder has been used for centuries, moringa benefits are just starting to catch the attention of the mainstream. How can we harness moringa benefits and integrate it into our daily routines? Functional medicine expert, [Dr. Josh Axe](https://draxe.com/nutrition/herbs/moringa-benefits/), is breaking down everything we need to know... Never heard of moringa before? Although this plant was initially discovered for its beneficial properties thousands of years ago, only recently has moringa (sometimes called the Ben oil tree) become known as one of the most impressive herbal supplements to hit the holistic health market. In fact, in 2008 the National Institute of Health called moringa (moringa oleifera) the \"plant of the year,\" acknowledging that \"perhaps like no other single species, this plant has the potential to help reverse multiple major environmental problems and provide for many unmet human needs.\" Clearly, moringa benefits are highly touted and deservedly so. To date, over 1,300 studies, articles and reports have focused on moringa benefits and this plant's healing abilities that are important in parts of the world that are especially susceptible to disease outbreak and nutritional deficiencies. Research shows that just about every part of the moringa plant can be utilized in some way, whether it's to make a potent antioxidant tea or produce an oily substance that lubricates and nourishes the skin. Throughout the world, moringa is used for treating such widespread conditions as: inflammation-related diseases, cancer, diabetes, anemia, arthritis and other joint pain, such as rheumatism, allergies and asthma, constipation, stomach pains and and diarrhea, epilepsy, stomach and intestinal ulcers or spasms, chronic headaches, heart problems, including high blood pressure, kidney stones, fluid retention, thyroid disorders, low sex drive, bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infections... Moringa is an excellent source of protein, vitamin A, potassium, calcium and [vitamin C](http://thechalkboardmag.com/health-at-all-costs-the-3-best-vitamin-c-sources-at-every-price). Just how strong is moringa? According to Kuli Kuli, an organization that harvests moringa plants in Africa and makes them accessible to customers in the the U.S. and other western nations, gram for gram, moringa contains: two times the amount of protein of yogurt, four times the amount of vitamin A as carrots, three times the amount of potassium as bananas, four times the amount of calcium as cows' milk, and seven times the amount of vitamin C as oranges... 6 Proven Moringa Benefits Moringa is known by over 100 names in different languages around the world. This easy-to-grow tropical plant species, native to the Himalayan mountains and parts of India and Africa, comes packed with over 90 protective compounds, including isothiocyanates, flavonoids and phenolic acids. Moringa has gained a reputation for [fighting inflammation](http://thechalkboardmag.com/10-ways-to-avoid-inflammation) and combating various effects of malnutrition and aging, earning the nickname \"the miracle plant.\" Here are the top six proven moringa benefits to show that nickname is well-deserved: Provides Antioxidants + Anti-Inflammatory Compounds. One of the reasons that the many health benefits of herbal plants like Moringa oleifera are so impressive is because they contain similar abilities to conventional drugs, only they don't pose the same level of risk for experiencing side effects. According to a report published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, moringa contains a mix of essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), carotenoid phytonutrients (the same kinds found in plants like carrots and tomatoes), antioxidants such as quercetin, and natural antibacterial compounds that work in the same way as many anti-inflammatory drugs. Moringa leaves are high in several anti-aging compounds that lower the effects of oxidative stress and inflammation, including polyphenols, vitamin C, beta-carotene, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid. These are associated with a reduced risk for chronic diseases, such as stomach, lung or colon cancer; diabetes; hypertension; and age-related eye disorders. Balances Hormones + Slows the Effects of Aging. A 2014 study published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology tested the effects of moringa (sometimes also called \"drumstick\") along with amaranth leaves (Amaranthus tricolor) on levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in menopausal adult women. Knowing that levels of valuable antioxidant enzymes get affected during the postmenopausal period due to deficiency of \"youthful\" hormones, including estrogen, researchers wanted to investigate if these superfoods could help slow the effects of aging using natural herbal antioxidants that balance hormones naturally. Ninety postmenopausal women between the ages of 45-60 years were selected and divided into three groups given various levels of the supplements. Levels of antioxidant status, including serum were analyzed before and after supplementation, along with fasting blood glucose and haemoglobin levels. Results showed that supplementing with moringa and amaranth caused significant increases in antioxidant status along with significant decreases in markers of oxidative stress. Better fasting blood glucose control and positive increases in hemoglobin were also found, which led the researchers to conclude that these plants have therapeutic potential for helping to prevent complications due to aging and natural hormonal changes. Moringa [benefits the libido](http://thechalkboardmag.com/?s=libido) as well and might work like a natural birth control compound, according to some studies. Although it's been used as a natural aphrodisiac to increase sex drive and performance for thousands of years, it seems to help reduce rates of conception. That being said, it can boost the immune system during pregnancy and also increase breast milk production/lactation, according to some studies. Helps Improve Digestive Health. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, moringa has been used in ancient systems of medicine such as [Ayurveda](http://thechalkboardmag.com/?s=ayurveda) to prevent or treat stomach ulcers, liver disease, kidney damage, fungal or yeast infections ( [such as candida](http://thechalkboardmag.com/how-to-clear-candida-yeast-overgrowth)), digestive complaints, and infections. A common use of moringa oil is helping to boost liver function and therefore detoxifying the body of harmful substances, such as [ heavy metal toxins](http://thechalkboardmag.com/heavy-metal-detox-dr-axe). It might also be capable of helping to fight kidney stones, urinary tract infections, constipation, fluid retention/edema and diarrhea. Balances Blood Sugar Levels. Moringa contains a type of acid called chlorogenic acid, which has been shown to help control blood sugar levels and allow cells to take up or release glucose (sugar) as needed. This gives moringa natural antidiabetic and hormone-balancing properties. Aside from chloregnic acid, compounds called isothiocyanates that are present in moringa have also been tied to natural protection against diabetes. A study that appeared in the International Journal of Food Science Technology found that moringa had positive effects on blood glucose control and insulin levels in patients with diabetes when eaten as part of a high-carbohydrate meal. The effects of three different plants (moringa, curry and bittergourd) were tested in response to eating meals containing various levels of glucose. The results showed that plasma insulin responses were significantly lower when the three plants were included in the meal compared to when they weren't, with all three plants having similar effects. Separate studies conducted by the Biotechnology Institute at Sadat City University in Egypt have found that antidiabetic activities of low doses of moringa seed powder (50-100 milligrams per kilogram body weight) help increase antioxidant status and enzyme production within the liver, pancreas and kidneys of rats and prevent damage compared to control groups. High levels of immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG), fasting blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) \u2014 three markers seen in diabetics \u2014 were also found to decrease as a result of moringa given to rats with diabetes. Results from the study showed that overall, compared to rats not given the herbal treatment, those receiving moringa experienced a return to both kidney and pancreatic health as well as reduced complications of diabetes. Protects + Nourishes the Skin. Moringa contains natural antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral compounds that protect the skin from various forms of infections. Some of the common ways moringa is used on the skin include: reducing athlete's foot, eliminating odors, reducing inflammation associated with acne breakouts, treating pockets of infection or abscesses, getting rid of dandruff, fighting gum disease (gingivitis), and helping heal bites, burns, viral warts and wounds. Moringa oil is applied directly to the skin as a drying, astringent agent used to kill bacteria, but at the same time when used regularly, it's known to act as a lubricant and hydrate the skin by restoring its natural moisture barrier. It's a common ingredient used in food manufacturing and perfumes because it prevents spoilage by killing bacteria, plus it has a pleasant smell and reduces odors. Helps Stabilize Mood + Boost Brain Health. As a high protein food and a rich source of the [amino acid](http://thechalkboardmag.com/amino-acid-for-food-cravings-cure) tryptophan, moringa benefits neurotransmitter functions, the \"feel good\" hormone serotonin. Moringa is also rich in antioxidants and compounds that improve thyroid health, which makes it beneficial for maintaining high energy levels plus fighting fatigue, depression, low libido, moods swings and [ insomnia](http://thechalkboardmag.com/natural-solutions-for-insomnia). Nutritional Benefits of Moringa Moringa is a unique plant because almost all parts of it \u2014 leaves, seeds, flowers/pods, stem and roots \u2014 can be used as a source for nutrition and its other medicinal properties that fight free radical damage. The most popular medicinal use of moringa, both traditionally and today, involves drying and grinding down the tree's antioxidant-packed leaves to unlock the most moringa benefits. Moringa leaves are loaded with numerous nutrients, including antioxidants, protein, calcium, beta-carotene, vitamin C and potassium. Because it provides a concentrated source of vitamin A, moringa is given to thousands of children in third-world countries every year suffering from life-threatening vitamin A deficiency, which is linked to impaired immune function. With an exceptionally high nutritional value, moringa can be used to obtain important trace minerals, protein and phenolics. The plant contains a rare and unique combination of phytonutrients, including: proven anti-inflammatories with strong medicinal values. Numerous studies have shown that these compounds are protective of the heart, natural circulatory stimulants, and possess antitumor, anti-epileptic, anti-ulcer, antispasmodic, antihypertensive and antidiabetic effects. To take advantage of this, moringa leaves are used to brew tea by steeping the dried, preserved leaves in hot water, which releases their special chemical compounds \u2014 very similarly to how green tea is made. Dried moringa leaves are also ground to create a long-lasting powder, or potent extracts are taken from the leaves to be used in the formation of concentrated moringa capsule supplements. Aside from the valuable leaves, the pods of the moringa tree also contain seeds that hold a healing type of oil. Oil from moringa seeds can be used to cook with or put directly onto the surface of the body. Several popular uses of moringa oil are to help retain skin's moisture, speed up wound healing, and soothe dry or burnt skin. Another interesting use of the seeds is for water purification. Combining moringa seeds with water helps impurities cling to the seeds so they can be removed, leaving behind better quality water that's lower in toxins. Salt also seems to bind to moringa, which is beneficial for producing fresh-tasting water. Some studies have shown that 0.2 grams of ground moringa seed can turn one liter of contaminated water into safe drinking water due to the coagulating actions of certain ingredients in the seeds that absorb bacteria, adding water purification to the list of moringa benefits. How to Use Moringa As you can probably tell by now, moringa can be used in many different ways in order to utilize all the available moringa benefits. Because of the long transport time needed to ship moringa from parts of Africa or Asia where it's grown, in the U.S. it's usually sold in powder or capsule form, which prolongs its shelf life. An interesting characteristic of moringa? It's said to taste like a mix between horseradish and asparagus. (14) It might not have the most appealing flavor, but it's a supplement with one of the the richest supplies of vital nutrients in the world, which makes the off-putting taste worth it. There's no recommended or required dosage of moringa at this time since it's only an herbal supplement and not an essential nutrient. That being said, there's some evidence that the optimum dose for humans has been calculated to be 29 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. It's recommended that you start by taking half a teaspoon of dried moringa orally per day for three to five days, increasing your intake slowly over two weeks as you get accumulated to its effects. Most people choose to take moringa every several days but not every single day for long duration of time, since it can can cause laxative effects and an upset stomach when overused. How to get the best moringa benefits possible: Dried moringa leaves or moringa powder: It takes roughly seven pounds of moringa leaves to make one pound of dried moringa powder. The leaves are considered the most potent parts of the plant, containing the most antioxidants and available macronutrients. In regard to the concentration of phenolic compounds, amino acids and volatile oils, the stem and root portions of the plant appear to have the least bioactive nutrients compared to the leaves. Look for moringa dried leaves in capsule, powder or tea form, and take them with a meal, rather than on an empty stomach. [CHECK OUT](https://animamundiherbals.com/?rfsn=1908470.98dd8) Moringa tea: This type of moringa is made from dried leaves steeped in hot water, just like many other beneficial herbal teas. The most nutrient-dense types are organic and dried slowly under low temperatures, which helps preserve delicate compounds. Avoid boiling the leaves to help retain the nutrients best, and don't cook with moringa if possible. [CHECK OUT](https://amzn.to/2mZvHih) Moringa seeds: Moringa pods and flowers appear to have a high phenolic content along with proteins and fatty acids. These are the parts of the plant used to purify water and add protein to low-nutrient diets. Look for them added to creams, capsules and powders. The immature green pods of the plant are often called \"drumsticks\" and are prepared similarly to green beans. The seeds inside the pods are removed and roasted or dried just like nuts to preserve their freshness. [CHECK OUT](https://amzn.to/2mWPIWL) Moringa oil: The oil from moringa seeds is sometimes called Ben oil. Look for it in natural creams or lotions. Keep the oil in a cool, dark place away from high temperatures or the sun. [CHECK OUT](https://amzn.to/2m71NZ4) Potential Side Effects To Be Aware Of Because it's completely natural and free from chemical additives (when you buy a pure, high-quality brand), moringa taken by mouth or used on the skin seems to be very well-tolerated and unlikely to cause side effects. Leaves, fruit, oil and seeds from the moringa tree have been consumed safely for thousands of years, but today there are various forms of moringa supplements or extracts sold, so it's important to buy the purest kind you can find. It's possible for moringa to be combined with synthetic ingredients, fillers and toxins in certain supplements, so read ingredient labels carefully. Follow dosage directions carefully, taking up to six grams daily for up to three weeks at a time (which has been shown to be safe according to studies). During pregnancy or when breast-feeding, it's best to avoid moringa extract, root or high doses of supplements since not enough research has been done to show it's definitely safe. It's possible that chemicals within the plant's root, bark and flowers can lead to contractions of the uterus, which can cause complications during pregnancy. Use moringa under the care of a health care professional or functional doctor if pregnant or breast-feeding to air on the safe side.
