Liver and kidney drainage is central to any successful healing protocol, as it relieves stressful congestion to these vital organs. This in turn assists in the clarification of the extracellular matrix (ECM), without which, deep and thorough restoration will not be realized. There are three different sources all of organic intoxication that can have a negative effect on the functioning of the specific organs that regulate elimination from various parts of the body: 1. Exogenous toxins are those of the chemical and psychological nature that directly affect the tissues of the body. These include alcohol, drugs, tobacco, environmental pollution and emotional trauma (anxiety or shock). 2. Endogenous toxins are those that come from within the body. These can come from viruses, fungi, yeasts and diseases that affect the normal function of the body. 3. Autogenous toxins are those that are created by the body itself and can be related to genetic predisposition and/or the constitutional or personality traits of the individual. The body drains toxins through various excretory organs and tissues, which include the liver, kidneys, skin and mucous membranes. Once these systems are draining and tonified, the case opens to reveal what was at one time a \"Cloaked Disturbance\" or a \"rigid signal\". The liver, like the kidneys, are key to this process.
