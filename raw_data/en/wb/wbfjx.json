Over the years, people have become more aware of what goes inside their bodies and their skin-care products. Gone are the days when people would blindly apply items on their skin without turning the label to scrutinize its contents. Keeping the consequences in mind, consumers are making more informed decisions with what they use and consume. Looking presentable while stepping out of the house is an unsaid rule that any societal being cannot escape. Unless one is a hippie, they ensure to use some of the other skin-care product on daily basis to look more confident and youthful. However, using chemical-ridden products regularly could be harmful to one's health and skin. No amount of false promises, marketing gimmicks and material benefits can now keep a conscious customer associated with a brand against his/her will. Looking at the rising demand for natural skin-care products, hundreds of chemical-free skin-care companies have emerged. While the non-serious ones were bound to shut shop, many were well-received by the customers. Earlier in the days, Ayur and Himalaya Herbal products were a part of every other Indian household, then came the phase of fancy brands with attractive commercials. As they say, nothing stays forever. The limelight caught by the products made of harmful elements is fading as Indian consumers are maturing. They now understand the relevance of non-toxic beauty.
