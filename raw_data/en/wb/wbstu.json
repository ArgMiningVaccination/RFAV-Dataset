The appli- cant may appeal directly to the Federal Circuit, 35 U.S.C. 141, which \"shall review the decision from which an appeal is taken on the record before the [USPTO] ,\" 35 U.S.C. 144. Alternatively, the applicant may bring a civil action against the Director of the USPTO in dis- trict court, where the applicant may present additional evidence. 35 U.S.C. 145. If the applicant elects to bring such an action, \"[a]ll the exp enses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant.\" Ibid. The question pre- sented is as follows: Whether the phrase \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceed- ings\" in 35 U.S.C. 145 e ncompass es the personnel ex- penses the USPTO incurs when its employees, incl uding attorneys, defend the a gency in Section 145 litigation .

NANTKWEST , INC. ON PETITION FOR A WR IT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRC UIT PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI The Solicitor General, on behalf of the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office , re- spectfully petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in this case. OPINIONS BELOW The opinion of the en banc cou rt of appeals (App., infra , 1a-55a) is reported at 898 F.3d 1177. The opinion of the court of appeals pane l (App. , infra , 56a-87a) is re- ported at 860 F.3d of the district court (App., infra , 88a-100a ) is reported at 162 F. Supp. 3d 540. JURISDICTION The judgment of the court of appeals was entered on July 27, 2018. On October 5, 2018, the Chief Justice ex- tended the time within which to file a petition for a writ 2 of certiorari to and including November 23, 2018. On November 14, 2018 , the Chief Justice further extended the time to and including December 21, 2018. The juris- diction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). STATUTORY PROVISION S INVOLVED Section 145 of the Patent Act provides: An applicant dissatisfied with the d ecision of the Pa- tent Trial and Appeal Board in an appeal under sec- tion 134(a) may, unless appeal has been taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Cir- cuit, have remedy by civil action against the Director in the United States District C ourt for the Eastern District of Virginia if commenced within such time after such decision, not less than sixty days, as the Director appoints. The court may adjudge that such applicant is entitled to receive a patent for his inven- tion, as specified in a ny of his claims involved in the decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, as the facts in the case may appear and such adjudication shall authorize the Director to issue such patent on compliance with the requirements of law. All the ex- penses of the proceedings shall be paid by the appli- cant. 35 U.S.C. 145. Other pertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the appendix to this petition. App., infra , 159a -166a . STATEMENT 1. a. The United Patent and Trademark Of- fice ( USPTO) is \"responsible for the granting and issu- ing of patents.\" 35 U.S.C. 2(a)(1). When an applicant seeks a patent, the USPTO assigns an examiner to study the application and determine whether a patent 3 should issue. 35 U.S.C. 131; 37 C.F.R. 1.104. An a ppli- cant who is dissatisfied with the examiner's decision may appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (Board) , a unit within the USPTO . See 35 U.S.C. 6(b)(1), 134. In turn, a n applicant who is dissatisfied with the Board's decision may seek judicial review through either of two avenues : a direct appeal to the Federal Circuit or a civil action in district court . 35 U.S.C. 141, 145. In a direct appeal under 35 U.S.C. 141, the Federal Circuit \"revi ew[s] the [Board's] decision * * * on the record before the\" USPTO . 35 U.S.C. 144 . The court of appeals must apply the deferential standards of re- view prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq. , and may set aside the USPTO's findings of fact only if they are \"unsupported by Zurko , 527 U.S. 150, 152 (1999). Alternatively, an unsuccessful applicant may \"have remedy by civil action against the Director\" of the USPTO in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, 35 U.S.C. 145, with a sub- sequent appeal to the Federal Circuit, 28 U.S.C. 1295(a)(4)(C). In a Section 145 action , unlike in a direct appeal, the applicant may conduct discovery and may introduce evidence that the USPTO had no opportunity to consider. See Kappos v. Hyatt , 566 U.S. 431, 444 (2012). If the applicant introduces new evidence, \"the district court must make de novo factual findings that take account of both the new eviden ce and the adminis- trative record before the PTO.\" Id. at 446. Section 145 states that \"[a]ll the expenses of the pro- ceedings shall be paid by the applicant.\" 35 U.S.C. 145. That requirement applies \"regardless of the outcome \" of the suit. Hyatt v. Kappos , 625 F.3d 1320, 1337 (Fed. 4 Cir. 2010) (en banc), aff 'd, 56 6 U.S. 431 (2012). No anal- ogous expense -recoupment provision applies when an unsuccessful applicant instead opts for a direct appeal to the Federal Circuit . b. Section 145 is the current em bodiment of a statu- tory provision that has authorized judicial review of the decisions of the USPTO (or its predecessor, the Patent Office) since 1836, when Congress first created an agency responsible for the examination of patents. See Act of July 4, 1836 (1836 Act), ch. 357, \u00a7 16, 5 Stat. 123; see generally Hoover Co. v. Coe, 325 U.S. 79, 84 -87 (1945). To finance the agency 's operations , Congress created a \"patent fund,\" into which applicants were re- quired to pay fees for examinations . 1836 Act \u00a7 9, 5 Stat. 121. The fund was used \"for the payment of the salaries of the officers and clerks herein provided for, and all other expenses of the Patent Office.\" Ibid. An applicant who was dissatisfied with the agency's decision could seek review before a board of examiners , \u00a7 7, 5 Stat. 119-120, and in some circumstances could obtain judicial review by filing a \"bill in equity ,\" \u00a7 16 , 5 Stat. 124 . In 1839, Congress extended the bill-in-equity provision \"to all cases where patents are refused for any reason what- ever .\" Act of Mar. 3, 1839 ( 1839 Act), ch. 88, \u00a7 10, 5 Stat. 354. Congress also direct ed that, in any case where a disappointed applicant invoked the bill-in-equity mech- anism, \"the who le of the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the applicant, whether the final decision shall be in his favor or otherwise.\" Ibid. Congress has since amended various aspects of the Patent A ct's scheme for judicial review. See Hoover Co., 325 U.S. at 85 -87. Throughout that period, how- ever, the statutory scheme has both (a) afford ed disap- pointed patent applicants the option of initiating a type 5 of court proceeding in which the applicant could intro- duce new evidence , and (b) require d any applicant who chose that route to pay all the expenses of that proceed- ing. See Act of July 8, 1870, ch. 230, \u00a7 52, 16 Stat. 205; Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4915 (2d ed. 1878); Act of Mar. 2, 1927, ch. 273, \u00a7 11, 44 Stat. 1336 -1337 ; 35 U.S.C. 63 (1946). In the Pa- tent Act of 1952 , ch. 950, 66 Stat. 792, Congress replaced the term \"bill in equity\" with \"civil action ,\" while man- dating that \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant ,\" \u00a7 145, 66 Stat. 803. In the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq. , Congress has e nacted a materially identical provision for unsuc- cessful applicants for a trademark registration . Before 1962, the Lanham Act simply incorporated by cross - reference the procedures of Section 145. See 15 U.S.C. 1071 (1958) (authorizing proceedings \"under sections 145 and 146 of Title 35 * * * under the same conditions, rules, and procedures as are prescribed in the case of patent appeals\"); see also Act of Oct. 9, 1962, Pub. L . No. 87 -772, \u00a7 12, 76 Stat. 771 -772 (amending this provi- sion). In its current form, t he Lanham Act states that a disappointed applicant for a trademark registration may \"have remedy by a civil action\" in district court in lieu of a direc t appeal to the Federal Circuit. 15 U.S.C. 1071(b)(1). The statute further directs that, \"[i]n any case where there is no adverse party, a copy of the com- plaint shall be served on the Director, and, unless the court finds the expenses to be unreasonable, all the ex- penses of the proceeding shall be paid by the party bringing the case, whether the final deci sion is in favor of such party or not .\" 15 U.S.C. 1071(b)(3) . c. The USPTO has invoked the expense provision s of Section 145 and its predecessors, as well as the coun-6 terpart provision s in the Lanham Act , to recover a vari- ety of expenses that the agency has incur red when disappointed applicant s have elect ed to proceed in dis- trict court rather than taking a direct appeal. E.g., Sandvik Aktiebolag v. Samuel s, No. 89 -cv-3127, 1991 WL 25774, at *1 -*2 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 1991) ( expert wit- ness fees ); Cook v. Wats on, 208 F.2d 529, 530 -531 (D.C. Cir. 1953) (per curiam) (printing expenses); Robertson v. Cooper , 46 F.2d 766, 769 (4th Cir. 1931) (travel ex- penses for agency attorneys ). The USPTO has always exercised discretion , however, in determining whether to seek the full extent of expenses permitted by the stat- ute. See, e.g., Edwin M. Thomas, Recent Suits Against the Commissioner Under R. S. 4915 , 22 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y 616, 618 (1940 ) (noting that the USPTO \"seldom exercise [s]\" its statutory right to require an applicant to pay the expenses of an appeal by the agency if the applicant prevails in district court ). In 2013 , the USPTO began seeking to recover the personnel -related expenses (including money paid to paralegal s and attorne ys) that the agency incur s in pro- ceedings under 35 U.S.C. 145 and 15 U.S.C. 1071(b) . That change in agency practice responded to two devel- opments. First, in the Leahy -Smith America Invents Act, Congress directed the agency to set its fees so as \"to recover the aggregate estimated costs to the [ USPTO] for processing, activities, services , and m aterials relating to patents * * * and trademarks .\" Pub. L. No. 112 -29, \u00a7 10(a)(2) , 125 Stat. 316 ; see SUCCESS A ct, Pub. L. No. 115-273, \u00a7 4, __ Stat. __ (extending USPTO's fee -setting to 2026) .1 Accordingly, t he USPTO has estab- 1 The SUCCESS Act has been preliminarily designated for publi- cation at 132 Stat. 4158. 7 lished fee schedules that are designed to recover the ag- gregate costs of its operations, including the costs the agency in curs in examining patent and trademark ap- plications. See , e.g., 37 C.F.R. 1.17, 2.6. Second, pro- ceedings under Section s 145 and 1071(b) have grown in- creasingly expensive , and the single largest expense to the USPTO is often the time that agency employees must devote to those matters \u2014as was true in this case . See App., infra , 100a . 2. The present dispute arises from a Section 145 proceeding brought by respondent's predecessor -in- interest as assignee of a patent application drawn to a method of treating c ancer cells , which the Board re- jected as obvious had \"relied solely on the testimony\" of the putative inventor. Id. at 140a . In the Section 145 proceeding, however, respondent relied on a new expert witness, and the USPTO retained an ex- pert to respond; both experts produced extensive re- ports and participated in lengthy depositions with USPTO attorneys . See id. at 140a -142a . In addition, the district court held a hearing on several motions filed by the parties . See, e.g., D. Ct. Doc s. 33, 35 -36, 38, 40 (May 11, 2015) , 50-53 (May 26, 2015 ), 54 -55 (June 2, 2015 ), 73 (July 15, 2015) . The district court granted summary judgment t o the USPTO on the issue of patentability , App., infra , 146a , and t he of appeals affirm ed in an unpublished de- cision, id. at 101a -128a . 3. After the USPTO prevailed at summary ju dgment, the agency moved for reimbursement of $111,696.39 in expenses under Section 145 , comprising $78,592 .50 in personnel costs for the time two USPTO attorneys and 8 a paralegal had spent on the proceeding and $33,10 3.89 in expert -witness expenses . D. Ct. Doc. 79, at 8, 12 (Sept. 16, 2015). The USPTO calculated its perso nnel expenses as a pro rata share of the relevant employees' salaries. See id. at 11 -12. Two experienced USPTO at- torneys had spent nearly 1 000 hours defending the agency in the district -court proceeding . Ibid. The USPTO declined to reque st other expenses, such as the agency's travel expenses , that it had incurred as a result of the litigation . See id. at 7. The district court grant ed the USPTO's request for reimbursement of expert -witness fees but denied the request for reimbursement of personnel expenses . App., infra , 88a-100a . In distinguishing between the two types of expenses, the court stated that the phrase \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" in Section 145 is not sufficiently \" 'specific and explicit' \" to en compass the USPTO's attorney and paralegal personnel ex- penses , given the presumption under the \"American Rule * * * that each litigant pays his own attorneys' fees.\" Id. at 90a-92a (quoting Baker Botts LLC , 135 S. Ct. 2158, 2164 (2015)). 4. A divided panel of the court of appeals reversed . App., infra , 56a-87a. The panel majority assumed with- out deciding that the American Rule is relevant to in- terpreting 35 U.S.C. 145, under which the applicant' s obligation to pay the expenses o f the proceeding s does not turn on which party prevails . App., infra , 60a-61a. Even accepting that premise, however, the panel major- ity concluded that Section 145 \"authorizes an award of fees\" because \" 'expenses' here includes attorneys' fees.\" Id. at 61a. The panel majority based that conclu- sion on evidence of ordinary usage in 1839, when Con- gress first required plaintiffs in suits like this one to pay 9 the attendant expenses , id. at 62a; the history and pur- pose of the statute, id. at 62a-63a; and thi s Court's prec- edent , including the Court's observation that the \" non- taxable expenses\" borne by litigants , as distinct from taxable costs, include \"expenses * * * for attorneys ,\" id. at 63a-64a (quoting Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd. , 566 U.S. 560, 57 3 (2012)) (emphasis omitted).2 Judge Stoll dissented . App., infra , 72a-87a. She would have held that the American Rule applied and that Section 145 does not overcome the presumption against fee -shifting. Id. at 72a-73a. 5. Acting sua sponte , the en banc court of appeals vacated the panel opinion and reheard the case. App., infra , 156a -158a . After rehearing, the court affirmed the district court's denial of the USPTO's motion for personnel expenses, holding in a 7 -4 decision that the term \" expenses\" in Section 145 does not encompass the USPTO's \"attorneys' fees.\" Id. at 1a-55a. a. The en banc majority first held that \"the Ameri- can Rule applies to \u00a7 145,\" even though the agency's en- titlement to reimbursement of its expenses for a partic- ular suit does not turn on whether it is a prevailing party . App., infra , 11a-16a. The majority recognized 2 Respondent also argue d that the USPTO personnel expenses at issue here are not expenses \"of the proceedings\" because the agency would have been require d to pay its employees' salaries even if this suit had no t been brough t. Resp. C.A. Br. 35. The panel majority rejected that argument, observing that the USPTO had \"dedicated time and resources of its attorneys to the defense of this litigation when it could have otherwise applied those resources to other mat- ters.\" App., infra , , 236 F.3d 363, 365 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"[S]alaried government lawyers, like in -house and non -profit counsel, do incur expenses if the time and resources they devote to one case are not available for other work.\"). 10 that the Fourth Circuit had rejected an anal ogous premise in Shammas v. Focarino , (2015), cert. 1376 (2016), which had \"inter- preted [the] nearly of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b)(3),\" to authorize the USPTO recover infra , 9a, 12a-13a; see Shammas (concluding that Section 1071(b) \"requires a dissatisfied ex parte trademark ap- plicant who chooses to file an action in a district court challenging the final decision of the PTO, to pay, as 'all the expenses of the proceeding,' the salaries of the PTO's attorneys and paralegals at tributed to the de- fense of the action\"). the view, Section 145 \"lacks the 'spe- cific and explicit' congressional authorization required to displace the American Rule.\" App., infra , 16a. The majority acknowl edged that the word \"expenses\" can \"refer to * * * attorney's fees ,\" id. at 28a, and that dic- tionaries contemporaneous to the 1839 enactm of Section 145's first statutory antecedent broadly defined \"expense \" to include \"the disbursing of money ,\" id. at 17a (citation omitted). The majority dismissed that ev- idence as \"vague,\" however, and looked instead to \"Con- gress's usage of the terms 'expenses' and 'attorneys' fees' in other statutes.\" Id. at 18a. It noted that some statutes authorize the award of both \" 'expenses '\" and \"'attorneys' fees, '\" whereas others \"define expenses to include attorneys' fees, but they do so explicitly.\" Id. at 18a-20a. The majority concluded that the term \"ex- penses\" in this statute is at best \"ambiguous \" with re- spect to attorney's fees , and that Se ction 145 therefore is not specific enough to overcome the American Rule 's presumption against fee -shifting , particularly when com-11 pared to other Patent Act provisions th at expressly au- thorize shifting of attorney's fees. Id. at 22a-23a. The ma- jority also stated that, because the USPTO's \"interpreta- tion * * * would have a patent applicant pay the govern- ment's attorneys' fees even whe n the patent applicant suc- ceeds ,\" that position would mark \"a particularly unusual divergence from the American Rule.\" Id. at 26a. b. Chief Judge Prost dissented, joined by three other member s of the court . App., infra , 36a-55a. Stat- ing that the majority opinion \"creates an unfortunate and unnecessary conflict between the circuits,\" the dis- sent ers would have h eld that Section 145 require s \"the applicant to pay all the expenses of the proceedings, in- cluding the PTO's personnel expenses.\" Id. at 36a. The dissent ing judges explained that, both in mod- ern usage and when Section 145's first statutory ante- cedent was enacted, the \"ordinary meaning of 'expenses' infra , 40a (citing dictionaries) . In particular, the dissent ers explained that the 18 36 Act had referred to agency sal- aries as \" expenses of the Patent Office ,\" id. at 39a (quot- ing 1836 Act \u00a7 9 , 5 Stat. 121 ), and that Congress had used the same term (\"expenses\") three years later when it amended the 1836 Act to require applicants who file a bill in equity to pay the \"whole of the expenses of the proceeding ,\" 1839 Act \u00a7 10 , 5 Stat. 354 ; see App., infra , 39a; p. 4, supra . The dissent ing judges further con- clud ed that Congress 's use of the modifier \"all\" in Sec- tion 145 evidenced an intent \"to broadly and compre- hensively capture anything fairly regarded as an 'ex- pense.' \" App., infra , 45a. Finally, the dissent ing judges observed that reading \"expenses\" to include the USPTO's personnel expenses 12 is consistent with the statute 's purpose , which is \"to en- sure that\" the expenses of Section 145 proceedings \"fall on the applican ts who elect the more expensive district court proceedings over the standard appeal route .\" App., infra , 49a. The dissenters explained that the ma- jority's interpretation, by contrast, would ensure that \"other PTO applicants * * * pay the PTO's personne l ex- penses incurred in\" Section 145 proceeding s. Id. at 54a. REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION The en banc court of appeals held that the phrase \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceeding s\" in 35 U.S.C. 145 does not encompass the expenses that the USPTO in- curs when its employees, including attorneys, defend the a gency in Section 145 litigation . That holding con- travenes the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" and is in- consistent with Section 145's history and purpose. Section 145 gives disappointed patent applicants a unusual opportunity to challenge an agency decision based on additional evidence that the agency had no op- portunity to consider. Section 145 ameliorates the po- tential burdens on the agency that attend that ap- proach, howeve r, by protecting the USPTO from the fi- nancial impact of discovery , motion practice, and trial. If left uncorrected, the decision below ensur es that ap- plicants will be liable only for some of those expenses. As the en banc majority recognized , moreover, the de- cision below is inconsistent with the Fourth Circuit's in- terpretation of materially identical language in the Lan- ham Act. App., infra , 12a denied, 136 S. Ct. 1376 (2016)) . The petition for a w rit o f certiorari should be granted. 13 A. The Federal Circuit's Decision Is Wrong The text, structure, purpose, and history of Section 145 all confirm that the phrase \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings \" encompass es money paid to USPTO per- sonnel who work on Section 145 litigation . 35 U.S.C. 145. The court of appeals believed that its contrary reading was compelled by the American Rule \u2014i.e., the \"rule that each side must pay its own attorney's fees, \" \"absent explicit statutory authority\" for a fee award. Baker Botts L .L.P. v. LLC 2163 (2015) ( citation, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted). But Section 145 is not the sort of fee - shifting provision that implicates the American Rule , and the clear language of the statute w ould \"trump[] the American Rule,\" id. at 2164, even if that Rule applied . 1. The Patent Act provides that, when a disap- pointed patent applicant elects to pursue a civil action under 35 U. S.C. 145, \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceed- ings shall be paid by the applicant .\" The ordinary meaning of the phrase \" [a]ll the expenses of the pro- ceedings\" is all the expenditures \"of money, time, labor, or resources\" through which a participant in the pro- ceeding seeks to attain its desired result. See Black's Law Dictio nary 698 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"ex- penses\" as \"[a]n expenditure of money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a result\"); Webster's New World College Dictionary 511 (5th ed. 2014) (defining \"expenses\" as \" charges or costs met with in * * * doing one's work\" ). The same was true in 1839 when Section 145's first statutory antecedent was enacted (p. 4, supra ). See 1 Noah Webster, An American Dictionary of the Eng- lish Language (1828) (defining \"expense\" as a \"laying 14 out or expending; the disbursing o f money, or the em- ployment and consumption, as of time and dictionaries). Indeed, the 1836 Act, which first established an agency to examine paten t applications, referred to employee \"salaries\" as \"expenses of the Patent Office .\" \u00a7 9, 5 Stat. 121. There is no reason to think that Congress intended a narrower meaning three years later, when it amended an adjacent provision to require disappointed p atent ap- plicants who file a bill in equity to pay the \"whole of the expense s of the proceeding .\" 1839 Act \u00a7 10 , 5 Stat. 354 . In the specific context of civil litigation, where Sec- tion 145 applies, the term \"expenses\" suggests broader coverage than the word \"costs,\" which the Court has construed as a more limited term of art. \"Taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by liti- gants for attorneys , experts v. . Saipan, Ltd. , 566 U.S. 560, 573 (2012 ); see Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy , 548 U.S. 291, 297 (2006) (contrasting \"costs\" and \"expenses\" and suggesting that the latter term is \"op en-ended\"); United States v. 110-118 River- side Tenants Corp F.2d 514, 520 (2d Cir. 1989) (in- cluding attorney's fees \" expenses of the foreclos ure proceeding\") , cert. denied, 495 U.S. 956 (1990) ; 10 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and P rocedure \u00a7 2666 ( 2014 ) (explaining that \"'[e]xpenses,' of course, include all the expenditures actually made by a litigant in connection with the action,\" inc luding money paid to attorneys). The modifier \" all\" in Section 145 refutes any inference that Congress intended Section 145 plain- tiffs to be liable for only a subset \"ex- penses.\" See App., infra , 45a (Prost, C.J., dissenting) 15 (explaining that Congress used the term \"all\" in Section 145 \"to broadly and comprehensively capture anythin g fairly regarded as an 'expense' \"); Shammas , 784 F.3d at 225 term \"all\" in Section 1071(b) \"clearly indicat[es] that the common meaning of the term 'expenses' should not be limited\"); cf., e.g., Norfolk & W. Ry. Co. v. American Train Dispatchers , Ass'n , 499 U.S. 117, 129 (1991) ( broadly construing the phrase \"all other law\" to include obligations imposed by contract) . 2. The Federal Circuit's crabbed interpretation of the term \"expenses\" in 35 U.S.C. 145 is also inconsistent with the s tructure , purpose, and history of the statute . a. The Patent Act provides two alternative avenues for obtaining judicial review of the USPTO's rejection of a patent application. Under Section 141 , an applicant who is \"dissatisfied with the final decision\" of the agency may pursue a direct appeal to the Federal Cir- cuit. 35 U.S.C. 141(a). Alter natively, Section 145 per- mits a disappointed applicant to \"have remedy by civil action against the Director\" of the USPTO in district court. 35 U.S.C. 145. An applicant who elects to bring a Section 145 action is not limited to the administrative record, but instead may conduct discovery and present additional evidence that the agency had no prior opportunity to consider, and the district court must make de n ovo findings con- cerning that new evidence. See Kappos v. Hyatt , 566 U.S. 431, 444 -445 (2012). The \"opportunity to present new evidence\" in a Section 145 proceeding can be \"signifi- cant\" for the applicant, \"not the least because the PTO generally does not accept oral testimony.\" Id. at 435. But such litigation can also subject the USPTO to sig- nificant financial burdens that the agency does not incur 16 in a direct appeal \u2014e.g., the costs of conducting and re- sponding to discovery, retaining and deposing expert witnesses, engaging in sometimes extensive motion practice , and trying the case . Section 145's requirement that the applicant pay \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings,\" whether or not the applicant p revails , protects the USPTO's resources by shifting th e additional expense of a civil action and possible trial to the applicants who opt for those pro- ceedings . 35 U.S.C. 145. The requirement also discour- ages abusive filings. See Hyatt v. Kappos , 625 F.3d 1320, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (en banc) (\"To deter applicants from exactly the type of procedural gaming that con- cerns the Director, Congress imposed on the applicant the heavy economic burden of paying '[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings' regardless of the outcome.\") (cita- tion omitted; brackets in original) , aff'd, 566 U.S. 431 (2012). More broadly, the requirement ensures that other persons who use the US PTO 's service s\u2014who must pay fees designed to recoup the agency 's opera- tional costs, see p p. 6-7, supra \u2014are not effectively com- pelled to subsi dize Section 145 plaintiff s. The Federal Circuit's interpretation undermines those important purposes. The personnel expenses that the Federal Circuit forbade the USPTO from recover- ing often represent the bulk of the agency's expenses \u2014 as illustrated by th is case, where the most significant expense the USPTO incurr ed came in the form of attor- ney time. See App., infra , 100a (district court order denying the USPTO recovery of more than 70% of the expenses the agency incurred). If that decision is al- lowed to stand, other USPTO users will necessarily be required to underwrite some of the expenses of Section 17 145 proceedings , in contravention of the statutory de- sign . See id. at 54a (Prost, C.J., dissenting). b. The history of Section 145 supports a broad con- struction of the term \"expenses.\" As explain ed above , when Congress first provided some disapp ointed patent applicants with an option for obtaining judicial review via a \"bill in equity ,\" it referred elsewhere in the same statute to employee \"salaries\" as \" expenses, \" to be paid from the fees charged to applicants. 1836 Act \u00a7\u00a7 9, 16 , 5 Stat. 121, 124 ; see p . 4, supra . The 1836 Act created an additional procedure , also financed by applicant fees, for administrativ e appeals to a board of examiners. \u00a7 7, 5 Stat. 119 . That system proved unsatisfactory, in part because the review proceedings began \"to add consid- erably to the 48a (Prost, C.J., dissenting) ( citation and emphasis omit- ted). Congress therefore abolished the board of exam- iners, substituted a direct judicial appeal, and expanded the availability of the bill -in-equity procedure to \"all cases where patents are refused for any reason what- ever.\" 1839 Act \u00a7 10 , 5 Stat. 354 ; see \u00a7 11, 5 Stat. 354 . Cognizant of the p otential strain that additional litiga- tion might cause the agency, however, Congress required each applicant who filed a bill in equity to pay \"the whole of the expenses of the proceeding .\" \u00a7 10, 5 Stat. 354. Congress has thus long made unsuccessful patent applicants liable for the expenses of Section 145 pro- ceedings , just as it has required applicants to pay for the cost of examination . Indeed, during the 19th cen- tury, this Court described proceedings under Section 145's prec ursor as \"a part of the application for the pa- tent,\" rather than \"a technical appeal .\" Gandy v. Mar- ble, 122 U.S. 432, 439 (1887). The court proceeding was understood to be in practical effect a continuation of the 18 examination pro ceeding, in which the applicant could receive an adjudication of his entitlement to a patent based on new evidence. Construing the term \"expenses\" to encompass personnel expenses accords with that his- torical understanding and gives Section 145's expense - reimbursement requirement the same function as appli- cation fees \u2014namely, defraying the USPTO's expendi- tures, including personnel expenses , and allocating those expenditures to the particular users who cause the USPTO to incur them . To be sure, the USPTO has only r ecently sought to recover the personnel expenses that it incurs in Section 145 litigation . See p p. 6-7, supra . But the plain lan- guage of the statute has long authorized the agency to recoup those expenses , and the agency \"has never af- firmatively disclaim ed authority.\" App., infra , 54a (Prost, C.J., dissenting). \"Given how dramatically the patent and litigation landscapes have changed,\" and how Sectio n 145 proceedings in particular have become more expensive over time , ibid., the agency reasonably determin ed that it should no longer for bear from col- lecting the personnel expenses to which it is has long been entitled under the statute. 3. The en banc majority repeatedly acknowledged that the term \"expenses\" can encompass the cost of pay- ing USPTO attorneys. See App., infra , attorneys' fees\"); id. at 28a (\"some- times used * * * to refer to a variety of burden s in- curred by a litigant, including attorneys' fees\"); id. at 33a (\"can be broad enough to cover salaries of some PTO employees\") (emphasis omitted) . It concluded, however, that the American Rule required Congress to speak with greater specificity to authorize the USPTO 19 to recove r its personnel expenses. Id. at 1a. That is incorrect. a. The USPTO's request for reimbursement of per- sonnel expenses under Section 145 does not implicate the American Rule. That principle holds that \"the pre- vailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a rea- sonable attorneys' fee from the loser.\" Alyeska Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y , 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975); see also, e.g., Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. West Va. Dep't of Health & Human Res. , 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001) (explaining that, under the \" 'American Rule,' we follow 'a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory author- ity'\") (citation omitted). For that reason, statutory de- partures from the American Rule typically speak in terms of \"prevailing\" parties. See Baker Botts, 135 S. Ct. at lthough to [the American Rule] take various forms,' they * * * usually refer to a 'prevailing party' in the context of an adver- sarial 'action.' \") (citation omitted; brackets in original ). Section 145 does not operate in that w ay, and there is no reason to suppose that Congress had the American Rule in mind in enacting it or its predecessors. As the Fourth Circuit explained with respect to the parallel provision in the Lanham Act, \"the imposition of all ex- penses on a plaintiff in an ex parte proceeding, regard- less of whether he wins or loses, does not constitute fee - shifting that implicates the American Rule.\" Shammas , 784 F.3d at 221 (emphasis omitted) . Instead, such a pro- vision is \"an unconditional compensatory charge im- pose d on a dissatisfied applicant who elects to engage\" the USPTO in the more ex pensive and burdensome district -court proceedings. Ibid. The expenses the ap-20 plicant is required to pay are thus best viewed as a coun- terpart to the application fees that are designed to de- fray the USPTO's examination expenses. See Gandy , 122 U.S. at 439 (stating that an action under Section 145's predecessor \"is, in fact and necessarily, a part of the application f or the patent\"); pp. 6-7, supra .3 Before the Federal Circuit's decision in this case, no court of appeals had ever applied the American Rule to a statute that does not merely shift fees to the losing party , but instead requires one party to pay all the ex- pens es of a proceeding regardless of the outcome. Nothing in this Court's precedent suggests that the American Rule applies in those circumstances. To the contrary, when this Court addressed a statutory scheme that requir es the payment of attorney's fees re- gardless of a litigant's success, the Court did not men- tion the American Rule. See Sebelius v. Cloer , 569 U.S. 369 (2013) (considering the fees provision of the Na- tional Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. 300aa -15(e), which requires the govern ment to pay rea- sonable attorney's fees to both successful and unsuc- cessful claim ants, as long as the claim is not frivolous). 3 That conclusion is reinforced by the manner in which the USPTO calculates its personnel expenses. When the government seeks an award of attorney's fees under a fee -shifting statute, the amount of the award is typically calculated base d on the prevailing market rate for private counsel, regardless of the government's ac- tual expenditure for the representation. See, e.g., NLRB v. Local 3, Int'l Bhd. (2d Cir. 2006). The USPTO does not use that metric in calculat ing personnel ex- penses under Section 145. Instead, it seeks reimbursement only for the expenses the agency incurs \u2014namely, an amount that reflects the actual salaries of the relevant employees, prorated according to the amount of time eac h spent on the district -court proceeding. App., infra , 8a. 21 The win -or-lose recoupment feature of Section 145 makes the American Rule inapposite. b. Even if Section 145 were viewed as implicat ing the American Rule, the statute unambiguously dictates a re- sult inconsistent with that background presumption . For the reasons discussed above, the ordinary meaning of \"ex- penses\" incurred in connection with legal \"proceedings\" includes money s pent to pay attorneys. See, e.g., Tanigu- chi, 566 U.S. at 573. Section 145's reference to \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" thus unambiguous ly author- izes a district court to require the applicant to reimburse the USPTO's attorney expenses. 35 U.S.C . 145. The Federal Circuit 's contrary holding was based primarily on the observation that numerous statutes \"authoriz[e] the award of both 'expenses' and attorneys' fees'\" attorney's fee , reasonable expert fees, and other reasonable litigation expenses\"). From that common usage, the cou rt inferred that Congress views expenses and attorney's fees \"as distinct tools in its toolbox ,\" and that the term \" expenses\" standing alone does not encompass attorney salari es \"absent an express expansion * * * to include 'attorneys' fees.' \" App., infra , 21a-22a.4 4 The Federal Circuit also contrasted Section 145 with other Pa- tent Act provisions that expressly authorize award s of attorney's fees. App., infra , 22a-24a; see, e.g., 35 U.S.C. 285, 297(b)(1). Be- cause t he Patent Act did not provide for attorney fee -shifting in in- fringement litigation until 1946, see Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. , 572 U.S. 545, 548 (2014), the provisions on which the Federal Circuit relied are of limited rele vance in inferring 22 That inference is unsound. T his Court has never held that Congress must use the specific term \"attor- ney's fees\" in order to authorize recoupment of money spent on attorney services as part of a larger award of litigation expenses . See Baker Botts , 135 S. Ct. at 2164 (noting a variety of phrases used in statutes that dis- place the American Rule ); Key Tronic Corp. v. United States , 511 U.S. 809, 815 (1994) ( \"The absence of specific reference to attorney's fees is not dispositive if the stat- ute otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees.\"); id. at 823 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part) (\" Con- gress need only be explicit \u2014it need not incant the magic phrase 'attorney's fees.' \"). The terms \"fees\" and \"expenses ,\" moreover, are commonly used t o denote overlapping categories, as reflected in the very statutes cited by the en banc Federal Circuit, see App., infra , 18a-21a. By using the broader term \"expenses\" in Sec- tion 145, Congress signaled its intent to allow th e USPTO to recoup agency expenditures that include but are not limited to money spent on attorneys . See Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2666 (\"Both fees and costs are expenses but by no means constitute all of them.\"). B. The Question Presented Warrants Rev iew 1. The Court should grant the petition to correct the Federal Circuit's flawed interpretation of 35 U.S.C. 145. That court recognized the significance of the issue in acting sua sponte to rehear this case en banc, App., 156a -158a , and it divide d 7-4 on the merits. Because the intent of the 1839 Congress that enacted Section 145's first stat- utory antecedent . In any event, the fact that the Patent Act author- izes fee awards to prevailing part ies in private infringement litiga- tion has little bearing on the m eaning of the term \"expenses\" in the quite different context of Section 145 proceedings b etween an appli- cant and the USPTO. 23 that court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals in Section 145 case s, 28 U.S.C. 1295(a)(4)(C), the rule it announced will govern all future Section 145 proceed- ings absent this Court's intervention. Th is Court regu- larly grants certiorari to review questions of statutory interpretation otherwise committed to the Federal Circuit , particularly questions under the Patent Act . See, e.g., WesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp. , (2018); Techs. Corp. , 137 S. Ct. 734 (2017); Samsung Elecs. Co. v. Apple Inc., 137 S. Ct. 429 (2016); Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States , 1969 (2016); Cloer , 569 U.S. 369 . 2. As the en banc Federal Circuit unanimously rec- ognized, t he decision below conflicts with the Fourth Circuit's decision in Shammas , supra , interpreting par- C.J. relevant Lanham Act provision, 1 5 U.S.C. 1071(b), authorizes a disappoint ed applicant for a trademark registration to file a civil action against the Director of the USPTO in district court. L ike Section 1 45, Section 1071(b) requires an applicant who chooses that mode of review to pay \"all the expenses o f the proceeding * * * whether the final decision is in favor of such party or not.\" 15 U.S.C. 1071(b)(3). In Shammas , the Fourth Circuit held that Section 1071(b) authorizes the USPTO to recover its personnel expenses. 784 F.3d at 227. It based that con- clusion primarily on the language of the statute, noting that, \"in ordinary parlance, 'expenses' is sufficiently broad to include attorneys fees and paralegal fees,\" and that Congress's use of the modifier \"all\" \"clearly in- dicat[es] that the common meaning of the term 'ex- penses' should not be limited.\" Id. at 222. 24 The Fourth Circuit further explained that the stru c- ture and history of Section 10 71(b) confirmed its plain meaning , based on the same considerations that the Federal Circuit discounted here . In particular, the Fourth Circuit stated that, b y attaching the expense - payment provision to the option to initiat e a more \"ful- some and expensive \" district -court proceeding, Con- gress had \"obviously intended to reduce the financial burden on the PTO in defending such a proceeding \" by requiring the applicant to pay all of those expenses. Shammas , 784 F.3d at 225. The court cited legislative history, and the \"original understanding\" of the p rede- cessor provision in the 1839 Act, as additional evidence that Section 1071(b) was \"designed to relieve the PTO of the financial burden that results from an applicant 's election to pursue the more expensive district court lit- igation .\" Id. at 226 -227. Finally, the Fourth Circuit rejected the contention that the American Rule required a contrary result. See Shammas , 784 F.3d at 223 -224. The Fourth Circuit ex- plained that , \"[b]ecause the PTO is entitled to recover its expenses even when it completely fail s, \u00a7 1071(b)(3) need not be interpreted against the backdrop of the American Rule. \" Id. at 223; see id. at 221 (describing the expense provision as \"an unconditional compensa- tory charge\" to applicants, rather than a fee-shifting mechanism based on litigation success ). 3. The court of appeals' holding has s ignificant prac- tical consequence s. The USPTO began seeking to re- coup its personnel expenses because of the increasing financial burden of Section 145 and Section 1071(b) pro- ceedings . As both this case and Shammas illustrate, the USPTO's personnel expense s are often the most signif- icant expense the agency incurs in suits brought under 25 those provisions. S ee App., infra , (98% of requested expenses). The deci sion below will thus pre- vent the USPTO from recovering its largest expense in many Section 145 proceedings. Because the USPTO's schedule of fees is designed to recover the aggregate cost to the agency of its opera- tions , the decision below effectively guarantees that other persons who use the US PTO 's services will indi- rectly bear the cost of Section 145 proceedings . The en banc majority sought to downplay the financial signifi- cance o f that effect by noting that , because the agency receives hundreds of thousands of patent applications each year, even a million dollars in unrecouped person- nel expenses for Section 145 proceeding s would have only a slight effect on any particular patent applicant . App., infra , 34a -35a. But those are expenditures that Congress determined are properly chargeable to the particular applicants, like respondent, who forgo a di- rect appeal and instead cause the USPTO to incur sig- nificant additional expense. Congress determined that those applicant s should be liable for \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings,\" 35 U.S.C. 145, not merely some of them. 26 CONCLUSION The petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted.

Ap- plican ts who invoke \u00a7 145 are required by statute to pay \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" incurred by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") in de- fending the Board 's decision, regardless of the out- come. Historically, the agency relied on this provision to recover sums it spent on travel and printing and, more recently, expert witnesses. Now, 170 years after Congress introduced \u00a7 145 's predecessor, the agency argues that \u00a7 145 also compels applicants to pay its at- torneys ' fees. We hold that it does not, for the American Rule prohibits courts from shifting attorneys ' fees from one party to another absent a \"specific and explicit\" directive from Congress. The phrase \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" falls short of this stringent standard. Accordingly, we affirm the district court 's judgment. I A The Patent Act gives applicants two mutually exclu- sive options for judicial review of an adverse Board de - cision. First, the applicant may appeal directly to this court. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141. Second, the applicant may file a civil action against the Director of the PTO in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. We, in turn, have jurisdic - tion over subsequent appeals from the district court under 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1). 3a Section 141 provides standard judicial review of an agency decision under the Administrative Procedure Act. We review the Board 's legal determinations de novo, Honeywell Int 'l Inc. v. Cir. 2017), and we \"set aside the PTO 's factual findings only if they are 'unsupported by substantial evidence, '\" Kappos v. Hyatt , 566 U.S. 431, 435 (2012) (quoting Dickinson v. Zurko , 527 U.S. 150, 152 (1999)). Im- portantly, appellate review in \u00a7 141 proceedings is con - fined to the record before the PTO. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. Section 145, by contrast, authorizes a more expan- sive challenge to the Board 's decision and is generally more time consuming. For example, patent applicants can conduct disco very and introduce new evidence. And once an applicant submits new evidence on a dis- puted factual question, \"the district court must make a de novo finding.\" Hyatt , 566 U.S. at 434 -35 (\"This op - portunity . . . is significant, not the least because the PTO generally does not accept oral testimony.\"). The parties may also engage in motion practice, and the proceeding can culminate in a full-blown trial. Congress set the price for engaging the PTO in this type of litigation: \"All the expenses of the proceed- ings shall be paid by the applicant.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. Thus, an applicant who proceeds under \u00a7 145 must shoulder not only his own significant expenses and fees, but also the PTO 's \"expenses of the proceedings.\" Congress introduced \u00a7 145 's predecess or in 1839,1 and over the years, the PTO has relied on these \"ex- 1 The original language from 1839 required an applicant to pay \"the whole of the expenses of the proceeding . . . whether the 4a penses\" provisions to recover PTO attorneys ' travel expenses to attend depositions, see Robertson v. Cooper , 46 F.2d 766, 769 (4th Cir. 1931), printing expenses, cf. Cook v. Watson , 208 F.2d 529, 530 (D.C. Cir. 1953), court reporter fees, and reasonable fees for expert witnesses, see Sandvik Aktiebolag v. Samuels WL 25774, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 1991). For more than 170 years, how ever, the PTO never sought \u2014and no court ever awarded \u2014attorneys ' fees under \u00a7 145 or its predecessor. B As its name suggests, the American Rule is a \"bed- rock principle\" of this country 's jurisprudence. Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co. , 560 U.S. 242, 253 (2010). It provides that, in the United States, \"[e]ach litigant pays his own attorney 's fees, win or lose.\" Baker Botts L.L.P. v. ASARCO (2015) (quoting Hardt , 560 U.S. at 253). The American Rule may only be displaced by an express grant from Congress. Id. And it serves as the \"basic point of reference\" whenever a court \"consider[s] the award of attorney 's fees.\" Id. (quoting Hardt , 560 U.S. at 252 -53). The rationale supporting the American Rule is rooted in fair access to the legal system, as well as the difficulty of litigating the fee question: [S]ince litigation is at best uncertain one should not be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and . . . the poor might be unjustly dis- final decision shall be in his favor or otherwise.\" Act of Mar. 3, 1839, ch. 88, \u00a7 10, 5 Stat. 353, 354. Neither party argues that sub - sequent revisions to \u00a7 145 impact our analysis. 5a couraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents ' counsel. Also, the time, expense, and difficulties of proof inherent in litigating the question of what constitutes reasonable attorney 's fees would pose substantial burdens for judicial ad- ministration. Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co. , 386 U.S. 714, 718 (1967) (citations omitted). In the con- text of this case, the American Rule preserves access to district courts for small businesses and individual in- ventors seek ing to avail themselves of \u00a7 145 's benefits. The American Rule traces its origins back to at least the late 1700s. In Arcambel v. Wiseman , the circuit court included $1,600 in counsel 's fees as part of the damages. 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 306, 306 (1796). The as- sessment of attorneys ' fees, the Supreme Court con- cluded, could not be allowed because the \"general prac- tice of the United States is in opposition to it; and even if that practice were not strictly correct in principle, it is entitled to the respect of the court, till it is changed, or modified, by statute.\" Id. \"[O]ur courts have gen- erally resisted any movement\" toward the English system \u2014which permits the award of attorneys ' fees to successful parties in litigation \u2014ever since.2 Fleisch- 2 The Supreme Court has carved out several equitable exceptions to further the interests of just ice. See F. D. Rich Co. v. U.S. for Use of Indus. Lumber Co. , 417 U.S. 116, 129 (1974) (acknowledging availability of attorneys ' fees where party \"has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons\"); Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Sc ale Co. , 261 U.S. 399, 426 -28 (1923) (allowing at - torneys ' fees as part of penalty for willful disobedience of court order); Trustees v. Greenough , 105 U.S. 527, 532 -33, 537 (1882) 6a 386 U.S. at 717; see Runyon v. McCrary , 427 U.S. 160, 185 (1976) (\"[T]he law of the United States . . . has always been that absent explicit congressional authorization, attorneys ' fees are not a recoverable cost of litigation.\"). Only Congress \"has the power and judgment to pick and choose among its statutes and to allow attorneys ' fees under some, but not others.\" Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U.S. at 263. Congress has not \"extended any rov - ing authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted.\" Id. at 260. Thus, the Supreme Court has held that the American Rule presumptively applies and any statutory deviations from it must be \"specific and explicit.\" Id. at 260 -62, 269. According to th e Supreme Court, one \"good example of the clarity . . . required to deviate from the Amer- ican Rule\" can be found in the Equal Access to Justice Act's attorneys ' fees provision. Baker Botts , 135 S. Ct. at 2164. That provision commands courts to \"award t o a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses . . . incurred by that party in any civil action,\" so long as certain conditions are met. Id. at 2164 (emphasis added) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A)). As the Supreme Court ex plained, \"there could be little dispute that this provision \u2014 which mentions 'fees, ' a 'prevailing party, ' and a 'civil (permitting party recovering fund for the benefit of himself and others to seek attorneys ' fees from the fund itself or directly from other parties who enjoyed the benefit); see generally Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc 'y, 421 U.S. 240, 257 -59 (1975). None of these exceptions are implicated here. 7a action '\u2014is a 'fee-shifting statut[e] ' that trumps the American Rule.\" Id. (alteration in original). Not all fee -shifting statutes follow this template though. For example, the Supreme Court has a sep- arate line of precedent \"addressing statutory devia- tions from the American Rule that do not limit attor- ney's fees awards to the 'prevailing party. '\" Hardt , 560 U.S. at 254. In Hardt , the Court analyzed whether Congress deviated from the American Rule when it passed a statute providing that a \"court in its discre- tion may allow a reasonable attorney 's fee and costs of action to either party.\" Id. at 251 -52 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1)). The same is true in Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club , where the Court examined a provision of the Clean Air Act allowing a court to \"award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) whenever it determines that suc h an award is appropriate.\" 463 U.S. 680, 682 (1983) (emphasis omitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(f )). And while the American Rule sets a high bar for shifting attorneys ' fees, it does not impose a magic words requirement so long as Congress 's intent is \"specific and explicit.\" See Summit Valley Indus., Inc. v. Local 112, United Bhd. of Carpenters , 456 U.S. 717, 721 -22 (1982). As the Supreme Court acknowl- edged in Key Tronic Corp. v. United States , \"[t]he ab - sence of [a] specific reference to attorney 's fees is not dispositive if the statute otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees.\" 511 U.S. 809, 815 (1994); see Baker Botts , 135 S. Ct. at 2165 (discussing statute pro - viding for \"reasonable compensation for ing 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330(a)(1)(A))). II This brings us to the procedural background of the current case. In 2001, Dr. Hans Klingemann filed a patent application directed to a method for treating cancer using natural killer cells. Dr. Klingemann 's application was eventually assigned to NantKwest, Inc. The examiner rejected the application as obvious in 2010, and the Board affirmed the rejection in 2013. Pursuant to \u00a7 145, NantKwest challenged the Board 's decision by filing a complaint against the Director of the PTO in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Discovery ensued and the PTO moved for summary judgment that the application 's claims wou ld have been obvious. The district court granted the PTO 's motion, and we affirmed. See NantKwest, Inc. v. Lee , 686 F. App 'x 864, 865 (Fed. Cir. 2017). After prevailing on the merits, the PTO filed a motion for reimbursement of the \"expenses of the proc eedings\" under \u00a7 145. The $111,696.39 sum sought by the PTO included $78,592.50 in attorneys ' fees\u2014calculated based on the pro rata salaries of the two PTO attorneys and one paralegal who worked on the case \u2014and $33,103.89 in expert witness fees. The distr ict court denied the PTO 's motion with re- spect to attorneys ' fees, citing the American Rule. Nan[tK]west, Inc. v. Lee , 162 F. Supp. 3d 540, 542 -43 (E.D. Va. 2016). In the court 's view, \"Congress 's reference to 'all . . . the expenses ' merely points to a collection of the expenses used, commonly under- stood to encompass . . . printing, travel, and rea-9a sonable expert witness expenses.\" Id. at 543. The district court noted that \"[i]n \u00a7 145 Congress neither used the phrase 'attorneys ' fees' nor 'fees' nor any alternative phrase demonstrating a clear reference to attorneys ' fees.\" Id. at 545. It then concluded that the \"ambiguity regarding the exact reach of the term 'expenses ' means \u00a7 145 does not meet the Supreme Court 's Baker Botts standard and therefore, cannot deviate from the American Rule.\" Id. The PTO appealed the denial of its motion to recover attorneys ' fees, and a divided panel of this court re - versed the district court 's judgment. The majority re - lied on the Fourth Circui t's opinion in Shammas v. Focarino , which interpreted a nearly identical provision of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b)(3). 784 F.3d 219, 223 -24 (4th Cir. 2015). There, the Fourth Circuit held that the American Rule only applies to statutes that refer to a \"prevailing party.\" Id. at 223. Refer- ring to this language, the majority here voiced \"sub- stantial doubts\" that \u00a7 145 implicates the American Rule because it imposes the PTO 's expenses on appli- cants without referring to a (Fed. Cir. 2017). Nevertheless, the majority assumed the American Rule applied for purposes of its analysis and conc luded that the word \"expenses\" \" 'specific[ally] ' and 'explicit[ly] ' authorizes an award of f ees.\" Id. at 1356 (alterations in original) (quoting Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U.S. at 260). For support, the majority relied on dictionaries defining \"expenses\" as \"expenditure[s] of money, time, labor , or resources to accomplish a re- sult,\" id. (alteration in original) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 698 (10th ed. 2014)), and a statement from Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd. , from at 1357 (quoting 566 U.S. 560, 573 (2012)). Finally, the ma- jority rejected NantKwest 's contention that pro -rata salaries of the PTO 's employees were not \"expenses of the proceedings.\" Id. at 1359.3 Our court voted sua sponte to hear the appeal en banc and vacated the panel 's judgment. NantKwest, Inc. v. Matal , 869 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2017). We re - quested briefing on a single question: whether the panel \"correctly determine[d] that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 's '[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings ' provision au- thorizes an award of the [PTO 's] attorneys ' fees.\" Id. at 1327. In addition to the parties ' briefs and argu- ment, we received seven amicus briefs, none of which support the PTO 's position. We now affirm the judg- ment of the district court. III We review de novo a district court 's interpretation of a statute. Boston Sci. Scimed, Inc. v. Medtronic Vas- cular, Inc., 497 F.3d 1293, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Unless otherwise defined, words in a statute \"will be in terpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, com mon mean- 3 Following issuan ce of this Court 's NantKwest decision, the PTO requested and received attorneys ' fees in at least one \u00a7 145 ac - tion. See, e.g. , Realvirt, LLC v. Lee , 220 F. Supp. 3d 695, 704 (E.D. Va. 2016) (awarding more than $48,000 in attorneys ' fees in \u00a7 145 action). The PTO also convinced a district court to impose a $40,000 bond on a pro se plaintiff who filed suit under \u00a7 145. Taylor v. Lee, No. 1:15 -CV-1607, 2016 WL 9308420, at *2 (E.D. Va. July 12, 2016) (requiring payment of bond before permittin g \u00a7 145 action to proceed, but noting uncertainty surrounding applicant 's finances). 11a ing.\" Summit Valley , 456 U.S. at 722 (quoti ng Perrin v. United States , 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)). According to the PTO, the American Rule does not govern our interpretation of \u00a7 145. Even if it does, the PTO and the dissent aver that the statutory text suffices to displace this long -standing, common -law rule. We disagree on both counts and address each issue in turn. A At the outset, we hold that the American Rule ap- plies to \u00a7 145. As noted, the American Rule provides that each litigant bears its own attorneys ' fees, win or lose, and a statute must use \"specific and explicit\" lan - guage to depart from this rule. The Supreme Court in Baker Botts emphasized that the American Rule is the starting point whenever a party seeks to shift fees from one side to the othe r in adversarial litigation. 135 S. Ct. at 2164 (explaining that \"when considering the award of attorney 's fees,\" the American Rule con- stitutes the \"basic point of reference\" (quoting Hardt , 560 U.S. at 252 -53)). Because the PTO contends that \u00a7 145 shoul d be construed to shift its attorneys ' fees to the patent applicants bringing suit, the American Rule necessarily applies. Accordingly, we must be able to discern from \u00a7 145 's text a \"specific and explicit\" con- gressional directive to make an award of attorneys ' fees available. Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U.S. at 260. We are not persuaded by the PTO 's contrary argu- ments for why the American Rule should not apply to litigation under \u00a7 145. The PTO begins by relying on the Fourth Circuit 's Shammas opinion for the proposi- tion that the American Rule only governs the interpre- tation of statutes that shift fees from a prevailing party 12a to a losing party. Because \u00a7 145 imposes \"[a]ll the ex - penses\" on the applicant, win or lose, the PTO asserts it is not a fee -shift ing statute that falls within the American Rule 's ambit. We disagree. Given the pri - mary purpose of the American Rule \u2014protection of ac - cess to courts \u2014the PTO 's alleged distinction makes little sense. We submit that the policy behind the American Rule wo uld be even more strongly implicated where attorneys ' fees would be imposed on a winning plaintiff. In Shammas , a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit awarded attorneys ' fees to the PTO under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b)(3) \u2014the trademark analogue to \u00a7 145 \u2014which also refers to \"all the expenses of the proceeding.\" The Shammas court reached this decision only by first holding that the American Rule does not apply to \u00a7 1071(b)(3). 784 F.3d at 223. Based on a narrow in - terpretation of the Supreme Court 's statement in Alyeska Pipeline , the Fourth Circuit held that \"the American Rule provides only that 'the prevailing party may not recover attorneys ' fees' from the losing party .\" Id. (quoting Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U.S. at 245). The Fourth Circuit also re lied on the Supreme Court 's observation in Ruckelshaus that \"virtually every one of the more than 150 existing federal fee -shifting provi- sions predicates fee awards on some success by the claimant \" to conclude that a statute mandating fees without regard t o a party 's success is not a fee -shifting statute governed by the American Rule. Id. (quoting Ruckelshaus , 463 U.S. at 684). We respectfully submit that Shammas 's holding cannot be squared with the Supreme Court 's line of nonprevailing party precedent applying the American 13a Rule. Although Alyeska Pipeline does refer to the American Rule in the context of a \"prevailing party,\" the rule is not so limited. Rather, the Supreme Court has consistently applied the rule broadly to any statute that allows fee shifting to either party, win or lose. For example, the Supreme Court in Hardt evaluated a request for attorneys ' fees under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), which grants courts authority to award \"reasonable 's fee[s] . . . to either pa rty\" at the court 's \"discretion.\" 560 U.S. at 251 -52. The Supreme Court held that \"a fee claimant need not be a 'prevailing party ' to be eligible for an attorney 's fees award under \u00a7 1132(g)(1)\" because the statutory text contained no such limitation. Id. at 252. But the ab - sence of a \"prevailing party\" requirement did not ren- der the American Rule inapplicable to the fee -shifting inquiry. Instead, the Court \"interpret[ed] \u00a7 1132(g)(1) in light of [its] precedents addressing statutory devia- tions from the American Rule that do not limit attorney 's fees awards to the 'prevailing party. '\" Id. at 254. Our decision is in keeping with Ruckelshaus , relied on by the Fourth Circuit in Shammas . While the Court in Ruckelshaus acknowledged that the vast ma - jority of fee -shifting provisions impose a \"success\" re - quirement, the Court made clear that its absence does not render the American Rule inapplicable. Instead, the Court applied the American Rule even though the district court awarded fees to a \"party that achieved no success on the merits\" based on a statute that Ruckelshaus , 463 U.S. U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(f )). Accordingly, we think that the Fourth Circuit 's reliance on Ruckelshaus to 14a support its view that the American Rule does not apply to statutes lacking a success requirement is misplaced. Our understanding is likewise confirmed by numer- ous other cases that applied the American Rule to a variety of statutes that did not mention a \"prevailing party.\" The Supreme Court applied the American Rule to a bankruptcy statute allowing \"reasonable com - pensation for actual, necessary services rendered by the truste e . . . S. Ct. at 2165 (emphasis omitted). An environmental statute permitting the recovery of any \"necessary costs of re - sponse,\" including \"enforcement activities\" was also analyzed by the Court under the American Rule. Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 813, 819. So too with a statute authorizing an injured person to \"recover the damages by him sustained and the cost of the suit.\" Summit Valley , 456 U.S. at 722. The Court likewise held that the American Rule gove rned an attorneys ' fees request under a statute authorizing the recovery of \"sums justly due.\" F. D. Rich Co. , 417 U.S. at 128, 130 -31. The PTO also cites the Supreme Court 's decision in Sebelius v. Cloer , which interpreted a statute requiring the payment of attorneys ' fees regardless of the party 's litigation success without expressly discussing the American Rule. 569 U.S. 369 (2013). This, the PTO argues, shows that the American Rule does not apply to statutes that do not refer to a \"prevailing party.\" At issue in Cloer was the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (\"NCVIA\"). The statute creates an \"unusual scheme for compensating attorneys who work on NCVIA petitions\": it requires courts to award \"reasonable attorneys ' fees\" for a successful petition, and it grants courts discretion to make the same award 15a for an unsuccessful petition \"brought in good faith [with] a reasonable basis for the claim.\" Id. at & n.1 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa -15(e)(1)). Therefore, Congress specifically and explicitly authorized the award of attorneys ' fees. The only question for the Court was whether attorneys ' fees could be recovered for untimely petitions. The Court answered this question in the affirmative, but its analysis does not undercut the America n Rule 's applicability to \u00a7 145. First, the Court rejected the government 's argument that an untimely petition was ineligible for fees because it was never \"filed\" within the meaning of the statute. Id. at 377 -79. The Court then turned to the government 's argument that common - law principles, including the American Rule, barred the award of attorneys ' fees for untimely petitions. Citing the page of the government 's brief discussing the American Rule, the Court held that the \"presumption favoring the ret ention of long -established and familiar [common -law] principles,\" i.e., the American Rule, must \"give way\" to the unambiguous statutory language. Id. at 380 -81 (alteration in original) (quoting Brief for the Petitioner at 32, Sebelius v. Cloer , 569 2013 WL 75285, *32). Cloer thus stands for the unremarkable principle that a statute providing for the award of \"attorneys ' fees\" can displace the American Rule. Given the Supreme Court 's line of non -prevailing party precedent and the inapposite nature of Cloer , we see no reason why the American Rule would not apply to \u00a7 145. As the Supreme Court has explained, the American Rule simply provides that each litigant bears its own attorney fees. Hardt , 560 U.S. at 253. The 16a PTO 's rea ding of \u00a7 145 requires the opposite. Ac- cordingly, \u00a7 145 should not escape the heightened stan - dard required for congressional departure from this bedrock principle. B Having concluded that the American Rule applies, we now ask whether \u00a7 145 displaces it. The Supreme Court has explained that when, as here, a statutory provision \"does not expressly provide for the recovery of attorney 's fees . . . we are not presented with a situation where Congress has made 'specific and ex- plicit provisions for the allowance of ' such fees.\" Summit Valley , 456 U.S. at 722 (quoting Alyeska Pipe - line, 421 U.S. at 260 & n.33); see also Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 815. But \"[t]he absence of [a] specific ref - erence to attorney 's fees is not dispositive if the statute other wise evinces an intent to provide for such fees.\" Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 815. Congress can convey this intent through the ordinary meaning of the statu- tory term alleged to shift attorneys ' fees\u2014here, \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" \u2014although the ordi- nary meaning must supply a \"specific and explicit\" di - rective to depart from the American Rule. See Sum- mit Valley , 456 U.S. at 722 -23; see also id. at 721, 726 (declining to deviate from American Rule after finding no \"express statutory authorization\" in statute 's text to support contention that \"damages\" includes attorneys ' fees); Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 819 (requiring \"explicit statutory authority\" to depart from American Rule). In our view, \u00a7 145 's statement that \"[a]ll the ex- penses of the proceedin gs shall be paid by the appli- cant\" lacks the \"specific and explicit\" congressional au - thorization required to displace the American Rule. 17a Section 145 contains no reference to attorneys ' fees, \"reasonable compensation for actual, necessary ser- vices rendere 135 S. Ct. at 2165 (emphasis omitted), PTO attorney salaries, or any other equally clear language. To sa - tisfy the Supreme Court 's strict standard, the PTO must show that \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" specifically and explicitly includes attorneys ' fees. But this phrase is at best ambiguous as to attorneys ' fees. As explained below, the cases and definitions relied on by the PTO demonstrate that, at most, this language is merely capable of implicitly covering at- torneys ' fees. The American Rule and the \"specific and explicit\" requirement demand more than language that merely can be and is sometimes used broadly to implicitly cover attorneys ' fees. Moreover, other sta - tutory provisions enacted by Congr ess demonstrate that ordinarily, a statutory right to \"expenses\" does not include an implicit authorization to award attorneys ' fees. This is further demonstrated by both contem- poraneous and current court cases and other statutory provisions in the Patent Act. We begin our analysis with contemporaneous defini- tions and usages of \"expenses.\" In introduced the \"whole of the expenses\" language in \u00a7 145 's predecessor, Act of Mar. 3, 1839, \u00a7 10, 5 Stat. at 354, the ordinary meaning of \"expen ses\" did not im - plicitly encompass attorneys ' fees. The PTO only cites one dictionary from this time period, which de- fined \"expense\" as \"[a] laying out or expending; the disbursing of money, or the employment and consump- tion, as of time or labor.\" Appell ant Br. 17 (quoting Noah Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1st ed. 1828)). Other 1830s Worcester, A Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary of the English Language, with Pronouncing Vocabularies of Classical and Scripture Proper Names 117 (1830), as is used, employed, laid out, or consumed,\" Noah Webster et al., An American Dictionary of the English Language 319 (Joseph Worcester ed., 1830). These vague definitions, however, do not establish that a statutory right to \"expenses\" includes \"an implicit authorization to award attorney 's fees.\" Summit Val- ley, 456 U.S. at 722. More compelling than the dictionary definitions, though, is Congress 's usage of the terms \"expenses\" and \"attorneys ' fees\" in other statutes. These stat- utes demonstrate Congress 's understanding that the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" does not include at- torn eys' fees. Similar to the Supreme Court 's analy- sis in West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Ca- sey, we think the \"record of statutory usage\" convinc- ingly demonstrates that attorneys ' fees and expenses are regarded as separate elements unless specifically identified otherwise. 499 U.S. 83, 88 (1991) (reviewing statutes using terms \"attorney 's fees\" and \"expert fees\" to understand whether reference to \"attorney 's fees\" would necessarily shift expert fees as well). Indeed, Congress has drafted n umerous statutes au - thorizing the award of both \"expenses\" and \"attorneys ' fees.\" This first category of statutes list expenses and attorneys ' fees as separate items of recovery. See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(n) (authorizing trustee to recover \"any costs, a ttorneys ' fees, or expenses may allow to any such party reasonable expenses and attorneys ' fees.\"); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1786(p) (\"[C]ourt . . . may allow to any such party such reasonable expenses and attorneys ' fees as it deems just and proper. . . . \"); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 and expenses\"); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(2)(A) (allowing recovery of \"excess costs, ex - penses, and attorneys ' fees\" against attorneys ' fees and be awarded by court); 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(d)(1) (\"Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys ' fees and costs.\"); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4323(h)(2) (\"[T]he court may award any such person who prevails in such action or proceeding reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.\"); Act of Dec. 23, 1930, ch. 23, \u00a7 4, 46 Stat. 1033, 1034 (granting Court of Claims risdiction to \"determine a reasonable fee . . . to be paid the attorney or attorneys employed as herein provided, together with al l necessary and proper ex- penses\"); Act of Mar. 23, 1932, ch. 90, \u00a7 7, 47 Stat. 70, 72 (requiring adequate security to cover \"all reasonable costs (together with a reasonable attorney 's fee) and expense\" before permitting issuance of temporary re - straining order or temporary injunction). It is hard to imagine that the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" spe- cifically and explicitly includes \"attorneys ' fees\" given the volume of statutory provisions that treat expenses and attorneys ' fees as separate items.4 If \"expenses\" 4 The dissent questions the import of these statutes because they 20a includes attorneys ' fees, then many \"statutes referring to the two separately become an inexplicable exercise in redundancy.\" W. Va. Univ. , 499 U.S. at 92. A second category of statutes define expenses to in- clude attorneys ' fees, but they do so explicitly. These statutes demonstrate that \"expenses\" does not neces- sarily include attorneys ' fees, else there would be no need to so define \"expenses.\" See, e.g. , 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005(b)(2)(B) (providing that, in absence of breach of warranty, amount of indemnity shall be sum of \"inter- est and expenses (including costs and reasonable at- torney 's fees and other expenses of representation)\"); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409(c)(1)(C) (permitting agency head to require that contractor pay \"an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys ' fees and expert witnesses ' fees)\" in connec- tion with complaint regarding a reprisal); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(2) (permitting recovery of \"a sum equal to the aggregate amount of cost and expenses (including at - torneys ' fees based on actual time expended)\"); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (\"An order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\"); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1370(e) (1) (\"[T]he court in its discretion may award all or a portion of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action, in- cluding reasonable attorney 's fees. . . . \"); 30 U.S.C. post-date the enactment 145 's predecessor. Dissent Op. 6 -7 n.1. But Congress distinguished betwee n attorneys ' fees and ex penses during the mid -1800s too, see, e.g. , S.J. Res. 25, 40th Cong. \u00a7 1, 15 Stat. 26, 26 (1867) (discussing payment to \"agent or attorney [of] his lawful fees and expenses\"). In any event, neither the PTO nor the dissent suggests that Congress 's understanding in this regard changed between 1839 and the passa ge of the above -cited statutes. 21a \u00a7 938(c) (allowing successful miner to recover \"a sum equal to th e aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including the attorney 's fees)\"); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) (\"[A] sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including the attorney 's fees) . . . head of agency may \"[o]rder the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggre- gate amount of all costs and expenses (including attor- neys ' fees and expert witnesses ' fees) that the complain- ant reasonably incurred\") ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d -6d(e)(9) expenses incurred . . . including a reasonable attorney 's fee\"); 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 396 (\"The committee may allow any party reimburse - ment from the applicable accounts of the House of Represe ntatives of his reasonable expenses of the con- tested election case, including reasonable attorneys fees. . . . \"). Collectively, these statutes encompass diverse cat- egories of legislation and demonstrate that Congress understood the \"ordinary, contemporary, common meaning\" of \"expenses\" as being something other than \"attorneys ' fees\" unless expressly specified. See Sum- mit Valley , 456 U.S. at 722 (quoting Perrin , 444 U.S. at 42). Statutes awarding both expenses and attorneys ' fees suggest that Congress viewed them as distinct tools in its toolbox of recovery items that can be shifted at its discretion to accomplish a policy objective. If \"expenses\" necessarily included \"attorneys ' fees,\" the numerous statutes providing for both would have su- perfluous words and, as a general rule, courts should \"avoid an interpretation of a statute that 'renders some words altogether redundant. '\" See United States v. Alaska , 521 U.S. 1, 59 (1997) (quoting Gustafson v. 22a Alloyd Co. , 513 U.S. 561, 574 (1995)). Likewise, Con- gress would have no reason to permit the recovery of \"expenses\" \u2014and then specify whether it included \"at- torneys ' fees\" \u2014if the former always encompassed the latter. To us, the logical implication of Congress 's prior usage is that \"attorneys ' fees\" are not even ordi- narily, let alone necessarily, included in \"expenses\" absent an express expansion of \"expenses\" to include \"attorneys ' fees.\" At best, whether \"expenses\" in- cludes \"attorneys ' fees\" is ambiguous.5 But ambiguity cannot satisfy the e xacting standard erected by the American Rule for shifting attorneys ' fees. In considering whether the ordinary meaning of a particular statutory provision shifted attorneys ' fees, the Supreme Court in Key Tronic found it persuasive that Congress included express provisions for fee awards in related statutes without including a similar provision in the statute at issue. 511 U.S. at 817 -18. So too here.6 The existence of several Patent Act pro - 5 We note that \u00a7 145 is not discretionary; it requires that \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 (emphasis added). To the extent the phrase \"ex - penses\" unambiguously includes attorneys ' fees, it is unclear why it took the PTO more than 170 years to appreciate the statute 's alleged clarity and seek the attorneys ' fees that are statutorily mandat ed under its interpretation. The dissent excuses the PTO 's failure to pursue fees in earlier proceedings, citing \"dramatic[]\" changes in the patent landscape, Dissent Op. 18, but this does nothing to soften the statute 's mandatory directive. 6 The dissen t cites Key Tronic as an example of the Supreme Court favorably citing the Eighth Circuit 's conclusion that a stat- ute's reference to \"necessary costs of response\" and \"enforcement activities\" constituted a \"sufficient degree of explicitness\" to permit the award of attorneys ' fees. Dissent Op. 15 (quoting Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 815). But the Supreme Court analyzed the same sta - 23a visions awarding \"attorneys ' fees\" demonstrates Con- gress 's use of \"specific and explicit\" language in the Patent Act to shift fees when it so desired. For ex- ample, \u00a7 285 states: \"The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 (emphasis added). Other provisions of the Patent Act recognize the availability of attorneys ' fees by cross -referencing \u00a7 285. See, e.g., 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(4) (noting \"that a court may award attorney fees under section 285\" as part of rem- edy for infringement circumstances where \"the court shall find the case exceptional for the pur- pose of awarding attorney fees under section 285\" (em - phasis added)). Finally, \u00a7 297(b)(1) permits customers who have been defrauded by a n invention promoter to recover \"reasonable costs and attorneys ' fees\" in addition to damages. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 297(b)(1) (emphasis add ed). Congress elected in \u00a7 145 to provide for the recov- ery of the PTO 's \"expenses,\" not its \"attorneys ' fees.\" When \"Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclu- sion or exclusion.\" Russello v. United States , 464 U.S. tutory language as the Eighth Circuit and held that it cannot sup - port an award of attorneys ' fees: \"To conclude that a provision that only impliedly authorizes suit nonetheless provides for at- torney 's fees with the clarity required by Alyeska would be unu- sual if not unprecedented.\" Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 818. This decision was informed in part by the presence of \"two express provisions for fee awards\" in a related statute, which the Court understood to \"strongly suggest a deliberate decision not to au - thorize such awards\" here. Id. at 818 -19. 24a 16, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo , 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972)). Here, Congress did not award \"attorneys ' fees\" under \u00a7 145 but did make them available under other sections of the Patent Act. We presume this was intenti onal, id., and thus the omis- fees\" from \u00a7 145 \"strongly suggest[s] a deliberate decision not to authorize such awards.\" See Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 819 (declining to award fees under provision that did not refer to \"attorneys ' fees,\" in part because two other provisions in related statute contained express authority to shift fees).7 We are dubious of the dissent 's attempt to distinguish \u00a7 285 from \u00a7 145 on the ground that \u00a7 145 does not \"arise[] in traditional patent litigati on.\" Dissent Op. 8. To the contrary, \u00a7 145 is titled \"Civil action to ob - tain patent,\" and it provides \"remedy by civil action against the Director in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\" \u00a7 145. This statutory languag e clearly gives rise to \"patent 7 The patent laws have been amended on numerous occasions since Congress enacted \u00a7 145 's predecessor in 1839. If the PTO 's decision not to seek fees during this time contradicted Congress 's intent, Congress could have revised the statute to make its intent more clear. For example, Congress amended the law in 1946 to permit the \"award [of ] reasonable attorney 's fees to the prevailing party\" in infringement actions. Act of Aug. 1, 1946, ch. 726, 60 Stat. 778, 778 (emphasis added) (creating predecessor to \u00a7 285). Con- gress could have included similar language in \u00a7 145, but it did not. \"When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally.\" Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 174 (2009). Although Gross drew this inference based on Congress 's decision to amend a provision in one s tatute but not amend a similar provision in another statute, we think the inference carries equal force with respect to two provisions within the same statutory scheme. 25a litigation\" between the disappointed patent applicant and the Director of the PTO. We have also considered judicial usage of \"expens- es.\" See W. Va. Univ. , 499 U.S. at 92 -93 (looking to contemporaneous court decisions to determine whether expert fees were shifted as element of attorneys ' fees). Many courts and litigants in the 1800s referred to \"ex - penses\" and \"attorneys ' fees\" as distinct items. See, e.g., Morris v. Way , 16 Ohio 469, 472 (1847) (referring to statement o f accounts listing \"attorney 's fees and ex - penses\"); Hayden v. Sample , 10 Mo. 215, 221 (1846) (noting defendant 's request that jury be instructed to ignore evidence of \"the expenses incurred . . . and the fees paid counsel and attorneys\"); Anderson v. Farns, 7 Blackf. 343, 343 (Ind. 1845) (citing party 's re- quest for indemnity from all \"penalties, costs, damages, attorney 's fees, and expenses\"); State v. Williams , 13 Ohio 495, 499 (1844) (providing that trustees had authority to settle \"the expense of prosecuting suits, attorney 's fees, etc.\"); Bishop v. Day , 13 Vt. 81, 83 (1841) (discussing contract containing indemnity from \"any costs, lawyers ' fees, and expenses\"); Hickman v. Quinn , 14 Tenn. 96, 107 n.1 (1834) (explaining that defendants deducted \"th eir expenses, attorney 's fees, etc.\" from amount voluntarily given to plaintiff ); see also Br. of Amici Curiae Intellectual Prop. Owners Ass'n 8 (collecting cases). This distinction remains evident in recent legal opin- ions. For example, one court recogni zed that \"[t ]he terms 'costs ' or 'expenses ' when used in a statute do not ordinarily include attorney 's fees.\" Ark. Dep 't of Human Servs., Div. of Econ. & Med. Servs. v. Kistler , 320 Ark. 501, 509 (1995); see also Tracy v. T & B Con-26a str. Co. , 182 N.W.2d 320, 322 (S.D. 1970) (\"Ordinarily the terms 'costs ' and 'expenses ' as used in a statute are not understood to include attorney 's fees.\"); McAdam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 896 F.2d 750, 776 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e can not find the vague reference in \u00a7 4-207(3) to 'expenses ' [to be a] sufficient basis on which to predicate such an award [of attorneys ' fees].\"); Lewis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. , 197 F. Supp. 3d 16, 29 (D.D.C. 2016) (finding no authority to shift at- torneys ' fees under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(f ), subsection (3) of which permits court to \"award all or a portion of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action\"). Finally, we emphasize that the PTO 's interpretation of \u00a7 145 would have a patent applicant pay the govern- ment 's attorneys ' fees even when the patent applicant succeeds. Other than what we believe to be an incor- rect interpretation of the trademark analogue in Sham - mas , we are aware of no statute that requires a private litigant to pay the government 's attorneys ' fees without regard to the party 's success in the litigation. Indeed, the PTO could not identify any statute that shifts the salaries of an agency 's attorneys onto the party bring- ing suit to challenge the agency 's decision. See Oral Arg. at 26:53 -27:09, http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts. gov/default.aspx?fl=2016 -1794_382018.mp3; see also Amici Curiae Am. Bar Ass 'n 5 (\"Congress has never enacted a fee -shifting provision that shifts only the government 's fees onto private parties, much less a provision that does so even if the government loses the litigation.\"). Thus, adopting the PTO 's interpretation would create a particularly unusual divergence from the American Rule. Had Congress intended to pro- duce such an anomalous result, we believe \"it would 27a have said so in far plainer language than that employed here.\" Ruckelshaus , 463 U.S. at 694. The Supreme Court 's reluctance to endorse statu- tory interpretations that would create sweeping de- partures from the American Rule furthers our conclu- sion. For example, even in statutes where Congress has granted courts broad leeway to shift \"attorneys ' fees,\" the Supreme Court has restricted the availability of those awards. See, e.g., Hardt , 560 U.S. at 251 -52, 255 (requiring \"some degree of success on the merits \" to recover attorneys ' fees even though statute permits \"court in its discretion [to] allow a reasonable attor- ney's fee and costs of action to either party (emphases added)); Ruckelshaus \"some degree of success on the merits\" before shifting attorneys ' fees even though statute allows court to \"award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) whenever it deter- mines that such an award is appropriate \" (emphasis added)); Baker Botts , 135 S. Ct. at 2165 (permitting recovery of attorneys ' fees for work done during bank - ruptcy proceeding, but not in fee -defense litigation, un - der statute allowing \"reasonable compensation for ac - tual, necessary services rendered by the trustee . . . or attorney \" (emphasis omitted)). And the Court often rejects fee -shifting requests under the American Rule where Congress employs vague statutory language that might, to a layperson, seem broad enough to cover attorneys ' fees as well as other items. See, e.g. , Summ it Valley , 456 U.S. at 722, 726 (declining to shift attorneys ' fees under statute permitting recovery of \"the damages by him sustained and the cost of the suit\"); F. D. Rich Co. , 417 U.S. at 28a 128, 130 -31 (declining to award attorneys ' fees pursu- ant to statu te authorizing recovery of \"sums justly due\"); Fleischmann , 386 U.S. at 720 (declining to award attorneys ' fees under statute giving courts au- thority to award \"costs of the action\"); Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 813, 819 (declining to shift attorneys ' fees pursuant to statute making responsible parties liable for \"any . . . necessary costs of response,\" includ- ing \"enforcement activities\"). Using these cases as a barometer, we cannot conclude that a statute awarding \"[a]ll the expenses,\" with nothing more, effects such an extreme departure from the American Rule. IV The PTO and the dissent resist our conclusion that \u00a7 145 does not displace the American Rule. They both begin \u2014as we do \u2014with the meaning of \"expenses.\" To support an expansive reading of \"expe nses\" that in - cludes attorney fees, the PTO and the dissent cite the Supreme Court 's statement in Taniguchi that \"[t]ax - able costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for attorneys , experts, consultants, and investigators.\" 566 U. S. at 573 (emphasis added); see generally Appellant Br. 38 -39; Dissent Op. 6. We acknowledge that the word \"expenses\" is broad and, like \"costs\" or \"litigation costs,\" is sometimes used in judicial opinions to refer to a variety of burdens in- curred by a litigant, including attorneys ' fees. But the Supreme Court has never interpreted the phrase \"ex- penses\" or \"all the expenses\" to authorize a departure from the American Rule. Indeed, Taniguchi only an - alyzed \"whether [the phrase] 'compensation of inter- preters' covers the cost of translating documents.\" Id. at 562. 29a In a similar vein, the PTO relies on a single sentence from Arlington Central School District Board of Edu- cation v. Murphy , 548 U.S. 291 (2006). See Appellant Br. 39. There, the Individuals with Disabilities Edu- cation Act (\"IDEA\") permitted courts, in their discre- tion, to award \"reasonable attorneys ' fees as part of the costs\" to the prevailing party. Arlington Central , 548 U.S. at 297 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 asser ted that \"costs\" should be inter- preted to cover all the costs of an IDEA proceeding, including expert fees. The Court rejected respond- ents ' argument, noting that the statute 's \"use of this term of art [ 'costs '], rather than a term such as 'ex- penses, ' strongly suggests that \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open -ended provision that makes par- ticipating States liable for all expenses incurred.\" Id. The PTO seizes on this language, but it omits the end of the sentence, which provides examples of t he \"open - ended . . . expenses\" envisioned by the Court: \"travel and lodging expenses or lost wages due to time taken off from work.\" Id. Absent from the list is a reference to attorneys ' fees. Thus, Arlington Central does not address the interpretat ion of a statute con- taining the word \"expenses\" in light of the American Rule. Nor does it stand for the proposition that the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" is broad enough to include \"attorneys ' fees.\" The PTO likewise insists that a single sentence in Baker Botts suggests that a statutory reference to \"liti - gation costs\" alone would suffice to shift attorneys ' fees. Appellant Br. 39 (quoting 135 S. Ct. at 2164). Specifically, the Court in Baker Botts stated: \"We have recognized departures from the American Rule\" and these departures \"tend to authorize the award of 'a 30a reasonable attorney 's fee,' 'fees, ' or 'litigation costs, ' and usually refer to a 'prevailing party. '\" Id. But none of the cited statutes \u2014either in Baker Botts itself or in the cases Baker Botts cites \u2014contain a stand -alone reference to \"litigation costs.\" See Appellee Br. 24 -25. Rather, each of the statutes expressly provides for the award of attorneys ' fees in addition to, or as part of, the litigation costs. We therefore do not r ead Baker Botts to stand for the proposition that the phrase \"litigation costs,\" by itself, can displace the American Rule.8 The PTO and dissent next accuse us of transforming a statute requiring the payment of \"[a]ll the expenses\" to one demanding reimbursement for only \"some\" of the expenses. Appellant Br. 41; see Dissent Op. 9 -10. Both emphasize the modifier \"[a]ll\" in arguing that Congress intended \u00a7 145 to be fully remedial. But the word \"all\" sheds no light on the breadth of \"expenses\" vis-\u00e0-vis attorneys ' fees\u2014the crux of the dispute \u2014and serves only to clarify that, whatever the \"expenses\" 8 Alyeska Pipeline also cited numerous statutory examples of \"specific and explicit pr ovisions for the allowance of attorneys ' fees.\" 421 U.S . at 260 -62 & n.33 -35. every cited statute re- ' fees,\" for services rendered\" by an \"attorney.\" See id. The same holds true for the 2008 Congressional Research Service Report in which Congress compiled the text of several hundred other fee - shifting provisions. Each of these statutes referred to \"attorneys Cohen, Serv., Awards of Attorneys ' Fees by Fed- eral Courts and Federal Agencies 64-114 (2008), available at https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/94 -970.pdf. Notably, \u00a7 145 was not in - cluded in the statutory compilation. 31a are, all of them must be paid by the applicant. In ad - dition, at least one statute expressly identifies \"attor- neys ' fees\" as one of an enumerated list of \"all expens- es\" recoverable, further supporting the notion that the phrase \"all expenses\" does not carry the weight afforded to it by the PTO and the dissent. See 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 4531(b)(4) (permitting recovery of \"all . . including . . . attorneys ' fees and expenses of litigation\"). Finally, we note that, even if \"attorney 's fees are necessary to achieve full compensation [for the PTO 's involvement in a \u00a7 145 action], this justification alone is not sufficient to create an exception to the American Rule in the absence of express congressional authority.\" Summit Valley , 456 U.S. at 724 (emphasis added). The argument by the PTO is \"nothing more than a 'restate[ment] of one of the oft-repeated criticisms of the American R ule.'\" Id. at 725 (alteration in original) (quoting F. D. Rich Co., 417 U.S. at 128). The dissent next invokes \"legislative history and the purpose of \u00a7 145\" for displacing the American Rule. Dissent Op. 10 -13. At the outset, we question the role of legislative history in this context where the very point of the \"specific and explicit\" standard is to demand clarity in the statute 's text. See Baker Botts , 135 S. Ct. at 2164 (\"We have recognized departures from the American Rule only in 'specific and e xplicit provisions for the al- lowance of attorneys ' fees under selected statutes. '\" (quoting Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U.S. at 260)); cf. Conroy v. Aniskoff , 507 U.S. 511, 519 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"The law as it passed is the will of the majority of both houses, and the only mode in which that will is spoken is in the act itself. . . . \" (emphasis in original) (quoting Aldridge v. Williams , 44 U.S. (3 How.) 9, 24 (1844))). 32a Where the textual indications a re unclear, we are skepti- cal of what legislative history and policy could add to satisfy this standard. But even if we set these concerns aside, the dissent 's legislative history fails to advance its interpretation of \u00a7 145. The dissent points to an expen se reimbursement provision in the 1870 amendments to the patent laws, which it notes is similar to the language employed by Congress in \u00a7 145 's predecessor. Dissent Op. 11. Initial versions of the House bill limited the reimburse - ment by using the word \"costs\" and capping it at $25. See H.R. 1714, 41st Cong. \u00a7 52 (as passed by House, Apr. 25, 1870). The Senate, however, changed \"costs\" to \"expenses\" and $25 cap. See H.R. 1714, 41st Cong. \u00a7 52 (as amended by Senate, May 31, 1870). The enacted version reflects the Senate amend- ments, see Act of July 8, 1870, ch. 230, \u00a7 52, 16 Stat. 198, 205, which according to the dissent, \"demonstrates \u2014or at least strongly suggests \u2014that Congress specifically intended that 'expenses ' be broader than 'costs.'\" Dissent Op. 12. We do not contest that \"expenses\" is broader than \"costs.\" But the breadth of expenses relative to costs has no relevance here. Our task is to determine whether \"expenses\" includes attorneys ' fees, and the dissent 's legislative history is silent on this crucial point. The PTO and the dissent also direct our attention to \u00a7 9 of the 1836 patent statute \u2014a budgetary provision that uses the word \"expenses.\" Appellant Br. 27 -28; Dissent Op. 4. Section 9 requires that money paid by patent applicants into the Treasury be used \"for the payment of the salaries of the officers and clerks herein provided for, and all other expenses of the Patent Office.\" 33a Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, \u00a7 9, 5 Stat. 117, 121. In the dissent 's view, this establishes that Congress \"under- stood salaries to be within the scope of 'expenses. '\" Dissent Op. 4. But as the dissent recognizes, context is important when interpreting a statute. Dissent Op. 7. Here, \u00a7 9 is an accounting provision that earmarks mon ey the PTO receives to cover various \"expenses of the Pa- tent Office\"; it does not address how \"expenses of the proceedings\" are to be allocated in the context of adver- sarial litigation involving the PTO. Moreover, it is doubtful (or at least uncertain) whether any of the sala- ries of the particular \"officers and clerks herein provided for\" under \u00a7 9 included the salaries of PTO attorneys and paralegals who engaged in litigation on the agency 's behalf. \u00a7 9, 5 Stat. at 121 (emphasis added); see id. \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, 5 Stat. at 117 -18 (creating roles for Commissioner of Patents, Chief Clerk of Patent Office, an examining clerk, and two \"other\" clerks). Accordingly, \u00a7 9 at most supports the idea that \"expenses\" can be broad enough to cover salaries of some PTO employee s in an unrelated context. But, even then, Congress felt it necessary to expressly enumerate \"salaries of the officers and clerks\" in addition to \"all other expenses,\" demonstrating again that the ordinary meaning of expenses does not include attorney sal aries. Both the dissent and the PTO contend that it would not make sense for Congress to use the phrase \"attor- neys ' fees\" in the context of \u00a7 145 actions because it is more accurate to classify the salaries of the PTO 's at- torneys as personnel \"expenses.\" Appellant Br. 42; Dis - sent Op. 8. In light of other statutes providing for the government 's recoupment of attorneys ' fees, as opposed to personnel expenses, in enforcement actions, we do not find this argument convincing. See, e.g. , 42 U.S.C. 34a \u00a7 7413(d)(5) (\"Any person who fails to pay on a timely basis a civil penalty ordered or assessed under this sec- tion shall be required to pay . . . the United States enforcement expenses, including but not limited to at- torneys fees and costs incurred by the United States for collection proceedings . . . . \"); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(g)(9) (similar). from the trademark analogue at issue in Shammas , the PTO did not identify a single statute that awards to the government prorated portions of its attorn eys' salaries without using the phrase \"attor- neys ' fees.\" Finally, the PTO and the dissent paint \u00a7 145 actions as a scourge on other patent applicants. Appellant Br. 21-25; Dissent Op. 12, 17 -18. They claim it is unfair to burden all applicants with the additional costs caused by those who voluntarily initiate \u00a7 145 proceedings. But this policy debate on the value of \u00a7 145 actions is best left for Congress. And, as various amici indicate, Congress already addressed the debate by rebuffing an attempt to repeal \u00a7 145. Br. of Amici Curiae Intellec- tual Prop. of Amici Curiae Ass'n of Amicus Counsel 14. In any event, the dis- sent 's concerns appear to us exaggerated. A back -of- the-envelope calculation elucidates the minuscule im- pact of these proceedings on the overall cost of a patent application. Although neither party could provide an exact tally of the \u00a7 145 proceedings, at the panel stage the PTO estimated that there were four to five of these proceedings in the last three years. See Oral Arg. at 19:19 -20:10, http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/ default.aspx?fl=2016 -1794.mp3. If we were to take a conservative estimate of ten \u00a7 145 actions per year (five times the rate estimated by the PTO) and assume that the PTO expended $100,000 in attorneys ' fees defend-35a ing each action ($20,000 more than the amount the PTO incurred in this case), the total expense for fiscal year 2018 would be $1 million. The PTO estimates that it will receive more than 627,000 patent applications during this same time period. See U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Fiscal Year 2018 Congressional Justification 11 (2017), https://www.uspto.gov/sites/ default/files/documents/fy18pbr.pdf. When spread amongst the 627,000+ applications, the $1 million price tag amounts to less than $1.60 per application. V The general rule in the United States is that each party pays for its own attorneys. To deviate from the status quo embodied in the American Rule, Congress must draft legislation \u2014\"specific and explicit\" le gislation \u2014demonstrating its intent to make the award of attor- neys ' fees available under that statute. Awarding \"[a]ll the expenses\" simply cannot supply the \"specific and explicit\" directive from Congress to shift attorneys ' fees, and nothing else in the statute evinces congressional intent to make them available. Other than Shammas 's interpretation of the trademark analogue, we are not aware of any statute requiring a private litigant to pay the government 's attorneys ' fees without regard to the party 's success in the litigation. We are unwilling to \"invade the legislature 's province by redistributing litiga- tion costs\" in a way that would create such an anomalous statute here. See Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U.S. at 271. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. AFFIRMED COSTS Costs to Appellee. 36a UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT 2016 -1794 NANTKWEST , INC., PLAINTIFF -APPELLEE v. ANDREI IANCU , UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE , DEFENDANT -APPELLANT Filed: July 27, 2018 Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in No. 1:13 -cv-01566 -GBL -TCB, Judge Gerald Bruce Lee PROST Judge , dissenting, with whom DYK, REYNA , and HUGHES , Circuit Judges , join. The question for the en banc court is whether 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145, which provides that \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant,\" requires the applicant to pay all the expenses of the proceedings, including the PTO 's personnel expenses, or just some of the expenses. When Congress said, \"[a]ll the expenses,\" I believe it meant all the expenses. The Fourth Circuit agrees. Shammas v. Focarino , 784 F.3d 219 (4th Cir. 2015), cert. denied nom. Shammas v. Hirshfeld , 136 S. Ct. 1376 (2016). The ma- jority opinion creates an unfortunate and unnecessary conflict between the circuits. I respectfully dissent. 37a I When electing to pursue its \u00a7 145 ac tion, NantKwest, a disappointed patent applicant, had two options for judicial review of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board 's decision. See Kappos v. Hyatt , 566 U.S. 431, 434 (2012). NantKwest could have \"either: (1) ap peal[ed] the deci- sion directly to [ this court], pursuant to \u00a7 141; or (2) file[d] a civil action against the Director of the PTO in the United States District Court for the [Eastern District of Virginia] pursuant to \u00a7 145.\" Id. at 434 & n.1. Litigation in district court is expensive and time - consuming, much more so than direct appeals to this court limited to the administrative record. Section 145, unlike \u00a7 141, requires the applicant to pay \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings,\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145, F.3d 1320, 1337 2010) aff'd and re- manded , 566 U.S. 431 (2012). Section 145 actions are also uncommon. Id. (noting that \"the vast majority of applicants pursue an on -the-record appeal [under \u00a7 141] instead of a \u00a7 145 action\"). In defending the \u00a7 145 proceedings initiated by NantKwest, the PTO incurred expenses for expert wit - nesses and personnel expenses \u2014that is, the expense of diverting agency attorneys and paralegals from other matters to this \u00a7 145 action. The dist rict court or- dered NantKwest to reimburse the agency 's expenses for its expert witness but not its personnel. The par- ties do not dispute that \"[a]ll the expenses of the pro- ceedings\" includes the PTO 's expert witness expenses. On appeal, the PTO seeks rei mbursement under \u00a7 145 for personnel expenses it incurred. 38a II I start, as I must, with the language of the statute. E.g., United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc. , 489 U.S. 235, 241 (1989). And its plain text provides our an- swer. See SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu , 138 1348, 1354 (2018). When \u00a7 145 says \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceeding s shall be paid by the applicant\" it means the applicant must pay all the expenses of the proceedings. \"Absent persuasive indications to the contrary, we presume Co ngress says what it means and means what it says.\" Simmons v. Himmelreich , 136 S. Ct. 1843, 1848 (2016). Here, neither the major- ity opinion nor NantKwest 's arguments give me any reason to doubt what I see as the plain -text result in this case. Id. A Initially, I note that the PTO did not retain outside counsel to assist in defending this \u00a7 145 action. In- stead, it used its salaried government lawyers. These lawyers incurred expenses because the time they de- voted to this case was not available for other work. See Wis. v. Hotline Indus., Inc. , 236 F.3d 363, 365 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"[S]alaried government lawyers, like in-house and non -profit counsel, do incur expenses if the time and resources they devote to one case are not available for other work.\"). Additionally, the PTO is not seeking reimbursement for its lawyers ' time at market rate. Rather, the PTO seeks personnel ex- penses it actually incurred in these proceedings. Compare J.A. 83 -84 (the PTO 's request for the actual expenses it incurred in this \u00a7 145 action by calculating a proportional share of its attorneys ' salaries (citing Hotline Indus. , 236 F.3d at 368)), with, e.g. , 39a Fed. Bureau of Prisons , 222 F.3d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (\"[A] nonprofit legal services organization is enti- tled to receive a prevailing market rate pursuant to a statute that authorizes the prevailing party to be award- ed 'a reasonable attorney[s '] fee as part of the cost. '\" (citing Blum v. Stenson , 465 U.S. 886, 894 -96 (1984)). Thus, the question in this case is whether \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" includes the personnel ex- penses the PTO actually incurred for attorneys in de- fending these \u00a7 145 proceedings. I conclude that it does. B To determine whether the phrase \"[a]ll the expenses\" includes the PTO 's personnel expenses, I first look to the meaning of \"expenses.\" Although the statute does not expressly define that term, the Patent Act of 1836 did use the term \"expenses\" in a provision dis cussing application fees. That provision, which was retained when Congress added the expense -reimbursement lan- guage in 1839, read in relevant part: [T]he applicant shall pay into the Treasury of the United States, or into the Patent Office, or into any of the deposite banks to the credit of the Treasury . . . the sum of thirty dollars. . . . And the moneys received into the Treasury under this act shall constitute a fund for the payment of the sala- ries of the officers and clerks herein provided for, and all other expenses of the Patent Office , and to be called th e patent fund. Patent Act of 1836, ch. 357, \u00a7 9, 5 Stat. 117, 121 (em- phasis added). Congress understood \"salaries of the officers and clerks\" as one kind of \"expense.\" To be sure, there is a difference between \"expenses of the 40a Patent Office\" and \"expenses of the proceedings,\" but the point is that Congress, at the time it enacted the precursor to \u00a7 145, understood salaries to be within the scope of \"expenses.\" When a term goes undefined in a statute, we give the term its ordinary meaning. Taniguc hi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd. , 566 U.S. 560, 566 (2012). The or- dinary mean ing of \"expenses\" encompasses expendi- tures for personnel. Dictionaries in use when Con- gress enacted \u00a7 145 's precursor generally defined \"ex- penses\" as an expenditure of money, time, l abor, or resources. For example, in 1830 \"expense\" was de- fined as \"1. [a] laying out or expending; the disburs- ing of money, or the employment and consumption, as of time or labor .\" Noah Webster, An American Dic- tionary of the English Language 319 (3d ed. 1830) (emphasis added). The majority points to other 1830s dictionary definitions, which defined \"expense\" as \"cost; charges; money J.E. Worcester, A Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dic- tionary of the English Language, with Pronouncin g Vocabularies of Classical and Scripture Proper Names 117 (1830), and as \"the disbursing of money,\" \"2. is used, em- ployed, laid out or consumed,\" Noah Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 319 (3d ed. 1830). Based on these definitions, I agree with the government that the ordinary or common meaning of \"expenses\" includes personnel expenditures. It also includes out -of-pocket attorneys ' fees. Although the PTO did not retain outside counsel in this case, the statute 's history suggests that Congress intended \"expenses\" to also include attorneys ' fees for 41a the PTO 's retained outside counsel. At the time the expense -reimbursement provision appeared, proceed- ings in equity seem to have been quite rare. And when they occurred, it seems that the PTO incurred the expense of employing outside counsel. This con- clusion is drawn from the Report of the Commissioner of Patents for the Year 1845, in which the Commis- sioner explained that \"[t]wo suits in equity are now pending against the Commissioner in the circuit court for the district of Pennsylvania, in which, as it has not been necessary for me to attend, I have employed counsel.\" REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS FOR THE YEAR 1845, H. Doc. No. 29 -140, at 8 (1st Sess. 1846). The plain and ordinary meaning that the Supreme Court has ascribed to the word \"expenses\" comports with my reading of the dictionary definitions cited above. For example, the Court has recognized that \"expenses\" (as compared t o taxable costs) contem- plates the full range of expenditures a party must make in litigation (including attorneys). Taniguchi , 566 U.S. at 573 (\"Taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consultants, and investigators.\"). In other words, the Supreme Court has told us that the plain and ordinary meaning of the word \"expenses\" in the litigation con- text includes those incurred for attorneys. Although NantKwest and the majority do not deny that \"expenses\" is broad enough to cover the PTO 's per- sonnel expenses, they contend that the term \"is merely capable of implicitly covering attorneys ' fees\" and \"is at best ambiguous as to attorneys ' fees.\" Majority Op. 17. As support, NantKwest and the majority rely on 42a other federal statutes under various titles where Con- gress has employed the term \"expenses\" to authorize attorneys ' fees either in addition to expenses (e.g., \"ex - penses and attorneys ' fees\"), or as a component of them (e.g., \"expenses including attorneys ' fees\") .1 The majority contends that \"[t]hese statutes demonstrate Congress 's understanding that the ordinary meaning of 'expenses ' does not include attorneys ' fees.\" Majority Op. 18. Certainly, \"a definition [being] broad enough to en- compass one sense of a word does not establish that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense.\" Taniguchi , 566 U.S. at 568. But even if I were to agree with NantKwest and the majority 's characteriza- tion of what \"expenses\" ordinarily means, here t he statutory context in which \"expenses\" appears indi- cates that it includes personnel expenditures for attor- neys. See id. at 569 (observing that the context in which a word appears may over -override the word 's ordinary meaning). As noted, the word \"expenses\" 1 When the Supreme Court examines the \"record of statutory usage\" it focuses on contemporaneous statutes. See W. Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey , 499 U.S. 83, 88 (1991) (reviewing statutes en - acted the same year as the statute at issue, and in one case a stat- ute enacted \"just over a week prior\"); see also id. at 88 -89 & n.4 (revie wing statutes enacted within a few years of the statute at issue). The majority acknowledges that its cited statutes were not enacted contemporaneously with Congress 's enactment of \u00a7 145 's precursor, so it points to an 1867 statute that distinguishes betw een an individual attorney 's fees and his or her expenses. Majority Op. 19 n.4. This distinction hardly suggests that \"[a]ll the expens es of the proceedings\" does not include the PTO 's personnel expenses. Regardless, my point is that because statutory i nterpre tation de- pends very much on context, I would not assign the same probative value to unrelated, later -enacted statutes as does the ma jority. 43a showed up one other time in the Patent Act of 1836 \u2014 where the Act expressly characterized the salaries of PTO officers and clerks as \"expenses.\" Patent Act of 1836, ch. 357, \u00a7 9, 5 Stat. 117, 121. The majority addresses the statutory conte xt by pointing to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285, which provides that \"[t]he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable at- torney fees to the prevailing party.\" The majority sug - gests that because this provision of the Patent Act spe- cifically mentions attorneys ' fees, Congress must have intended to exclude them from \"expenses\" in \u00a7 145. Majority Op. 22 -24. I disagree. First, Congress intended a broader compensation scheme under \u00a7 145 than under \u00a7 285. Compare \u00a7 145 (\"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\"), with \u00a7 285 (\"reasonable attorneys ' fees\"). For example, NantKwest does not contest that the language of \u00a7 145 includes the PTO 's expert witness expenses. In \u00a7 285, Congress chose not to award all the expenses to the prevailing party, but only attorneys ' fees. Congress can cer- tainly employ a broad word over other narrower alter- natives if it so chooses. Second, as salaried employees, the PTO 's attorneys do not bill individual hours for their work, nor do they collect fees from those whom they represent. In thi s context, the overhead associated with the PTO 's attor- neys ' work is more aptly characterized as an \"expense\" to the PTO than a \"fee.\" Compare Expense , Black 's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"expense\" as \"expenditure[s] of money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a result\"), with Attorney 's fee , Black 's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"attorney 's fee\" as \"[t]he charge to a client for services performed for the 44a client, such as an hourly fee, a flat fee, or a contingent fee\"). I would not require Congress to mimic \u00a7 285 and use the phrase \"attorneys ' fees\" when, in this con- text, \"expenses\" is the more apt term. Third, the \u00a7 145 and \u00a7 285 provisions are implicated in different settings. Section 285 arises in traditional patent litigation, and authorizes a district court to award attorneys ' fees to the prevailing party. See Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. , 134 S. Ct. 1749, 1752 (2014). In contrast, \u00a7 145 pro- ceedings are, \"in fact and necessarily, a part of th e application for the patent.\" Gandy v. Marble , 122 U.S. 432, 439 (1887). The \"[a]ll the expenses\" contem - plated by \u00a7 145 are a direct counterpart to the ap - plication fees that are designed to reimburse the PTO 's examination expenses \u2014application fees that, like the \"[a]ll the expenses\" of \u00a7 145, the applicant must pay re- gardless of whether it receives a patent. Congress 's use of different phrases theref ore makes sense in these differ ent settings. And Congress 's choice to depart from the model of a r elated statute is a choice we may not disregard.2 SAS Inst. , 138 S. Ct. at 1355. 2 The majority proposes that Congress should have amended \u00a7 145 to include the \"attorneys ' fees\" language when it amended the Patent Act in 1946 to permit the \"award [of ] reasonable attorney 's fees to the prevailing party\" in infringement actions (i.e., the pre- cursor to \u00a7 285). Majority Op. 24 n.7 (quoting Patent Act of 1946, ch. 726, 60 Stat. 778, 778 (emph asis added)). In other words, the majority would require Congress to review and amend \u00a7 145, its already -clear expense -reimbursement statute, so as to make it ex - tra clear. This just can 't be right. Especially not when, as I have detailed, the statutes are implicated in different settings and inten - tionally provide for compensation schemes of varying breadth. The majority seems to infer that because Congress added other 45a But I need not rely on the word \"expenses\" alone. Congress did not simply provide for \"expenses of the pro- ceedings\" in \u00a7 145 \u2014it clarified that it was requiring the applican t to pay \" [a]ll the expenses of the proceedings.\" The majority maintains that \"the word 'all' sheds no light on the breadth of 'expenses, '\" and reasons that \"all\" \"serves only to clarify that, whatever the 'expens- es' are, all of them must be paid by the applicant.\" Majority Op. 30. I disagree. Such an interpretation leaves little work for \"all\" to do; simply saying \"the expenses\" would seem to do just as well. While this latter, more limited phrasing would still not exp licate the breadth of \"expenses,\" neither would it, by itself, provide a basis for excluding anything properly re- garded as an \"expense.\" In my view, Congress used the word \"all\" to broadly and comprehensively capture anything fairly regarded as an \"expens e,\" resolving any lingering doubt in favor of inclusion. The majority acknowledges that the term \"expenses\" is capable of including attorneys ' fees and cites to several statutes that list attorneys ' fees as part of expenses. Majority Op. 20 -21 (citing te n such statutes). In \u00a7 145, Con- gress 's use of the word \"all\" indicated its desire to broadly and comprehensively include all of the expens - es as it commonly understood them, which includes the personnel expenses the PTO incurs in defending \u00a7 145 actions. statutory provisions (which arise in different circumstances), that it necessarily i ntended to not provide for the PTO 's personnel ex- penses in those provisions it did not amend. This inference is far too attenuated to have any persuasive force. 46a C Both the legislative history and the purpose of \u00a7 145 support my reading of the statutory text and context. The majority questions the relevance of legislative history in interpreting fee statutes. Majority Op. 30-31. I note, however, that the Supreme Court has examined legislative history in cases implicating fee - shifting and the American Rule. E.g., Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club , 463 U.S. 680, 686 -91 (1983); Summit Val- of ters & Joiners of Am. , 456 U.S. 717, 723 -24 (1982). Consideration of the history of \u00a7 145 suggests that Congress intended \"expenses\" to capture broadly, not narrowly. As the parties have noted, the \"expenses\" provision arose (in slightly different form) in the 1839 Amendments to the Patent Act, which provided that an applicant bringing a proceeding in equity to contest an adverse decision of the Patent Office would be required to pay \"the whole of the expenses of the proceeding . . . whether the final decision shall be in his fa vor or otherwise.\" Patent Act of 1839, ch. 88, \u00a7 10, 5 Stat. 353, 354. When Congress revised the Patent Act in 1870, it used expense -reimbursement language very similar to the language used in the previously enacted 1839 stat- ute. Initial versions of the House bill sought to limit the reimbursement provision by using the word \"costs\" instead of \"expenses\" and by limiting any reimburse- ment to $25. But these changes were rejected and the word \"expenses\" was retained. The version of the bill reported in the House and referred to the Senate read, in relevant part: 47a SEC. 52. And be it further enacted, That when the Commissioner of Patents is the only defendant in any such suit, all costs shall be paid by the com- plainant , and whole amount of costs taxed against the complainant shall not exceed the sum of twenty - five doll ars. . . . H.R. 1714, 41st the S. Com- mittee on Patents, Apr. 25, 1870) (emphasis added). The Senate made significant amendments to the bill, including changing Section 52 to use \"expenses\" rather than \"costs\" and by removing the $25 cap. The ver- sion passed by the Senate read, in relevant part: SEC. 52. And be it further enacted, That whenev- er a patent on application is refused, for any reason whatever, either b y the Commissioner or by the su- preme court of the District of Columbia upon appeal from the Commissioner, the applicant may have remedy by bill in equity; . . . . And in all cases where there is no opposing party a copy of the bill shall be served on th e Commissioner, and all the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the ap- plicant, whether the final decision is in his favor or not. H.R. 1714, 41st Cong. \u00a7 52 (as amended by the Senate, May 31, 1870) (emphasis added). The House disa- greed with the Se nate amendments and asked for a conference. Ultimately, the House members dropped their objections to the Senate amendments to \u00a7 52, and the enacted version reflected the Senate 's version us ing the word \"expenses.\" This demonstrates \u2014or at least strongly suggests \u2014that Congress specifically intended that \"expenses\" be broader than \"costs.\" 48a The statute 's purpose also confirms that Congress intended all of the expenses associated with \u00a7 145 pro- ceedings to be borne by the applicants who elect them \u2014not by taxpayers or other PTO users whose fees fund the agency 's operations. Section 145 proceedings are an optional extension of the application process. See Gandy , 122 U.S. at 439 -40 (referring to \u00a7 145 's precur- sor as \"in fact and necessarily, a part of the appl ication for the patent\" and \"clearly a branch of the application for the patent\"). And litigation in district court is ex - pensive and time -consuming, much more so than the direct appeals limited to the administrative record also available to disappointed applicants. Proceedings un - der \u00a7 145 force the PTO and its employees to dedicate time and effort to conducting discovery, interviewing witnesses, filing and responding to motions, and ad- dressing new evidence. PTO 's En Banc Br. 22. Indeed, even in 1838, Congress was aware that pro- ceedings in equity were adding to the Patent Office 's expenses \u2014including labor expenses. H.R. Rep. No. 25-797, at 3 (1838) (discussing the 1839 Act). A letter from the Commissioner of Patents annexed to the House Report stated: The judicial decisions on interfering applications, subsequent to the examination, on application, will, both in number and importance, exceed all the pa- tent cases before the United States courts. On the first of January three cases were pending a hearin g, valued at upwards of $100,000 each. The evidence is voluminous, and the arguments often lengthy. The subject of appeals is beginning to add consid- erably to the labor of the office , and the litigated cases demand many long copies. 49a Id. (emphasis added). An applicant 's choice to proceed under \u00a7 145 diverts the agency 's resources from the PTO 's principal mission of examining patent and trademark applications at the agency. The purpose of \u00a7 145 's expense -reimbursement provision is to ensure that the se expenses fall on the applicants who elect the more expensive district court proceedings over the standard appeal route. III The majority concludes that the text of \u00a7 145 fails to provide the necessary congressional directive to over- come the American Rul e's bar against shifting attor- neys ' fees. Under the American Rule, \"the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys ' fee from the loser.\" Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975). Cour ts uniformly recognize an exception to this general proposition, however: when the statute itself \"specif- ic[ally]\" and \"explicit[ly]\" authorizes an award of fees, the prevailing party may be entitled to collect its fees. Alyeska , 421 U.S. at 260. I note that the Fourth Circuit reviewed 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b)(3), which contains language nearly identical to the relevant language in \u00a7 145, and concluded that the statute is \"not a fee -shifting statute that operates against the backdrop of the American Rule\" bec ause it \"mandates the payment of attorneys[ '] fees without re - gard to a party 's success.\" Shammas , 784 F.3d at 223. While I assume that the American Rule applies here, I share the Fourth Circuit 's doubt that the Rule applies in this context \u2014i.e., where C ongress has simply as- signed payment responsibility to the applicant, con-50a sistent with the various other application -related fees Congress has assigned to the applicant. But even assuming the American Rule applies here, I still disagree with the majority 's analysis. For ex- ample, the majority attempts to create ambiguity by focusing on the word \"expenses\" in a vacuum. But, as I've discussed, Congress did not simply provide that under \u00a7 145 an applicant pays \"expenses.\" Nor did it say \"may pay\" or something that could be less than \"all.\" Congress said that the applicant \"shall\" pay \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings.\" It is also well established that \"[t]he absence of spe- cific reference to attorney[s '] fees is not dispositive if the statute otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees.\" Key Tronic Corp. v. United States , 511 U.S. 809, 815 (1994). Although the majority gives lip service to this principle, as a practical matter, it still seems to require a statute 's use of the magic words \"attorneys ' fees\" to meet the American Rule 's height- ened demands.3 For example, the majority spends pages contrasting \u00a7 145 unfavorably with other statutes that explicitly mention attorneys ' fees. Majority Op. 18-24. It further cites a C ongressional Research 3 When asked during oral argument to propose other language that Congress could have employed to overcome the American Rule, NantKwest offered \"including, without limitation, the time spent by lawyers working on the particular matter from the Solicitor 's office . . . and outside counsel\" or \"persons providing lawyer services who are hired internally or externally by the Patent Office\" as the only alternatives. Oral Argument No. 2016 -1794 (Mar. 8, 2018) 40:45 -41:23, 43:57 -44:05, http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral -argument - recordings. I do not believe the American Rule requires such la - bore d descriptions, when \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" suffices in this context. 51a Service Report compiling the text of other fee -shifting statutes. The majority notes that each of these stat- utes recites either the magic words \"attorneys ' fees,\" or the (slightly) the like. Majority Op. 29 n.8. But again, the absence of \"attorneys ' fees\" is not dispositive. In making clear that \"[t]he absence of specific reference to attorney[s '] fees is not dispositive if the statute otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees,\" the Supreme Court pointed to an Eighth Circuit decision, stating that \"[t]he Eighth Circuit, for example, found 'a sufficient degree of explicitness ' in [the Act 's] references to 'necessary cos ts of response ' and 'enforcement activities ' to warrant the award of attorney[s '] fees and expenses.\" Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 815. The Court then contrasted these sufficiently explicit phrases with \"[m]ere 'generalized commands, ' . . . [which would] suffice to authorize such fees.\" Id. Surely, \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" is just as, if not more, explicit than \"necessary costs of response\" or \"enforcement activities\" in reference to personnel expenses. In sum, contrary to the majority 's views, the lan- guage of \u00a7 145 evinces Congress 's \"specific and explic- it\" intent to depart from the American Rule and to im - pose upon the applicant payment of all the expenses of the proceedings, including the PTO 's personnel expenses. IV The majority also references certain policy justifica- tions for its interpretation of \u00a7 145. First, the major- ity cites the access -to-justice concern underlying the 52a American Rule. Majority Op. 6. I am unconvinced that these disappointed applicants ' access to justice is lacking. Applicants have the option to forgo \u00a7 145 ac - tions altogether and pursue appeals before this court under \u00a7 141 \u2014a choice the overwhelming majority of applicants make. See Hyatt , 625 F.3d at 1337 (ob- serving that \"the vast pursu e an on-the-record appeal [under \u00a7 141] instead of a \u00a7 145 action\"). These disappointed applicants only reach the point of electing a \u00a7 145 action after an extended application examination process before the PTO. A patent examiner first determines whethe r the applica- tion satisfies the statutory prerequisites for granting a patent. Kappos , 566 U.S. at 434 (citing 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 131). If the examiner denies the application, the applicant may then file an administrative appeal with the PTO 's Patent Trial and Appeal Board. See id. If the Board also denies the application, only then is the disappointed applicant faced with electing between an appeal under \u00a7 141 or a \u00a7 145 action. Id. Second, and relatedly, the majority expresses spe- cial solicitude for \"small businesses and individual inventors,\" Majority Op. 6 -7, presumably because they may be less able to afford the PTO 's personnel expenses. This possibility is entirely speculative. And, even if it were always the case, it is of no moment. \"Our unwill- ingness to soften the import of Congress '[s] chosen words even if we believe the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding.\" Baker Botts L.L.P. v. ASARCO (2015) (quoting Lamie v. United States Tr. , 540 U.S. 526, 538 (2004)). While I do not deny that the PTO 's personnel ex- penses may, in some cases, amount to substantial sums, 53a it is important to view these amounts against those expenses that applicants must undisputedly pay if they elect a \u00a7 145 action. For example , the parties do not dispute that \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" in- cludes the PTO 's expert witness expenses. In Booking. com B.V. v. Matal , aside from the $51,472.53 in person - nel expenses, the applicant was required to pay $21,750 in expert witness expenses. No. 1:16 -CV-425, 2017 2017). In Realvirt, LLC v. Lee , the expert witness expenses amounted to more than the $48,454.62 in PTO person- nel expenses, costing the applicant $50,160. 220 F. Supp. 3d 695, 704 (E.D. Va. 2016). Finally, in Taylor v. Lee , the court made it clear that the PTO 's motion for the $40,000 bond cited by the ma jority should be granted, even if the PTO 's $45,000 in personnel expenses were not included because the other anticipated expenses, including expert witness expenses, were reasonably expected to exceed $40,000. No. 1:15 -CV-1607, 2016 WL 9308420, at *2 n.1 (E.D. Va. July 12, 2016). Further, unless the applicant is proceeding pro se, it is of course quite likely th at its own attorneys ' fees would vastly exceed the PTO 's personnel expenses.4 Indeed, I wonder who the majority seeks to protect: the hypothetical applicant who would pay its own at- torneys and the PTO 's expert witness expenses, yet balk at the PTO 's pers onnel expenses. 4 For example, in this case, the PTO 's calculations indicated that its attorneys earned only $78.55 per hour, yet the district court has authorized a range of rates for private attorneys between $300 and $600 per hour. J.A. 84 & n.7 (citing Tech Sys., Inc. v. No. 1:12-CV-374, 2013 WL 4033650, at *7 (E.D. Va. Aug. 6, 2013)). 54a And while it may be true that the PTO 's personnel expenses in some cases might amount to a significant sum for applicants who choose to proceed down the optional \u00a7 145 route, those expenses have to be paid by someone. As the PTO observes, at Congress 's direc- tion, the PTO now must operate entirely as a user - funded agency. PTO 's En Banc Br. 23. All appli- cants pay a number of fees throughout the patent - examination process to cover the PTO 's expenses of operation. Id. at 24. Thus, in asking this court to ex - clude personnel expenses from \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings,\" NantKwest asks this court to require other PTO applicants to pay the PTO 's personnel ex- penses incurred in response to its \u00a7 145 complaint, rather than NantKwest itself. This contravenes Con- gress 's intent. The statutory language is clear: it is the applicant that voluntarily chooses a \u00a7 145 action, and not other PTO users, who must pay \"[a]ll the ex- penses of the proceedings.\" Thus, the question of the equitable allocation of burdens is one that Congress has already addressed in the language of the statute. It is not this court 's job to allocate those burdens dif- ferently based on our own policy preferences. Finally, much is made of the fact that the PTO re- fraine d from seeking reimbursement for its personnel expenses until recently, despite the provision 's 170 -year existence. Notably, however, while the PTO has his- torically refrained from seeking reimbursement of these expenses, it has never affirmatively disclaimed that authority. Given how dramatically the patent and litigation landscapes have changed since the provision was first enacted, it is hardly surprising that the PTO would have felt compelled in recent years to change its strategy. The PTO 's pa st decisions to not seek reim-55a bursement for its personnel expenses may be related to the fact that it is so rarely confronted by these cases. The PTO now points, however, to how \u00a7 145 proceed- ings have become more common and more expensive. PTO 's En Banc B r. 30. Accordingly, the PTO has be - come increasingly reluctant to require other PTO users to subsidize the expenses of these optional proceedings, in light of Congress 's mandate that the PTO fund itself exclusively through fees. Even within the more rigor ous administrative rule- making environment, \"[a]gencies are free to change their existing policies as long as they provide a rea- soned explanation for the change.\" Encino , 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016). Further, even where longstanding policies may have engendered reliance interests, an agency may still change its position as long as it shows that there are good reasons for the new policy. Id. at 2126. The PTO has done so here. * * * Because Congress meant all the expenses of the proceedings when it said \"[a]ll the expenses of the pro - ceedings,\" I respectfully dissent. 56a APPENDIX B UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT 2016 -1794 NANTKWEST , INC., PLAINTIFF -APPELLEE v.

Nantkwest, Inc. appeals from a decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granting -in-part and denying -in-part the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") Direc- tor's motion for fees. In its order, the district court 57a granted the Director 's requested witness ' fees but de- nied the requested attorneys ' fees. The Director ap - peals the court 's denial of attorneys ' fees. We reverse. I In 2001, Dr. Hans Klingemann filed a patent appli- cation directed to a method of treating cancer by ad- ministering natural killer cells. After several years of examination, the USPTO rejected Dr. Klingemann 's application on obviousness grounds. The Patent and Trial Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") affirmed the examiner 's rejection and Nantkwest, as assignee of the application, appealed to the district court under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. We have provided a summary of the technology and the proceedings at the USPTO and district court in Nantkwest 's companion appeal. Nantkwest, Inc. v. Michelle K. Lee , No. 2015 -2095, slip op. at 2 -5 (Fed. Cir. May 3, 2017) . Section 145 provides that an applicant dissatisfied with the PTAB 's decision may appeal directly to the United St ates District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in lieu of immediate appeal to this court. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. The statute further provides that the applicant must pay \"[a]ll of the expenses of the pro- ceeding,\" id., \"regardless of the outcome,\" Hyatt v. Kappos , F.3d and remanded , 132 S. Ct. 1690 (2012). After prevailing at the district court on the merits, the Di- rector filed a motion to recover $111,696.39 of the USPTO 's fees under the \u00a7 145 expense provision. See 58a J.A. 84 (seeking $78,592.50 in attorneys ' fees (including paralegal fees) and $33,103.89 in expert fees).1 Although the district court granted the USPTO 's expert fees, it denied its requested attorneys ' fees, cit- ing the \"American R ule.\" J.A. 10 -11. Under this Rule, litigants pay their own attorneys ' fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise. Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co. , 560 U.S. 242, 252 -53 (2010). Applying this Rule, the court found that in order to recover these fees, \"[d]efendants must be able to articulate a statutory provision that clearly and ex - plicitly allows them to recovery attorneys ' fees from Plaintiff.\" J.A. 3 -4. The district court concluded that the \"[a]ll expenses\" provision of the statute was neither sufficiently specific nor explicit enough for the author- ization of attorneys ' fees under this Rule. Id. On ap - peal, the Director argues that the district court erred by excluding the USPTO 's attorneys ' fees under \u00a7 145. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4)(C). II The principal issue on appeal is whether \u00a7 145 's \"[a]ll expenses of the proceedings\" provision authorizes an award of the USPTO 's attorneys ' fees under this section.2 1 To arrive at this value, the USPTO calculated the pro-rata share of the salaries of the two attorneys and one paralegal who worked on the appeal. J.A. 83 -84. Nantkwest did not challenge the number of hours expended or the pro -rata share of salaries the USPTO proffered at the district court. J.A. 138 -40. 2 Throughout its briefing, the Dir ector routinely refers to these attorneys ' fees as \"personnel expenses.\" See, e.g. , Appellant 's Br. 3. Because there is no genuine dispute that the terms \"personnel ex - 59a We review a district court 's interp retation of a stat- ute de novo. Weatherby v. 't of the Interior , 466 F.3d 1379, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2006). \"In construing a statute or regulation, we begin by inspecting its lan- guage for plain meaning.\" Meeks v. West , 216 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). In the absence of a definition of a term, courts give the words their \"ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\" Wil- liams v.

All the e xpenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant . Id. (emphasis added). At the outset, we observe that we have previously construed other portions of \u00a7 145. See, e.g., Hyatt , 625 F.3d at 1322. Although Hyatt resolved a different issue than the one presented here, we based our hold- ing, in part, on our recognition of the breath of the \"all expenses\" provision and the substantial financial bur- den that applicants must bear for initiating \u00a7 145 ap- peals. Id. at 1337. \"To deter applicants from exact ly the type of procedural gaming that concerns the Di- rector, Congress imposed on the applicant the heavy economic burden of paying '[a]ll the expenses of the penses\" and \"attorneys ' fees\" are interchangeable within the context of this appeal, we refer to them as \"attorneys ' fees\" throughout this opinion. 60a proceedings ' regardless of the outcome.\" Id. (altera- tion in original) (citing 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145). Put another way, Congress intended that all applicants uncondi- tionally assume this financial burden when seeking review directly in district court \u2014whether they win, or lose. We thus concluded that Congress drafted this provision without requiring any degree of success on the merits (much less a prevailing party) as a necessary precedent for shifting this \"heavy economic burden\" onto the applicant. Id. A Before determining whether \u00a7 145 authorizes an award of the USPTO 's attorneys ' fees, we first addre ss the government 's argument that the American Rule does not apply to these proceedings. Like the Fourth Circuit, we have substantial doubts that this provision even implicates this Rule. See Shammas v. Focarino , 784 F.3d 219, 223 (4th Cir. 2015), cert. denied sub nom. Shammas v. Hirshfeld , 136 S. Ct. 1376 (2016) (con- cluding that a nearly identical statutory provision gov- erning Trademark appeals (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b)(3)) does not \"operate[] against the backdrop of the Ameri- can Rule\" because that provision made no reference to prevailing parties). In response to the government 's arguments, Nantk - west relies on Baker Botts L.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC to support its position that the American Rule applies whenever a litigant seeks to recover attorneys ' fees. 135 S. Ct. 2158, 2164 (2015).3 Baker Botts , however, 3 In that case, although the statute made no reference to prevail- ing parties, Congress drafted the fees provision to apply exclusi vely to non -adversarial bankruptcy proceedings. Id. at 2163 -65. Nev- 61a does not stand for a general proposition that courts must apply the American Rule 's specific and explicit requirements to all fee statutes irrespective of a pre- vailing party as Nantkwest contends. Rather, it dem - onstrates that a statute must meet these requirements before a party may recover its fees when attempting to extend its reach to ancillary litigation Congress never intended. See id. at 2165. Nevertheless, despite our doubts as to the app licability of the American Rule here, we analyze \u00a7 145 's \"[a]ll expenses of the proceed- ing\" provision assuming the Rule applies, as we con- clude that even under this Rule, the expenses at issue here include the USPTO 's attorneys ' fees. B Under the American Rule, \"the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys ' fee from the loser.\" Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975). Courts uniformly recognize an exception to this general propo- sition, however: when the statute itself \"specific[ally]\" and \"explicit[ly]\" authorizes an award of fees, the pre- vailing party may be entitled to collect its fees. Id. at 260. In agreement with two other circuits, we con- clude that \"expenses\" here includes attorneys ' fees. See Shammas, 784 F.3d at 222 -23 (holding that the term \"expenses\" covers the USPTO 's attorneys ' fees); United States v. 110 -118 Riverside Tenants Corp. , 886 F.2d 514, 520 (2d Cir. 1989) (observing that attor- ertheless, Baker Botts used this provision as a basis to recover its fees for work it performed in a related, but adversarial, fee -defense litigation. Id. at 2166. By applying this stat ute to a proceeding Congress never contemplated in the first instance, Baker Botts effectively sought its fees in the absence of a fee statute altogether. 62a neys ' fees are \"expens es of the proceedings\" under \u00a7 6342 of the Internal Revenue Code).4 1 The definitions and explanations that standard legal dictionaries and treatises provide for the term \"ex- pense\" support this conclusion. Wright & Miller on Federal Practice and Procedur e, for example, defines this term as \"includ[ing] all the expenditures actually made by a litigant in connection with the action,\" in- cluding \"attorney 's fees.\" 10 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2666 (3d ed. 1998). Similarly, Black's Law Dictionary defines \"ex - penses\" as \"expenditure[s] of money, time, labor , or re - sources to accomplish a result.\" Black's Law Dictio - nary 698 (10th ed. 2014) (\" Black's\") (emphasis added). The dissent summarily dismisses these definitions, declaring that \"they are not contemporaneous with Congress 's introduction of the word 'expenses ' into the Patent Act in 1839.\" Dissenting Op. 14. Relying on Nineteenth Century dictionaries instead, the dissent concludes that \"the words 'expe nse,' 'cost, ' and 'dam- age' were considered synonymous around the time of the 1839 Amendments.\"5 Id. at 6. Not so. The Patent 4 The court in Riverside relied on the statutory language of this section 's \"expenses of the [foreclo sure] proceedings\" provision when awarding the Apartment Corporation its attorneys ' fees. See id. (\"The attorneys ' fees incurred . . . for selling the shares . . . are in the same category as expenses of foreclosure and sale pro- ceedings . . . . \"). 5 The dissent 's position here not only lacks support in the brief- ing, but also directly undermines the party 's position it purports to advance. Specifically, in arguing that \u00a7 145 does not include attor - neys ' fees, Nantkwest cited the same dictionary and definitions 63a Act of 1836 specifically distinguished among these three terms. Compare Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117, \u00a7 9 (\"[M]oneys received into the Treasury under this act shall constitute a fund for the payment of salaries of the officers and clerks herein provided for, and all other expenses of the Patent Office.\" (emphasis added)), with id. \u00a7 14 (\"[W]henever, in any action for damages for making, using, or selling the thing where- of the exclusive right is secured by any patent . . . , a verdict shall be rendered . . . , it shall be in the power of the court to render judgment for any sum above the amount found by s uch verdict as the actual damages sustained . . , not exceeding three times the amount thereof, according to the circumstances of the case, with costs .\" (emphases added)). The histori- cal statute that the dissent relies on simply does not support its c onclusion. If anything, this sta tute lends support to the majority 's position by expressly charac- terizing the salaries of USPTO officers and clerks and as \"expenses.\" Id. \u00a7 9. The Supreme Court has ob- served the distinction between \"expenses\" and \"costs\" recently, providing an interpretation that comports with the modern definitions that the dissent disregards. In Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd. , the Court recognized the distinction between costs and fees; de - termining that the term \"fees\" includes \"expenses borne by litigants for attorneys.\" 132 S. Ct. 1997, 2006 (2012). There, the Court distinguished \"expenses\" from the more limited term \"costs,\" which represent that the dissent now concludes bear no relevance to the interpreta- tion of this statute. See Appellee 's Br. 27 -28 (relying on the 2014 Black's Law Dictionary definition for the term, \"expense\"). 64a only a fraction of expenses, relying specifically on the 1998 W right & Miller treatise cited above. Although costs has an everyday meaning synony- mous with expenses, the concept of taxable costs . . . is more limited. . . . Taxable limited to relatively minor, incidental expenses[;] . . . such items as clerk fees, court reporter fees, expenses for printing and witnesses, expenses for exemplification and copies, docket fees, and com- pensation of court -appointed experts. . . . Taxa- ble costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consult- ants, and investigators . Id. at 2006 (emphasis added) (citations and quotation marks omitted). The Court provided this analysis in direct support of its holding that resolved the breadth of taxable costs under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. Id. at 2000, 2006. Notably, neither the dissent nor Nantkwest provide contrary authority where the Supreme Court has held that the term \"expenses\" categorically ex- cludes attorneys ' fees. Nantkwest argues here that the term \"expenses\" lacks the requisite specificity to overcome the pre- sumption of the American Rule that each party will pay its own attorneys ' fees. Although Nantkwest does not deny that this term supplies sufficient breath to cover the USPTO 's attorneys ' fees, it contends that the American R ule demands more. In particular, it ar- gues \"[o]n its own, the term 'expenses ' is ambiguous.\" Appellee 's Br. 32. As support, Nantkwest relies heav- ily on the fact that other federal statutes under various titles illustrate that Congress has employed the t erm \"expenses\" to authorize attorneys ' fees either in addi-65a tion to expenses (e.g., \"expenses and attorneys ' fees), or as a component of them (e.g., \"expenses including attorneys ' fees).6 In other words, the term \"expenses,\" Nantkwest contends, can either include or exclude attorneys ' fees depending on the statute and, thus, the term is \"far from clear.\" Appellee 's Br. 33. Review- ing the list of statutes that Nantkwest provides, how- ever, we conclude that Congress made clear that it meant to award attorneys ' fees under the broader term \"expenses\" within the context of these particular pro- ceedings. As noted above, the ordinary meaning as defined in dictionaries and the Supreme Court 's interpretation of this term lend significant weight to the conclusion that when Congress used the phrase \"all expenses,\" it meant to include attorneys ' fees. The fact that the dissent and Nantkwest compiled a list of statutory provisions for which Congress on occasion employed the term \"expenses\" to authorize attorneys ' fees in ad- 6 Nantkwest cites approximately twenty such stat utory provi- sions covering a wide range of areas of law including: bankruptcy, administrative procedure, judicial proceedings, and financial man- agement. Appellee 's Br. 32 -34. Some of these statutes list attor - neys ' fees in addition to expenses while othe rs list attorneys ' fees as part of expenses. Roughly fifty percent of those statutes cited do not support the Appellee 's view because they treat attorneys ' fees as part of expenses. Id. The fact that the remaining provi- sions support Nantkwest 's position is neither reliable nor signifi- cant within the context of \u00a7 145 proceedings. Similarly, the dis- sent provides its own list of federal statutes, more than half of which actually support the majority 's view as well. Dissenting Op. 7-9. Notably, neither th e dissent nor Nantkwest provide any indi - cation regarding which \u2014if any \u2014of these cited provisions Congress enacted prior to the Supreme Court 's creation of the \"explicit\" and \"specific\" criteria under the American Rule. 66a dition to expenses in other contexts cannot be suffi- cient to dislodge the reasonable and ordinary meaning of this term. This is especially true in the context of this particular statutory provision where Congress ex - plicitly authorized compensation for \"[a]ll expenses of the proceedings.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. At best, these ex - amples demonstrate that Congress will not confine it - self to a single word or phrase when referencing attor- neys ' fees. Yet under Nantkwest 's narrow view, a statute could not meet t he American Rule 's heightened demands without using the precise words \"attorneys ' fees\" or some equivalent. For example, when asked du - ring oral argument to propose other language that Con- gress could have employed to satisfy the American Rule, Nantkwest cited \"reasonable compensation of attorneys\" as the only alternative.7 The dissent shares this view, stating and restating that the statute cannot award at- torneys ' fees because Congress did not employ these exact words. See, e.g., Dissenting Op. 1 -2 (\"Section 145 neither mentions 'attorneys ' fees' nor reflects congres- sional intent to authorize them.\"); id. at 3 (\"The . . . \"). The Supreme Court, on the other hand, has provided other suitable alternatives without using any of these words. In Baker Botts for instance, the Court recog- nized the term \"litigation costs\" as one such example. 135 S. Ct. at 2164. Clearly, \"litigation costs\" does not include the phrase \"attorneys ' fees.\" Yet the dis sent offers little to justify its conflict with the Supreme 7 Oral Argument 12:42 -13:17, http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts. gov/mp3/2016 -1794.mp3. We perceive no practical difference be - tween \"attorneys ' fees\" and the \"reasonable compensation of attor - neys\" example Nantkwest provided. 67a Court 's conclusion that the use of the term \"litigation costs\" overcomes the American Rule. While a refer- ence to a \"prevailing party\" may \"usually\" appear in fee-shifting statutes, id., the Supre me Court has never suggested that such a reference is a requirement for fee shifting, contrary to what the dissent argues. See Dissenting Op. 9 -10 (\"Nothing in [\u00a7 145] confines the award of expenses to a prevailing party.\"). The law neither confines Congr ess to the use of any particular term or phrase to satisfy the American Rule 's specificity requirement nor requires that Con- gress employ the words, \"compensation,\" \"fee,\" or \"attorney\" to meet it. The term \"expenses,\" like \"liti - gation costs,\" is another example where Congress au - thorized fee awards without including the words \"fees\" or \"compensation\" in the statute. Nantkwest and the dissent simply demand too much. Our conclusion that this term authorizes the USPTO 's fee award is particularly important here in the context of \u00a7 145 's all expenses provision. This unique provision requires that applicants uniformly name the Director as defendant to their suits. In representing the USPTO 's interests, the Director relies on personnel from the Office of the Solicitor. See 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.40(b). These attorneys \u2014the Solicitor, his deputy, and associates \u2014 and supporting paralegals receive fixed salaries as compensation for their government work. As salaried employees, they do not bill individual hours for th eir work, nor do they collect fees from those whom they represent. In this context, we characterize the over- head associated with their work more precisely as an \"expense\" to the government than a \"fee.\" Compare Black's 698 (defining \"expense\" as \"expenditure[s] of 68a money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a re- sult\"), with Black 's 154 (defining \"attorney 's fee\" as \"[t]he charge to a client for services performed for the client, such as an hourly fee, a flat fee, or a contingent fee\"). Unde r the dissent and Nantkwest 's view, Con- gress must use the word \"fee\" instead for the USPTO to receive remuneration. We do not view the American Rule so narrowly. To conclude otherwise, our interpre- tation would force Congress into the untenable position of selecting a word that must be applied in an uncon- ventional and imprecise manner in the context of these unique proceedings.8 Given the Supreme Court 's construction of \"ex- penses,\" the guidance dictionary and treatises provide on this term, and the context in which Congress applied it, we conclude that the term \"expenses\" includes the USPTO 's attorneys ' fees under \u00a7 145. 8 Congress 's contrasting use of the term \"attorneys ' fees\" under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 provides further evidence to this point. There, Congress chose not to award all expenses to the prevailing party, but only attorneys ' fees. The dissent appears to ignore this distinc- tion, instead requiring that Congress recite the phrase \"attorneys ' fees\" to cover at least a subset of these \"expenses\" simply because other portions of Title 35 employ that phrase. Dissenting Op. 4 -5. Put another way, under the dissent 's view, Congress must rigidly employ a phrase such as \"attorn eys' fees and other expenses\" in place of the broader term \"expenses,\" which already includes these fees. Relying on a flawed premise, the dissent simply dismisses \u2014 even as a theory \u2014that Congress could have intended a broader compensation scheme under \u00a7 1 45 than \u00a7 285. Congress indisput - ably has the authority to employ a broad word over other narrower alternatives if it so chooses. And it may do so irrespective of how many times it amended other portions of Title 35 or employed nar - rower alternatives for other sections of the Code. 69a 2 Nantkwest makes an additional argument regarding whether the USPTO 's attorneys ' fees are \"expenses of the proceedings.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. It contends that this provision does not provide a basis for attorneys ' fees because the USPTO would have had to pay the portions of these full-time employees ' salaries regard- less of Nantkwest 's suit. We disagree. First, we have accorde d similar re- lief in the past in the context of other salaried attor- neys. In Raney v. Federal Bureau of Prisons , for ex - ample, we awarded salaried union attorneys an appor- tionment of their salaries because the litigation re- quired the lawyers to divert thei r time away from other pending matters. 222 F.3d 927, 935 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Second, our sister circuits have recognized the costs associated with these diversions and awarded fees to salaried employees as well. See, e.g. , Shammas , 784 F.3d at 223 (reco gnizing that the USPTO \"incurred expenses when its attorneys were required to defend the Director in the district court proceedings, because their engagement diverted the PTO 's resources from other endeavors\"); Wisconsin v. Hotline Indus., Inc. , 236 F.3d 3 63, 365 -66 (7th Cir. 2000) (holding that sala- ried government employees could recover their fees as they relate to the government 's opposition to an im- proper removal of a state court case). Section 145 proceedings similarly impact the USPTO 's resources. These costs are particularly relevant here, where the USPTO attributes over seventy percent of its total expenses ($78,592.50 of the $111,696.39) to attorneys ' fees. Nantkwest filed its appeal in district court and enjoyed the pro -applicant benefits of t hat 70a forum. See Hyatt , 625 F.3d at 1336 -37 (obtaining de novo review with the ability to introduce new evidence). Under Nantkwest 's view, the government 's recovery would be limited only to certain ad hoc expenses, e.g., printing, travel, expert witness co sts, Appellee 's Br. 35, while ignoring the vast majority of the expenses the USPTO incurred as the proximate cause of Nantkwest 's appeal. We cannot subscribe to this view. It cannot be credibly disputed that the USPTO ded- icated time and resources of its attorneys to the de- fense o f this litigation when it could have otherwise ap - plied those resources to other matters. Without ac- knowledging these concerns, Nantkwest essentially en - dorses a rule that would theoretically permit an award if the USPTO retained outside counsel to defend its in - terests but not if it elected to proceed on its own. Logically, the meaning of \"of the proceedings\" cannot turn on the type of attorneys retained to defend the government 's interests. As we previously observed, we must e qually regard salaried attorneys ' time and \"tak[e] into account the opportunity costs involved in devoting attorney time to one case when it could be devoted to others.\" Raney , 222 F.3d at 934 -35.9 We thus con- clude that \u00a7 145 entitles the USPTO to compensation for the diversion of its resources in the defense of \u00a7 145 appeals. 9 Without shouldering these expenses itself, Nantkwest seeks a ruling that essentially requires other applicants to fund its own ap - peal. See Leahy -Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. No. 112 -29, \u00a7 10, 125 Stat. 284, 316 (2011 ) (recognizing the USPTO as exclu- sively an applicant -funded agency). Although this may be appro - priate in the context of other agency proceedings, it does not ac- cord with our requirement that the applicant itself must bear the burden of these appeals. Hyatt , 625 F.3d at 1337. 71a Accordingly, we hold that \"[a]ll expenses of the pro - ceedings\" under \u00a7 145 includes the pro -rata share of the attorneys ' fees the USPTO incurred to defend ap - plicant 's appeal. To conclude otherwise would conflict with Hyatt , where we recognized the \"heavy economic burden\" that \u00a7 145 shifts onto applicants for electing this favorable appellate path. Hyatt , 625 F.3d at 1337. We have considered Nantkwest 's remaining argu- ments in this appeal but find them unpersuasive as well. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court and remand the case for it to enter an additional award of $78,592.50 in favor of the Director. REVERSED AND REMANDED 72a UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT 2016 -1794 NANTKWEST , INC., PLAINTIFF -APPELLEE v. JOSEPH MATAL , PERFORMING THE FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF THE UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR , U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE , DEFENDANT -APPELLANT Filed: June 23, 2017 Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in No. 1:13 -cv-01566 -GBL -TCB, Judge Gerald Bruce Lee STOLL , Circuit Judge , dissenting. Under the American Rule, \"each party in a lawsuit ordinarily shall bear its own attorney 's fees unless there is express statutory authorization to the contra- ry.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart , 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983). It erects a strong presumption against fee -shifting, re- quiring an explicit provision permitting a departure from the American Rule or other evidence of congres- sional intent to make such an award available. Section 145 neither mentions \"attorneys ' fees\" nor reflects a congressional intent to authorize them. Because I be - lieve \u00a7 145 fails to provide the necessary congressional 73a directive to overcome the American Rule 's bar against shifting attorneys ' fees, I respectfully dissent. I. The majority expresses \"substantial doubts\" regard- ing whether the American Ru le applies to \u00a7 145. Maj. Op. 5. But Supreme Court precedent makes clear that the American Rule marks the starting point for any analysis that shifts fees from one litigant to another. Often referred to as a \"bedrock principle,\" the Ameri- can Rule requir es that \"[e]ach litigant pay[] his own attorney 's fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise.\" Baker Botts L.L.P. v. ASARCO 2158, 2164 (2015) (quoting Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co. , 560 U.S. 242, 253 (2010)). This presumption against fee shifting in American litigation dates back more than 200 years to Arcambel v. Wiseman , 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 306 (1796). \"[T]he law of the United States, but for a few well - recognized exceptions not pre sent [here], has always been that absent explicit congressional authorization, attorneys ' fees are not a recoverable cost of litigation.\" Runyon v. McCrary , 427 U.S. 160, 185 (1976) (footnote omitted). While Congress remains free to draft statutes pro - viding for the award of attorneys ' fees, any such devia- tion from the American Rule must be \"specific and ex - plicit,\" for Congress has not \"extended any roving au - thority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might de em them war- ranted.\" Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 260 -62 (1975) (citing statutory pro - visions containing the phrase \"attorney 's fees\" as ex- amples of \"specific and explicit provisions for the al-74a lowance of attorneys ' fees\"). Several cases have rec- ognized that a statute 's failure to reference \"attorneys ' fees\" is not always dispositive, but the statute must \"otherwise evince[] an intent to provide for such fees.\" See, e.g. , Key Tronic Corp. v. United States , 511 U.S. 809, 81 5 (1994). This necessitates resort to the ordi- nary meaning of the phrase that is alleged to shift attorneys ' fees and the legislative history of the statu- tory provision to see if such an intent exists. Id. at 817-19; Summit Valley Indus. Inc. v. Local 11 2, United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am. , 456 U.S. 717, 722-23 (1982). II. It is against this backdrop that we analyze whether Congress expressed an intent \"to set aside this long - standing American rule of law,\" Runyon , 427 U.S. at 185-86, and award attorneys ' fees under \u00a7 145. In order to shift the PTO 's attorneys ' fees to NantKwest in this case, we must find in the text of \u00a7 145 a \"specific and explicit\" authorization from Congress. See Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U.S. at 260. Without express authority, the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" or \u00a7 145 's legisla- tive history has to provide it. A searching review exposes no such authorization. A. The language of \u00a7 145 does not explicitly grant us authority to shift attorneys ' fees. Section 145 requir es a patent applicant electing to challenge the PTO 's unfa- vorable decision in district court to pay \"[a]ll the ex- penses of the proceedings.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 (emphasis added). The phrase \"attorneys ' fees\" is not men- tioned, and Congress 's use of \"expenses\" is not the 75a type of \"specific and explicit\" language that permits the award of attorneys ' fees. See Summit Valley , 456 U.S. at 722 (noting that statute does not expressly mention attorneys ' fees); Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 814 -15 (same); F. D. Rich Co. v. U.S. for the Use of Indus. Lumber Co., 417 U.S. 116, 126 (1974) (same). In this case, the omission of \"attorneys ' fees\" from \u00a7 145 is particularly telling. When Congress wanted to make attorneys ' fees available in a patent litigation, it knew how to do s o. Section 285 of the America Invents Act, for example, provides: \"The court in ex - ceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 (emphasis add - ed). Several other sections of the Patent Act cross - reference \u00a7 285, and each of those sections recognizes the availability of \"attorney fees\" under \u00a7 285. See, 273(f ). Similarly, Section 297 of the AIA permits a customer who has been defrauded by an invention promoter to recover \"reasona ble costs and attorneys ' fees,\" in addition to other damages in- curred by the customer. Id. \u00a7 297(b)(1) (emphasis added). It is a fundamental principle of statutory interpre ta- tion that, \"[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally pre sumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclu- sion or exclusion.\" Russello v. United States , 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972)). Congress decided to exclude \"attorney fees\" from \u00a7 145 but not \u00a7 285 \u2014 the exact type of disparate exclusion we ordinarily pre-76a sume to be intentional .1 The omission of attorneys ' fees from \u00a7 145 \"strongly suggest[s] a deliberate decision not to authorize such awards.\" Key Tronic , 511 U.S. at 818-19. It reveals Congress 's intent \"to pick and choose among its statutes and to allow attorneys ' fees un - der some, but not others.\" Alyeska Pipeline , 421 U.S. at 263. Cong ress 's knowledge of the American Rule lends even more force to this argument. At least as early as 1973, Congress formed subcommittees to study attor- neys ' fees and other issues affecting legal services. See F. D. Rich Co. , 417 U.S. at 131 & n.20. And when warranted, Congress has drafted statutes to overcome the American Rule. See Hensley , 461 U.S. at 429 (stating that Congress enacted Civil Rights Attorney 's Fees Awards Act of 1976 in response to American Rule to provide explicit authorization for shi fting attorneys ' fees). As it did with the Civil Rights Attorney 's Fees Awards Act of 1976, Congress could have revised \u00a7 145 to expressly provide for the award of attorneys ' fees. Congress, however, did not. We should defer to Con- gress 's decision. See Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc. , 557 U.S. 167, 174 (2009) (\"When Congress amends one 1 Congress has expressly awarded attorneys ' fees in many other statutory contexts. See, e.g. , 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2565 (\"The court in excep- tional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\"); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1089(f )(2) (recognizing that statute provides \"the authority to provide for reasonable attorney 's fees\"); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a) (permitting award of \"reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party\" for certain trademark violations); 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 277d the court\"); 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 41305(e) (\"[T]he prevailing party may be award ed reasonable attorney fees.\"). 77a statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally.\"). B. Because \u00a7 145 lacks specific and explicit statutory authority to shift attorneys ' fees, we must be able to glean a congressional intent to do so from the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" or the legislative history of \u00a7 145. The majority concludes that the ordinary mean- ing of \"expenses\" necess arily includes attorneys ' fees.2 I disagree. It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that, \" '[u]nless otherwise defined, words will be inter- preted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, com- mon meaning ' at the time Congress enacted the stat- ute.\" Amoco Prod. Co. v. S. Ute Indian Tribe , 526 U.S. 865, 873-74 (1999) (quoting Perrin v. United States , 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)). As the Director points out in her brief, Congress amended the Patent Act in 1839 to require that \"the whole of the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the applicant, whether the final decision shall be in his favor or otherwise.\" Act of Mar. 3, 1839, ch. 88, \u00a7 10, 5 Stat. 353, 354; Appellant Br. 21. In the 1830s, the definition of \"expense\" in- cluded \"cost,\" and the definition of \"cost\" included \" ex- pense.\" J.E. Worcester, A Pronouncing and Explana- tory Dictionary of the English Language with Pro- nouncing Vocabularies of Classical and Scripture Proper Names 75, 117 (1830); see also Noah Webster et al., An American Dictionary of the English Language 197, 319 ( Joseph Emerson ed., 1830) (listing definition 2 The majority does not rely o n the legislative history to support its position. 78a for \"expense\" as \"cost\" and vice versa). Moreover, the words \"expense,\" \"cost,\" and \"damage\" were consid- ered synonymous the 1839 Amend- ments. Peter Mark Roget, Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases 227 (Barnas Sears ed., 1856). These definitions suggest that, at the time Congress introduced the word \"expenses\" into the Patent Act, its ordinary meaning did not include attorneys ' fees. The Supreme Court has twice held that the word \"damag es\" \u2014a synonym for \"expenses\" at the time of enactment \u2014is insufficient to override the American Rule. See Summit Valley , 456 U.S. at 722 -23 (\"Ordinarily a stat- utory right to 'damages ' does not include an implicit authorization to award attorney 's fees. Inde ed, the American Rule presumes that the word 'damages ' means damages exclusive of fees .\" (emphasis added)); Arcambel , 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) at 306. And even the ma- jority agrees that the word \"costs\" cannot displace the American Rule. See Maj. Op. 8 -9. There can be no doubt that the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" at the time of its inclusion in the Patent Act falls short of overcoming the American Rule. That the PTO did not rely on this provision to seek attorneys ' fees for over 170 years supports the underst anding that it is far from clear whether \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceed- ings\" includes attorneys ' fees. Congress 's frequent use of \"expenses\" and \"attor- neys ' fees\" in other statutory provisions further rein- forces that \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedi ngs\" does not necessarily include attorneys ' fees. The U.S. Code is replete with examples of Congress awarding \"ex- penses\" and then separately clarifying that attorneys ' fees are also available. See, e.g. , 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(n) 79a (authorizing trustee to recove r \"any costs, attorneys ' fees, or expenses . may to such party reasonable expenses and at- torneys ' fees.\"); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1786(p) (\"Any court having jurisdiction of any proceedings instituted under this section . . . may allow to any such party such rea- sonable expenses and attorneys ' fees as it deems just and proper in absence of breach of warranty, amount of indemnity shall be sum of \"interest and expenses (in- cluding costs and reasonable attorney 's fees and other expenses of representation)\"); 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a) (dis - cussing \"payment \u00a7 6673(a)(2)(A) (allowi ng recovery of \"excess expenses, attorneys ' fees\" against attorney who multiplied proceedings); 15 U.S.C. -1(a)(6) (discussing \"[t]otal attorneys ' fees and that can be awarded by court); 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 396 (\"The committee may allow any party reimbursement from the applicable accounts of the House of Representatives of his reasonable expenses of the contested election case, including reasonable attor- head to require that contractor pay \"an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys ' fees and expert wit - nesses ' fees)\" in connection with complaint regarding a reprisal); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(2) (permitting recover y of sum \"equal to the aggregate amount of cost and ex- penses (including attorneys ' fees based on actual time expended)\"); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (\"An order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a 80a result of the removal.\"); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1370(e)(1) (\"[T]he court in its discretion may award all or a portion of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action, including reasonable attorney 's fees. . . . \"); 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 938(c) (allowing successful miner to recover \"a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including the attorney 's fees)\"); 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(d)(1) (\"Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court fi nds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys ' fees and costs.\"); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) (\"[A] sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including the attorney 's fees) . . . court may award any such person who prevails in such action or proceeding reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.\"); 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(d)(1)(C) (noting that head of agency may \"[o]r - der the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attor neys ' fees and expert witnesses ' fees) that the complainant reasonably incurred\"); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d -6d(e)(9) (permitting ble expenses incurred . . . including a reasonable attorney 's fee\"). The message is clear: Congress did not view \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" as necessarily inclu - \"attorneys in cluded \"at- torneys ' fees,\" there would be no reason for Congress to specify the availability of attorneys ' fees in statutes that already provide for the award of expenses. In- stead, the logical implication is that \"expenses\" and \"attorneys ' fees\" mean diffe rent things and that ex- penses do not necessarily include attorneys ' fees. At 81a best, Congress 's reference to \"[a]ll the expenses\" is ambiguous. As such, Congress 's intent is not clear, and the statutory language does not overcome the American Rule. Althoug h Congress has enacted statutes that award the government attorneys ' fees in a district court ac- tion, in each circumstance, Congress explicitly referred to attorneys ' fees, making its fee -shifting intent abun- dantly clear. For example, in the context of an agency enforcement action for assessment of a civil penalty, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(a)(5)(B) provides that \"[a]ny person who fails to pay on a timely basis a civil penalty or- dered or assessed under this section shall be requir ed to pay . . . the United States enforcement expenses, including but not limited to attorneys fees.\" Likewise, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319(g)(9)(B) provides that \"[a]ny person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty . . . shall be required to pay [the agency] . . attorneys fees and costs for collection proceedings.\" Unlike these statutes, Con- gress 's alleged intent to award attorneys ' fees to the government in \u00a7 145 actions is not so clear. Finally, if \u00a7 145 were a f ee-shifting statute, it would represent a particularly unusual divergence from the American Rule because it obligates even successful plaintiffs to pay the PTO 's attorneys ' fees. \"[W]hen Congress has chosen to depart from the American rule by statute, virtually every one of the more than 150 ex- isting federal fee-shifting provisions predicates fee awards on some success by the claimant.\" Ruckel- shaus v. Sierra Club , 463 U.S. 680, (1983); see also Baker Botts , 135 S. Ct. at 2164 (recognizing deviation s from American Rule \"tend to authorize the award of 'a 82a reasonable attorney 's fee, ' 'fees, ' or 'litigation costs, ' and usually refer to a 'prevailing party ' in the context of an adversarial 'action. '\"). Nothing in \u00a7 145 confines the award of expenses to a prevailing party. Instead, it requires the applicant to pay \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings,\" which according to the majority means the applicant pays for the PTO 's attorneys ' fees in every \u00a7 145 proceeding. In these atypical circumstanc- es, I th ink Congress 's intent to award the PTO attorneys ' fees in every case should have been more clear. I can- not agree that Congress used the word \"expenses\" to effect such an unusual departure from the American Rule \u2014a departure that would saddle even prevailin g applicants with the PTO 's attorneys ' fees.3 C. The maintenance of a robust American Rule also finds support in public policy. For example, uncer- tainty is inherent in any litigation, and \"one should not be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit,\" as this could have a disproportionate effect in discouraging less wealthy individuals \"from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents ' counsel.\" Fleisch - mann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co. , 386 U.S. 3 The majority repeatedly mischaracterizes the dissent as advo- cating for a rigid requirement that would bar the award of attorneys ' fees unless Congress invoked those exact words. See Maj. Op. 11, 12, 13 n.8. This is incorrect. My opinion only addresses whether the word \"expenses\" is a specific and explicit directive from Con- gress to shift attorneys ' fees or whether \u00a7 145 otherwise signals Congress 's intent to make an award of attorne ys' fees available. I express no opinion as to what other words carry enough weight to displace the American Rule. 83a 714, 718 (1967); see also Summit Valley , 456 at 725 (\"[C]onsiderations [favoring application of the American Rule] include the possible deterrent effect that fee shifting would have on poor litigants with meritorious claims .\"). Independent advocacy could al - so be threatened, the Supreme Court warned, \"by hav - ing the earnings of the attorney flow from the pen of the judge before whom he argues.\" F. D. Rich Co., 417 U.S. at 129. Finally, if the word \"expenses\" in every statute or contract trumped the American Rule, then \"the time, expense, and difficulties of proof inherent in litigating the question of what constitutes reasonable attorney 's fees would pose substantial burdens for judi- cial administration.\" Fleischmann , 386 U.S. at 718 . Here, the majority 's interpretation would compel any prospective patentee who avails herself of the re - view afforded by \u00a7 145 to pay the PTO 's attorneys ' fees even if the applicant prevails and proves error b y the PTO.4 These high and uncertain costs will likely deter applicants, particularly solo inventors and other smaller entities, from pursuing review under \u00a7 145. And every \u00a7 145 proceeding would involve litigation over whether the PTO 's attorneys ' fees were reasonab le, creating an additional burden for the district court. I am not convinced that Congress intended such an outcome. 4 The AIA offers two options for judicial review of a Board deci- sion rejecting a patent application. The applicant can appeal to the Feder al Circuit under \u00a7 141 or it can file a civil action in the Eastern District of Virginia against the Director of the PTO under \u00a7 145. See Kappos v. Hyatt , 132 S. Ct. 1690, 1694 (2012). Seeking review under \u00a7 145 offers certain benefits to the applicant, including the ability to conduct discovery and introduce additional evidence. See id. at 1700 -01. 84a III. The majority 's arguments to the contrary do not per- suade me to conclude otherwise. The majority relies heavily on our statement in Hyatt v. Kappos , 625 F.3d 1320, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2010) that plaintiffs who proceed under \u00a7 145 bear \"the heavy economic burden of paying '[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings ' regardless of out- come.\" Maj. Op. 5, 15. This observation, however, does not re quire that expenses include attorneys ' fees. Indeed, the PTO has traditionally interpreted this statu- tory language to include expert fees, court reporter fees, deposition travel expenses, and printing expenses \u2014all of which can be significant and pose a \"h eavy economic burden\" in district court litigation. The majority also claims that its holding is con- sistent with opinions from the Second and Fourth Cir- cuits that have interpreted \"expenses\" to include at- torneys ' fees. But the rationale adopted by the m a- jority diverges from that of the Fourth Circuit in Shammas v. Focarino , 784 F.3d 219 (4th Cir. 2015), and the Second Circuit 's opinion in United States v. 110-118 Riverside Tenants Corp. , 886 F.2d 514 (2d Cir. 1989) is easily distinguished.5 5 In addition, the majority cites to dicta in Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd. , 132 S. Ct. 1997 (2012) as evidence that the Supreme Court has blessed its interpretation of \"expenses.\" As described by the Court, the question presented in Taniguchi was whether the phrase \"compensation of interpreters\" includes the cost of translating written documents. The Court answered this question by concluding that \"both the ordinary and technical mean - ings of 'interpreter, ' as well as the statutory context in which the word is found, lead to the conclusion that \u00a7 1920(6) does not apply to translators of written materials.\" Id. at 2005. Only then did 85a In interpreting a section of the Lanham Act requir- ing the party bringing the case to pay \"all the expenses of the proceeding,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071(b)(3), the Sham- mas majority6 found American Rule did not apply. Shammas , 784 F.3d at 223. Only after dispatch ing with the strong presumption against fee shifting em- bodied in the American Rule \u2014a rule that the majority here assumes is applicable \u2014was the Shammas court able to interpret the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" to cover attorneys ' fees. Id. at 224. Simply reaching the same result, however, does not make the majority 's opinion consistent with Shammas . This is particularly so here because the two opinions offer conflicting views on the applicability of the foundational common law principle embodied in the American Rule. The Second Circuit 's decision in 110-118 Riverside is inapposite because it does not address the interpre- tation of \"expenses\" in a contract or statutory provi- sion. Instead, 110-118 Riverside dealt with an apart- ment corporation that incurred expenses in foreclosing a lien that the government placed on one of the apart- ment corporation 's tenants. The government bore re - sponsibility for foreclosing the tax lien, but the apart- the Court explain that its holding was consistent with the \"narrow scope of taxable costs,\" which it characterized as a fraction of the nontaxable expenses. Id. at 2006. It never interpreted a statu- tory provision containing the word \"expenses\" to include attorney s' fees. 6 Judge King dissented. In his view, the American Rule con- trols the analysis, and attorneys ' fees should not be shifted because the statutory provision at issue \"makes no reference to attorney 's fees awards and does not reflect a Congressional i ntention to au - thorize such awards.\" Shammas corporation effectuated the foreclosure and shoul- dered the expens es associated with the proceeding. Because it was the government 's duty to foreclose the tax lien, the court found no reason why the government should not reimburse the apartment corporation for the expenses of the foreclosure proceeding, including attorn eys' fees. 110-118 Riverside , 886 F.2d at 520. As these facts demonstrate, 110-118 Riverside is a case where a private party performed the legal obligations of the government and was made whole for its efforts; it does not involve the interpretation of a statute in the context of adversarial litigation to determine whether Congress specifically and explicitly provided for the recovery of attorneys ' fees by one party against the other based on its use of the word \"expenses.\" Next, the majority relies on dictionary definitions to illuminate the ordinary meaning of \"expenses.\" The majority 's dictionaries, however, are from 1998 and 2014 \u2014they are not contemporaneous with Congress 's introduction of the word \"expenses\" into the Patent Act in 1839. Therefore, they shed no light on the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" more than 175 years ago. See Amoco Prod. Co. , 526 U.S. at 873 -74 (\"'[U]nless other- wise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning ' at the time Congre ss enacted the statute .\" (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Perrin , 444 U.S. at 42)). And unlike the 1998 definition from Wright and Miller, the contemporaneous definitions do not mention \"at- torneys ' fees.\" See Section II.B, supra . Finally, the majority posits that the litany of statu- tory provisions separately specifying both \"expenses\" and \"attorneys ' fees\" demonstrates Congress 's desire 87a not to be restricted to a single word or phrase when awarding attorneys ' fees. See Maj. Op. 11. These statutes, in my view, compel the opposite conclusion, especially when read in light of the American Rule. As explained above, there would be no reason for Con- gress to provide for the award of \"attorneys ' fees\" in numerous statutory provisions wher e it also permits the award of expenses if the contemporaneous, ordi- nary, and well -known meaning of \"expenses\" neces- sarily included attorneys ' fees. Rather, in the context of \u00a7 145, the term \"expenses\" is ambiguous and shows no clear intent to award attor neys ' fees. IV. The American Rule is the starting point for our analysis, and it imposes a high bar for any litigant seeking to shift its attorneys ' fees to the opposing par - ty. Despite assuming the American Rule 's applicabil- ity to this case, the majority believes \u00a7 145 provides the requisite authorization. But \u00a7 145 lacks the specific and explicit provision for the allowance of attorneys ' fees, and the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" fails to fill the void.

Lee 's Motion for Expenses (Doc. 78) at the conclusion of a trademark and infringement case, where the Plaintiff elected to bring its appeal of the PTAB 's decision pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. The first issue is whether 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 's language requiring Plaintiff to pay for the USPTO 's ''expenses '' encompasses the payment of the USPTO 's attorney fees, thereby deviating from the American Rule, that each side bears their own attorney 's fees. The second issue is whether the USPTO 's expert witness ' fees of $800/hr. (and $100 0/hr. for testimony) were unreasona-89a ble given that Plaintiff 's own expert, specializing in the same field, only charged $400/hr. The Court DENIES Defendant 's Motion for Ex- penses regarding the Defendant 's attorney fees and GRANTS Defendant 's Motion for Expe nses relating to Defendant 's expert witness. I. BACKGROUND This matter arises from a patent infringement dis- pute between Nantkwest, Inc. ( ''NantKwest '') and the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( ''USPTO ''). Def. Mot. to Dismiss, at 1. After the PTAB rejected its patent claims, Plaintiff Nantkwest, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145, elected to present its claim in this Court. Id. Section 145 allows a plaintiff to have a federal district court review its patent claims, along with new evidence, to determine the patentability of the relevant patents. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. However, when a plaintiff elects to have a district court review patents pursuant to \u00a7 145, Congress has mandated that the plaintiff is responsible for ''all the expenses of the procee ding. '' Id. On December 20, 2013, under \u00a7 145, NantKwest filed this proceeding to challenge an adverse decision from the USPTO. Def. Mot. to Dismiss, at 2. On September 2, 2015, this Court entered summary judg- ment in favor of the USPTO. Id. The USPTO now seeks $111,696.39 from Plaintiff as ''expenses '' of the proceeding under \u00a7 145. Id. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW Under the ''American Rule, '' parties are responsible for their own attorneys ' fees. In re Crescent City Estates, LLC, 588 F.3d 822, 825 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 533, 114 S. Ct. 90a 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994)). Thus, a prevailing li - tigant is generally not entitled to recover attorneys ' fees from the non -prevailing litigant. Id. (citing Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975)). However, there is an exception to this rule when attorney 's fees are provided by a statute. Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of Am. v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U.S. 443, 448, 127 S. Ct. 1199, 167 L. Ed. 2d 178 (2007). Nevertheless, a statute will only be interpre ted as allowing a deviation from the American Rule if it requires another party to pay attorney 's fees in specific and explicit provisions. Baker Botts L.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S. Ct. 2158, 192 L. Ed. 2d 208 (2015). The party seeking to recover attorneys ' fees has the burden of demonstrating that it is entitled to fees and that the amount it seeks is reasonable. See Airlines Reporting C orp. v. Sarrion Travel, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 2d 533, 536 (E.D. Va. 2012). III. ANALYSIS The Court DENIES Defendant 's Motion for Ex- penses regarding the Defendant 's attorney fees and GRANTS Defendant 's Motion for Expenses relating to Defendant 's expert witness. 1. The USPTO is Not Entitled to Attorneys ' Fees Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. a. The American Rule Does Not Allow Payment Of Attorneys ' Fees Unless A Statute Specifically And Expressly Requires It. Defendants are not entitled to attorneys ' fees be- cause the American Rule specifically forbids it. The American Rule states that each litigant pays his own attorneys ' fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract 91a provides otherwise. Baker Botts L.L.P. v. ASARCO LLC, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S. 2158, 2164, 192 L. Ed. 2d 208 (2015); Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 252 -53, 130 S. Ct. 2149, 176 L. Ed. 2d 998 (2010) ( ''[e]ach litigant pays his own attorney 's fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides oth- erwise. ''). Because the American Rule is rooted in common law, dating as far back as the 18th century, a party who seeks to deviate from the American Rule by requesting attorneys ' fees from his opposing party, must have statutory justification. Baker Botts, 135 S. Ct. at 2164 ( ''The basic point of reference when considering the award of attorneys ' fees is the bedrock principle known as the American Rule. ''); Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 271, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975) ( ''absent statute or enforceable contract, litigants pay their own attorneys ' fees. ''). More precisely, the Supreme Court has stated that departures from the American Rule are authorized only when there is a ''specific and explicit provision[ ] for the allowance of attorneys ' fees under [the] selected statute[ ]. '' Id. at 2164 (quoting Alyeska Pipeline Ser - vice, 421 U.S. at 260, 95 S. Ct. 1612.) In other words, ''absent explicit statutory authority, '' to the contrary, a court must follow the Am erican Rule. Id. In light of this ''specific and explicit provision '' standard, Defen - dants must be able to articulate a statutory provision that clearly and explicitly allows them to recover at- torneys ' fees from Plaintiff. 92a b. Section 145 of Title 35 o f the United States Code Does Not ''Specifically and Explicitly '' Allow for Payment of Attorneys ' Fees The language of \u00a7 145 neither specifically nor ex- pressly requires plaintiffs to pay their opponent 's at- torneys ' fees. Section 145 does not justify a deviation from the American Rule. Section 145 states, in rele- vant part: \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant. '' 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 (2011). Thus, to satisfy the Supreme Court 's standard in Baker Botts and show that \u00a7 145 d eviates from the American Rule, Defendants must be able to show the statute 's use of the term 'expenses ' specifically encompasses attorneys ' fees. However, this is not possible because in \u00a7 145 's entire two -hundred -year existence, it has never been interpreted as including attorneys ' fees in ''ex- penses. '' Instead, Congress 's reference to ''all of the expenses '' merely points to a collection of the expenses used, commonly understood to encompass as printing, travel, and reasonable expert witness expe nses. The American Rule requires a statute to expressly indicate a deviation from its bedrock principle that each side pays its own fees. This deviation from the American Rule does not require a statute to specifically state ''attorneys ' fees'' in order f or attorneys ' fees to be one of the statute 's contemplated ''expenses. '' In- stead, the statute must, in keeping with the ''specific and explicit '' standard, clearly indicate that it requires a party to pay attorneys ' fees. See Baker Botts, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S. Ct. 2158, 192 L. Ed. 2d 208. In Baker Botts, the Supreme Court held that a statute success- fully deviated from the American Rule and therefore mandated a party pay its opponent 's attorneys ' fees 93a even though the statute never used the term ''attorneys ' fees.'' Id. The Supreme Court crucially noted that the statute satisfied the ''specific and explicit '' standard because the statute 's language authorizing ''reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered '' undisputedly authorized an award of attorneys ' fees for the work in question. See id. (''no one disputes that \u00a7 330(a)(1) authorizes an award of attorneys ' fees for that kind of work ''). More specifically, the Su- preme Court noted the statute 's use of the term 'ser- vices rendered, ' in re ference to what fees should be paid, further indicated Congress 's intent to include attorneys ' fees in the party 's required expenses. Id. This ruling shows that a statute can depart from the American Rule without requiring the term ''attorneys ' fees'' as long as its deviation is clear and unambiguous. In spite of such a concrete precedent from the Su- preme Court, Defendant still mischaracterizes Baker Botts in two ways. First, Defendant insists that the Supreme Court 's holding in Baker Botts does not apply to the case at hand because the Court, after agreeing the statute at issue allowed attorney 's fees, rejected an attorneys ' request to apply the statute to fees the at- torney had personally accumulated while defending himself during fee litigation. How ever, this analysis actually cuts against Defendant 's position because, as Defendant notes in its Reply Brief, ''[t]he Supreme Court applied the American Rule to what it viewed as a classic example of 'adversarial litigation. ''' (Doc. 93 at 8). In other words, the Supreme Court 's refusal to deviate from the American Rule in the single instance involving an attorney 's fee -defense litigation was based solely on the fact that the litigation the attorney sought expenses for, was not classic example of advers arial litigation, 94a where ''one side '' is against ''the other. '' See Baker Botts, 135 S. Ct. at 2164. Instead, the attorney sought to use the relevant statute to recover attorney 's fees for he had previously imposed on his own client, and thus was defending, that removed this particular sce- nario from the ''classic adversarial '' case. The case fits into the category of ''classic adversarial litigation. '' Plaintiff, opposing Defendants, sought ju - dicial review of a USPTO ruling of in this Court. Simply because Plaintiff brings suit under a statute that requires them to pay for all expenses, does not in - dicate that this suit is not adversarial. On the con- trary, because such suits are naturally adversarial, the requirement of paying all expenses is meant to be a deterrent to litigation, not simply require a party to pay the expenses he would have had to pay regardless. Additionally, the very structure of \u00a7 145 indicate that claims pursued under the statute are inherently ad- versarial. The statute is premised on a party 's dissatis - faction with the administrative ruling such that, knowing well before bringing suit that it will have to pay the expenses of the USPTO, it still endeavors to have his suit heard in a federal district court. This cannot be described as anything but adversarial. Second, Defendant alleges that Baker Botts stands for the proposition that a broad term like ''reasonable compensation '' is sufficient to deviate from the Ameri- can Rule. This conclusion fails for many reasons. Primari ly, Defendant 's position ignores the require- ment that a statute requiring attorney 's fees be specific and explicit, as well as previous statutes that adhere to the 'specific and explicit ' requirement. To be clear, when Congress intends a statute to deviate from the 95a American Rule, it does so explicitly. See, e.g., 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 (authorizing, in ''exceptional cases, '' awards of ''reasonable attorney fees''); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2)(D)(iv) (imposing liability on party making material misrepre- sentations ''for any damages, including costs and at- torney 's fees ''); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116(d)(11) (authorizing, in action for wrongful seizure of goods or marks, award of ''a reasonable attorney 's fee''); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a) (authorizing, in ''exceptional cases, fees U.S.C. \u00a7 recovery of ''a rea- sonable attorney 's fee ''). Further, even when a statute authorizes a broad term like 'costs ' or 'expenses, ' if such terms are in- tended to include attorney 's fees, Congress will modify the term to spec ify or clarify the statute 's meanings. See, e.g. , 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(n) (authorizing recovery of ''any costs, attorneys ' or expenses incurred ''); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464(d)( l)(B)(vii) (at the c ourt 's discretion, obligating federal savings associations to pay ''reason- able expenses and attorneys ' fees'' in enforcement actions); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(2)(A) (requiring lawyers who cause excessive costs to pay ''excess costs, expens- es, and attorneys ' fees''); 31 3730(d)(4) (author- izing, in false claims suit, ''reasonable attorneys ' fees and expenses '' to prevailing defendant); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5009(a)(1)(B) (holding party at fault liable for ''inter- est and expenses (including costs and reasonable at- torney 's fees and other expenses of representation) ''); Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A) (requiring party at fault to pay ''reasonable expenses . . . including attorney 's fees''). 96a Additionally, Defendant 's argument misses the fact that in Baker Botts, the statute at issue did not simply state ''reasonable compensation '' but used the phrase ''reasonable compensation for actual, necessary ser- vices rendered .'' See id. While it is true that in Baker Botts, the Supreme Court emphasized that var- ious phrases \u2014not solely ''attorneys ' fees, ''\u2014could in - dicate departure from the American Rule such varia- tions, whether ''a reasonable attorneys ' fee,'' ''fees, '' or ''litigation costs, '' all unequivocally indicate attorneys ' fees. Id. at 2164. For example, the Equal Access to Justice Act, which dictates what fees a party must pay in specific suits against the government, makes a clear distinction between expenses generally and attorneys ' fees, often referring to both terms in the same sen- tence. See 28 U .S.C. \u00a7 2412. Section (a)(1) the act states ''a judgment for costs . . . but not including the fees and expenses of attorneys ;'' section (b) notes ''a court may award reasonable fees and expenses of at- torneys; '' subsection (2) it outlines the payment of ''fees and expenses of attorneys; '' and in section (d)(1)(A) it states ''a court shall award . . . fees and other expenses, in addition to costs. '' Id. The Equal Access to Justice Act and the Supreme Court 's interpretation of the specific and explicit lan- guage in Baker Botts, provide examples of statutory provisions that specifically and explicitly authorize at - torneys ' fees. In both statutes, Congress ' intentional inclusion of the term fees, rather than 'costs ' or 'ex- penses ' when it wanted to authorize attorneys ' fees, make it is evident that \u00a7 145 simply does not meet the standard articulated in Baker Botts . In \u00a7 145 Con- gress neither used the phrase ''attorneys ' fees'' nor ''fees'' nor any alternative phrase demonstrating a clear 97a reference to attorneys ' fees. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 (2011). Such ambiguity regarding the exact reach of the term ''expenses '' means \u00a7 145 does not meet the Supreme Court 's Baker Botts standard and therefore, cannot deviate from the American Rule. c. The Shammas Court 's Reading That the American Rule Only Applies When The Prevailing Party Seeks Fees, Is Erroneous The Fourth Circuit 's holding in Shammas v. Focarino does not correctly follow the later articulated Supreme Court standard in Baker Botts . In Shammas, the Fourth Circuit decided that ''the American Rule [ ] applies only where the award of attorney[ ']s fees turns on whether a party seeking fees has prevailed to at least some degree. '' Shammas v. Focarino, 784 F.3d 219, 223 (4th Cir. 2015). Relying on previou s Supreme Court cases that state the American Rule by address- ing ''the prevailing party, '' the Shammas court con- cluded that the American Rule applies only in the context of a prevailing party seeking fees from a losing party. Id. at 223 (concluding, ''[t]hus a statute that mandates the payment of attorneys ' fees without re- gard to ta party 's success is not a fee -shifting statute that operates against the backdrop of the American Rule. ''). The court then noted that, in the context of \u00a7 145, ''[b]ecause the PTO is entitled to recover its expenses even when it completely fails, [\u00a7 145] need not be interpreted against the backdrop of the American Rule .'' Id. Without more, this hardly justifies deviating from the American Rule 's bedrock principle. Most im- port ant however, given the Supreme Court 's decision Baker Botts decision after Shammas, specifying a clear 98a standard that directly opposes the exception the Sham - mas court articulated, this Court is bound to apply Baker Botts to the current case.1 Granted, the Sham- mas decision cited Supreme Court cases that included the phrase ''the prevailing party, '' however, those cases made no reference to an express holding that the American Rule only applied to prevailing parties. For example, the Shammas court cited the Supreme Court 's decision in Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, which merely stated that ''the consistent rule is that complete failure will not justify shifting fees. '' 463 U.S. 680, 684, 103 S. Ct. 3274, 77 L. Ed. 2d 938 (1983). Howev- er, this affirmative statement does not necessitate its inverse. In other words, simply because the Supreme Court holds that a party 's failure does not justify shift - ing fees to its opponent, does not necessarily mean that in cases where ''failure '' is not possibl e (because the parties have agreed that one party will pay all ex pens- es), the American Rule does not apply. Neither the Shammas court, nor Defendant has pointed to a Su- preme Court case that affirmatively states that the American Rule only applies in conte xts of prevailing parties. This complete omission, in light of a clearly articulated standard from the Supreme Court, reinforces the fragility in the Shammas justification. Given this, the Supreme Court 's 2015 standard articulated in Baker Botts should guide all determinations of whether a statute deviates from the American Rule. 1 Both Plaintiff and Defendant correctly recognize that the Fourth Circuit 's decision in Shammas is not binding on this Court because the Federal Circuit is the exclusive appellate authority for this ac - tion brought pursuant to part of the Patent Act (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145). See Def's Mtn. for Expenses at 9 Plt. Opp. at 13 n.12. 99a Finally, the Shammas court notes that, even if it had erroneously concluded that the term ''expenses '' in \u00a7 145 deviates from the American Rule, its conclusion is nonetheless su pported because it is clear from ''ordi- nary parlance '' that ''expenses '' is ''sufficiently broad to include attorneys ' fees. '' Id. at 22. But once again, this misinterprets the standard articulated in Baker Boots . The issue, when deciding if statutory language sufficiently deviates from the American Rule, is wheth - er the language specifically and explicitly states that attorneys ' fees\u2014in some way or another \u2014are author- ized, not whether a term is broad enough to where it appears applicable under the terms in the statute. As the Shammas court itself noted, Congress must speak with ''heightened clarity '' to overcome the pre- sumption of the American Rule. Shammas, 784 F.3d at 223. In light of this, the Fourth Circuit 's references to the dictionary definition of expenses and the likeli- hood that the term expenses encompasses attorney fees do not affect this Court 's analysis. Instead, when viewing \u00a7 145, this Court must determine whether the statute specifically and explicitly autho rized attor- neys ' fees. When disturbing a bedrock principle with such harsh results, uncertainty is unacceptable. Fi- nally, as Plaintiff aptly notes, no other court has sup- ported or echoed Shammas ' rationale. 2. Defendants ' Retention of Expert Lewis Lanier Does Not Appear Excessive; However, That Is at The Discretion of the Court. Plaintiff additionally contests Defendants ' use of an expert witness costing between $800 -$1000/hr. given that Plaintiffs expert only cost $400/hr. This disparity in experts ' rates is not indicative of any misconduct by 100a the Defendants. Before selecting their expert wit- ness, Defendants sought nine different experts, did not choose the highest one, and eventually selected an ex - pert whose fee is similar to recent cases the expert h as served as a witness. Thus the Court holds that the USPTO 's expert Lewis Lanier 's total rate of $33,103.89 was not excessive in light of his previous rates and experience. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defen - dants ' Motion for Expenses for $33, 103.89, for the costs of retaining its expert witness, Lewis Lanier. V. CONCLUSION The Court DENIES Defendant 's Motion for Ex- penses regarding the Defendant 's attorney fees of $78,592.50 and GRANTS Defendant 's Motion for Ex- penses of $33,103.89 for Defendant 's expe rt witness, Lewis Lanier. For the reasons stated above, it is hereby, ORDERED that Defendant Michelle K. Lee's Mo- tion for Expenses is DENIED for attorney 's fees of $78,592.50 and GRANTED for the fees of $33, 103.89 for Defendant 's expert witness Lewis Lanie r. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff pay the USPTO $33 ,103.89 within forty -five (45) days of this Order. IT IS SO ORDERED . 101a APPENDIX D UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT 2015-2095 NANTKWEST , INC., FORMERLY CONKWEST , INC., PLAINTIFF -APPELLANT v. MICHELLE K. LEE, DIRECTOR , U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE , DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE , DEFENDANT -APPELLEE Decided: May 3, 2017 Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in No. 1:13 -cv-01566 -GBL -TCB, Judge Gerald Bruce Lee OPINION Before: PROST , Chief Judge, DYK, and STOLL , Cir - cuit Judges. Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge DYK, in which PROST , Chief Judge, joins. Dissenting Opinion filed by Circuit Judge STOLL . DYK, Circuit Judge. 102a The United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") rejected claims 20, 26, and 27 of U.S. Pa- tent Application No. 10/008,955 ( \"'55 patent applica- tion\") on the ground that the claims would have been obvious. NantKwest sought review in district court, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 , asserting that claims 20, 26, and 27 of the application were nonobvious. The district court granted the USPTO 's motion for sum- mary judgment of obviousness. NantKwest appeals. We affirm . BACKGROUND NantKwest is the assignee of the pate nt application at issue, filed by Hans Klingemann (\"patent applicant\"), directed to the use of a specific type of immune cells for treating cancer . The immune system can be divided into its innate and adaptive responses. The innate immune response \u2014which is the first line of defense \u2014comprises immune cells like natural killer (\"NK\") cells that rapidly attack anything that they sense as foreign. NK cells gener- ally have limited target -recognition specificity and at - tack rather indiscriminately. The adaptive immune response \u2014which is the second line of de fense \u2014 comprises immune cells like T cells that attack specific foreign antigens that they have been trained to recog- nize. The adaptive immune response is thus slower but more target -specific. NK cells and T cells have different cell surface proteins and respond to certain target cell receptors differently. The patent applica-103a tion here concerns the use of a particular cell line1 of NK cells \u2014NK-92. Despite these differences between NK cells and T cells, throughout the 1980s and 1990s, various prior art references taught that both T cells and NK cells were capable of lysing (destroying) cancer cells. These references described in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo ex- periments demonstrating this ability. By 1997, NK cells and T cells were the only tw o types of immune cells known \"to recognize and lyse tumor cells in vivo in mammals.\" J.A. 779 -80. Two specific prior art references are involved here. First, U.S. Patent No. 5,272,082 , by Santoli et al. (\"San- toli\"), taught that a specific cell line of T cells, TALL -104, can be used in vivo to treat cancer . Second, Gong, Maki, and Klingemann (the '955 patent applicant) pub- lished a study (\"Gong\") that taught that a specific NK cell line, NK -92, can lyse cancer cells in vitro with high efficacy. The question here is whether these refer- ences rendered the '955 application 's claims obvious. On December 7, 2001, the patent application was filed with a priority date of April 30, 1997. Claim 20, an independent claim on appeal here, provides A method of treating a cancer in vivo in a mammal comprising the step of administering to the mammal a medium comprising an NK -92 cell line ATCC De- 1 Immune cells harvested in the laboratory are derived from \"cell lines,\" which refe r to cancerous cells that continue reproducing more of their own cell type. For example, tumor cells that pro- duce T cells or NK cells nonstop (and hence cause cancer ) can be removed from a patient and nourished in the laboratory to repro- duce more T cells or NK cells for subsequent experimental use. 104a posit No. CRL -2407, wherein said lysed by said NK -92 cell line. J.A. 5. Also on appeal are two dependent claims. Claim 26 teaches that \"[t]he method of treating a can- cer described in claim 20 wherein the route of admin- istration of the cells to the mammal is intravenous and the mammal is human.\" Id. Claim 27 teaches that \"[t]he method of treating a cancer described in claim 20 further comprising t he step of administering to said mammal a cytokine that promotes the growth of said NK-92 cell line.\" Id. The USPTO Examiner rejected the claims at issue and found that \"it would have been prima facie obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art . . . in April 1997 to combine the teachings of Santoli and Gong to arrive at the claimed method because Gong . . . teaches use of NK while lines.\" J.A. 8 (internal quotati on marks omitted). The applicant then appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (\"Board\"). The Board af - firmed the Examiner 's rejection on the ground that a person of ordinary skill in the art \"would have been motivated to replace the TALL -104 cells in Santoli 's method with NK -92 cells based on Gong 's disclosure that NK -92 cells spontaneously kill [ leukemia and lym- phoma cancer ] cells with high efficiency.\" J.A. 10 (in - ternal quotation marks omitted). Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 , NantKwest then filed a complaint in district court, seeking judgment that claims 20, 26, and 27 of the patent application were nonobvious. The USPTO moved for summary judg-105a ment. In response, NantKwest argued that this case involves dis putes of factual issues that cannot be re- solved on summary judgment, relying on expert re- ports from Dr. Miller (\"Miller\") and new references submitted for the \u00a7 145 proceeding. The district court granted summary judgment \"because there is no gen- uine material factual dispute as to whether the inven- tion claimed in the [patent application] was obvious over the prior art, as found by both the Examiner and the Board.\" J.A. 15. NantKwest appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1) . DISCUSSION I This court reviews the district court 's grant or deni- al of summary judgment de novo . MicroStrategy Inc. v. Bus. Objects , S.A. , 429 F.3d 1344, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citations omitted). Summary judgment may be granted only \"if the movant shows that there is no gen - uine dispute as to any material fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) . Claim construction is an issue of law that we re - view de novo where, as here, there is no relevant extrin- sic evidence. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. , \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S. Ct. 831, 841, \u2014 L. Ed. 2d \u2014 (2015) . A patent is obvious if \"a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention, and that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.\" Procter & Ga mble Co. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. , 566 F.3d 989, 994 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). II 106a NantKwest contends that we should reverse the grant of summary judgment because the district court used an incorrect claim construction. Initially , the district court construed \" cancer \" to mean a \"plurality or multiple cancer cells.\" J.A. 16. However, in ad- dressing the reasonable expectation of success, the court appeared to consider \" cancer \" as meaning \"one or more cancer cells.\" J.A. 22. We agree with NantKwest that this is a n incorrect construction of \" cancer .\" The cor - rect construction of the claim term \"treating a cancer \" \"require[s] lysis of many cells, in order to accomplish the goal of treating cancer ,\" and not merely lysing one or a few cancer cells. J.A. 722. However, the district court 's erroneous claim con- struction creates no basis for reversal. First, we re - view the district court 's decision de novo . In address - ing the issue of obviousness, we will use the correct construction, which renders the district court 's erro- neous construction harmless error. Second, there is no assertion here that the relevant prior art references taught methods that only lysed one cancer cell or oth- erwise lysed insufficient numbers of cells for treating cancer . III a Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 , [a]n applicant dissatisfied with . . may . . . have in [district court] . . . . such applicant is enti- tled to receive a patent for his invention, as specified 107a in any of his claims involved in the decision of the [Board], as the facts in the case may appear. . . . In \u00a7 145 proceedings, \"the district court may con- sider new evidence\" presented by the applicant that was not befor e the Board. Kappos v. Hyatt , 566 U.S. 431, 132 S. Ct. 1690, 1696, 182 L. Ed. 2d 704 (2012) . If there are genuine issues of material fact, \"the district court must make de novo factual findings that take account of both the new evidence and the administra- tive record before the PTO.\" Id. at 1701 . We agree with the district court that there is no material dispute that the combina tion of Santoli and Gong used here produced the invention and that per- sons of ordinary skill in the art would have been moti- vated to combine Santoli and Gong. Santoli was an important advance because it showed that T cells from a cell line, not belonging t o a patient, can be administered into a patient to produce in vivo therapeutic effects. Such an approach is called \"al- logeneic\" or \" adoptive immunotherapy .\" Santoli spe- cifically taught that the TALL -104 cell line can be used in adoptive immunotherapy in vivo for lysing cancer cells.2 2 We reject NantKwest 's argument that Santoli does not \"dis- close a successful in vivo therapy for TALL -104.\" Appellant Br. 32. A study of TALL -104 in vivo therapy in dogs showed clinical responses in eight out of nineteen dogs tested. Another study showe d that mice treated with TALL -104 cells remained cancer - free for at least 2 months, while untreated mice all died within 10 to 20 days. In fact, the patent application itself acknowledged that prior TALL -104 studies demonstrated \"antitumor activity in vi vo . alleged failure of 108a Gong taught that the NK -92 cell line showed in vitro efficacy in lysing cancer cells. In fact, NK -92 was found to have \"high efficiency\" in lysing the same leu- kemia tumor cell type as TALL -104 did. See J.A. 128, 142. Both TALL -104 and NK -92 lysed cancer cells via the same mechanism, i.e., in a \"non -MHC -restricted\" manner, in which they do not require presentation of antigens on the MHC cell surface proteins of the tumor cells. J.A. 131, 145. Prior art publications by the patent applicant him- self i ndicated that there was a motivation to seek clini- cal applications for the NK -92 cell line. For example, Gong noted that \"[b]ecause of their ability to lyse ma- lignant cells, NK . . . cells have been utilized in several clinical trials in cancer patients.\" J.A. 140. In a separate publication, Kling emann et al. cited to the fact that cells . . . can \"[t]o bility NK -92 purging.\"3 J.A. 344. While the appellant is correct that these experiments are differ ent from allogeneic in vivo therapy, in that they used the patient 's own NK cells, they indisputably indicate that skilled artisans were motivated to pursue clinical applications for NK cells and the NK -92 cell line. TALL -104 therapy in human clinical trials \u2014not known at the time of the application \u2014is irrelevant. See In re Vaeck , 947 F.2d 488, 493 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (\"[E]xpectation of success must be founded in the prior art.\" (emphasis added)). 3 Ex vivo purging entails removing \"a to the patient\" for therapy, with the effects stemming from the activated cells. J.A. 7. 109a Indeed, the '955 patent application itself referred to Gong to describe the superior qualities of the NK -92 cell line. See, e.g., '955 patent application, \u00b6 50 (\"The NK-92 cell line has been described by Gong et al. (1994)\"); id. at \u00b6 74 (\"NK -92 cells (Gong et al. (1994)) were derived from cells obtained from a patient suf- fering from non -Hodgkin 's lymphoma .\"). The patent application highlighted NK -92's \"superior\" in vitro efficacy (as well as the later -dete rmined in vivo effica- cy), compared against as \"activities [that] are . . . unexpected by a worker in the field of tumor cytotherapy.\" Id. at \u00b6 121. The patent application also teaches that NK -92's in vitro efficacy was \"superior to those activities manifested by the known preparations of cytolytic cells normally present in humans,\" which suggests NK -92's therapeutic utility based on in vitro data. Id. In fact, the '955 patent application concluded from in vitro data that \"the NK-92 cells of the invention are surprisingly and sig- nificantly more effective in lysing patient -104] cell line[ ] known in the field.\" Id. at \u00b6 104. Santoli taught that \"[t]here remains a need in the art for therapeutic methods . . . for cancers which can utilize cytotoxic T cell lines and avoid the present need . . . for patient 's own killer cells.\" J.A. 130, col. 2, ll. 33 -37. Santoli thus provided an explicit sug- gestion to use cell lines (allogeneic therapy) in cancer treatments because of their greater availability. In fact, the '955 patent application itself recognized that prior investigators turned to allogeneic the rapy in preference to using a patient 's own cells. See '955 patent application, \u00b6 9 (To overcome ical use, \"many investigators ha ve turned to the use of established NK -like cell lines.\"). Thus, prior art references on successful in vivo therapy using non - allogeneic NK cells taught toward using cell lines. Finally, there were specific studies undertaken to de- termine whether the NK -92 cell line would be useful for in vivo therapy. Yan et al. (\"Yan\") is a prior art refer- ence relied on by the Board, in which investigators com- pared the in vitro efficacies betwe en TALL -104 and NK-92 cell lines against various tumors, in order to study the potential of using these cell lines for in vivo therapy. J.A. 226 (\"To study the potential of using biological reagents in adoptive immunotherapy , we tested the tumoricidal capacity of T104 [and] NK92.\"). Yan concluded that the in vitro efficacy of NK -92 was even greater than the in vitro efficacy of TALL -104, which had already been used for in vivo therapy. Through this head -to-head comparison, Yan taught persons skilled in the art to combine the teachings of Santoli \u2014using a cell line in adoptive immunotherapy \u2014with the teachings of Gong \u2014the use of the NK -92 cell line. b We also find that it would have been at least obvious for skilled artisans to try to combine the teachings of Santoli and Gong. When there is a . . . problem and there are a fi- nite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good rea son to pursue the known options . . . . If this leads to the an- ticipated success, it is likely the product not of in- novation but of ordinar y skill and common sense. 111a In that instance the fact that a combination was ob- vious to try might show that it was obvious under \u00a7 103. KSR Int 'l Co. v. Teleflex U.S. 167 L. Ed. 2d 705 (2007) . Generally, the on ly situations where this does not apply is where \"the inventor would have had to try all possibilities in a field unreduced by direction of the prior art . . . [or] where vague prior art does not guide an inventor to- ward a particular solution.\" Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Barr Lab., Inc. , 575 F.3d 1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2009) . Even NantKwest 's expert conceded that in 1997, skilled artisans knew that NK cells and T cells were the only two types of im mune cells known to have anti- tumor efficacy. Moreover, both Santoli and Gong recognized that TALL -104 and NK -92 cells attack can- cer cells via the same mechanism, which induced skilled artisans like Yan to compare the efficacies of these two cell lines. Thus, TALL -104 and NK -92 were known to be simil ar and were among a very limited number of immune cells for use in anticancer therapy. Given the limited number of possibilities in the prior art and the many explicit suggestions \"toward a particular solu- tion,\" Bayer , 575 F.3d at 1347 , we conclude that com- bining the teachings of Santoli and Gong would have been at least obvious to try. IV NantKwest claims that expert reports by Dr. Miller submitted for the first time in the district court pro- ceeding and n ew prior art references also submitted for the \u00a7 145 proceeding raise genuine disputes of material 112a fact about the reasonable likelihood of success for com- bining Gong with Santoli. We disagree. Our cases recognize that there is no general rule that a skilled artisan cannot reasonably extrapolate in vivo success from in vitro results. \"Obviousness does not require absolute predictability of success. Indeed, for many inventions that seem quite obvious, there is no absolute predictability of success unt il the invention is reduced to practice.\" In re O'Farrell , 853 F.2d 894, 903 (Fed. Cir. 1988) . \"[P]roviding proof sufficient to justify conducting in vivo procedures on humans, while useful, is not a test of patentability.\" PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. v. ViaCell, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2007) . Rather, our cases hold that whether the skilled ar- tisan can extrapolate in vivo success from in vitro re- sults is highly fact -specific. See In re Gangadharam , F.2d issue . . . is not whether in vitro results can be used to predict in vivo success; rather it 's simply whether the [USPTO], in this case, carried its burden of proving a prima facie case of obviousness of the claimed inven- tion.\" Carroll , 601 F.2d 1184, 1186 (C.C.P.A. 1979) (holding that there was teaching away because a witness had stated that in vitro testing was unreliable for in vivo effectiveness in a specific context). The fact that in vitro success does not always translate into in vivo succe ss cannot defeat summary judgment. \"[O]bviousness cannot be avoided simply by a showing of some degree of unpredictability in the art so long as there was a reasonable probability of success.\" Pfizer, In c. v. Apotex, Inc. , 480 1364 (Fed. Cir. . Indeed, NantKwest itself simply argues that \"[p]ositive results in vitro do not necessarily establish a reasonable probability of success for therapeutic use of that drug in vivo .\" Appellant Br. 43 (emphasis added). But here, as we have discussed above, there is over -whelming specific evidence that a skilled artisan could reasonably extrapolate from the in vitro data with respect to TALL -104 and NK -92 that would rea- sonably teach the ir successful substitution in vivo .4 4 NantKwest argues that the Vujanovic et al. reference (\"Vuja- novic\") teaches that \"although the A -NK and NA -NK cells used for therapy showed simila r levels of cytotoxicity against HR [ gastric cancer ] cells tested [ in vitro ] (Table I), A -NK cells demonstrated dramatically and significantly greater antitumor activity than NA-NK cells in vivo (Table V, Fig. 4).\" J.A. 960. From this, NantKwest concludes that there is \"difficulty [in] predicting effica- cious in vivo cancer treatments from in vitro assays,\" in particular for NK cells. Appellant Rep. Br. 5. We reject this out -of-context reading. Vujanovic indeed teaches that A -NK and NA -NK have similar in vitro efficacy against gastric cancer cells. J.A. 957, tbl. I. Vujanovic also teaches that against gastric cancer cells in vivo , mice undergoing NA -NK treatment develop only 20% of the cancer metastases that would develop in untreated mice, while mice un- dergoing A -NK treatment develop only 6% of the cancer metasta- ses that would develop in untreated mice. J.A. 960, tbl. V. To be sure, this is a s tatistically significant difference between the NA -NK and A -NK treatments. However, what NantKwest fails to high- light is that despite this difference, both NA -NK and A -NK treat- ments produced very statistically significant reductions in cancer metastases as compared to untreated mice. Vujano vic thus does not support the argument that NK cells ' in vitro efficacy in anti- tumor activity cannot be extrapolated to in vivo success; at most, it only suggests that the exact magnitude of that success may not be predictable. 114a However, the appellant asserts five specific material disputes as to whether in vitro success here would translate into in vivo success. First, NantKwest argues that Miller shows that there is a teaching away from usin g unmodified NK -92 cells gene.\" 38. Santoli thus \"strongly discourages the skilled artisan from attempting to introduce unmodified [immune] cells into a new host\" without this genetic modification, because such cells may cause cancer . J.A. 392. NantKwest conceded during oral argument that the claim language here does not require administering \"unmodified\" NK -92 cells; that is, administering modi- Oral Arg. 33:40 -56. Therefore, away from using unmodified NK -92 cells is irrelevant. Furthermore, the prior art had disclosed that TALL -104 cells could be \"lethally irradiated,\" so that they became \"non -proliferating,\" without sacrific- ing TALL -104's ability to lyse cancer cells. J.A. 183. There is no dispute that ther e would be motivation to irradiate cell lines to address this problem if it arose.5 Thus, safely using a genetically unmodified immune cell line was already taught in the prior art. Second, NantKwest argues that Miller shows that there is a teaching away from using allogeneic NK -92 therapy because \"[i]t was not well understood at the time of the invention whether allogeneic NK cells 5 It was ultimately determi ned that NK -92 cells did not present this risk because they \"do not need to be modified or irradiated to prevent uncontrolled proliferation.\" Appellant Rep. Br. 17 n.2. 115a would be subject to [attack by the] foreign whether 411. This was a broad and general concern known to skilled artisans. In fact, USPTO expert Dr. Lanier agreed that the \"use of foreign immune cells in alloge- neic therapies may be associated with\" reactions from the host and the foreig n cells against each other. J.A. 573. It would be necessary \"to test immune cells for reactivity and cytotoxicity against allogeneic normal host cells in vitro prior to developing treatments . . . in vivo .\" Id. There was no testimony here that such an adverse reaction was likely in this context, and there was no testimony that this well -known, general pheno - menon (that administering foreign cells in to a host could cause untoward reactions) would prevent a skilled artisan from trying NK -92 cells in vivo while undertak- ing the necessary and known precautions. If the need for such pre -administration trials could prevent secur- ing a patent, then no patent on in vivo therapy would ever issue before clinical trials were complete. While that appears to have been Dr. Miller 's own view,6 that view does not correspond to the existing standard for patentability. See PharmaStem , 491 F.3d at 1364 (\"[A] rule of law equating un - 6 Dr. Miller stated the following during deposition: Q. Is there anything less than an in vivo study in mammals using NK -92 cells that could provide a reasonable expectation of success for the claimed method? A. . . . I'm not sure that there 's any predictability that I would be comfortable with, short of doing those types of ex- periments with the NK -92 cell argues that Yan taught away from substituting NK -92 for TALL -104 because it showed NK -92 in cyto- Appellant Br. 34 n.6. However, the appellant failed to mention that th is difference was actually the fact that \"[t]he NK92 [cell line] was highly cytotoxic towards all\" of the tumors tested, while TALL -104 only lysed four out of the thirteen tumors tested. J.A. 226. Therefore, NK-92 was much more efficacious than TALL -104, which would teach a skilled artisan toward the substi- tution. Fourth, NantKwest argues that Yan does not pro- vide a motivation to combine because it cautioned that extrapolating immunotherapy results from one context to another may be unpredictable. Specifically, Yan stated that \"our studies suggest that [immune cells '] cytotoxic activity towards [ cancer cells derived from laboratory] cell lines cannot be extrapolated to [ cancer ] cells derived directly from accompanied by care - ful study of the unique patterns of activity\" of the anti - tumor immune cells used. J.A. 226. Contrary to Miller 's assertion that this caveat \"admonishes against relying on in vitro tests to predict in vivo activity,\" J.A. 439, Yan is not in fact comparing in vitro and in vivo efficacies. In fact, Yan contains no in vivo ex- periments. Rather, Yan is cautioning against extrap-117a olating lysis results against tumors derived from cell lines to tumors derived directly from patients. And as the data shows, this cav eat applies only to TALL -104, but not NK-92.7 As discussed above, TALL -104 lysed three out of four types of cancer cells derived from laboratory cell lines, but only one out of nine types of cancer cells derived directly from pa- tients. In the same comparison, NK -92 lysed all of the four types of cancers derived from cell lines and all of the ni ne types of cancers derived directly from pa- tients. In other words, NK -92 showed no difference in lysis efficacy against laboratory cell line cancers and patient -derived cancers . Therefore, unlike TALL -104, which lyses cancer cells differently depending on their source, NK -92's efficacy appears to not be context - dependent. See Yan, J.A. 226. Fifth, NantKwest makes much of the differences be- tween T cells ' and NK cells ' cell-surface recep tors, to argue that these differences would have made it difficult to extrapolate NK -92 behavior from TALL -104's. How - ever, while Miller indeed highlights these differences, he conceded that \"NK -92 killing and T -ALL killing [of can- cer cells] has not, to in , been asso- ciated with the[ir] specific receptor pattern.\" Miller De - position, ECF 59 -1, at 34. Therefore, these cell -surface receptor differences are not material for the two cell lines ' similar ability to lyse cancer cells. 7 NantKwest also points out that a similar caveat is found in two other publications. See Appellant Br. 46 -47; J.A. 953; J.A. 961. Those caveats, like Yan 's, also apply only to TALL -104. 118a V NantKwest argues that even against a prima facie case of obviousness, i t had presented secondary con- siderations of nonobviousness that \"may raise a genu- ine issue of material fact that precludes summary . secondary considerations must always when present be considered en route to a determination of obviousness.\" In re Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended -Release Capsule Patent Litigation , 676 F.3d 1063, 1075 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quotation citation omitted). However , \"[f]or . . . secondary considerations to be accorded substantial weight, its proponent must establish a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention. . . . Moreover, secondary considerations . . prima facie , 616 F.3d 1231, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quotation marks and citation omitted). For secondary considerations of nonobviousness, NantKwest presents a news article announcing a $48 mil - lion investment in NantKwest as evidence of commer- cial success, and some results from NK -92's Phase I clinical trials as evidence of unexpected results. With respect to the investment, we agree with the district court that there is no direct nexus between the $48 million stock purchase and the merits of the claimed invention to demonstrate commercial success. The re - port indicates that the stock purchase was made for corporate control purposes. NantKwest also contends that it \"presented evi- dence of the 119a . . . recent . . . Phase I\" clinical trials. Appellant Br. 57. There is no evidence that the effi- cacy results were unexpected compared to what was expected based on the in vitro data. Indeed, as dis- cussed above, the in vitro data suggested that the in vivo trials would be successful. With respect to the Phase I trials ' safety results, there was no support for the conclusion that the NK -92 cell line was surprisingly safer than the TALL -104 cell line therapy. See Mil- ler, J.A. 393 -94 \u00b6 48, J.A. 396 \u00b6 53. We conclude that the district court properly gra nted summary judgment that claims 20, 26, and 27 were invalid as obvious. VI The dissent appears to agree that there is substan- tial evidence supporting the district court 's finding of obviousness. However, the dissent concludes that NantKwest submitted c ontrary evidence that raises genuine issues of material fact. The two cases cited by the dissent for the proposi- tion that \"lesser evidence [than what is presented here was] sufficient to reverse rejections by the PTO in the past\" are clearly distinguishabl e. Dissent Op. 876 -77. As discussed above, both Carroll 's and Gangadharam 's holdings are highly fact -specific. In Carroll , the court held that the prior art on the in vitro use of an antibi- otic did not render its in vivo use obvious because there was a teaching away from in vivo extrapolation for that specific antibiotic. In re Carroll , 601 F.2d at 1186 . Carroll does not discuss in vivo extrapolation generally. In Gangadharam , the court simply found that \"in this case,\" the USPTO failed to \"carr[y] its burden of proving a prima facie case of obviousness\" because the sole prior made \"general referenc e . . of in vivo applications. 1989 WL 127023, at *1 -2. Here, in contrast, there is in fact teaching towards the invention. The dissent also reads Vujanovic, Yan, and Cesano \u2014as well as Miller 's testimony concerning these studies \u2014as creating genuine issues of material fact. The cited passages do not show what Miller argues. First, the dissent cites Vujanovic for the teaching that \"[w]e suggest that standard in vitro cytotoxicity assays with target cells in suspensions have little rele- vance in predicting the in vivo antitumor activity of effector cells.\" J.A. 962 (emphasis added). This is merely stating that a certain type of experiment setup (\"cells in suspension\" assay) is not suitable for predict- ing in vivo results. Indeed, the very next sentence addresses spheroids assays and concludes that \"[o]ur results further imply that in vitro assessment of effec- tor cell functions with multicellular CA spheroids [as- says] instead of CA cell suspensions [assays] or mono- layers [assays] might be of greater relevance in pre- dicting the in vivo therapeutic antitumor po tential cells.\" Id; see also J.A. 956. There- fore, this passage does not support Miller 's testimony that Vujanovic \"caution[s] against relying on in vitro cytotoxicity results .\" J.A. 458 (emphasis added) . Second, the dissent cites Yan for the teaching that \"our studies suggest that cytotoxic activity towards 121a leukemic cell lines cannot be extrapolated to cells de- rived directly from patients. The use of such biologic reagents in vitro or in vivo for immunotherapy or purging must be accompanied by careful study of the[ir] unique patterns of activity. . . . \" J.A. 226. From this, Miller concludes that \"Yan admonishes against relying on in vitr o tests to predict in vivo ac- tivity.\" J.A. 439 -40. However, as discussed above, the cited passage from Yan is speaking about the dif- ferences in lysis efficacy against tumors from cell lines versus against tumors derived directly from patients. All of the experiments presented in Yan were per- formed in vitro (albeit for the purpose of studying the potential of using NK-92 and TALL -104 in vivo ). This Yan passage therefore cannot provide support for Miller 's warning against in vivo extrapolation. Third, the dissent cites Cesano for the teaching that \"the sensitivity of the dogs ' tumors to TALL -104 cell lysis in vitro did not appear to be a good indicator of clinical responses.\" J.A. 953. This sentence does not address NK -92 and, as discussed above, NK -92 was shown to be more efficacious than TALL -104. There- fore, this would actually teach a skilled artisan toward substituting NK -92 for TALL -104 (as Yan suggested to do). \"When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, . . . a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judg- ment.\" Scott v. Harris , 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007) . That is the situation here. Miller 's reading of the prior art is contradicted 122a by the art itself. Miller 's testimony thus does not raise genuine issues of material fact. AFFIRMED STOLL , Circuit Judge, dissenting. Absent the procedural safeguards provided to the non-moving party at the summary judgment stage, I might very well agree with the majority that the PTO demonstrated the obviousness of these claims. When evaluating a c ase on appeal from summary judgment, however, \"[t]he evidence of the non -movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 ( 1986) . NantKwest submitted evidence and accompanying ex- pert testimony showing that an ordinarily skilled artisan at the time of the invention would not have had a rea- sonable expectation of success in combining Santoli 's in vivo results for TALL -104 cells with Gong 's in vitro experiments for NK -92 cells. Drawing all reasonable in - ferences in favor of NantKwest, as we must, this evi- dence creates a genuine dispute of material fact that bars the grant of summary judgment. Because t he majority explains away NantKwest 's evidence instead of giving it the weight required by law, I respectfully dissent. I. As an initial matter, the difference between in vitro and in vivo testing is critical to understanding the dif - ficulty in using resul ts from the former to predict effi- cacy in the latter. In vitro experiments typically 123a occur in the controlled environment of a petri dish or test tube; in vivo experiments are performed in a living organism. J.A. 886. Experiments in vitro cannot ac - count for the variable environment of a living organism and cannot replicate a cell line 's interaction with the host 's immune system, among other things. J.A. 384, \u00b6 24; J.A. 886. This disparity in testing environments can lead to unpredicted in vivo results. For example, cell lines with encouraging cytotoxic activity in vitro can unexpectedly lose all activity in vivo . J.A. 414, \u00b6 93. The host 's immune system can even destroy the cell line, rendering it ineffective in vivo . Id. It is also possible for the cell line to trigger severe immune reactions in the host that produce serious complica- tions. J.A. 393, \u00b6 47. Therefore, demonstrated cyto- toxic activity in vitro does not always translate to suc- cess in vivo . II. The presence of each claimed element in the prior art is insufficient to render a claim obvious. Rather, there also must be a motivation to combine the prior art and an ordinarily skilled artisan must have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so. Kinetic Concepts, Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc. , 688 F.3d 1342, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and ci - tations omitted). Whether a skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success is a question of fact, Cumberland Pharm. Inc. v. Mylan Institutional (Fed. Cir. 2017) , and con- temporaneous evidence of what skilled artisans thought at the time of the invention can help inform our inquiry into whether the expectation of success was reasonable. In re Carroll , 601 F.2d 1184, 1186 -87 (C.C.P.A. 1979) . 124a When determining whether a person of ordinary skill possessed a reasonable expectation of success in pre- dicting in vivo efficacy based on in vitro results, we have recognized that \"simply because a drug gives positive results in vitro , it does not necessar ily follow that there is a reasonable probability of success for therapeutic use of that drug in vivo .\" In re Gan- gadharam , 889 F.2d 1101, WL 127023, Cir. 1989) -precedential) (citing Carroll , 601 F.2d at 1186 ). The majority concludes that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine Santoli with Gong because Santoli demonstrated in vivo efficacy for TALL -104 cells, Gong detailed NK-92's in vitro ability to lyse cancer cells, and the prior art in dicated a desire to seek clinical applications for the NK -92 cell line. Maj. Op. 867 -69. NantKwest 's arguments that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation of success in combining Santoli with Gong were not persuasive to the majority in light of the \"over -whelming specific evidence that a skilled artisan could rea sonably extrapo- late from the in vitro data with respect to TALL -104 and NK-92 that would reasonably teach their successful sub- stitution in vivo .\" Maj. Op. 870. In reaching its conclu- sion, the majority failed to give NantKwest 's evidence the weight it des erved and declined to draw all reasonable in - ferences in NantKwest 's favor. Numerous contemporaneous references identified by NantKwest warned that in vitro results were not predictive of in vivo efficacy in this field. For exam- ple, the Vujanovic referenc e questioned the correlation between in vitro studies and in vivo behavior for the 125a NK-92 cell line: \"We suggest that standard in vitro cytotoxicity assays with target cells in suspension s have little relevance in predicting the in vivo antitumor activity of effector cells.\" J.A. 962 (emphasis added). As confirmed by Dr. Miller, this passage from Vuja- novic \"caution[s] against relying on in vitro cytotoxicity results, such as those in Gong, to predict in vivo be- havior.\" J.A. 458, \u00b6 9 4. Yan contains similar warnings. Yan concluded his comparison of NK -92 and TALL -104 cells by noting: \"[O]ur studies suggest that cytotoxic activity towards leukemic cell lines cannot be extrapo- lated to cells derived directly from patients. The use of such biologic reagents in vitro or in vivo for immu- notherapy or purging must be accompanied by careful study of the unique patterns of activity. . . . \" J.A. 226 (emphasis added). Dr. Miller reiterated that \"Yan admonishes against relying on in vitro tests to predict in vivo activity,\" which was co nsistent with \"the common understanding in the art.\" J.A. 439 -40, \u00b6 48. Finally, in Cesano 's article describing a Phase I Clini- cal Trial for TALL -104 in dogs, the authors acknowl- edged that, \"[s]urprisingly, the sensitivity of the dogs ' tumors to TALL -104 cell lysis in vitro did not appear to be a good indicator of clinical responses.\" J.A. 953 (emphasis added). NantKwest 's evidence and supporting expert testi- mony laid bare the uncertainty in this complex field. As Dr. Miller explained, the authors in th e above ref- erences did not feel confident in predicting in vivo ac- tivity based on in vitro experiments at the time of the invention. J.A. 439 -40, \u00b6 48; J.A. 458, \u00b6 94. This cre - ates a dispute of material fact regarding the reasonable expectation of success. In my view, the majority 's willingness to discredit Dr. Miller 's understanding of 126a the disclosures in Vujanovic and Yan does not dispose of the genuine dispute of material fac t. Although the majority believes its view of the prior art references is superior to Dr. Miller 's, its analysis is not supported by citations to the USPTO 's expert report or the district court opinion. See Maj. Op. 873 -74. Dr. Miller 's opinion, on the other hand, is illuminated by the back- ground knowledge of a skilled artisan in this field, and I am not convinced that his opinion lacks support in the record. The result is a genuine dispute of material fact that I believe is not suited for resolution at the sum- mary judgment stage. Indeed, we have found lesser evidence sufficient to reverse rejections by the PTO in the past. In Carroll , for example, the PTO 's Board of Appeals rejected as obvious claims of a patent for treating M. paratubercu- losis with lauric acid based on the patentee 's master 's thesis. The thesis disclosed two types of studies: 1) in vitro studies, from which the patentee reported that lauric acid completely inhibited the growth of three strains of M. paratuberculosis , and 2) in vivo studies, from wh ich the patentee reported the suitabil- ity of a certain strain of C57 black mice as laboratory animals for studying the diseases caused by M. para- tuberculosis . Carroll , 601 F.2d at 1185 . An expert in the field, Dr. Merkal, discounted the patentee 's thesis at the time of its publication because, among other reasons, \" in vitro testing was an unreliable indicator for the in vivo effectiveness.\" Id. at 1186 . When the patentee sought a patent for his late r discovery that mammals can be treated with lauric acid orally to treat M. paratuberculosis , the PTO argued that the claims were obvious because his earlier thesis disclosed lauric acid's activity in vitro and that mice were suitable 127a animals for studying the disease. Id. at 1185 -86. Our predecessor court disagreed with the PTO, relying principally on Dr. Merkal 's \"contemporaneous evalua- tion of appellant 's thesis[ ] that one skilled in this art would have given no weight to the findings reported therein.\" Id. at 1186 -87 (emphasis added). Similarly, in Gangadharam , we held that the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences erred in finding a reasonable expectation of success for using CQQ to treat tuberculosis in mammals ( in vivo ) based on in vitro results. Gangadharam , 1989 WL 127023, at *3 (nonprecedential). The Board relied on a single ref- erence authored in part by the applicant to reject the claims. It found that the Gangadharam reference 's disclosure of \"very positive in vitro bactericidal activity of CQQ against the [pertinent] bacteria reported by Gangadharam certainly favors the in vivo use of said compound in the treatment of tuberculosis in mam- mals.\" Id. at *1 . But simply \"[r]ema rking that the positive in vitro results 'favored ' use in vivo does not meet the statutory standard,\" we explained, and therefore the PTO \"fell woefully short of its burden\" to establish a reasonable expectation of success. Id. at *2. Importantly, the Gangadhara m reference con- tained a proviso that further studies were needed \"be- fore CQQ can be suggested as a possible antimycobac- terial drug for treating humans with [ tuberculosis ],\" and a contemporaneous article warned that in vitro tests were neither equivalent to, nor a substitute for, in vivo experiments. Id. at *2 -3. Because \"there [wa]s evidence in this record . . . regarding the noncor- relation of in vivo from in vitro efficacy generally and with respect to tuberculosis ,\" we found that the PTO failed to de monstrate a reasonable expectation of suc-128a cess. Id. at *3 ; see also Abbott Labs. v. Sandoz, Inc. , 544 F.3d 1341, 1350 -52 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (affirming non - obviousness in context of district court 's grant of pre- liminary injunction because, inter alia , the patentee 's evidence demonstrated that \"it was not predictable\" how an antibiotic would perform in vivo based on in vitro experiments using a closely related antibiotic). As was the case with both Carroll and Gangadharam , the record here contains ample evidence that persons of ordinary skill in the art were skeptical about the ability of in vitro tests to predict in vivo efficacy for the two relevant cell lines. Vujanovic, Yan, and Cesano \u2014in the very s ame articles where they discussed the promising in vitro results for the NK -92 and TALL -104 cell lines \u2014proceeded to expressly caution against in - ferring efficacy in vivo based on these outcomes. A reasonable reading of these references supports the conclu sion that one skilled in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation of success in combining Santoli 's in vivo testing for TALL -104 with Gong 's NK-92 cell line. Because NantKwest is the non - movant at the summary judgment stage, it is a rea- sonable inference that we must draw in its favor. See Anderson , 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505 . III. Our standard of review for the grant of summary judgment requires us to believe the evidence of the non-movant and to draw all reasonable inferences in its favor. The majority did neither in finding th e claims in NantKwest 's patent application obvious. Accord- ingly, I respectfully dissent. 129a APPENDIX E UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA ALEXANDRIA DIVISION Case No. 1:13 -cv-01566 -GBL -TCB CONK WEST , INC., PLAINTIFF v. MICHELLE K. LEE, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE , DEFENDANT Filed : Sept. 2, 2015 MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant Michelle K. Lee 's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 44); Plaintiff CoNKwest, Inc. 's Motion in Limine to Preclude Defendant from Relying on Evidence not Timely Disclosed Under Rule 26(A)(2) (Doc. 33); Plain- tiff's Motion in Lim ine to Preclude Defendant from Relying on the Inventor 's Work Published Within a Year of the Filing Date (Doc. 35); Plaintiff 's Motion in Limine to Preclude Defendant from Relying on Post - Filing References as Prior Art or in Support of Obvi- ousness (Doc. 38); and Defendant 's Motion in Limine (Doc. 39). This case arises from the United States Patent and Trademark Office 's (\"USPTO\") denial of Plaintiff CoNKwest Inc. 's (\"CoNKwest\") patent. The 130a USPTO found that the claims of CoNKwest 's Patent Application No. 10/008,955 (the \" '955 application\") would have been obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) to a hypothetical person of skill in the art. CoNKwest seeks a judgment, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 , that it is entitled to a patent for the invention specified in claims 20, 26, and 27 of the '955 application. The issue before the Court is whether the Court should grant Defendant 's Motion for Summ ary Judg- ment, where Defendant argues that CoNKwest 's pa- tent application is obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) , while Plaintiff argues that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated to combine the prior art references and that t here are genuine issues of material fact in dispute which cannot be resolved on summary judgment. The Court GRANTS Defend- ant's Motion for Summary Judgment, because there is no genuine material factual dispute that the invention claimed in the '955 application is obvious over the prior art, as found by both the Patent Examiner and the Patent Trial and Appeals Board. There is no dispute that, together, the Santoli and Gong prior art refer- ences disclose all the elements of the claimed invention. Even considering the new evidence, it is clear that a person of skill in the art in 1997 would have had a rea- sonable expectation of success and a motivation to com- bine the prior art references. Additionally, CoN Kwest 's secondary consideration evidence is unpersuasive. I. BACKGROUND CoNKwest Inc., the assignee of the '955 application, brings this action seeking this Court 's reversal of a Patent Trial and Appeal Board 's (the \"Board\") deci- sion, which rejected the methods claimed in the 131a '955 application as obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) . The '955 application claims an in vivo method of treat- ing a cancer by administering the NK -92 cell line to a mammal to recognize and lyse cancer cells. CoNK- west seeks to present additional evidence supporting the patentability of its claims pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 . CoNKwest challenges two of the Board find- ings underlying the prima facie case of obviousness against its claims; namely, that (1) the prior art pro- vides a motivation to combine the prior art according to CoNKwest 's claims; and (2) the prior art provides a reasonable expectation of success for the claimed method. A. The '955 Application The '955 application, titled \"Natural Killer Cell Lines and Methods of Use\" was filed December 7, 2001. (Doc. 10 -2 at 1.) Hans Klingemann, M.D., Ph.D (\"Ap- plicant\") is listed as the sole inventor on the '955 appli- cation. (Id.) The '955 application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/045,885, which was filed on April 30, 1 997. (Id. at 4.) The parties agree that April 30, 1997 is the relevant date to deter- mine the knowledge comprising the prior art against CoNKwest 's claims. (Doc. 50 at 1 and 4.) The claims of the '955 application cover a method of treating cancer in a mammal or a human by administering NK -92 cells to recognize and lyse cancer cells in vivo , i.e., in the mammal or the human. (Doc. 10 -2.) On June 6, 2002, prior to any examination on the merits, the USPTO published the '955 application. On January 27, 2005, having not received an examination on the merits of the invention, Applicant sent a \"Status Inquiry\" to the USPTO not ing that \"[t]o date, Appli-132a cant[ ] ha[s] not received an Official A ction on the mer- its.\" (Doc. 10 -5 at 96.) On September 7, 2006, the PTO, through Primary Examiner Ronald Schwadron, mailed a Restriction Requirement requiring Applicant to elect only a single group of claims to be examined on the merits. (Doc. 10 -6 at 28.) The Examiner required an election of one of: Group I claims (claims 1 -9), Group II claims (claims 10 -19), or Group III claims (claims 20 -29). (Id.) On October 6, 2006, Applicant filed a response to the Restriction Requirement in which Applica nt elected the claims of Group III (claims 20-29) for examination on the merits, and withdrew the claims of Groups I and II (claims 1 -19) from considera- tion. (Id. at 30 -36.) On December 28, 2006, Exam- iner Schwadron mailed a second Restriction Require- ment requiring Applicant to elect, from among claims 20-29, only a \"single disclosed species for prosecution on the merits.\" (Id. at 38.) In particular, the Exam- iner required an election of one of: Species A (\"method of treating a cancer or a pathogenic virus\"), or Species B (\"method using cells wherein HLA expression has been inhibited or wherein the cells have been transfected with a vector encoding a cytokine or the cells of claim 28\"). (Id. at 38 -42.) On April 27, 2007, Applicant filed a response to the second Restriction Requirement electing Species A related to treating cancer as claimed in claims 20, 22, 23, 26, and 27 for examination on the merits, and withdrawing claims 21, 24, 25, 28, and 29 from consideration. (Id. at 50 -61.) Applicant also amended claim 20 to comply with the Examiner 's elec- tion requirement. (Id.) On June 5, 2007, more than five years after the filing of the '955 application, the USPTO mailed its first Office Action on the merits of Applicant 's invention. 133a (Id. at 64.) Examiner Schwadron notified Applicant that claims 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30 and 31 were rejected as not patentable on the grounds of non -statutory obviousness -type double patenting over the claims of co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/701,359 and under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) as being unpatentable over a journal article authored by Gong et al., Characteriza- tion of a Human Cell Line (NK -92) with P henotypical and Functional Characteristics of Activated Natural Killer Cells , 8 LEUKEMIA 652-658 (1994) (\"Gong\"), in view of U.S. Patent No. 5,272,082 issued to Santoli et al. (\"Santoli\"). (Id. at 64 -71.) On October 5, 2007, Applicant filed an Amendment and Response to the first Office Action. (Id. at 81.) Responding to the rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) , Applicant explained why he believed that Gong, in view of Santoli, did not render obvious cl aims 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30 and 31. (Id. at 81 -95.) On April 15, 2008, Ex- aminer Schwadron mailed a Final Office Action reject- ing claims 20, 22, 26, 27, and 30 as obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) .1 (Doc. 11 -2 at 70.) On October 15, 2008, Applicant filed a Request for Continued Examination, accompanied by a Declaration of Hans Klingemann, the inventor and Applicant, to provide an expert opinion explaining why claims 20, 22, 26, 27, and 30 would not have been obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) over Gong in view of Santoli. (Id. at 84.) On March 24, 2009, Examiner Schwadron mailed a Final Office Action rejecting claims 20, 22, 26, 27, and 1 The final Office Action addressed claims 20, 22, 26, 27, and 30. Only claims 20, 26, and 27 are at issue here. The Patent Examiner listed claims 23, and 31 as withdrawn. 134a 30 on the same grounds as those previously set forth in the Final Office Action. (Doc. 11 -4 at 55 -65.) Only claims 20, 26, and 27 of the '955 application are at issue here. Claims 20, 26, and 27, of the '955 appli- cation recite: 20. A method of trea ting a cancer in vivo in a mammal comprising th e step of administering to the mammal a medium comprising an NK -92 cell line ATCC Deposit No. CRL -2407, wherein said cancer is recognized and lysed by said NK -92 cell line. 26. The method of treating a cancer described in claim 20 wherein the route of administration of the cells to the mammal is intravenous and the mammal is human. 27. The method o f treating a cancer described in claim 20 furth er comprising the step of administer- ing to said mammal a cytokine that promotes the growth of said NK -92 cell line. B. Prior Art Claims 20, 26, and 27 were rejected as obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 over the combined teachings of Daniela Santoli et al. , U.S. Patent No. 5,272,082 (Santoli patent, Doc. 45 -2 at 2.) ; and Jiang -Hong Gong, \"Characteriza- tion of a Human Cell Line (NK -92) with Phenotypical and Functional Characteristics of Activated Natural Kill Cells,\" Leukemia 8:652 (1994) (Gong, Doc. 45 -2 at 15.). The Examiner found that the two prior art pub- lications disclosed all of the limitations of the claims. (Doc. 11 -4 at 55 -65.) Santoli 's patent discloses that cells of th e TALL -104 cell line recognize and lyse cells from several cancer 135a cell lines (i.e., K562, U937, Raji, patent, at col.13, .17-37.) Santoli 's patent also discloses that TALL -104 cells stop cancer cell growth and prolonged survival when administered to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice \u2014i.e., a breed of mic e with a highly ineffective immune sys- tem that is easily modified, as in Dr. Santoli 's experi- ments, to develop cancers like leukemia . (Santoli patent, at col.14, ll.7 -13.) The TALL -104 cell line is an immortalized (or transformed) cell line, developed from the peripheral blood cells of a human patient with a form of leukemia . (Santoli patent, at col.4, (1991)). Santoli 's patent discloses that, \"when compared to LAK cells from normal donors (i.e., a mixture of NK cells and T cells), TALL -104 cells display higher killing efficiency against more tumor targets.\" (Santoli pa- tent, at col.4, ll .31-35.) In addition to the work dis- closed in Santoli 's patent, Dr. Santoli and Dr. Alessan- dra Cesano published studies showing that, like NK cells, TALL -104 cells recognize and lyse a variety of solid tumor cell lines and leukemic cell lines, e.g., the K562 leukemia cell line. (See Doc. 45 -4 at 2.) Based on these in vitro results, Drs. Cesano and Santoli tested TALL -104 cells in vivo and published data showing that TALL -104 cells display an aggressive pattern of tumor infiltration and tumor cell lysis when administered in vivo to SCID mice. (Doc. 45 -5 at 6; see also Santo li patent, at col.14, ll.8 -13.) Around the time Drs. Cesano and Santoli reported the use of the TALL -104 cell line in adoptive therapies, Drs. Gong and Klingemann reported the development of the NK -92 cell line from the peripheral blood cells of a human pa tient with a leukemia . (Gong, at 1.) Gong 136a teaches that NK -92 cells are able to lyse the cells of a variety of human leukemic cell lines, including K562 cells, Daudi cells, TF -1 cells, and ML -193 cells. (Gong, at p.654, right col.) Based on these and other characteristics, Gong states that NK -92 cells have \"the phenotypical and ed] NK cells.\" (Gong, at p.652, right col.) More than a year before he filed the '955 application, Dr. Klinge- mann also co -authored an abstract for presentation at a national scientific meeting disclosing \"data showing the immunological purging of leukemic cells from blood cell preparations using the highly cytotoxic cells from the clone NK -92. . . (Doc. 46 -5 12.) This ab- stract describes these data as \"suggest[ing] that the cytotoxic NK -92 clone could be used as an efficient tool for immunological ex vivo purging.\" (Id.) In 1995, Yan et al. also published the results of head -to-head comparisons of NK -92 cells and TALL - 104 cells. (Doc. 45 -7 at 27.) Yan (1995) discloses that \"[r]ecent studies have shown that the human MHC un - restricted T cell clone T[ALL]104 and natural killer cell clone NK -92 are cytotoxic to human leukemic cell lines without toxicity towards normal [ blood cell] pro- genitors.\" Id. Yan (1995) also states that \"[t]o study the potential of using biological reagents in adoptive immunotherapy , we tested the tumoricidal capacity of [TALL -104 and NK -92].\" Id. Yan (1995) further re - ports that, while TALL -104 cells were cytotoxic to cer - tain cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells, NK -92 cells were \"highly cytotoxic towards all cell lines and primary tumor [cell targets].\" Id. In the mid -1980s \u2014i.e., prior to the development of the TALL -104 and NK -92 cells lines \u2014researchers had 137a previously developed cancer therapies based on the tumoricidal activity of LAK cells, i.e., mixed popula- tions of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells derived fro m peripheral blood activated in vitro with the cytokine IL-2. (See, e.g. , Ex.46 -1 at 2.) LAK cells had shown initial success in at least two types of therapeutic re- gimes: (1) in vivo therapies in which a patient 's LAK cells were activated by the adminis tration of IL -2; and (2) ex vivo therapies in which a patient 's peripheral blood mononuclear cells were removed from the body, activated with IL -2, and then returned back to the patient. (Id.; see also Doc. 45 -7 at 29; Doc. 45 -8; and Doc. 46 -1 at 12.) Santoli 's patent further discloses that TALL -104 may be used in \"a method of treating human cancers , including leukemias , by administering to a patient an effective tumoricidal amount of a modified cytotoxic T-ALL cell lines preferably TALL -104.\" (Santoli patent, at col.10, ll.19.) Santoli 's patent also discloses that this method \"may be performe d either in vivo or ex vivo , depending on the type of cancer to be treated.\" (Santoli patent, at col.10, ll.30 -31.) Santoli 's patent describes the intravenous administration of TALL -104 cells to human patients. (Santoli patent, at col.10, ll.52 -54) (\"For human patients, the T -ALL cells may be inject ed intravenously (i.v.).\"). C. The Examiner 's Findings The Examiner found that it would have been prima facie obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art (\"POSA\") in April 1997 to combine the teachings of Santoli and Gong to arrive at the claimed method \"be- cause Gong et al. teach[es] use of NK -92 cells to lyse tumor cells, while Santoli et teach[es] in vivo use of 138a cytotoxic cell lines.\" (Doc. 13 -4 at 92.) The Examin- er further found that a POSA would have been moti- vated to create the claimed invention because \"Santoli et al. teach that lytic human derived cell lines can be used in vivo to treat disease o r in preclinical in vivo studies ( see column 10) whilst NK -92 was . . . known [by persons in the art to also be a] human derived lytic cell line.\" (Doc. 13 -4 at 94.) The Examiner also found motivation to use the NK -92 cell line in Dr. Santoli 's method based on Dr. Santoli 's disclosure that \"there is a need for therapeutic methods for treating cancers using cytotoxic cell lines because said cell lines avoid the need to produce LAK cells derived from the partic- ular patient.\" (Doc. 13 -4 at col.2, ll.32 The Examiner explained that \"[t]he fact that NK -92 cells an d TALL 104 can lyse different types of tumors (as per the in vitro data that was disclosed in the prior art) would lead a [POSA] to use NK -92 . . . to treat not lysed by TALL -104 cells.\" (Doc. 13 -4 at 99.) Second, the Examiner found that the prior art provided a reasonable expectation of success for the claimed method because \"Santoli et al. had already established that a lytic cell line with in vitro activity could be used in vivo to lyse target cells/treat disease.\" (Id.) Further, the Examiner found that \"[t]he lytic properties of the NK -92 cells in in vitro assays [were] already known in the art.\" (Id. at 101.) Applicants appealed the Examiner 's decision to the Board. D. The Administrative Appeal On September 15, 2009, Applicant filed a notice of appeal from the Examiner to the Board of Patent Ap- peals and Interferences (now the PTAB). (Doc. 11 -4 139a at 90.) On July 9, 2010, Examiner Schwadron sua sponte reopened prosecution by mailing a non -final Office Action, thereby terminating Applicant 's appeal. (Doc. 12 -3 at 89.) Examiner Schwadron again reject- ed claims 20, 22, 26, 27, and 30. (Id.) On December 20, 2010, Examiner Schwadron mailed a Final Office Action rejecting claims 20, 26, 27, and 30. (Doc. 13 -2 at 101.) The Examiner withdrew the rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 , but maintained the other two rejec- tions. (Doc. 13 -3 at 1 -8.) On March 18, 2011, Appli- cant once again appealed the Examiner 's decision by filing a Notice of Appeal with the Board of Patent Ap- peals and Interferences (now the PTAB). (Id. at 21.) On January 9, 2013, having received no communica- tion from the PTAB since the second appeal was dock- eted on January 27, 2012, Applicant filed a \"Request for Status\" with the PTAB reque sting a status update. (Doc. 14 -1 at 16.) On October 25, 2013, after more than 11 years and 10 months since the filing of the '955 application, the PTAB issued a \"Decision On Appeal\" affirming -in-part and reversing in -part the Examiner 's December 20, 2010 Final Office Action. (Id. at 30 -40.) The Board affirmed the Examiner 's rejection, con- cluding that \"the Examiner ha[d] set forth a prima facie case that it would have been obvious to administer NK-92 in vivo to a mammal to treat cancer .\" (Id. at 33.) The Board agreed with the Examiner 's finding that a POSA would have been motivated to replace the TALL -104 cells in Santoli 's method with NK -92 cells based upon Gong 's disclosure that \"'NK-92 cells sponta- neously kill K562 [ leukemia ] and Daudi [ lymphoma ] cells with high efficiency. '\" (Id. at 34 (Gong, at pp. 653-654).) This appeal followed. 140a E. The Present Civil Action On December 20, 2013, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 , CoNKwest filed its Complaint seeking a judgment that it is entitled to a patent for the invention specified in claims 20, 26, and 27 of the '955 application. (Doc. 1.) On May 11, 2015, Defendant USPTO timely filed De- fendant 's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 44.) Plaintiff CoNKwest filed its opposition on May 29, and Defendant filed its Reply Memorandum of Law in Sup - port of Defendant 's Motion for Summary Judgment on June 9. (Docs. 53 and 59.) Defendant 's motion is now properly before the Court. 1. New Evidence Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 , Plaintiff may present to this Court, new evidence relevant to disputed issues of fact that was not presented to the USPTO. CoNK- west produced three expert reports by Dr. Jeffrey S. Miller to support the patentability of claims 20, 26, a nd 27. (Doc. 46 -8.) The USPTO likewise produced an ex- pert report by Dr. Lewis L. Lanier as additional evi - dence that the Board correctly found these claims ob - vious. (Doc. 53 -4.) During the examination and appeals processes, CoNKwest relied solely on t he testimony of Dr. Klinge - mann, the inventor. (Doc. 53 at 19 -23.) Here, CoNK- west presents for the first time new evidence in the form of expert testimony by a person of ordinary skill in the art \u2014Dr. Miller. (Id.) Dr. Miller bases part of his opinion on the notion that the Board and Examiner both misunderstood the prior art, including the mistaken assumption that isolated NK cells has been used in vivo, in patients, to treat cancer , prior to the invention. 141a (Doc. 53 at 21.) Dr. Miller testifies that pure NK cel ls had never been used to treat patients prior to the in- vention. (Doc. 46 -8 at \u00b6 41.) Dr. Miller 's expert report also explores the differences between LAK cells and NK -92 cell lines and notes that LAK therapy had been found to be toxic and ineffective prior to CoNK- west 's invention. (Id. at \u00b6 37 -40.) Plaintiff asserts that these findings call into question \"whether the prior art LAK teaching have any application to the claimed invention or otherwise support motivation to combine.\" (Doc. 53 at 22.) Dr. Miller also notes that the Board failed to appre- ciate that Santoli attributes activity to T cells, and thus LAK studies would have provided motivation to pursue T cells, not NK cells. (Doc. 46 -8 at \u00b6 41.) In his ex - pert report, Dr. Miller, goes on to further opine that the primary references, Santoli and Gong, actually teach away from the invention. (Id. at \u00b6 23.) For in - stance, Dr. Miller points to the fact that Santoli 's use of unmodified TALL -104 caused cancer and rapid death in the host animal, which is why Santoli used a suicide gene. (Id.) The NK -92 cell lines used here do not require a suicide gene and thus Dr. Miller testifies that a POSA would have expected NK -92 cells to cause can- cer and rapid death. (Id. at \u00b6 88.) Moreover, Dr. Miller states that Gong teaches that NK -92 cells are IL-2 dependent, while Santoli teaches that IL -2 is toxic to patients, thus the combination of Gong and Santoli would require co -administration of toxic IL -2 to an ani- mal or human. (Id.) Dr. Miller also provides opinion testimony as to why the differences between NK -92 and TALL -104 cells would lead a POSA to expect dif- ferent behavior in a mammalian host when using dif- ferent cell types. (Id. at \u00b6 20 -25.) 142a Plaintiff argues, based on Dr. Miller 's testimony, that there exists a material dispute of fact as to the reasonable expectation of success a POSA wo uld have had in April 1997. (Doc. 53 at 18.) CoNKwest also argues that its objective evidence of non -obviousness further supports the patentability of the claimed inven- tion. Specifically, Plaintiff relies on an article entitled \"L.A. Billionaire Invests $48M in S.D. Cancer Biotech CoNKwest\" (\"Fikes\" ) to establish evidence of objective indicia of non -obviousness based on commercial suc- cess, secondary considerations of unexpectedly superi- or results, long felt need, and failure of others, with re - spect to the use of NK -92 cells for treatment of cancer . (Doc. 46 -3.) Defendant presents the expert report of Lewis L. Lanier, Ph.D., who opines that the prior art provided a motivation to combine and a reasonable expectation of success. (Doc. 53 -4.) II. STANDARD OF REVIEW A. Summary Judgment Standard Under Federal Rul e of Civil Procedure 56 , the Court must grant summary judgment if the moving party demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (2013). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court views the facts in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Boitnott v. Corning, Inc. , 669 F.3d 172, 175 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986) ). Once a motion for summary judgment is properly made and support-143a ed, the opposing party has the burden of showing that a genuine dispute exists. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. , 475 U.S. 574, 586 -87 (1986) ; Bouchat v. Baltimore Ravens Football Club, Inc. , 346 F.3d 514, 522 (4th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). \"[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise pro- perly supported motion for summary judgment; the re - quirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.\" Emmett v. Johnson , 532 F.3d 291, 297 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Anderson , 477 U.S. at 247 -48). A \"material fact\" is a fact that might affect the out- come of a party 's case. Anderson , 477 U.S. at 248 ; JKC Holding Co. v. Wash. Sports Ventures, Inc. , 264 F.3d 459, 465 (4th Cir. 2001) . Whether a fact is considered to be \"material\" is determined by the sub- stantive law, and \"[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the g overning law will properly preclude the entry of summary judg- ment.\" Anderson , 477 U.S. at 248 ; Hooven -Lewis v. Caldera , 249 F.3d 259, 265 (4th Cir. 2001) . A \"genuine\" issue concerning a \"material\" fact aris- es when the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict in the nonmoving party 's favor. Resource Bankshares Corp. v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., 407 F.3d 631, 635 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting Ander- son, 477 U.S. at 248 ). Rule 56(e) requires the non- moving party to go beyond the pleadings and by its own affidavits, or by the depositions, answers to inter- rogatories, and admissions on file, designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986) . 144a B. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 Standard This civil action was brought pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 , which \"gives the Court the power to set aside any ruling refusing a patent and determine patenta bility de novo .\" Hitachi Koki Co., Ltd . v. Doll , 620 F. Supp. 4, v. Rogan , 323 F.3d 1000, 1004 (Fed. Cir. ; Newman v. Quigg , 877 F.2d 1575, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, in addition to the summary judgment standard of re view, this Court 's review under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 is guided by the adminis- trative record. See Johnson v. Rea , No. 1:12 -CV-440, 2013 WL 1499052, at *2 (E.D. Va. Apr. 9, 2013) . Section 145 provides that \"[a]n applicant dissatisfied with the decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in an appeal under section 134(a) may, unless appeal has been taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have remedy by civil action against the Director in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. . . . \" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 action under \u00a7 145 , \"the court may adjudge that [the] applicant is entitled to receive a paten t for his invention, as specified in any of his claims involved in the decision of the [USPTO], and as the facts in the case may appear and such adjudication shall authorize the Director to issue such a patent on compliance with the requirements of law.\" Id. Unlike applicants who seek review to the Federal Circuit, applicants who first seek review in this Court by civil action may present new evidence relevant to disputed issues of fact that was not presented to the USPTO. Kappos v. Hyatt , 132 S. Ct. 1690, 1696 (2012) . When an application does so, the Court \"must make de novo 145a factual finding that take account of both the new evidence and the administrative record before the [US]PTO.\" BTG Int 'l WL 6082910, at *4 (E.D. Va. Dec. 6, 2012) (quoting Hyatt , 132 S. Ct. at 1701 ) (internal quotation marks omitted). The evidentiary rules app licable to all civil actions govern \u00a7 145 actions, such that \u00a7 145 proceedings are subject to the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Fed- eral Rules of Civil Procedure. Hyatt , 132 S. Ct. at 1699 -1700 . The Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 145 actions \"should be conducted according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure and . . . should be prepared and heard upon all competent evi- dence adduced and upon the whole merits.\" Id. (quo- ting Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe , 112 U.S. 50, 61 (1884) ) (internal quotation marks omitted). Be- cause \"the district court acts as a fact finder when new evidence is introduced in a \u00a7 14 5 proceeding,\" it \"must assess the credibility of new witnesses and other evi- dence, determine how the new evidence comports with the existing administrative record, and decide what weight the new evidence deserves.\" Id. at 1700 . The standard of review of the new evidence must therefore \"[a]s a logical matter\" be \" de novo because [the district court] is the first tribunal to hear the evidence in ques- tion.\" Id. The Court retains discretion, however, to determine what weight to afford an applicant 's newly admitted evidence by considering the proceedings before the USPTO. Id. at 1700 . If the applicant presents no new evidence, this Court reviews the USPTO 's decision under the deferential standard provided by Adminis- Procedure Act 2013 WL 1499 052, at *2 . Thus, under the latter standard, the 146a Court will only set aside a Board decision that is arbi- trary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a) and Star Fruits S.N.C. v. United 393 F.3d 1277, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ). III. ANALYSIS The Court GRANTS Defendant 's Motion for Sum- mary Judgment, because there is no genuine material factual dispute as to whether the invention claimed in the '955 application was obvious over the prior art, as found by both the Exam iner and the Board. As an initial matter the Court first addresses the necessity to construe the claims at issue, particularly the term \" cancer \" as used in independent claim 20. Claim terms are given their ordinary and customary meaning, absent an explicit alternative definition pro- vided in the applic ant's specification. See In re Mor- ris, 127 F.3d 1048, 1054 (Fed. Cir. 1997) . Moreover, it is well -established that \u2014unlike the claims in an issued patent \u2014the claims in a patent application must be given t heir \"broadest reasonable interpretation con- sistent with the specification.\" See, e.g. Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2005) 415 F.2d 1393, 1404 -05 (C.C.P.A. 1969) . The Court finds that there is no dispute as to the definition of the term \" cancer .\" CoNKwest and the USPTO agree that \" cancer \" as used in the claims at issue means \"said cancer cells\" or in other words that the claims are directed at multiple \"cancer cells.\" The disagreement as to how many cancer cells the claims are directed to is immaterial to the ultimate question the Court must consider. While the Court finds no need to construe the term \" cancer ,\" the Court agrees 147a with Plaintiff that the term means a \"plurality or mul- tiple cancer cells.\" Title 35, United States Code, Section 145 (\"\u00a7 145 \") provides in pertinent part as follows: An applicant dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in an appeal under section 134(a) may, unless appeal has been taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have remedy by civil action against the Director in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. . . . The court may adjudge that s uch applicant is entitled to receive a patent for his invention, as specified in any of his claims involved in the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, as the facts in the case may appear and such adjudication shall authorize the Dire ctor to issue such patent on com- pliance with the requirements of law. In Hyatt , the Supreme Court considered (1) whether there are any limitations on a patent applicant 's ability to introduce new evidence before the district court in an action filed pursua nt to \u00a7 145 ; and (2) what standard of review the district court should apply when consid- ering new evidence. Hyatt , 132 S. Ct. at 1692 ). The Supreme Court first concluded that \"there are no evi- dentia ry restrictions beyond those already imposed by the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" Id. Hyatt also explicitly defines the only situation where consideration of the Board 's decision is permitted. The Court adopted the Federal Circuit 's rule that \"the district court may, in its discre- tion, 'consider the proceedings before and findings of the Patent Office in deciding what weight to afford an 148a applicant 's newly -admitted evidence. '\" Id. at 1700 (quoting Hyatt v. Kappos , 625 F.3d 1320, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ). Accordingly, where new evidence is sub- mitted, de novo review of the entire rec ord is required because the district court \"cannot meaningfully defer to the USPTO 's factual findings if the USPTO consid- ered a different set of facts.\" Id. The Court 's analysis is thus framed by three inter- secting legal frameworks: (1) the rules governi ng actions pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 , under which \"the district court must make de novo factual findings that take account of both the new evidence and the admin- istrative record before the PTO,\" Kappos v. Hyatt , 132 S. Ct. at 1701 ; (2) the obviousness standard which includes \"the scope and content of the prior art . . . ; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue . . . ; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art,\" Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kan. City , 383 U.S. 1, 17 (1966) ; and (3) the summary judgment standard, pursuant to which \"the movant [must] show[ ] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) , and the \"evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable infer- ences are to be drawn in his favor,\" Anderson , 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505 . In sum, the question before the Court is: has the Director shown th at no reasonable trier of fact could find that CoNKwest 's evidence outweighs the Direc- tor's own evidence regarding whether the claimed in - vention is obvious? Here, considering all the neces- sary legal framework, the Court holds that no reasona- ble trier of fact could find that the claimed invention was not obvious over the prior art. Accordingly, the 149a Court grants Defendant 's Motion for Summary Judge - ment. Each of the relevant legal frameworks are dis - cussed in turn. A. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 The Court is unpersuaded by the new evidence CoNKwest presents in the form of Dr. Miller 's expert reports and instead finds that the evidence supports the Board 's decision that the three claims at issue are obvious. Because Plaintiffs of fer new evidence to support their position with respect to the Board 's final rejection for obviousness, the Court employs a de novo standard as to the necessary factual findings, taking into account both Plaintiffs ' new evidence and the administrative reco rd. Hyatt , 132 S. Ct. at 1701 ; Johnson , 2013 WL 1499052, at *2 . Under Hyatt , a plaintiff in a \u00a7 145 ac- tion is entitled to present all evidence admissible under the rules of evidence as to al l claims, whether or not that evidence was first presented to the Board. Here, Plaintiff presented three expert reports from Dr. Jeffrey S. Miller to support the patentability of claims 20, 26, and 27. The USPTO likewise produced an expert report by Dr. Lewis L. Lanier as additional evidence that the Board correctly found these claims to be obvious. The Court, as instructed by Hyatt , consid- ered the newly presented evidence de novo along with the adminis trative record. As discussed above, CoNK- west presents for the first time new evidence in the form of expert testimony by an independent person of ordi- nary skill in the art \u2014Dr. Miller. (Doc. 53 at 19 -23.) In his expert report, Dr. Miller, opines that the pri- mary references, Santoli and Gong, actually teach away 150a from the invention. (Doc. 46 -8 at \u00b6 23.) For instance, Dr. Miller points to the fact that Santoli 's use of un- modified TALL -104 caused cancer and rapid death in the host animal, which is why Santoli used a suicide gene. (Id.) The NK -92 cell lines used here do not require a suicide gene and thus Dr. Miller testifies that a POSA would have expected NK -92 cells to cause cancer and rapid death. (Id. at \u00b6 88.) Moreover, Dr. Miller states that Gong teaches that NK -92 cells are IL-2 dependent, while Santoli teaches that IL -2 is toxic to patients, thus the combination of Gong and Santoli would require co -administration of toxic IL -2 to an ani - mal or human. (Id.) The Court is unpersuaded by Dr. Miller 's report and finds that the evidence , including the newly admitted evidence, supports the Board 's decision that the claims are obvious. Dr. Miller 's expert reports do not per- suade the Court as to the obviousness of the claims at issue. Particularly, the Court finds that it would have been obvious to administer the NK -92 cell line in vivo to a mammal to treat cancer , in light of the Gong and Santoli references. While the Court finds that Dr. Miller is a POSA, his conclusions stand in contrast to the prior art. The Court finds that a POSA in 1997 would have had motivation to combine the prior art with a reasonable expectation of success. B. Obviousness The Court finds that CoNKwest 's claimed invention would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art in 1997. Section 103(a) of Title 35 of the United States Code provides that a patent may not be obtained if the dif-151a ferences between the claimed invention \"as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) . In other words, under the patent statute, an invention that would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time of the invention is not patentable. Obviousness is a question of law to be decided by the Court and \"is focused on the scope of the patent in suit, not the pa- tentee 's goal in creating the patent.\" Pfizer Inc. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. , 803 F. Supp. 2d 409, 440 (E.D. Va. 2011) (citing KSR Int 'l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc. , 550 U.S. 398, 419 (2007) ). The factors guiding the ob - viousness inquiry are (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) the level of skill in the art; (3) diff erences between the claimed invention and the prior art; and (4) any relevant secondary considerations, including commercial success, long -felt but unsolved needs, and the failure of others. Graham v. John De ere Co. , 383 U.S. 1, 17 -18 (1966) ; DyStar Textilfarben GmbH & Co. v. C.H. Patrick Co. F.3d 1356, 1360 -61 (Fed. Cir. 2006) . A patent \"is not proved obvious merely by demon- strating that each of the ele ments was, independently, known in the prior art.\" Teleflex , 550 U.S. at 418 . \"[W]hen the prior art teaches away from combining certain known elements, discovery of a successful means of combining them is more likely to be nonobvi- ous.\" Id. at 416 . An inventor 's decision to act contrary to the accepted wisdom of the art is indicia of nonobvi- ousness. See United States v. Adams , 383 U.S. 39, 52 (1966) . However, if a person of ordinary skill, who is typically able to combine the teachings of multiple patents, is able to \"implement a predictable variation\" 152a based on that combination, then such variation is unpatentable as obvious. Johnson , 2013 WL 1499052, at *3. The Supreme Court recognized that an obvi- ousness analysis will often require \"a court to look to interrelated teachings of multiple patents; the effects of demands known to the design community or present in the marketplace; and the background knowled ge possessed by a person having ordinary skill in the art, all in order to determine whether there was an appar- ent reason to combine the known elements in the fash- ion claimed by the patent at issue.\" Id. at 418. Objective evidence of nonobviousness must also be considered, including \"secondary considerations\" such as \"commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failures of others, etc.\" Disney Enterpr ises, Inc. v. Rea, 940 F. Supp. 2d 288, 293 (E.D. Va. 2013) (internal citations omitted); see also KSR Int 'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 407 (2007) . In short, however, \"[a]n obviousness analysis measures the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art to determine whether the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.\" Disney Enterprises, Inc., 940 F. Supp. 2d at 291 (quoting Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs., , 464 F.3d 1286, 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ). The Court finds that CoNKwest 's claimed invention \u2014an in vivo method of treating a cancer by adminis- tering the NK -92 cell line to a mammal to recognize and lyse cancer cells \u2014would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art in 1997. Here, a POSA would have been motivated to \"implement a predictable variation\" based on the Santoli and Gong 153a references, which renders the var iation unpatentable as obvious. See Johnson , 2013 WL 1499052, at *3 . Specifically, it would have been prima facie obvious to a POSA in April 1997 to have combined the teachings of Santoli and Gong to arrive at the claimed method \"be- cause Gong et al. teach[es] use of NK -92 cells to lyse tumor cells, while Santoli et al. teach in vivo use of cytotoxic cell lines.\" The Court further finds that a POSA in 1997 would have been motivated to substitute the TALL -104 cell with the functionally similar NK -92 cells to achieve the claimed method an d would have reasonably expected success in doing so. In deciding whether or not a claimed invention is obvious, the Federal Circuit has instructed the USPTO to consider objective evidence of nonobviousness. In re Huang , 100 F.3d 135, 139 (Fed. Cir. 1996) . Secon - dary considerations like \"commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be uti- lized as . . . indicia of obviousness or Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City , 383 U.S. 1, 17-18, (1966) (citing Note, Subtests of 'Nonobviousness ': A Nontechnical Approach to Patent Validity, 112 U. PA. L. REV. 1169 (1964) ). However, the USPTO lacks the means or resources to gather evidence which supports or refutes an applicant 's assertion that the sales constitute commercial success, so accordingly the USPTO relies upon the applicant to provide hard evidence of commer- cial success. Id. The \"success is relevant in the obvi- ousness context only if there is proof that the sales were a direct result of the unique characteristics of the claimed invention \u2014as opposed to other economic and commercial factors unrelated to the quality of the patent ed subject matter.\" Id. (internal citations omitted). 154a The Court is unpersuaded by CoNKwest 's evidence of secondary considerations. Neither Dr. Miller nor the U-T San Diego article authored by Fikes offer any per - suasive evidence of commercial success, lo ng-felt but unsolved needs, failures of others, etc. The Fikes ar - ticle does little more than reveal that there was a $48 million dollar investment in CoNKwest as part of a stock trade. Though the article mentions phase I clin - ical trials, the article d oes little in the way of proving that the alleged success, or investment, was the \"direct result . . . of the claimed invention \u2014as opposed to other economic and commercial facts.\" The Court is not convinced that there is a direct nexus between Dr. Soon -Shiong 's $48 million dollar investment in CoNKwest and the merits of the claimed invention. C. Summary Judgment Here, the Court finds, based on the newly -presented evidence as well as the administrative record, that there is no genuine material factual dispute that the invention claimed in the '955 application i s obvious over the prior art, as found by both the Examiner and the Patent Trial and Appeals Board. There is no dispute that, together, Santoli and Gong disclose all the elements of the claimed invention. Even considering the new ev - idence and drawing al l inferences in CoNKwest 's favor, it is clear that a POSA in 1997 would have had a rea- sonable expectation that NK -92 cells would recognize and lyse one or more cancer cells in vivo in a mammal. Additionally, CoNKwest 's secondary consideration evi- dence is unpersuasive. 155a IV. CONCLUSION The Court grants Defendant 's Motion for Summary Judgment, because there is no genuine material factual dispute that the invention claimed in the '955 applica- tion is obvious over the prior art, as found by both t he Examiner and the Patent Trial and Appeals Board.
