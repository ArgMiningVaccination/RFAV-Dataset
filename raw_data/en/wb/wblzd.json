And many who do get sick will only experience mild symptoms for a couple of days. Of course, you should take all the normal precautions to minimize your exposure, like frequent hand washing and avoiding sick people, but to join that lucky percentage of people who don't get sick, or don't get very sick, you'll have to fortify from the inside out. If you're serious about protecting yourself through the cold and flu season, you need to start now, before you're sick. Lay the foundation for a healthy immune system with some basic diet and lifestyle modifications. Focus on eating whole, real foods. Fill your plate with vegetables and [clean protein](https://www.naturalgrocers.com/standards/meat-standards). Minimize and/or eliminate refined flours and sugar as much as possible. Check out this visual guide for [how to build a healthy meal](https://www.naturalgrocers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1-4-Building-a-Healthy-Meal-Wheel.pdf)\u2014it's a great place to start to improve your immune health. Next, make sure to get an appropriate (think Goldilocks here, not too little and not too much) amount of exercise, preferably outdoors (yes, even though it is winter) where you can also get some sunshine and fresh air. Make sleep a priority. Adults should aim to get at least seven hours of sleep a night and kids need even more. Finally, manage your stress. I know you can't make all of your responsibilities magically disappear, but you can [find balance](https://www.naturalgrocers.com/health-hotline-article/finding-balance-stressed-out-world). After you've laid the foundation for good health, build your defenses with a potent immune support supplement routine. These supplements help to bolster your natural immune defenses, so your body is better able to fight the germs you encounter. Some of my favorite wintertime immune-support supplements include: Sometimes, even despite doing all the right things, an infection-causing germ might sneak in. At the very first inklings of feeling sick, add on the following, more aggressive, immune support routine. The supplements in this list are best taken at the first signs of sickness, or within 24-48 hours, so it is good to keep a few of these on hand, just in case. These lists may seem a bit daunting, but you don't have to take every supplement on it. Everyone is unique, and will respond as such to different supplements, so I recommend choosing a few that resonate with you and starting there. But don't delay! Remember, the goal is to support your immune system before the winter bugs get to it, so you can be one of the lucky few this winter. Sign-up for {N}power to get exclusive discounts, "}
