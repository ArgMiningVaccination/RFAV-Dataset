The CHP houses the School of Pharmacy (SOP) , School of Nursing, Department of Public Health, and Department of Allied Sciences. Charles D. Peterson, PharmD, is t he Dean of the CHP and SOP (Appendix 8A ). The SOP is organized into two academic departments, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacy Practice, to execute the PharmD program's mission and goals (Appendix 8 B). The SOP Executive Team consists of the Dean, two Associate Deans (who have responsibilities in both the SOP and CHP), and two Department C hairs. Current position descriptions for members of the Executive Team are found in Appendix 8C . The Senior Associate De an (SrAD) is an ex-officio member of both Curriculum and Assessment Committees and provides yearly charges to both committees . Notable accomplishments since 2012 include the ongoing development of interprofessional education (IPE) across the CHP, the use of the ExamSoft exam platform and iPad s in the SOP, expansion of assessment efforts, implementation of the co -curriculum 4 program, and in stitution of student e -Portfolios . In addition to other CHP and SOP responsibilities, t he Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (ADSA &FD) is Chair of the SOP Admissions Committee. Notable accomplishments since 2012 include conversion to multiple -mini -stati on interviews and implementation of the Early Admissions Program (EAP) . Administrative leaders in NDSU SOP have the necessary credentials and experience to effectively manage their respective units and work collaboratively with one another (Appendices 8D-H). Each unit also has full-time faculty and staff to support goals of the program. Unfortunately, as a result of statewide budget cuts starting in 2014 through to the present, the SOP has vacant faculty and staff position s despite ongoing growth in relation to teaching, s ervice, and scholarly productivity. This has added strain to administrators, faculty , and staff who have needed to absorb responsibilities related to the areas of recruitment, laboratory support , and assessm ent; plus additional responsibilities in the areas of co -curriculum, academic advising, and IPE. Further d iscussion of these challenges , including currently vacant faculty /staff positions, are found in Standard s 18 and 23. Qualifications and Contributions of the Dean Charles D. Peterson, PharmD, has been Dean since 1996 (Interim in 1995). Prior to becoming Dean, he served as SOP Associate Dean and Chair of the Department of Pharmacy Practice . He has experience in all aspect s of academic pharmacy: teaching, scholarship, and direct patient care, in addition to extensive service to the CHP/SOP, the University, professional organizations and academic leadership as outlined in Appendix 8E . The Dean reports to the NDSU Provost . A formal job description, including description of duties and responsibilities, qualifications for the position of Dean, supervisory relationships and skills and knowled ge required is detailed in Appendix 8C . Since 2012, the CHP has experienced significant growth including the expansion of the nursing school and growth in publi c health which has added to the Dean's workload . Also, the Dean has been called upon by the President to take on additional tasks (e .g., chairing the interim provost search commi ttee) because he is the senior D ean at NDSU. These factors may sometimes make it challenging for him to devote full attention to the SOP . To partially address CHP growth, a SrAD was appropriated since the last accreditation visit. Overall administrative structure modifications are currently being discussed and refined to address the ongoing needs in the SOP . Dean Peterson's interactions with faculty, staff, students, alumni and other stakeholders are fueled by his passion and commitment to the profession and scholarship. These interactions are further articulated in his most recent comprehensive review in 2016 (Appendix 8 I). The Dean's accomplishment s are significant for the stakeholders of NDSU, CHP and SOP. Some of the most notable achievements are listed here: Successfully completing an all privately funded $28M 74,000 six story building addition to Sudro Hall (e .g., Aldevron Tower) which will greatly facilitate IPE and the soon to be completed renovation of the original Sudro Hall for research expansion . Unprecedented success in fund -raising including significant increases in annual gifts (FY17 total donations to the CHP were $23,557,671), student scholarships (now exceed $337,000/year), and total endowments for the CHP are now currently $7,997,532, all record dollars. 5 Unprecedented growth of the CHP to now more than 2,000 students, 165 faculty/staff, with 130 graduate students which is significantly increased from 1995 with totals of 650 students, 30 -40 faculty/staff, and 5 graduate students. Unprecedented growth in research (during FY18 the CHP had 66 grants awarded, with $9,072,919 in research revenue, and out of 142 Colleges and Schools of Pharmacy nationally our Department of Pharmaceutical Scie nces is currently ranked 3 rd in the nation for NIH funding per faculty FTE by the AACP . Increased emphasis on IPE within the College and the recent name change to CHP (approved in 2015) with pharmacy, nursing, allied sciences, and public health disciplines now under his management. This, in part, demonstrates a commitment to IPE as identified in the SOP Mission and Vision statements. In 2014, the CHP acquired Sanford College of Nursing in Bismarck (ND) which is now NDSU Nursing at Sanford Health. In 2012, the CHP added the state's first ever Master of Public Health degree program in North Dakota with dual degree options including PharmD/MPH. In 2019, 83% of SOP alumni (vs. 68.3% peer, 63.1% national) responding to the AACP Alumni Survey indicated that the Dean is providing leadership in pharmacy compared to 75% in 2017 and 72.7% in 2015. Further, in 2019, NDSU AACP Faculty Survey reported 84.9% agreement (vs. peer 83.1%% and national 79.3%) that the Dean is an effective leader of the SOP (compared to 79% in 2017 and 90% in 2015). Communication and Collaboration The SOP has a full -time Marketing and Communication Coordinator. This position assists the Dean to maintain an effective system of communication with internal and external stakeholders, including electronic, social media, print media, faculty/staff retreats, committees, and personal visits. The SOP website ( http://w ww.ndsu.edu/pharmacy/ ) is the main avenue for communication for both internal and external stakeholders. In addition to the SOP's Facebook page and Twitter account (both managed by the College Marketing/Communication Coordinator), the SOP publishes a biann ual alumni newsletter, highlighting development, faculty and student achievements, and outreach activities. The Dean publishes SOP updates in his \"Message from the D ean\" column in the quarterly publication of the North Dakota Pharmacists Association publ ication , the biannual student organization newsletter , and the biannual preceptor newsletter . Semi -annual developmental workshops are sponsored by the SOP to give faculty and staff an opportunity to explore critical issues related to the SOP's mission, vision, and strategic plan. Examples of programs presented include classroom instructional technology, learning assessment, strategic planning, diversity and cultural awareness, IPE, effective communication skills, admission interviewing, and academic advisin g. The SOP Executive Team meets every third week to facilitate direct communication between SOP executives. The SOP Leadership Council was created in 2018 as a n additional measure to ensure communication between units , and the ir respective faculty and staff. Besides the five executives, the 6 Leadership C ouncil includes the Vice -Chair of Pharmacy Practice , Chairs of the Assessment, Curriculum, and Experiential Education Committees, and Faculty Secretary. This C ouncil meets monthly to discuss matters relat ed to the SOP and subsequently sets the agenda for SOP faculty meetings . SOP faculty meetings are scheduled twice/ semester (this was increased in 2018 from 1-2 meetings/year ). Minutes from Executive Team , Leadership Council, and SOP faculty meetings are published on Blackboard to all faculty/ staff . The Dean's Student Liaison Committee, which includes student representatives from each professional - year class and student organization, meets monthly with the ADSA&FD providing a regularly scheduled communic ation mechanism between students and administration. At the University level, t he Dean interacts with other deans, directors , and U niversity administrators primarily through the Deans/ Directors Council chaired by the Provost to ke ep University leadership informed of issues related to the SOP . Additionally, SOP department c hairs attend monthly meetings with the Provost. Faculty Role in School and University Governance The process for faculty governance in the SOP is codified i n the bylaws , Section 1.01 of the SOP Policy Manual, which serves as the Faculty Handbook and is accessible on the SOP's website @ https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/pharmacy/documents/schoolinfo/School_of_Pharmacy_Policy_Manu al_11.13.18.pdf . The SOP management philosophy is generally a consensus driven process in that bylaws, policies and operational procedures are developed, revised and approved by the faculty. Faculty actions are recorded in meeting minutes, which are posted o n the SOP's Blackboard website which is accessible to all SOP faculty and staff . Accordin g to the bylaws, there is at least one faculty meeting/semester. Over the past 3 years, there ha ve been 2 College/School meetings per year. Meetings for each of the two Departments h ave averaged 9 meetings/year over the last 3 years. The SOP faculty have the opportunity to participate in school and college-wide committees whic h provide an effective framework to conduct SOP business and allow faculty to have significant input into governance. In addition to representation on the CHP Administrative Council, Executive Team (SOP), Leadership Council (SOP), and department meetings, other standing committees with SOP representation include Academic Affairs (CHP), Academic Affairs and Student Progress (SOP), Admissions (SOP), Assessment (SOP), College Awards (CHP), Curriculum (SOP), Dean's Student Liaison (CHP) , Educational Inclusivity Promotion and Tenure CHP), Scholarship Recognition/Awards (CHP), and Student Affairs (CHP). All standing committee meeting minu tes are posted on Blackboard. Bylaws define both the structure and charges for each committee and are detailed in Appendix 8J. In addition to faculty, pharmacy practitioners, preceptors, alumni, and students also serve on several of the committ ees. At the University level there are 5 faculty representative s from the CHP , 2 of them from the SOP, as member s of the Faculty Senate . These representatives are elected annually at CHP faculty meetings. 7 In the 2019 AACP Faculty Survey , faculty agreement pertaining to the statement: SOP \"provides opportunities for faculty participation in governance \" increased significantly with 6.1% disagree ( vs. 7.4% peer and 9.7% national) compared to the previous reporting period in 2017 (21.1% disagreed). Th e increas ed level of agreement may be explained, in part, because of creation of the Leadership Council in 2018 and increased f requency of SOP faculty meetings . Organizational Effectiveness Systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of each operational unit is fulfilled through annual rev iews of the administrators , faculty , and staff , by their immediate supervisor. Also , each member of the Executive Team undergo es a comprehensive 360 degree review every 5 years , except the initial review which oc curs after 3 ye ars (Appendices 8K-N ). Overall program effectiveness is assessed by measures detailed in the SOP Program Evaluation Plan and quantified in the SOP Program Evaluation Report which is distributed to the Executiv e Team, Leadership Council, SOP faculty , and staff (Appendices 8O- P). The Program Evaluation Plan is a systematic self-assessment of how well the organizational structure and systems of communication and collaboration are serving the program and s upporting the achievement of its mission and goal s. The Program Evaluation Plan and Report are used to identify areas of need, and triaged to appropriate committees for ongoing assessment and improvement. In addition to the SOP self - assessment, an outside review of the PharmD program was completed by the NDSU Program Review Committee (a NDSU Faculty Senate subcommittee) in March 2015 ( Appendix 8Q). Program r eview is conducted every 7 years. Contingency Plans Contingency plans are in place in the event of technical system failures, as well as administrative and academic disruptions ( required upload College Systems Failures Data Securit y and Contingency Planning). University Policies are in place to address Health and Safety (NDSU Policy 166 https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/166.pdf ) and Emergency Procedures (NDSU Policy 164 https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/164.pdf ). All systems operated by the Division of Informati on Technology are backed up on a nightly basis to protect against data loss. Most critical systems have copies of their data stored in two separate geographical locations. In the event of a technical failure of the campus's information network, services wo uld relocate to Bismarck. At the SOP level, the Administrative Contingency Plan ( Appendix 8R ) provides guidance for cases involving emergencies and/or times when administrative leaders are out of the office, including after hours. The Instru ctional Conti nuity Plan ( Appendix 8S ) includes mechanisms for making up lost coursework and academic credit in the event classroom activities are disrupted for a week or longer, or when individual students are unable to physically attend class because of medical issues . AACP Surveys A notable obs ervation from AA CP Survey data indicates that NDSU SOP faculty are less likely to agree that the SOP's administrators function as a unified team (disagree rate of 27.3% in 2019 and 31.6% in 2017 compared to 12% i n 2015 at NDSU; 17.7% peer and 19.8% national in 2019). Moreover, 2019 data reveals that 12.1% of faculty disagree that the SOP administrators have clearly defined responsibilities (compared 8 to 5.3% in 2017 and 0% in 2015; 9% peer and 12.6% national in 2019). NDSU SOP administrators are cognizant of these survey res ults an d acknowledge the issue is largely attributed to unclear lines of authority and accountability rather than specific roles and responsibilities. E fforts are being made to address this for the purpose of improving unified leadership and clearly defined administrative responsibilities, including contributions of the Dean. 4) College or School's Final Self -Evaluation: Self -assess how well the program is in compliance with the standard by putting a check in the appropriate box : Compliant Compliant with Monitoring Partially Compliant Non -Compliant No factors exist that compromise current compliance; no factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance.

Member, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India Member, Otago Pharmacological Association, Inc; 1986 -88. Member, Otago Med. Sch. Res. Council, 1986 -88. Accomplishment as a Department Chair: My administrative responsibilities include managing thirteen faculty members, 30 -35 doctorate level graduate students, 8 post -doctoral fellows/visiting scientists, two office s taffs, pharmaceutical sciences courses of professional students (400 Pharm.D. students) and the annual budget of the departme nt (~ $10 Million). The mission of the department is to educate and train future pharmacists and biomedical scientists and to advan ce biomedical research that improves human health. There is substantial growth of the department in the area of research infrastructure, research funding, professional and graduate education during my leadership as department chair. There is a 10-fold increase in extramural funding and peer -reviewed publications. Strengthened the research infrastructure of the department: developed common -used equipment and facilities and added several state of the art instruments such as confocal microscope, EPR, LC system; animal facilities, including nude mice facility; cold room; and dark room. More recently, upgraded animal facility to 4 BSL 2 animal facility and generated funds from the State of North Dakota and private donors to accomplish the construction and equipment needed to renovate this facility. Developed new programs such as combined Pharm.D./ Ph.D. and participates in the Cellular and Molecular Biology Interdisciplinary Ph.D. program. Streng thened the graduate program. In the most recent ranking by the National Research Council for the graduate program in the United States of America released, our graduate program in pharmaceutical sciences was compared with other pharmaceutical sciences as w ell as Pharmacology, Toxicology and Environmental Health programs of the US medical schools. Our program ranked 39th on the research based ranking and was above the University of Iowa and University of Kentucky. Our program ranked # 1 in student support. Improved the NIH research ranking of the program. Our research program ranked 13th in year 2008 and 9th in year 2009 in the U.S. for the percent of Ph.D. faculty with NIH funding. Developed vigorous pharmaceutical sciences lecture series inviting outside s peakers of national and international renown, including Nobel laureates. Recruited and mentored nine new faculty members for the department and received faculty start -up funds for them from internal and external sources . Enhanced collaboration of our facul ty within NDSU and out of NDSU. The department faculty became the part of NIH CoBRE with Chemistry ($25 M over 10 years) and NIH INBRE ($16.3 M over 5 years) grants, and another recent $10 M over 5 years NIH CoBRE grant on pancreatic cancer research. Helpe d create a North Dakota Economic Development Center of Excellence (ED -COE) in Biopharmaceutical Research and Production (CBRP, The Center) $6.7 million funded ($2 million from the State of North Dakota and 4.7 million from North Dakota Biopharmaceutical co mpanies) to perform economically significant and market -driven research and development of biopharmaceuticals . Created a good working environment in the department and instilled a climate of mutual cooperation in getting faculty to work together in strivin g to fulfill the overall mission and goals of the department in teaching, research and service. Developed Department PT&E guidelines, Department Strategic Plan, and helped develop strategic plan for the College of Health Professions. Increased the diversit y among department faculty and graduate students. Research Interests : In recent years' great progress has been made in pharmacotherapy, and many important new drugs have been introduced to clinical medicine. Even greater progress has been achieved in th e biopharmaceutical technology, which has made the precise control of drug delivery to the body by different routes, using a variety of sophisticated delivery systems. However, the delivery of proteins and peptides is somewhat of a \"black box.\" The develop ment of a whole new generation of potent therapeutic agents based on biotechnology and genetic engineering has brought the limitations of conventional drug delivery into sharp focus and is forcing a fundamental reappraisal of the basic mechanisms of drug a bsorption and transport. Many of these exciting new compounds are unstable polar macromolecules with very short biological half -lives whose clinical application is prevented by problems with delivery. If methods can be devised to overcome the natural barri ers to their absorption, transport and uptake, these agents promise to revolutionize drug therapy and bring enormous benefits to medicine and mankind.

For example, more than 97% of the APPENDIX 8I Dean Charles Peterson Evaluation Committee Report Submitted to Dr . Ingra m on February 17, 2016 by committee membe rs: Mark Strand, Don Miller, Norma Sanku Mall ik, and Craig Schnell. The Process The Committee was coordinated by Charlene Wolf-Hall, Vice Provost f or Academic Affairs. Committee membe rs were selected by the procedure in Policy 327. On October 29, 2015, Provost Ingram charged the Evaluation Committee with its work. The committee created a survey instrument pertaining to Dea n Peterson 's performance in the categories listed below. The online surve y was open November 20 through December 7, 2015. The peer dea ns group was missed in the initial survey window, and the survey was reopened for them over the winter b reak. In the survey, the scale used was 5= very good, 4=good, 3 = in-between, 2=poor, 1=very poor. Respondents could also select \"no opportunity to observe\" , and such responses were not factored into numeric score statis tics. For select questions in the survey, only targeted stakeholder groups were given the oppor tunity to respond to ensure that respondents had direc t interaction with the Dean for those particula r items of interest. Table 1 summarizes the response rates to the survey. Appendix A contains the aggregated da ta and responses to open-ended questions. Table 1. Stakeholder response rates to survey. Dean Peterson Evaluation - Page 2 respondents ranked him either \"very good \" or \"good\" in providing visionary leadership for advancing the College mission in teaching, research, and service 5.00, respectively). Consistently 98% of the participants ranked him either \"very good\" or \"good\" for clearly communicating the \"mission, vision, of 4.72 \u00b1 0.25). the respondents also gave him \"very good\" or \"good\" ratings for effectively communicating expectations, administrative procedures, and for instilling trust in the College. The written comments from the participants complimented him for being an \"excellen t advocate\" for the College who is \"always at the forefront when it comes to his scope.\" The students noted Dean Peterson for his \"amazing job\" in \"encouraging and leading as an example.\" The College faculty noted the Dean \"as a model leader\" who is \"ver y personable in talking to anyone regardless of their title or position,\" \"very helpful\" to new faculty members to \"assure success in academic career .\" The College staff commented that Dean Peterson \"values each member of the team,\" \"instills a sense of p ride,\" and \"motivates employees to perform to a high standard.\" Another Dean at NDSU found Dean Peterson to be \"a consummate professional who clearly grounds his actions in sound ethical principles.\" Only two participants found that Dean Peterson does no t have \"much interactions with faculty and staff unless it happens during a faculty meeting ,\" and noted that the \"Dean needs to get out of his office more.\" Planning, Administration, and Management Numerical rating s in this category ranged from 4.36 to 4.72. The two lowest ratings were for \"effective at conflict management\" and \"effectively oversees the PTE procedures .\" Open -ended comments in this section were mostly very positive, especially noting his ability to set direction and lead the College, but also to trust faculty, staff, and students to do the right thing without micro -managing. He receives respect for his lea dership from all constituencies. To some extent this may explain the lowest numerical ratings, as one person mentioned that the Dean does not interfere with committees and chairs who are entrusted with those issues. In general comments at the end of the s urvey , it was frequently noted that he is visionary, decisive, approachable, ethical, professional, and an outstanding leader. Program Quality, Assessment, and Development This section of the report involves six Likert scale (0=very poor to 5=very good) items and one open -ended response item. The mean scores ranged from 4.69 to 4.81 along with standard deviations from 0.39 to 0.63. Given the small range of both standard deviations and means indicates that respondents believe the Dean is effectively sup porting and managing all aspects (including instruction, research, service, accreditation, program assessment, and program development) for the College. Dean Peterson Evaluation - Page 3 Of the 13 open -ended response items in response to the question \"please provide constructive comments r egarding the Dean and instruction,\" most of the responses were positive and cited his supportive nature for ambassadors, nursing department, public health, pharmaceutical sciences, and hiring effective faculty and staff. The positive and constructive respo nses of the Dean to the difficult accreditation process were also noted. Outreach Outreach was assessed by the use of three survey items, with opportunity for respondents to give open -ended responses to the statement, \"Please provide constructive commen ts regarding the Dean and outreach.\" On a scale of 1 -5, Dean Peterson scored highest on \"responsive to external stakeholders\" (4.75 \u00b1.46). This is supported by the fact that in 2014 he was selected by the profession of pharmacy in North Dakota to receive the prestigious Bowl of Hygeia Award. In open -ended comments it was mentioned that Dean Peterson has helped resolve contentious issues with external stakehol ders, something that was deeply appreciated by the faculty member who reported it. His role in supporting Telepharmacy was also mentioned by several individuals. The second -highest score was \"provides a mechanism for the successful delivery of outreach programs\" (4.69\u00b1.49), and the third -highest was \"effectively promotes the service component of the College mission\" (4.66\u00b1.52). There were no negative comments or deficiencies reported by any of the respondents. As evaluated by survey respondents, Dean Pet erson has fulfilled his role in Outreach and is to be commended for his efforts. Development In this survey, development was addressed through surveys sent to NDSU Development Foundation personnel (for whom there were no responses) and the topic was also included in each survey sent to all other groups as two questions: 45. The Dean effectively works with the Development Foundation and other organizations in identifying and pursuing philanthropic support, and 46. The Dean effectively develops stakeh olders support for the college. With regard to Development Foundation personnel, there were no responses, either to the Likert questions or any written comments. Given the timing and situation, this was not unusual in that nearly all Foundation personnel had left NDSU . Thus, there was a dearth of potential respondents. With regard to the other respondent groups, there were 77 responses to question 45, providing a Likert value of 4.77 \u00b1.47. For Question 46, the Likert value from 80 respondents was 4.79 \u00b1.19. These values indicate very strong perception of the effectiveness of the Dean in development. Dean Peterson Evaluation - Page 4 Written comments were also vey positive and reflected that the Dean would need to have a very strong relationship with the Development Foundation with rega rd to funds for students' scholarships and in anticipation of building an addition to Sudro Hall. It must be noted that during the evaluation period, there was no University -wide capital campaign. Fundraising was generally a College initiated effort. Du ring this time, Dean Peterson continued with his innovative vision, being able, with Foundation support, to develop a Senior Director of Development position in order to provide more effort in fundraising. The first director was Sara Wald and, in her two years, more than $1,000,000 of new funding was received. Sara left the College to become the Director of Engagement at the Development Foundation and Alumni Association. Dean Peterson then hired Amy Ruley to the director's position. Positive comments were received for this hire. In summary, Dean Peterson has shown unusual acumen, effort, and innovation in fundraising and development for the college. Overall Effectiveness There were two open ended questions regarding Overall Effectiveness. They were: Question 48. What do you perceive as the Dean's strengths? And Question 49. What do you see as areas needing improvement related to the Dean's performance? The total number of respondents were 65 for Question 48 , and 43 for Question 49. Most frequent str engths indicated in response to Question 48 were: Personable/Approachable, Communication, Leadership Style, Visionary, and Trustworthiness. The following are several representative quotes. \"His leadership in making progressive development of our college pr ograms happen. He has also taken a positive stance and a 'Can Do' attitude on the building addition to Sudro Hall. Dean Peterson has done a great job of promoting the disciplines of pharmacy, nursing and public health.\" \"Open to new ideas and change. Commu nicates well. Attends to issues in a timely manner. Attention to details. Knowledgeable about the policies and processes at NDSU. Personable. Highly ethical.\" \"Open, fair, non -threatening. Dean Peterson has excellent character and performs his job with int egrity and professionalism.\" Of the 43 responses to Question 48, 15 indicated they had no improvement comments, effectively leaving 28 comments on areas needing improvement. The most frequently listed improvement areas were more interaction with students, more effective communication, and acknowledgement of faculty and staff. Representative comments are: \"Visibility to other students, outside of leadership positions, would contribute to a more unified college.\" \"Communication both internally and externally . Generally, the Dean does well in this area, but there is always room for improvement.\" \"Communicating regularly with faculty & moving the pharmacy profession forward.\" \"His one on one communication with faculty .\" \"Acknowledge all staff in the department when he comes in. A little acknowledgment goes a long way to develop loyalty.\" Dean Peterson Evaluation - Page 5 SECTION 14: What do you think is the Dean's most important achievement in the last three years. This was an open -ended question eliciting 48 responses. Responses were quite variable and reflected the perception of the respondent. Accomplishments cited included: faculty and staff hires - specific mentions of Carla Gross, Amy Ruley, Don Warne physic al changes and movement of units within Sudro Hall building new programs and strengthening existing programs adding Public Health and strengthening and growth of Nursing addressing space issues funding for student scholarships change in name of College to Health Professions renewed accreditation status for Pharmacy and Nursing (meeting challenges) supporting growth in research funding leading College to high level of performance SECTION 15: Any additional comments To this open -ended question, there were 24 responses. As indicated previously, the responses were quite varied and quite positive. Citations were directed to his great leadership, wisdom, approachability, respect, dedication, an outstanding individual, and a pillar of the pharmacy community.

The Dean is an excellent advocate and seems to always be at the forefront when it comes to his scope. Dean Peterson is a model leader. He is interested in what we do. He has an open door. He is always engaged when speaking with me. I appreciate having him as my dean. The Dean is a very effective leader for the College of Health Professions. He encourages everyone in the College to think outside the box, growth and challenges the \"this is the way we have always done it\" mode of thinking to make recommendation for continuous improvements. As a Student, the Dean does an amazing job with encourging us and leading as an example. He always shows great leadership which helps us as students to strive to be leaders as well. Good leader, seems to have a drive to make our college better all the time. I very much enjoy working in the College of Health Professions under Dean Peterson's leadership. I find that he values each member of the team in the college and instills a sense of pride in the work that we do. These leadership traits, in turn, tend to further motivate employees to perform to a high standard. Dean Peterson is an outstanding leader. He communicates on a regular and timely basis, maintains an \"open door\" policy and encourages feedback. He has created a very open, positive, inclusive environment where individuals thrive and stay motivated to perform. He recognizes effort and accomplishments on a consistent manner. He is very aware of and works to stay in step with the University mission. With the support he needs he will lead the College of Health Professions to an even more prominent level and successfully help in meeting the needs of the people as a student focused, land grant, research institution. Dean Peterson is excellent when it comes to keeping us, in the College, informed. Dean Peterson is a visionary leader who inspires all around him to excel in their roles within the College and the University. He is exceptionally effective in effectively communicating with alumni and friends of the College and University, involving them in advancing the goals of the College and spreading the word about the many initiatives and successes of all College programs. I know very little about Dean Peterson as I am new to the University, but so far he appears to be easy to communicate with and a strong leader. The Dean does a great job in communicating the College's vision. I do think our College could improve in sharing this vision with all students, and not just those in leadership positions. Dean Peterson communicates the college and universities' goals/mission/values very effectively as well as very often! Dedicated with a clear vision of the direction the college should take to remain at the top. The Dean is an inspirational leader and positive role model for the College and University. Leadership focus remains to be on pharmacy, but with nursing's growth and direct report to the Dean more leadership attention has been given that department in the past year He has been very helpful to me as a new faculty member in trying to assure my success in my academic career. Leads well I sit on a committee with Dean Peterson regarding Pharmacy Technician education requirements and standards. He provides excellent oversight and direction to the committee with meaningful discussion points on appropriate education values and desired outcomes. I had hoped with the increased numbers of nursing students/faculty we would see a balance between pharmacy and nursing. Maybe change is happening, we still appear to be the college of pharmacy not the college of health professions Dean Peterson communicates very well within the state and is very busy. Because of the wide variety of education the school provides (leading to the name change) I'm not sure we are getting national recognition of that variety. Since ND has the ownership law, maybe consideration of him attending the NCPA annual meeting should be considered. Dean Peterson is an excellent leader. He is well trusted and admired by faculty and staff in the College and has done an exceptional job of supporting the advancement of all disciplines. Dean Peterson is very proactive in sharing information related to the advancement and achievements of the college. I have never had a disappointing interaction with the Dean in almost 14 years of working with him. He is knowledgeable about systems and procedures and understands the art of working with people. I have found him to be a very inspiring leader. My thoughts often go back to ideas and outlooks he has communicated to me and I am able to apply these in my own leadership duties. He supports without micromanaging which is a fabulous model for the rest of us. Dr. Peterson is an excellent leader and dean. Interaction with the Dean is limited, but his passion for the College and University is unquestionable. Our college has benefitted greatly due to Dean Peterson's leadership. I feel that he makes his position known and is very personable when talking with anyone, regardless of their title or position. I feel that he communicates leadership and also truly cares about everyone. Dr. Peterson is a great listener, and communicates effectively in simple yet professional words that even a nonprofessional can easily understand. I wish I had a chair like him! I also wish I had more interaction than I had so far as a Jr faculty! Very involved with students and supportive! Not much interaction with faculty and staff, unless it happens during a faculty meeting My relationship with Dean Peterson has been mainly through my involvement with the nursing department and the allied sciences area. My interactions with the Dean have always been positive. He is a great ambassador for the College of Health Professions and for NDSU in general. He represents the College well at other functions sponsored by the University and actively participates in numerous functions such as Alumni and Foundation events. Our Dean is a dedicated, strong advocate for our college within the university and at the state level. No changes in style or substance recommended! Dean Peterson has an ability to excite all those who work for him directly and indirectly about the purpose in our positions. He shares his passion with our College which translates in faculty and staff pushing themselves to the next level. He can see all avenues when looking at a situation. He requires that faculty, staff, and students follow the guidelines/policies of the University. He can look at the big picture as well as the details needed to get there. Dean needs to get out of his office more and view the workings of the college. I think, He has some good leadership qualities such as good listener, understands what people want from him, spends time with students and staff, and asks for constructive suggestions how to make the college better. These qualities of him, makes him a good leader. Dean Peterson is a consummate professional who clearly grounds his actions in sound ethical principles. He has been an excellent colleague among the deans, and I have found him to be a helpful source of guidance and support. He has a deep commitment to serving the university and his college. He also has very good leadership and interpersonal skills. Text ResponseTotal Responses 36 Statistic Value4. Planning, Administration and Management 8 15.

Please provide constructive comments regarding the Dean and planning, administration and management. The Dean is well respected both within NDSU and outside the organization. He effectively communicates the strategic plan for the College, while matching it with NDSU's strategic plan. The Dean is respectful of everyone regardless of race, gender, etc. Through my time as an amabassador for the pharmacy program and as an ambassador for NDSU, I have witnessed the Dean do an exceptioal job with his interprofessional skills when he interacts with other leaders across campus (for example when we are at Bidder's Bowl or Recognition Societies Dinner). Also, in being in the comittee for the pharmacy practice department chair, I was very impressed with his willingness and trust in our comittee. He allowed us to grab this by the horns and drive it rather than him making all the decisions and us following. He does a wonderful job in the hiring process. His record says it all...moved from a College of Pharmacy to Pharmacy, Nursing and Allied Sciences to College of Health Sciences. Planned and coordinated implementation of the Masters of Public Health program, recruited top notch researchers and faculty bringing millions in grant money to NDSU. Dean Peterson has taken on the Bismarck Nursing program with openess and willing to allocate resources to this area. Dean Peterson's leadership in recruiting faculty and staff has been excellent. Hires from Dr. Warne to Amy Ruley have made NDSU an attractive place to work for other potential candidates. Effective leadership and uses the talents of his staff. Several of these items are difficult to assess generally, and as they might pertain to others in the College whose experiences with the Dean are unlike my own. #15-20 seem to be left up to department administration without the Dean micro-managing, which is a plus when you have effective leadership at the department level. Unable to comment as faculty can be uninvolved in administration in management Dean Peterson works with the Pharmacy Technician program at Wahpeton State School of Science. He is respective of the current program at Wahpeton and has encouraged a teamwork approach to resolving a growing need in the State for Pharmacy Technicians. This has included discussion of a joint partnership between the two institutions. Dean Peterson does a good job. The Dean is very forthcoming concerning The College's participation and leadership in guiding the direction of NDSU. The Dean has provided guidance for hiring my department and is always aware of the need to promote diversity within the staff, and more than promoting it, he wants to see concrete methods being used to achieve diversity in the staff. Dr. Peterson is a good manager. Solid, thoughtful, respectful, puts a good team together. Evidence of the Dean's effectiveness is this area is apparent by the concepts we are asked to consider as part of the Advisory Board role. While job performance reviews are required of faculty and staff, the periodic review of associate deans has not been done on a regular basis (particularly the senior associate dean, since the 1st one being done this year). As the College continues to grow, effective communication is essential. Both internally and externally there is room for improvement. Dean Peterson has been very supportive of all programs at the College of Health Professions. He has been very supportive of the initiatives brought forward by Carla Gross, the chair of the nursing department. There have been many new and innovative strategies in the department such as the increased enrollment of nursing students, new program development and the merger of Med Center One School of nursing with NDSU. He has been actively involved, assisted Carla to navigate and bring these initiatives forward to the President to get them on the fast track and get them completed. I know he worked diligently to assist with the merger of the two nursing programs as I work at Sanford and was privy to the information and would see him come to Sanford with Carla to attend many meetings with much work done prior to those meetings to make the end result very successful. Outside of public health, we could improve diversity in the other schools and departments. Dean Peterson understands the importance of strategic planning. Dean has made many very, very poor administrative hires. Dean Peterson has excellent skills in the areas of planning, management, and administration. He ensures that his college sets and pursues clear strategic priorities. Total Responses 21 Text Response Statistic Value6. Program Quality, Assessment and Development 15 34.

Please provide constructive comments regarding the Dean and instruction. The Dean hires effective Faculty and Staff, and utilizes them. He communicates trust by delegating as needed. He supports recommendations after reviewing and asking the right questions. During ambassador meetings and DLC, the Dean always makes sure that he is keeping us updated on what is going on in the college. He lets us know what is going great and what isn't so pretty, but he always remains positive about it. He let us, the pharmacy class representatives, know that we might now have classes in Sudro with the Stem building opening. This allowed us to communicate with the other students in our class so that they were prepared in advance rather than having the news be a shock. Responded positively to accreditation issue regarding inadequate space by developing a comprehensive plan for adding space, gaining support from the University executive leadership and presenting the plan to state legislators for funding. The challenges with the pharmacy accreditation we handled extremely well. Dean Peterson was extremely professional in his communication and interaction with ACPE. Provides good input and support. Again, utilizes staff for ideas and implementation to keep programs strong. Dean Peterson is a good detail person and assures good classroom and instruction. Dean Peterson has been extremely supportive of Nursing during the unit's growth and has intervened on Nursing's behalf at various levels to assure there are needed resources for growth. Dean Peterson regularly shares the challenges of accreditation and successful recruitment of research funding. He engages the Advisory Board on short and long-term strategy to both harvest opportunities and cultivate relationships beneficial to NDSU. The Dean shows vision in his assessment of our program as it exists and where it is going. He has always been supportive of the innovations we have developed in our service area yet makes clear the constraints under which the University and we must operate. These topics are always on the Advisory Board agenda and it is apparent that their placement is a result of direction from the Dean. Quality research is well supported financially for pharmaceutical sciences and to a lesser degree for pharmacy practice. We have a well-rounded academic College with excellence in teaching, research, and service. Dean has favorites among depts.; high favorability in Pharmacy Practice and Public Health.

The service component of the College's mission is very important, and easily seen through the work of the College through outreach programs, volunteering done be students and faculty, etc. The Dean has established and continues good relationships with alumni and supporters of the College. The Dean is always there to listen. As a pharmacy student, Ambassador, Class Representative, and a member of comittees throughout my time in the program, the Dean has listened when there was an issue and continually reminds me that his office is always open and to stop by when there is an issue. He treats everyone as an equal no matter their title they hold. He lends his knowledge, support, and word always and it is appreciated it so much. Our College has a lot of moving parts. There always seems to be so much going on. The Dean is vividly aware of these things and is fantastic about promoting them! Implementation of national advisory boards representing all stakeholders ensures external input to the College and fosters cross communication between students, faculty, and alumni. very responsive to pharmacy sponsers If the advisory committee is one of the \"external stakeholders\" he does a great job. Under the leadership of Dean Peterson, College staff regularly share their outreach, recruitment and service activities with Advisory Board members for purposes of strategy development and evaluation. My department has a large component of community service. The Dean is very accomplished in working with external stakeholders. I have had a number of opportunities to be part of interactions where there was the potential for a contentious situation to develop. He has always been able to handle these difficult conversations and offers smart ideas which benefit all. I have seen him work smoothly and patiently in some very difficult situations and he is good at negotiating good outcomes for our department. I have always felt that he is 'there' for us when we have had to deal with our external contacts and brings a confident, cooperative presence. Communicates well with advisory board. Visible and inclusive. No opportunity to observe. Positively involved with student organizations and events such as scholarship ceremonies, retreats, and hooding/pinning ceremonies Again, the work done with Med Center One school of nursing stands out to me. Great accomplishment. Also, I do see the Dean at the graduation of the Allied Science students as I have been invited to address this group as a graduate of the college and a representative from the Alumni Association Board of Directors. He makes certain that he works with all programs within the College, giving equally to each program. I am less familiar with seeing him interact with the pharmacy program but I know from others he is equally committed and works in a similar fashion in that area as it is a large and well respected program. The Dean's door is always open. He understands the importance of outreach and supports the many outreach programs our College provides. Dean has done a good job in supporting the TelePharmacy program. Total Responses 14 Text Response Statistic Value10. Development 3 45.

The Dean works effectively with the Development Foundation and others. He has hired Amy Ruley as the Senior Director of Development to help grow this area within the College. While the college has been effective in philanthropic support, there are always opportunities for growth and expansion. I have the great opportunity of being a Bison Ambassador so I get to see the Dean outside of Sudro's walls. I see him associating with the Alumni Association on multiple events and he is always showing his greatest professionalism. He does a great job with his communication and his support for the college. His pride in the College of Health Professions is always seen. The partnership the college has with the alumni association is truly visionary. Keeping donors engaged in the college is critical to continued support for the colleges programs. The Dean is fantastic with NDSU Pharmacy alumni in ensuring continued support. Very actively involved #45 is probably true for pharmacy Foundation needs to step up and formulate a plan to get a Sudro Hall addition completed. The biggest problem for Dean Peterson is space. My observation of funding is he depends on others for that part of the operation, which is OK. Dean Peterson is well respected at the university and across the state. Membership on the Advisory Board affords me first hand observation of Dean Peterson's efforts in the promotion of The College's external image and fostering pride within Alumni and partners. No Opportunity to observe. Always available, servant leadership approach. We have representation from the Development Foundation and also internal Development presence at out Advisory Board meetings. The Dean also stresses these areas when he meets with us. This is an area that should be targeted for growth. While scholarships are well supported, faculty development, study abroad, research/service improvement in North Dakota also need to be supported and developed. I had worked closely with Sara Wald who was the foundation representative at the College of Health Professionals and left to work full time at the Alumni Center. I had many opportunities to observe Sara interact with the Dean and they worked very well together to garner support for the programs in the College. I have not observed this since Amy Ruley took that role but I would assume he would work with Amy in the same way. Our College has an excellent relationship with the Development Foundations, and much of this has to do with the Dean's recognition of its importance and dedication to development. The Dean has a great relationship with our stakeholders and alumni. One of Dean's strengths I can say that he tries his best to outreach to people to ask them for philanthropic support and also reach the stakeholder to support college. Dean Peterson has strong skills in the area of development, and he has promoted ideas and practices that would help the Development Foundation be more successful in the future, particularly in drawing upon the talents and strengths of the deans and other administrative leaders.

I think he just needs time to win over other stakeholders. Provide opportunities for the departments within our college to collaborate more, break down silos. I am not aware of any at this time. Perhaps a bit more internal visibility, and a bit more interaction with the students and faculty in their daily activities (not just when there is an issue to be addressed or problem to solve) would be beneficial for the College. I think continuing to encourage his faculty to be forward thinking on research and involvement in the profession will be important to assure we keep the pulse on the profession and its impact on patients for the future. The only thing I would say could use a little improvement would his involvement with the \"normal students\" in the college. If I wasn't as involved as I am, I personally do not feel that I would be able to say so many great things about him because I wouldn't know him very much. Many students in my class have never had a one on one interaction with him; they only heard him speak during orientation. I think it would be cool for him to show students throughout the college that he is available because it's not just its student leaders that have feedback or issues, but every student has feedback and issues. Needs to \"toot his own proverbial horn\" more. He is sometimes overly sensitive to the other units on campus in terms of not wanting to appear arrogant or boastful. I don't see any at this point Extend the reach for promoting accomplishments. It's great for everything to be shared with the Advisory Board; however, the information needs to be shared beyond the advisory boards and faculty in a more timely fashion. His one on one communication with faculty. N/A Project his voise when speaking. I'd like to seem him become a little more familiar with staff from other departments in the college. Stop and greet staff when he comes in to see others in the departments. Staff would appreciate some acknowledgment occasionally as he is walking in the halls or stops in an office. Acknowledge all staff in the department when he comes in. A little acknowledgment goes a long way to developing loyalty. Visibility to other students, outside of leadership positions, would contribute to a more unified college. Communicating regularly with faculty & moving the pharmacy profession forward. Nothing. None- Perhaps communicate more effectively using less words and avoiding the tendency to \"process\" out loud. n/a I have not been here long enough to really observe this. None more visibility in Nursing There needs to be more support (money and services) for tenured faculty and faculty on tenure track. And he is not very interactive with faculty other than pharmacy. None Better knowledge about what is going on at the department level I'd love to see him more involved at a national level in pharmacy leadership, however NDSU and the state of ND are holding back what he is capable of doing by not giving him the space he needs to do it. Further, he cannot push the pharmacy curriculum to a new level without this. With the lack of solid building remodeling and expansion support from politicians he may need to consider getting a bit more involved with some personally. The alternative would be to make others, particularly the advisors and maybe students more knowledgeable about our serious dilemma of accreditation. This should start now, with some gentle lobbying. Few know that we are now in five locations. A short description of our key concerns to politicians could start the process a year or so before the next legislative session and a new governor is responsible for the capital budget of NDSU. Sometimes he could be more concise in his verbal and written comments. Today's media-rich, information-based world requires optimum placement of messaging with high impact. The College has relied on the success of it's alumni in placing Pharmacy as a highly sought degree, future recruitment of quality students, researchers and funding will depend more and more on effectively \"marketing\" the NDSU College of Health Professions to stakeholders key to the continued success of The College. In all honesty, I can't answer this question. As I mentioned previously, I have NEVER been disappointed in any interaction I've had with the Dean and I have never heard a bad word spoken about him. I am unable to contribute an answer to this question. Can think of nothing from my perspective - NA Nothing that I have adequate knowledge of. I just got elected and became part of the committee so do not know. Research in Pharmacy Practice is very poor compared to an equivalent School of Pharmacy in the country. While a few makes an effort in carrying out research in teaching/assessment/pedagogy-related aspects, no clinical research that can be delivered to patients' current needs. That is discouraging given the fact that we have so many talented faculty in this Dept. Communication both internally and externally. Generally, the Dean does well in this area, but there is always room for improvement. N/A I don't have any. Reaching out to all groups to participate in events More focus on diversity would make our College stronger and would better meet the needs of the healthcare system. N/A Text ResponseNeeds to treat units equivalently. The Dean will need to garner high levels of support from alumni and friends to meet the space needs of the college and ensure continued accreditation of the school of pharmacy. I believe this is within his skill set but will the greatest challenge of the next three years. I don't see much that needs improvement. He shares many useful thoughts and ideas, but at times he could talk less frequently to ensure that others have a chance for input. Total Responses 45 Statistic Value14. 50. What do you think is the Dean's most important achievement in the last three years? Changing the overall organization of the Health Professions department promoting the need to update and expand Sudro for the various colleges Establishing the MPH program. The name change of our College The growth and expansion of the Nursing program and adding Public Health. Assisting the School of Nursing faculty, staff and students through its recent growth. Leading the growth especially in research, nursing and public health program has been impressive to me. I have only known of 1 big push that the Dean made and that was for the building extension. He worked so hard for that and got us in a great postion for the extension, it was unfortunate that the state did not approve any of the proposals state wide. Even though we didn't get it, he didn't give up. He worked really hard to make sure we got everyone where they needed to go to make sure students will still be able to graduate from an accredited college. I think that is a huge achievement. Even when all odds were against him, he pushed through and it made it look effortlessly from the outside. He did a great job with staying positive and continually pushing when he knows the needs the of the college. Name change gathering input and getting support for the Sudro expansion. Faculty and staff hires. Research work with the three RO1 and soon to be announced additional grants. These are tremendous accomplishments that impact real people and the future of health care! The collaborative model to the College of Health Professions that will positively impact our students (particularly when they can study and learn under one roof when the Sudro addition becomes a reality or a larger facility is provided). Our students will continue to be leaders in the health professions with the foundation of teamwork that they experience from the moment they enter the CHP. Gaining support for and approval of advancing to a College of Health Sciences thus cementing a multidisciplinary education for students. This is vital in order to deliver modern healthcare services to North Dakotans and the nation today and into the future.

Movement of the College of Pharmacy forward to the College of Allied Health Sevices Procurement of funding for student scholarships Hiring Amy Ruley as his development director; I think she will do an outstanding job. He was very fotunate to have Sara Wald before that. Growth of the school in student population and programs. Supporting and overseeing the College's growth. Meeting challenges of accreditation and anticipated success of cultivating the needs of The College to improve infrastructure to remain a leader in the provision of health profession education and research. Being in a service area off campus, I am probably not aware of the on campus developments that have occurred. I have been able to observe the development of the physical facility of Sudro and now the new nursing area and I have heard from students and faculty about the developments in the academic curriculum. I see him strengthening all the programs of the college in the last three years, especially building new programs (Public Health and Nursing). Hiring Carla Gross - building the nursing program. *Elevation of the need for additional space to the Legislative bodies. I just got elected and became part of the committee so do not know. Dean played an instrumental role in expanding the facilities for the college, and tried to find room by reaching out every corner available in the campus. He took the case to the state-level for procuring funds and he did a great job with that, yet we look forward for outcomes. Maintaining a collaborative environment between the different Departments Support and development of the Department of Public Health and the MPH program. I don't have enough experience to judge this From my perspective, it would be the support and trust he has given to the development and expansion of the nursing program. Obtaining space for all programs to thrive. Leading the College to high level of performance and outstanding students and faculty Receiving the new accreditation status as the School of Pharmacy, School of Nursing, and the College of Allied Sciences.

I believe Dean Peterson is a great leader and we are very fortunate to have him as our Dean in the College of Health Professions. I have been very impressed with Dean Peterson's leadership. He is clearly a leader that is worth following. He has clear goals for the growth of the College of Health Professions, and I believe the next 5 years will be an exciting time of growth. I am very satisfied with Dean Peterson's leadership of the College. Chuck is truly a pillar of the pharmacy community in our state. His impact is very widespread! I really respect the Dean and all that he does for us. I thank him a lot because I know it cannot be easy to be in his position, but I appreciate all that he does. Space for research, teaching, interaction and collaboration will provide the support the Dean needs to be allowed to grow the College of Health Professions to meet the potential it offers our students and ultimately our citizens. I very much appreciate his leadership, wisdom and approachability. Big job next to rally funds for physical plant expansion. Dr. Peterson is oustanding and NDSU is very lucky to have him. I think I've said all I can think of right now! We are extremely fortunate to have a Dean of this high quality. I'd like to commend The Dean on his dedication and leadership through a difficult period and encourage his continued devotion to the advancement of The College and NDSU. As you may have noticed in my previous comments, I feel so fortunate to work directly for the Dean. I feel that he always 'has my back' yet he affords all of our department's staff the trust and support needed for us to move ourselves forward and continue to innovate in an independent manner. He has laid out expectations of how we are to conduct ourselves in our work and then steps back and lets us do it. I feel a great responsibility to never disappoint him. In 38 years in the pharmacy profession, I find him to be the person I respect the most. I have had opportunity to work in different countries and I can say with confidence that this dean is very trustworthy. It is a pleasure to serve on this Advisory Board. I have served on several others, many with much less support and acknowledgement from Administration. Thanks, Dean, for what you do everyday! I just got elected and became part of the committee so do not know. Dean is encouraged to meet with junior faculties once in a while n interact with them in different ways. I haven't seen him after I spoke with him during my interview!!! More time to fish! However, I am not suggesting retirement. What you have accomplished in your nearly 20 years of Deanship is incredible. N/A Thanks for asking me to participate. Blessed with an outstanding individual and leader! Keep up the great work! I feel what Dean Peterson has created with our College is something that is difficult to explain. So many people are so very thankful to be working in this College and under his direction. He makes us all feel valued and essential no matter what our position is. Associate deans in pharmacy need better mentoring. I feel very fortunate to have Chuck as a colleague.

Any individual seeking to transfer into NDSU's Pharm. D. Program must follow t he procedures outlined below. 1. Students must currently be enroll ed in an ACPE-accredited Pharm. D. Program. Student s enrolled in non-pharmacy degree programs, or those enrolled in bachelor or masters-level pharmacy programs (ACPE-accredited or otherwise) are not eligible to transfer into NDSU's Pharm.D. Program. Those students must apply directly to the entry leve l Pharm.D. Program us ing the NDSU Pharm.D. Supplemental Application. 2. The student must submit a formal application to both North Dakota State University, and be accepted to study at the University. Applicat ions to the University as a whol e must be completed according to the guidelines established by the Un iversity (www.ndsu.edu/admission). 3. Students accepted to study at NDSU may subsequently submit a formal transfer request to the NDSU College of Health Professions, Pharmacy Admissions Committee. A formal request will contain (at a minimum) the following information: i) A formal letter or equivalent written stat ement outlining the reasons for requesting the transfer; ii) Documented evidence from the st udent's current institution (typically a formal letter on university letterhead written by the Dean of t he current institution) demonstrating that the student is currently in good ac ademic and professional standing; iii) Documented evidence (including, but not limited to include official transcripts of all college work including pharmacy transcrip ts, PCAT scores and three lette rs of evaluation/reference from faculty members of a professional pharmacy program) that the student meets all admission requirements for NDSU's Pharm.D. Program. 4. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will review transfer applications twice per year. Individuals wishing to transfer and begin classes in the fall seme ster must submit the ent irety of their application materials by June 1 of that academic year. St udents intending to transfer and begin classes in the spring semester must submit the entirety of their application materi als by October 15 of the preceding semester/calendar year. 5. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will conven e to evaluate completed transfer applications within 30 days of the application deadline in question. If, upon review of the application materials, the Pharmacy Admissions Committee believes t hat the student's application merits further consideration, the Admissions Committee will schedule an interview with the applicant. The interview will be conducted within 45 days of the applicat ion deadline in question. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee may exercise discretion in choosin g the medium (in-person, telephone, video- conferencing, etc.) for, and t he content of, the interview. 6. All decisions on transfer applications are made excl usively by the Pharmacy Admissions Committee. Decisions will be based on factor s which include, but are not lim ited to: the student's academic record, an evaluation of the circ umstances leading to the transfe r request, the student's performance during the interview (if granted by the Pharmacy Admissions Committee), available space in the Pharm.D. Program, and the admi ssion standards currently used to evaluate traditional Pharm.D. applicants. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will generally not accept transfer applicants whose credentials fall substantially below those of the 85 students admitted to th e entry-level Pharm.D. Program in the previous year. The Pharmacy Ad missions Committee will generally not admit any transfer students if such admissions increase cl ass sizes beyond the maximum capacity identified under College Policy 2.24. 7. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Facult y Development (who serves as Chair of the Pharmacy Admissions Committee) will notify the student in writing within 60 days of the application deadline regarding the outcome of the application. 8. In the event that the students request for a transfer is grant ed, the Pharmacy Admissions Committee will forward the student's academic transcript and contact information to the Senior Associate Dean. The Senior Associate Dean will review the student's transcript and co llect other relevant information in order to assess whether (and if so, how mu ch) credit may be granted for courses which are applicable to the courses outlined in the curri culum of the NDSU Pharmacy Program. This assessment will be completed at leas t one week prior to the start of the semester in which the student is set authorized to attend classes. Students should be aware that not al l ACPE-accredited Pharm.D. Progr ams have the same curricula. As a result, student should antici pate that some courses may not transfer and/or that remedial coursework may be necessary. Students are responsible for ensuring that all information necessary to complete the assessment is provided to the Senior Associate Dean in a timely fashion. Failure to do so will result in fewer credits accepted for transfer and additional coursework to be completed by the student at NDSU. 9. The student must complete and submit a copy of the NDSU Student Condu ct Policy prior to registering for any coursework at NDSU. The st udent must also provide documented evidence of health insurance, apply to the North Dakota Boar d of Pharmacy for a Pharmacy Intern License, successfully pass a multi-state background check and complete all other relevant paperwork/tasks expected of incoming Pharm.D. st udents (transfer or otherwise) prior to registering for any coursework at NDSU. Failure to do so will autom atically lead to a revocation of the student's admittance. The student also is made aware the academic, profe ssional and time-limit standards outlined in the College Policy Manual (www.nds u.edu/healthprofessions/college_information/ policy_manual/) which govern the st udent's continued 3.20 ACADEMIC REMEDIATION and REPETITION OF PROFESSIONAL COURSES Professional pharmacy student s failing to achieve a mi nimum grade of \"C\" in a graded course or \"P\" in a pass/fail course may be offered remediation at the discre tion of the course instruct or(s) to. Remediation is a privilege and should only be offered to students with regular course a ttendance and participation. Remediation is defined as any change in grade based on the es tablished grading crit eria and process t hat applies to all students. Remediation will be tailored to the individual student and may in clude, but is not limited to, one or more of the following in conjunction with ac ademic advising: re-examination, additional course work, independent study, and campus tutoring. If remediation is offered, it is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure the student demonstrates competence in the c ourse material. Prior to offering re mediation, the course instructor must notify the Senior Asso ciate Dean with the student's name and pr oposed plan of remediation. The Senior Associate Dean will be responsible fo r tracking remediation o pportunities offered to all professional students. Students will only be allowed to re mediate one course per semester. If students do not successfully complete a profession al pharmacy course (i.e. grade less than a C), and remediation is not offered, they may repeat the c ourse. Withdrawal (for r easons other than extenuating conditions*) from a profe ssional pharmacy course with a grade less than a C is considered the same as a failure. Failure to complete all Co-Curriculum semester requi rements is considered a pr ofessional pharmacy course failure . Students are limited to a total number of three (3) course failures and/ or course remediation. A fourth occurrence of receiving a grade less than a C (or withdrawal due to a grade less than a C) or course remediation in a professional pharmacy course, didactic or experiential, wi ll result in term ination from the pharmacy program. For example the established standard wo uld result in dismissal from the professional pharmacy program if a student had the following results Rem ediation of 2 courses, failure of 1 course, and fail ure of 1 APPE. Compliance with the University Class Attendance Policy 333 is still required by ins tructors. Appeals to this policy may be submitted to the Pharmacy Academic Affa irs and Student Progre ss Committee which may grant exceptions due to exte nuating circumstances. *All extenuating circumstances mu st be approved by the Pharmacy Ac ademic Affairs and Student Progress Committee before the withdrawal takes place.

Approved: 8/11/04 Housekeeping: 3.26 PHARM.D. PROFESSIONAL ELECTIVES A minimum of 6 professional elective course credits, that permit explorat ion of and/or advance study in areas of professional interest, are required for graduation with the entry-level Pharm.D. degree. Professional elective courses are subjec t to the following rules: 1. Professional elective courses must be taken while enrolled in the entry-level P harm.D. program (e.g. beginning Fall Semester P1 year). These courses must be completed prio r to the beginning of the P4 year. 2. Professional elective courses must be taken for a letter grade, and a grade of C or better (pass for a pass/fail course) is required to meet the requirements. 3. The Pharm.D. handbook contains a list of pr e-approved professional elective courses. 4. A student may take a professional elective course that is not included in the pre-approved list only after (1) consultation with his/her academic advisor, AND (2) approval of the c ourse by the Pharm.D. Curriculum Committee. The necessary steps to take a course that is not included in the pre-approved prof essional elective course list is as follows: 1. The student must meet with his/her advisor and demonstrate that the c ourse \"permits exploration of and/or advance study in areas of professional interest\". This reques t must be made to the advisor by December 1 for upcoming spring semester courses, and April 1 for upcoming summer and fall semester courses. 2. If the advisor supports the student's elective course choice, then th e advisor shall petition to the chair of the Curriculum Committee to approve the course. 3. Curriculum Committee will obtain a syllabus for revi ew and contact the instructor to address other criteria as needed. 4. Upon receipt of all required information, the Cu rriculum Committee shall review the information, determine the status of the request, and inform the student, and advisor, of the outcome of the petition. 5. If the Curriculum Committee approves the course, the course shall be included in future revisions of the pre-approved professional elective course list.

Approved: 3/10/04 Housekeeping: 12/3/14 Source: Faculty Meeting Minutes PHARM.D. Policy 3.28 STUDENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURES The Accreditation Council for Phar macy Education (ACPE), at the behes t of the U.S. Secretary of Education, requires all accredited pharmacy programs to establish, impl ement and assess a formal complaint policy for students. More specifica lly, all accredited colleges or school s of pharmacy must establish a comprehensive policy with a simple set of procedures whereby all students enroll ed in the College (and the pharmacy program in particular) can submit and resolv e a complaint about the educational process. While such procedures do not always produce an outcome that meets the student's pref erences, they do ensure that students have access to an equitabl e and efficient means to remediate their complaints. The complete set of ACPE standards regarding student complaint po licies can be found on pages 32-33 (Standard 20) of the following website http://www.acpe-accredit.org/pdf/ACPE_Revised_PharmD_Standards_Adopted_Jan152006.pdf. The NDSU School of Pharmacy takes student complaints very seriousl y. Our goal is to ensure that students have access to transparent, due process in a m anner that leads to an appropriate resolution of the complaint. To that end, a copy of t he NDSU School of Pharma cy policy relating to this issue is available on its website at www.ndsu.ed u/pharmacy. Students who have difficulty a ccessing this webpage may also obtain a copy of the complaint policy in the Dean's Office (Sudro Hall, Room 123). A discussion of this policy shall take place annually during the orientation pr ocess for first professional year students. Each student complaint will be appropriately docum ented and investigated. A chronological record of each complaint, including the natur e of the complaint, written records of the complaint procedure and the final outcomes of the resolution proc ess shall be maintained in the Office of the Dean, and shall be available for review by ACPE or its represent atives upon written request or in the process of an on-site evaluation visit. Student complaints generally fall within two major categories: complaints about unfair grading and all other, non-grade-related complaints. Student complain ts about grades are generally handled at the level of the University, since grades are usually adminis tered through the NDSU Office of Registration and Records. Other student complaints remain under the purview of the individual colleges within NDSU. Student Complaints Regarding Grades University Grade Appeal Policy NDSU has an established policy regarding complain ts about grading, otherwi se known as \"grade appeals\". The full grade appeal pol icy (section 337), which includes hearing procedures, is available at www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/337.pdf. While students acti vely considering a grade appeal are referred to the aforementioned website for the specific details of the policy, a summary of the policy is outlined below. With the exception of incomplete grades, a cour se grade is considered final unless an appropriate appeal is filed by the student. Grade changes are also considered only for those students who have not yet earned a degree for which the course in question was applied. For a student who has reason to believe that t hey have been issued an inco rrect or inappropriate grade, he/she must initiate a request fo r a change of a grade with the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional days of the first day of the semest er immediately following the semest er in which the grade was awarded. For Spring Semester courses, the request may be made with in fifteen (15) instructi onal days of the start of Fall Semester, if the student is not enrolled for a Summer term in the same academic year. A grade appeal is formally in itiated when the stude nt presents the Grade Appeal Form to the instructor. If there is an unsatisfactory decision, t he student must consult the Department Head, and the Dean or a designated college commi ttee, proceeding from one le vel to the next only after an unsatisfactory decision of the conflict at that level. In t he event that the instructor is also the Department Head or Dean, he or she need only be consulted in the capacity of instructor. In the event of an unsatisfactory decision within the college, the student may submit a formal written appeal to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be made within fifteen (15) instructional days a fter conclusion of the coll ege proceedings as stated above. Non-Grade Student Complaints Pre-professional and professiona l pharmacy students who have a non-grade-related complaint can seek resolution of that complaint through the followi ng procedures. It is impo rtant to note that these procedures represent the sole avenu e for student complaints regarding non-grade-related issues, including (but not limited to) ACPE standards, policies and proc edures. Additionally, becau se the pharmacy program spans multiple departments, the non-grade complaints are handled thr ough the Dean's Office , rather than by the departments themselves. 1. The student(s) or, in cases where student anonymity is required, their advocate (also known as the \"plaintiff(s)\") will file a formal written complaint (delivered through the postal service or NDSU email) to the Dean's Office in t he NDSU School of Pharmacy. 2. The written complaint must include a description of the issue, policy, pr ocedure or ACPE standard in question. It must also summarize the argument of the plainti ff (including the grounds for the appeal or complaint) and provide a reasonable am ount of evidence supporting the claim. 3. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the complain t will be assigned to either the Senior Associate Dean (as the Chair of the College Academic Affairs Committee) if the complain t is primarily academic in nature, or the Associate Dean for Student Affa irs and Faculty Development (as the Chair of the College Student Affairs Committee) if the complain t is primarily non-academic . The plaintiff(s) will receive email notification (via NDSU email) within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the complaint concerning the identity of the A ssociate Dean handling the complaint. 4. The Senior Associate Dean or Associate Dean fo r Student Affairs and Facult y Development or, if a non-academic issue, Student Affair s, shall convene a meet ing of College Academic Affairs or, if a non-academic, Student Affairs Committe e to review the complaint. Be cause the procedures for both Associate Deans and Committees are similar in pr ocedure, they will henceforth be referred to generically as \"Associate Dean\" and \"Committee\", re spectively. The Committee meeting shall occur within thirty days from the time that the A ssociate Dean receives the written complaint. 5. Once the Committee has met, the Associate Dean sh all prepare and submit a formal, written reply to the student(s) based on the recommendation of Comm ittee. The reply sha ll include an evaluation of the complaint, a description of any violations, and a proposal for any necessary corrective action. The reply will be sent through official NDSU deliv ery methods (i.e., the postal service, campus mail and/or the NDSU email system) with in fifteen business days from the time that the Committee makes a decision. 6. Decisions of the Committee that demonstrate arbitrary and capric ious treatment, or that are fundamentally inappropriate in the eyes of the plaintiff(s) may be appealed to the Dean of NDSU School of Pharmacy. In such cases, the st udent(s) file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Dean. The written complaint would also identify and provide evidenc e indicating that the A ssociate Dean and/or the Committee acted in an arbitrary, capric ious or otherwise inappropriate manner. 7. If unsatisfactory resolution occurs after the appeal to the Dean, a final appeal may be made to the Provost. Once again, the student(s) must file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complain t would be addressed directly to t he Provost, rather than the Dean, and would provide evidence substant iating the claim of unfair treatm ent levels. Approved: 4/21/2011 Source: 3.29 DOCTOR OF PHARMACY (PHARM.D.) STUDENT TECHNICAL STANDARDS The North Dakota State Universi ty College of Health Professions ' (NDSU CHP) mission is to educate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy, nursing, allied sciences, and public health. As a corollary to this mission, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligible for licensure, and embark upon a successful career as a health care professional. Thus, the Pharm.D. professional program requires students to undertake the full set of activities that are necessary to comple te their program of study. The goal of every licensed pharmacist is to provide safe and effective care to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals must have the physical, cognitiv e and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's profession. Failure to dem onstrate these competencies not only endangers the patients under the pharmacist's care, but also impacts the ability of other prov iders to provide safe and effective patient care. Therefore, the following technical st andards represent competencies neces sary to complete the Pharm.D. professional program and provides additional guidance to the College Student Technical Standards Policy 3.11 for students. Students must be able, with or without reasonable accommodations, to consistently demonstrate these competencies. Stude nts who fail to demonstrate these competencies are ineligible for admission or progression in the NDSU Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) pr ofessional program. The technical standard competencies are organized into five general categories: 1. Perception/observation 2. Communication 3. Motor/tactile function 4. Intellectual, conceptual, integr ative, and quantitative abilities 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes 1. Perception/Observation Competencies Students must be able to utilize their senses and ment al abilities to perceive and observe information presented through: Written material Audiovisual material Demonstration Large-group lectures Small group discussions and presentations One-on-one interactions Laboratory experiences Patient encounters (at a di stance or close at hand) Procedures 2. Communication Competencies Students must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently (in English) using nonverbal, verbal, and writing strategies with faculty members, other members of the healthcare team , patients, families, and other students, in order to: Produce written and or al communication Elicit information Convey information Clarify information Create rapport Work collaboratively Develop therapeutic relationships Demonstrate computer literacy 3. Motor/Tactile Function Competencies Students must have sufficient motor func tion, skills, and tactile ability to ex ecute basic tasks in the training and provision of patient care. This includes coor dination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the sens es of touch and vision in order to: Attend and participate in classes, groups, and acti vities which are part of the curriculum. Conduct basic laboratory procedures and tests. Perform basic, non-sterile compounding. Demonstrate aseptic technique. Examine patients (including in spection, auscultation, palpatio n, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers). Administer immunizations, per form cardiopulmonary resuscita tion, perform palpitation, auscultation, and percussion. Provide patient care appropri ate to the circumstances. Perform in a reasonably in dependent way in potentially hi gh speed/high demand/emergency environments. 4. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrat ive & Quantitative Competencies: Student must be able to demonstr ate higher-level cognitive abilities, which include: Memory Rational thought Visual-spatial comprehension Conceptualization Application Measurement Calculation Analysis Representation (oral, written, di agrammatic, three dimensional) Organization Synthesis Clinical reasoning Ethical reasoning 5. Behavioral and Social Competencies Students must consistently demonstrate attributes of pr ofessionalism, including: Empathy, compassion, integrity, and respect for others. Preparation, initiative, and a ccountability consistent with a commitment to excellence Commitment to legal and ethical principles pertain ing to the provision of patient centered care. Mindfulness of the environment, re cognizing that one's professionalis m is constantly evaluated by others. Reasonable Accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages any st udent who suspects that he or s he may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Disability Services for guidance concerning the steps that are necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. C onsistent with NDSU and Federal policies, students with documented evidence of disabilities may request r easonable accommodations. However, such requests are not reasonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger pati ents, students, co-workers and/or instructors, or otherwise cause a f undamental alteration to the program. Failing to Meet, Reporting and Adj udicating Technical Competencies Applicants and students of the Phar macy Doctorate professional progr am who consistently fail to demonstrate the competencies identifie d above are ineligible for admissi on or progression in the program. Students who are admitted to the Pharmacy Doctorate professi onal program and who realize (either through their own efforts or as demonstrated by a licensing board, a pr eceptor or a faculty me mber in the program) that they do not (or no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technica l competencies to be eligible for licensure have an ethical obl igation to self-report that information to the College' s administration (i.e., the appropriate department chair, the Senior Associate D ean and/or the Associate De an for Student Affairs and Faculty Development). Once realized (through own awareness or as report ed to them by a licensing board, faculty, or preceptor), failure to self-report a consistent lack of technical competenc ies represents a violation of the Student Conduct Policy (Co llege Policy Manual, 3.30 EXAMINATION ADMINISTRATION The purpose of this policy is to provide expectation s for student conduct related to examinations and ensure examinations given at t he School of Pharmacy are adequately and consistently administered. Aside from maintaining academic integrity, exam ination procedures prepar e the student for the stringent expectations of the professional licensure process. I. Technology Requirements 1. Students must possess an iPad and accessor ies that meet the School of Pharmacy requirements. 2. Students must install and mainta in a current version of iOS and the electronic testing software utilized for ExamSoft exam delivery. 3. Students should be familiar with their iPad, testing software, and instructions prior to downloading an ex amination. 4. Students are expected to: a. Have an A/C power cord av ailable AND a fully charged battery (at least 2 hours) for cases in which there is a power di sruption during the ex amination OR an electrical outlet is not near the student's assigned seat. b. Ensure that the internal clock is set to the correct date a nd time (CST/CDT). II. Timing and Attendanc e at Examinations 1. Students requiring accommodations are to coordinate with the office of Disability Services prior to the delivery of the examin ation (NDSU Policy Manual Section 606). 2. Students are expected to be present for all ex aminations unless otherwise stated by the course instructor. All absences require appropriate document ation and instru ctor approval (NDSU Policy Man ual Section 333). a. Students missing an examinat ion due to an EXCUSED abs ence will be permitted to take a make-up examination timed at the discretion of the instructor. b. Students missing an exam ination due to an UNE XCUSED absence may be granted the privilege of taking a make-up examination; however, the student will be subject to a penalty on their exam score. c. In any case where a delayed or makeup examination is necessary, a comparable but different examination may be given. Faculty may assess in a different format from the original exam (e.g. multiple choice may be replaced with essay questions). d. All delayed or makeup examinations must be taken under direct observation of a proctor. The proctor may be a teaching assistant, graduate assistant. The proctor may also directly observe with use of a surveillance camera. 3. Students must be on time for examinations. St udents arriving more than 15 minutes late, without proper justification, will be subject to penalty. Student's arrivi ng late must take the examination in a location deter mined by the individual administering the exam. Unless extenuating circumstances are ca use for the delay and were un avoidable, they will receive no additional time. 4. Examination start times will not be delayed d ue to a hardware or software problem with a student's iPad. Students enc ountering a tech nical issue during an exam should notify the individual administering the exam. See Technology Issues. 5. Students are responsible for brin ging their iPad to the examination room with the exam file already downloaded. Additional time will not be granted for do wnloading exam files when it was available prior to the exam session. 6. If a student has examination acco mmodations approved by the Office for Disability Services, the exam must be taken in the facilities of the Office for Dis ability Services and at the same time as the regular class exam ination (if time permits). III. Examination Procedures 1. Faculty are responsibl e for being attentive to students during an exam. 2. Students may be asked for id entification or si gn an attendance log at any time. 3. Students are expected to maintain a decor um and demeanor consistent with accepted academic and professional standards at all times during examinatio ns (NDSU CHP Policy Manual Section 3.9). Lack of pr ofessional decorum may result in dismissal from the exam, which will be considered an unexcused absence. 4. Students may be randomly s eated during an examination. 5. An examination may take place dur ing a time that is not part of their regular course schedule. This will be determined by the faculty and will be conv eyed in the course syllabus. 6. Students are allowed ONLY the following items at their seat: a. iPad devoid of taped-on note s or markings that coul d be construed as \"cheat sheets\" b. Power adapter c. Standard (non-mechanical/ non-refillable) #2 pencils d. The following items may be al lowed if deemed necessary by the course instructor: 1.

This report summarizes a survey of faculty, staff and stakeholders in the College of Health Professions who routinely work with Dr. Naughton in her capacity as the Senior Associate Dean. The survey was designed, administered and summarized during the period October 15 through December 14, 2015, and was conducted in accordance with NDSU Policy 327: Evaluation of Academic Deans, Directors, and Department Chairs/Heads. The Process On August 5, 2015, Dr. Charles Peterson, Dean of the College of Health Professions (CHP), initiated the review process. An eight member committee chaired by Carla Gross, Associate Dean and Chair of the School of Nursing was developed. Other members included Amy Werremeyer (Associate Professor of Practice and Vice Chair, Pharmacy Practice), Brody Maack (Assistant Professor of Practice, Pharmacy Practice), Kristine Steffen (Associate Professor, Pharmaceutical Science), Mark Strand (Professor, Pharmacy Practice and Public Health), Karla Haug (Assistant Professor of Practice, Nursing), Melissa Eslinger (Academic Assistant, Dean's Office), and Dan Cernusca (Assistant Professor, Instructional Designer). The Committee communicated through face to face meetings and email. The final report was submitted to Dr. Peterson on December 11, 2015. The evaluation committee created a survey instrument to evaluate Dr. Naughton's performance in carrying out her administrative responsibilities. The survey contained six sections. Questions in Section one asked the individual's unit within the College (Allied Sciences, Dean's Office, Nursing, Pharmacy Practice, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Other) and the role of the individual responding to the survey (Faculty, Administrative Council, Staff, Clinical Associate, and Other). The second section contained four items assessing Dr. Naughton's overall effectiveness. Section three included twelve questions assessing her leadership abilities. The fourth section, which included five items assessing Dr. Naughton's performance in assessment was completed only by faculty in Pharmacy Practice and Pharmaceutical Sciences since her role in assessment is limited to these two units. Section five contained nine items assessing her performance in communication. Finally, the sixth section included eight questions assessing Dr. Naughton's performance related to management. Each section included an open ended question encouraging participants to include additional insights related to the measured category. At the end of the survey, participants were asked to comment on Dr. Naughton's strengths and areas for growth. A five point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) was used to answer the quantitative survey items. Collectively, these items are generally consistent with the standards identified in NDSU Policy 327. Because Dr. Naughton's position as Senior Associate Dean is somewhat unique at NDSU and spans both administrative and department-specific responsibilities, a decision was made to design the survey in accordance with her actual job responsibilities, rather than arranging the survey items in a manner consistent with the evaluation criteria in Policy 327. Dr. Naughton was provided with a copy of the survey items and invited to provide feedback prior to the administration of the survey. The survey was administered electronically with Qualtrics software. The survey was sent to faculty and staff in the College of Health Professions, the Pharmacy Alumni Advisory Board, Clinical Associates, APPENDIX 8Kand other external program stakeholders and was opened the week of November 10th through November 20th. Two reminders were sent out during that time to encourage participation. After closing the survey, all responses were gathered, analyzed, and summarized. Survey items with five point response scales were summarized using descriptive statistics. Open-ended comments were compiled and major themes were identified. These summaries are provided below. The full set of responses has been attached to this report as an appendix. Evaluation Summary Demographics Sixty-four respondents completed the survey. Of those, 36% (N= 23) were from Pharmacy Practice, 20% (N = 13) were from Nursing, 13% (N = 8) were from Pharmaceutical Sciences, 3% (N = 2) were from Public Health, 3% (N = 2) from Allied Sciences, and 13% (N = 8) identified as \"other\". The distribution of respondents by role included 58% (N = 37) faculty, 17% (N = 11) staff, 8% (N = 5) Administrative Council members, 2% (N = 1) clinical associate, and 16% (N = 10) identifying as \"other\". The majority of the participants from the \"other\" category included advisory board members; a lecturer and a campus administrator also responded. A few invitees contacted the evaluation committee chair and respectfully declined to participate in the survey because they did not believe that they worked with Dr. Naughton on a regular basis to provide meaningful responses. Mean Scores Categories/Distributions Cronbach's Alpha was calculated to analyze the internal reliability of each category. The results ranged from .96 to .99, suggesting very high internal consistency between items in each category. Clearly, the items used to assess performance in each of the five categories were highly reliable. As depicted in Table 1 below, the mean scores for each category ranged from 4.0 to 4.2 (SD ranged from .92 to 1.11). Table 2 reveals the mean values for each survey item. Table 1.

Staff rated her performance lowest (4.0) in the overall effectiveness and leadership categories and highest (4.3) in management. Members of Administrative Council rated Dr. Naughton's performance lowest (3.9) in the categories of communication and management and highest (4.1) in the overall effectiveness category. The group identifying as \"other\" rated Dr. Naughton's performance highest, ranging from 4.8 (overall effectiveness and leadership) to 4.9 (communication and management). The assessment category was excluded in the last three group mean ratings summary since a very limited number of participants answered the assessment items. When assessing the mean score distribution by departments, participants who identified as \"other\" rated her highest ranging from 4.2 in communication to 5.0 in management. Allied Science and the Dean's Office staff participants rated Dr. Naughton's performance in all four categories consistently high (4.4 to 4.5). Nursing participants rated her performance lowest (3.7) in the overall effectiveness category and highest (4.3) in communication and management. Participants from Public Health rated her lowest (3.9) in leadership and highest (4.6) in communication. Participants in Pharmacy Practice rated Dr. Naughton's performance somewhat lower and fairly consistent across categories, ranging from 3.8 in leadership and management to 4.2 in assessment. Mean scores from Pharmaceutical Sciences participants ranged from 3.5 in leadership to 4.1 in management. Overall Effectiveness Overall, respondents agreed that Dr. Naughton is effective in her position. This was evaluated using four questions related to overall effectiveness. The mean ranged from 4.0-4.2 (SD 0.99 -1.20). Respondents agreed that Dr. Naughton provides leadership in all matters related to Academic Affairs as well as working effectively with all departments within the College (4.0). Dr. Naughton is also effective at providing administrative oversight for matters related to assessment (4.1). Respondents agreed that Dr. Naughton is effective at developing and implementing academic policies and procedures to support and enhance the quality of the College of Health Professions (4.2). Comments related to overall effectiveness were very positive. Dr. Naughton was reviewed as an effective leader by several respondents. Respondents state that Dr. Naughton is accessible and thoughtful as well as knowledgeable and approachable. One respondent shared, \"Dr. Naughton is a consummate professional in terms of both academic endeavors and administrative duties. She puts students first.\" Some respondents did identify that Dr. Naughton's role is primarily within the pharmacy programs; her interactions with other units are limited. Leadership The administered survey had 12 questions to evaluate participants' perceptions of Dr. Naughton's leadership skills. The internal reliability of the 12 leadership questions as measured with Cronbach's Alpha was extremely high (0.99). The mean and standard deviation shown in Tables 1 and 2 indicate a high level of perceived leadership skills, while the range of the average scores points towards some less positive evaluations. The distribution of means across the elements of the two demographic variables collected for this review is presented in Tables 3 and 4. While all mean scores are high and very high, as suggested by the results shown in these tables, the participants in the departments that have a stronger connection with Dr. Naughton, Pharmacy Practice and Pharmaceutical Sciences, respectively, have a lower mean score for perceived leadership skills than other departments. On the same line of reasoning, faculty members' input shows a lower mean score for the perceived leadership skills. Of the six participants that provided an answer to the open-ended question related to Dr. Naughton's leadership skills, four clearly indicated that they had few or no significant leadership-related interactions with her and therefore they could not provide significant feedback on this area. These findings provide some additional support to the previous findings that showed some over-estimation of these skills from those participants that came from departments or roles not linked to the School of Pharmacy. While two of the six respondents spoke favorably about Dr. Naughton's leadership, there were some comments that suggest the possibility of some departments in the College of Health Professions feeling less connected to Dr. Naughton. Assessment Senior Associate Dean Naughton was evaluated in the area of assessment of pharmacy programs, in accordance with her job description. Only the survey respondents who identified that they were members of the Departments of Pharmaceutical Sciences or Pharmacy Practice were able to access the four questions that addressed the area of assessment of pharmacy programs in the survey. Overall, scores were high in this area. The highest mean score (4.5) (SD .74) was associated with question 4, \"Keeps up to date with changes in accreditation standards related to assessment and informs others of these changes.\" The lowest mean score (4.0) (SD .74) was associated with question 1, \"Effectively institutes and manages a process for evaluation the success and performance of pharmacy programs.\" There was just one pertinent comment relevant to the area of assessment and this comment was very positive. Communication There were nine questions included on the survey related to communication ability and effectiveness. The Chronbach's Alpha value for this set of questions was found to be .98, suggesting very high internal consistency between items in this category. Among the 59 respondents, the mean score across questions related to communication was 4.2 (SD1.0). Mean communication scores varied across departments; the lowest mean scores were given by the pharmaceutical sciences (3.8, n=8) and pharmacy practice (3.9, n=22) departments and the highest scores were given by allied sciences (4.5, n=2) and public health (4.6, n=2). Mean ratings on individual items within the set of questions concerning communication ranged from 4.0-4.4, and median values were either 4 or 5 for each question. Dr. Naughton's perception as a communicator is very positive. Based on additional comments provided by those surveyed, she clearly has very good communication skills and is open to discussion and listening to other faculty and staff. It is also noted that she carries herself very professionally and is very approachable to those who have regular contact with her. Some comments provided evidence that some departments outside of pharmacy practice, such as nursing, do not have much contact with her, and therefore were unable to comment on her ability to communicate effectively. Management Senior Associate Dean Naughton's management responsibilities were evaluated using eight questions. The mean of the responses varied from 4.1-4.3 (SD 0.99-1.20). Overall, respondents agreed that Dr. Naughton is effective in her ability to make decisions, her organization and management skills, her follow-up on academic affairs issues, and her ability to apply policy consistently (mean for all areas 4.2). Dr. Naughton also demonstrates the ability to manage workloads appropriately (4.1). Respondents agreed that Dr. Naughton assists faculty with the handling of students' complaints (4.1). Respondents also agreed that she effectively delegates tasks (4.1). The highest ranked management question was her ability to effectively manage and coordinate scheduling and registration within the college (4.3). Overall, Dr. Naughton was identified to have effective management skills. Comments related to management indicated that Dr. Naughton has excellent management and organizational skills. \"Dr. Naughton was always well-organized and completed tasks (both assigned and volunteered for) in a responsible and timely manner. Respondents also positively acknowledge her ability to address student issues through consistent application of College policies and fairness.\" Respondents indicated an area of growth (by a small margin) to be Naughton's ability to delegate activities. Strengths When asked to describe Dr. Naughton's strengths, 27 of the 64 participants responded with their perceptions. Several themes were identified. She has strong communication skills, is very approachable, and is receptive to others. For example, one participant wrote \"Dr. Naughton is an excellent listener. She is respectful while also being insightful.\" She is also viewed as dedicated, goal directed, and knowledgeable. One participant commented on Dr. Naughton's \"strong understanding of academic policies and the assessment process\" and her \"attention to detail and motivation to complete tasks thoroughly, efficiently, and effectively\". Participants view Dr. Naughton's demeanor as very professional. One individual stated \"She is visionary and sets high standards for herself and others.\" \"She has great vision and does a wonderful job of getting buy-in and keeping faculty moving in the direction of her vision(s) for improvement of programs.\" Areas for Growth Of the 14 comments in this section of the survey, 11 actually made suggestions for areas for growth in Dr. Naughton's performance. The most consistent theme was the need for her to interact more with the other disciplines in the College in her role as Associate Dean. For example, one participant wrote \"Availability and visibility with non-pharmacy students, faculty, and staff\". Another wrote \"maybe a clearer definition of her role with nursing\". Other suggestions, although these were not as prevalent, were to seek more faculty input before making decisions and to enhance her delegation skills. Conclusions The evaluation committee members agreed that the performance survey findings indicate that Dr. Naughton is effective in her role as Senior Associate Dean. Only two of the 38 items in the survey had a mean score less than 4.0; both items were in the leadership category. Mean scores for all other items across all categories ranged from 4.0 to 4.5 indicating participants agreed or strongly agreed with the statements. Dr. Naughton is viewed as highly professional, knowledgeable, and organized leader with very good communication skills. As discussed earlier in this report, mean ratings of Dr. Naughton's performance were perceived as less favorable from participants in Pharmacy Practice and Pharmaceutical Sciences departments and participants who are faculty. When discussing the possible reasons for this finding, committee members identified that participants in those categories interact more closely and frequently with Dr. Naughton; therefore they are most likely best able to evaluate her performance and to have the strongest responses. Based on comments dispersed throughout the survey report, Dr. Naughton's position as Senior Associate Dean in the College of Health Professions is unclear and confusing, especially to faculty and staff outside of the pharmacy discipline. Committee members agreed that this does not reflect Dr. Naughton's performance. Instead the committee recommends that her position description be re-evaluated and/or better communicated to faculty and staff so that her role in the College is better understood. 1Senior Associate Dean, Cynthia Naughton - Review Survey November 2015 Demographics Total number of respondents: 64 Table 1.

Results from the Analysis of Review Categories The administered survey had 5 review categories each made of multiple questions evaluated with a Likert Scale (1- strongly disagree to 5- strongly agree). Table 3 shows these categories, their structure and the internal reliability of each category as measured with Cronbach's Alpha. Table 3. Review Categories Review category # questions Cronbach's Alpha Overall Effectiveness 4 .96 Leadership 12 .99 Assessment [Pharmacy] 5 .96 Communication 9 .98 Management 8 .98 2The very high internal reliability for each of the five review categories indicates that each category acts as a reliable evaluation scale resulted as the mean of its questions' scores.

Difficult to answer questions about effectiveness because the SON virtually never has any interaction with Dr. Naughton, I believe she is only concerned about Pharmacy practice Difficult to answer. Not sure of what Dr. Naughton role is with the nursing department. If leadership and/or oversight of nursing is a role, I cant evaluate as I haven't seen those activities. Dr Naughton is a consummate professional in terms of both academic endeavors and administrative duties. She puts students first. She works extremely well with the Advisory Board, informing of the board of initiatives within her scope of activities, brings up areas of excellence as well as identifying areas in which the Advisory Board can help to improve. Top notch member of the team! Dr. Naughton has provided effective direction and oversight while reviewing my course content, including class objectives and lecture schedule. She has also been very encouraging. Dr. Naughton is an insightful leader within the College of Health Professions. She is accessible and thoughtful in her interactions with others. Dr. Naughton is open and approachable. Dr. Naughton's leadership was instrumental in the successful visit by the ACPE accreditation committee I have found her to be very willing to assist when I have needed assistance with anything. She has been very approachable when I have questions. I have not had hardly any interaction with her to base my assessment of her on, but wanted to respond to the repeated urgings to complete a survey. So, this is why I felt that my assessment was \"not applicable.\" Is always willing to collaborate with all departments--provides great insight and support to others when needed. Has high standards and if highly effective in her position. Understands, develops, and implements reasonable policies. Outstanding performance and leader . Pharmacy Practice and Allied Sciences both submit outstanding assessment reports and have strong cultures of assessing student learning. Pharmaceutical Sciences struggles. She is very knowledgeable and skilled at handling assessment and academic affairs issues. Very effective leader. Major projects such as mandatory I-pads and required Exam Soft examinations seemed to have not been discussed much. They were decided and implemented without full faculty input. 5Additional insights - Leadership Dr. Naughton was a highly involved and very effective committee member on the Core Undergraduate Learning Experiences team. She made particularly important contributions to the Quality Improvement Project (capstone experiences) that the team did for the HLC. She was also very helpful in helping us think systematically about how we examined recent general education revisions at other land-grants. Highly effective in all leadership skills!! Many of these items I have not had first hand experience with resulting in a not applicable rating. Other responses are based solely on my interaction with Dr. Naughton while serving on the pharmacy advisory board. My perception is limited by what she presents at the meetings and the Dean shares with us. Not familiar with her leadership or effectiveness because she is not transparent or visible or available to Nursing Once again, I have not had any one-on-one interaction with Dr. Naughton to base constructive feedback or evaluation on. Seems very focused on Pharmacy Additional insights - Assessment I am sure she does a great job with Pharmacy. nursing would not be able to evaluate her pharmacy assessment performance Very organized and efficient in all duties! Additional insights - Communication Cindy has excellent communication skills, and has an open door policy. difficult to evaluate as interaction with nursing is minimal Great interpersonal and communication skills! Displays a genuine concern for students, faculty and staff! Dr N is a great asset to the HP college, we are fortunate to have her!!!!!!! My interactions with Dr. Naughton have always been extremely professional. She seems genuinely interested in me as a person and is easy to talk to . Outstanding. Additional insights - Management Dr. Naughton was always well-organized and completed tasks (both assigned and volunteered for) in a responsible and timely manner. Excellent management skills. Very organized and fair. I have not worked with Dr. Naughton in this capacity to be able to assess. It would be nice to actually have the academic affairs committee evaluate and report on those students who are remediating repeatedly. Use this committee! Non-Pharmacy, Dr. Naughton does not do any of these activities for non-pharmacy staff and faculty so cannot answer many of the questions. She may be great in the Pharmacy program scheduling has been effective , unable to evaluate other criteria 6Strengths As faculty in the CHP, I have no idea her strengths because have had one conversation with her in 13 years. Assertive Cindy is very knowledgeable about the College and her field. Dedicated, well-spoken, motivated, visionary diligent worker Dr. Naughton demonstrates professionalism and has demonstrated an ability to develop and measure new teaching/learning methods within the College.

Verbal communication 7Areas for growth Availability and visibility with non-pharmacy students, faculty and staff Dr Naughton consistently makes unilateral decisions/plans with little or no faculty input. Dr Naughton lacks the skills necessary to build consensus and implement a team approach to solving problems and making strategic plans. I am unable to assess areas for growth. I don't see anything specific. / I hope n wish she will get an opporunity to serve a college/institute as a Dean or higher authority, in near future. She is SO READY for that not that I want to see her off. I would like to see her interact more with faculty in disciplines other than pharmacy. I sometimes get the impression that she feels faculty are beneath her in importance to the University. leadership maybe a clearer definition of her role with nursing. is she accountable for assessment activities of the college or just pharm practice? She can continue to grow in delegating to others. Sometimes her tendency to be a perfectionist comes across to others as controlling. Sometimes when approaching her with an issue, it seems like she is still thinking about something else. After a few minutes, it's usually fine. But sometimes you feel you have interrupted something. / Better mastery of education theory. Stubborn at times thoughtfully consider both sides of an issue, not just whoever \"gets your ear first\" Unknown by me at this time. When presenting information to the Advisory Board, her presentation style is very formal and her rate of speech is slower than anticipated. She is a great presenter, but would be nice to see her be a little less formal - take off the administrator hat for a while - we are a very laid back group. :) Leadership Senior Associate Dean Dr. Cynthia Naughton: 1.

January 31, 2019 Dean Charles Peterson North Dakota State University College of Health Professions PO Box 6050 Fargo, ND 58108 Dear Dean Peterson, The committee appreciates the opportunity to review Dr. Daniel Friesner, Associate Dean for the College of Health Professions, for his required administrative 360 evaluation. For this review we examined and analyzed several materials related to the job dut ies outlined in Dr. Friesner's position description. The materials used to evaluate Dr. Friesner include: Dr. Friesner's letter of self-assessment, statement of accomplishments, and administrative and leadership philosophy where he reflects both broadly and narrowly on his accomplishments and challenges; an online faculty/staff survey; an online student survey (sent to CHP Ambassadors and the Dean's Student Liaison Committee); an online partner survey (sent to selected outside the College partners); and, your 2014 -2018 supervisor letters of evaluation. This letter outlines the committee's analysis of the examined materials in five selected areas: Academic Advising and Student Recruitment, Partnerships and University Relationships, Student Affairs, Teaching , and Research. A final section of this letter focuses on results and recommendations specifically from the faculty/staff survey. Academic Advising and Student Recruitment In the areas of student recruitment/admissions and pharmacy student academic advisin g (these relate almost exclusively to pharmacy faculty and staff) faculty/staff generally agree that Dr. Friesner assures compliance with ACPE standards for student affairs. However, a significant number of people disagree that he seeks input from faculty regarding pharmacy admissions policy and standards, offers training and support for faculty academic advising, and that he makes fair faculty assignments for pharmacy advising loads. This may reflect confusion about which policies and decisions are made by him versus a college committee. Regardless, a more assertive communication style may be helpful in overcoming barriers to faculty buy -in. To be more effective as a leader in College -wide student recruitment, Dr. Friesner is encouraged to directly dissemin ate information via email or in meetings to all departments and individuals impacted by decisions. APPENDIX 8L DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH NDSU Dept 2662 I Box 6050 I Fargo I http://www.ndsu.edu/publichealth NDSU is an EO/AA university. Partnerships and University Relationships Dr. Friesner serves on several university committees related to student affairs. Materials used to summarize Dr. F riesner's effectiveness in representing the College were a partner survey sent to external stakeholders recommended by Dr. Friesner and his self -assessment of administrative duties. Among NDSU partners and stakeholders outside the College, Dr. Friesner is very well regarded. Survey participants find him to be a productive committee member, knowledgeable about college and NDSU policies, highly cooperative, and a good listener. They regard him as an excellent colleague. This reflects the stated importance tha t Dr. Friesner places on these relationships. Relative to Dr. Friesner's work on university committees, particularly the Honor's Advisory Council, increasing faculty involvement and the number of the College's students in the Honors program is one area nee ding attention. Student Affairs Dr. Friesner provides administrative oversight for student affairs issues within the College of Health Professions (CHP). This includes the development and implementation of the College's Student Conduct Policy. Specific to the PharmD program, student affairs responsibilities include: chairing the Pharmacy Admissions Committee, overseeing the process of admissions, orientation of new and returning pharmacy students, and assigning advisors for pre -professional and professional pharmacy students. Additionally, as the chair of the College Dean's Student Liaison Committee (DLC), Dr. Friesner is responsible for leading the meetings and setting expectations for the future work of the committee. The committee used both the student an d the faculty/staff surveys to determine Dr. Friesner's performance in the realm of student affairs. Students indicated that Dr. Friesner is an overall effective Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Students rated Dr. Friesner positively for specific charac teristics related to his interpersonal skills, credibility, trustworthiness, and his ability to support and advocate for all students. Additionally, faculty agreed that Dr. Friesner has an awareness and understanding of student affairs issues within the Co llege, and that he is responsive to student needs related to student affairs matters. Faculty also believe Dr. Friesner facilitates an open environment inclusive of all programs within the College. The evaluation from students and faculty follow the self -reflection assessment by Dr. Friesner, and the importance and emphasis he places on his responsibilities within the College. Teaching Dr. Friesner coordinates, implements, and provides instruction in the course CHP 190: Critical Thinking and Academic Succes s. This course was developed to replace University 189. The course involves coordination with the pre -professional advisors. The course is organized where students meet in smaller discussion groups one day per week with the advisors, and one day per DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH NDSU Dept 2662 I PO Box 6050 I Fargo I http://www.ndsu.edu/publichealth is an EO/AA university. week w ith Dr. Friesner in a large group format to focus on the basics of critical thinking. Dr. Friesner is in the process of developing a course challenge exam for CHP 190 as well as the development of a course best suited for transfer students. In his self -assessment, Dr. Friesner believes the course is an important accomplishment that fulfills his role as Associate Dean. Dr. Friesner also guest lectures on topics consistent with his areas of expertise. Finally, Dr. Friesner has submitted Stage I & Stage II pro posals for the development of a College -level major, a new Bachelor of Science in Health Services. The new major will serve the important function of providing a means of completion for College students who do not have the option of finishing a degree with in nursing, pharmacy, or allied sciences. Research Dr. Friesner has continued to maintain a strong focus in research and scholarship. Even with his heavy administrative duties, he continues to publish articles in peer -reviewed academic journals and co -author grant applications to federal funding sources. He has published over 125 peer - reviewed journal articles in fields including (but not limited to) pharmacy, nursing, economics, chemistry, finance, management science/operations research, education and leg al studies. Currently, he collaborates with other quantitative methods faculty on campus to build a biostatistics consulting unit as a part of a multi -million dollar NIH COBRE grant. Reflections Specific to Faculty and Staff Faculty and staff responses to the online survey include positive responses and indicated areas of improvement. Faculty and staff find Dr. Friesner friendly, intelligent, hard -working, prompt in replies, supportive and an excellent statistician and researcher. Faculty and staff also fin d Dr. Friesner to be approachable and available when assistance is needed. Comments related to Dr. Friesner's ability to communicate are mixed. He \"fails to communicate directly and effectively,\" \"Communicating via e -mail to everyone involved or discussing matters in meetings, rather than sharing things with one or two people and then expecting trickle down would greatly improve (Dr. Friesner's) effectiveness as a leader.\" Comments also state that Dr. Friesner tends to avoid conflict. Faculty and Staff stat e that he is a \"champion on behalf of students\" although some comments find this a negative in that faculty and staff then do not feel supported on policy changes or student affairs matters. Several comments also identified the lack of faculty development training. Overall, Faculty and Staff comments did state that Dr. Friesner is \"an effective administrator who always seems willing and eager to help.\" The committee recommends that Dr. Friesner consider implementing some techniques for improving communicat ion (although we also recognize that communication can be situational and difficult to make consistent with everyone when navigating competing interests). Regarding professional development (PD), the committee recommends that Dr. Friesner fall back on the DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH NDSU Dept 2662 I PO Box 6050 I Fargo is an EO/AA university. College PD committee to create no -cost, low -cost PD opportunities for the College. The committee should meet every year, even in lean times where funds are low. In conclusion, this committee finds Dr. Friesner to be an effective leader in his role as Assoc iate Dean for the College of Health Professions at North Dakota State University. Dr. Friesner successfully navigates competing interests of faculty, staff, and students. Although, we recognize this letter identifies areas of improvement for Dr. Friesner, we do so in the spirit of encouragement because we believe Dr. Friesner possesses self -awareness of his challenge/growth areas. In fact, the faculty/staff survey responses were consistent with his own assessment of identified growth areas. Please let us kn ow how the committee can be of further service and if you have any questions as to the methods utilized or conclusions reached.

This report summarizes a survey of faculty, staff and external stakeholders in the College of Health Professions (CHP) and the School of Pharmacy (SOP) who routinely work with Dr. Marvanova in her capacity as Department Chair. The revie w was conducted in accordance with NDSU Policy 327: Evaluation of Academic Deans, Directors, and Department Chairs/Heads. The Process Dr. Charles Peterson, Dean of the CHP and the SOP, initiated the review process on September 18, 2018. Dr. Dan Friesner, A ssociate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development in the CHP and the SOP, chaired the review committee. The other members of the review committee were: Kristine Steffen (Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Mark Strand (Professor, Pharmacy Practice ), Yagna Jarajapu (Associate Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Jeanne Frenzel (Associate Professor, Pharmacy Practice), Amanda Brooks (Assistant Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Lisa Richter (Assistant Professor, Pharmacy Practice), and Jean Trautmann (Staff, Department of Pharmacy Practice). The Committee communicated through both email and meetings. The review committee submitted its report to Dr. Peterson on January 25, 2019. When discussing the best approach and empirical methods to assess Dr. M arvanova, the review committee noted several considerations. First, respondent anonymity (both actual and perceived) must be ensured. Second, the methods used to collect information must be valid and reliable. Third, it is vital to disaggregate responses based on the respondent's professional roles and responsibilities. Put differently, faculty in the Department of Pharmacy Practice may have very different assessments of Dr. Marvanova' s work as Department Chair than other respondents. In many areas of e valuation, the responses of faculty within the Department of Pharmacy Practice may carry greater weight than other responses. Fourth, staff are an integral part of the evaluation. However, staff do not have the protection of faculty, and may have fundamen tally different assessments than faculty. These distinctions may make the responses of staff who work within the Department of Pharmacy Practice potentially identifiable. To address these issues, the review committee chose to contract with an external ven dor to collect the information used to generate this report. After considering various options, the review committee chose the Kansas State University IDEA Center's Feedback System for Chairs: https://www.ideaedu.org/Services/Leadership -Feedback -Systems/Feedback -System -for-Chairs . The review committee concluded that the use of an external vendor was important in order to ensure respondents that their res ponses were truly anonymous. Perhaps more importantly, this system has been used extensively and consistently over time by many academic departments across the U.S. As such, it is extremely likely to produce valid and reliable results. It assesses more than 50 different areas of leadership germane to Department Chairs, including administrative responsibilities (21 items), personal characteristics relevant to unit leadership (11 items), administrative methods (21 items) and overall success (2 items). The sys tem also asks Dr. Marvanova to self- assess her competencies and performance in each of these areas. Gap scoring is used to compare Dr. Marvanova's assessment with those of the respondents. Respondents also have the opportunity to provide open -ended commen ts. 2 The IDEA Center's assessment items allow for general evaluations of any given Chair's performance. The review committee also wanted to assess several issues that are potentially unique to the SOP. NDSU Policy 327 has been in place, and followed by th e CHP and SOP, for a number of years. Several surveys of CHP and SOP administrators have been created and implemented as a part of these evaluations. Upon perusing these surveys, the review committee determined that the following items would be added to the IDEA system surveys: 1. The Chair shows and fosters respect and appreciation for each person, whatever that person's background, age, race, gender, disability, values, lifestyle perspectives, or interests. 2. The Chair shares governance with others when app ropriate. 3. The Chair supports and defends academic freedom. 4. The Chair appropriately responds to the needs and/or suggestions of external constituencies. 5. The Chair fosters a culture of collaboration between departments in the School of Pharmacy. All items, including the IDEA items and these items, are evaluated using 5 -point Likert scales, with 1 indicating a low or negative response, 3 indicating a neutral response, and 5 indicating a high or positive response. More specifically 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = in -between, 4 = good, 5 = outstanding. To address the final concerns, the complete survey instrument (inclusive of comments, IDEA items and NDSU -authored items) was sent to two different groups of respondents, and separate, disaggregated results are provided for each group: 1. Faculty within the Department of Pharmacy Practice 2. Faculty, staff and administrators within the CHP, as well as external stakeholders identified by the Chair who work directly with Dr. Marvanova Staff working with the De partment of Pharmacy Practice were included with all other CHP staff, administrators, and faculty in the CHP, as well as external stakeholders, to ensure anonymous responses. The survey was opened November 21, 2018, and remained open through December 19, 2018. Dr. Friesner sent emails to CHP personnel to inform them that they would receive an opportunity to participate in the process by completing the survey (and that the invitation would come from the vendor). Reminder emails were sent every 4 days to no n-respondents. After closing the survey, all responses were gathered and summarized by IDEA and forwarded to the review committee. Survey items with five point response scales were summarized using descriptive statistics. Open -ended comments were comp iled and major themes were identified. These summaries are provided below. 3 IDEA Feedback System for Chairs Evaluation Committee Report - Pharmacy Practice Faculty Dr. Marketa Marvanova Overall Ratings of Effectiveness Seventeen out of 20 pharmacy practice faculty completed the online IDEA Feedback System for Chairs survey for Dr. Marketa Marvanova in December 2018. Overall, 52.9% of pharmacy practice faculty agreed or strongly agreed that they have confidence in Dr. Marvanova's ability to provide future leadership to the department and 47.1% agreed or strongly agreed that Dr. Marvanova has provided excellent leadership. Summary of IDEA Feedback System for Chairs Survey Pharmacy practice faculty were asked to evaluate Dr. Marvanova on her responsibilities associated with the role of the department chair and her personal characteristics and administrative methods most highly related to successful accomplishment of chair re sponsibilities. Survey responses were scaled using a Likert of 1 = poor , 2 = fair, 3 = in -between , 4 = good , 5 = outstanding. Strengths Pharmacy p ractice faculty rated Dr. Marvanova: 1. On her responsibilities relevant to the role of the chair as good for items focused on department needs, facilitating curriculum development, supporting good teaching and assessment, and overseeing essential administrative tasks, and new faculty and staff development. 2. On her personal characteristics relevant to the role of the chair as good for problem solving abilities , organizational skills, and practical judgement. 3. On her administrative methods as good for items focused on ensuring faculty are working at capacity, promoting inclusiveness and diversity, maintain ing standards of performance, facilitating positive relationships between faculty and staff, and advocating for the department. Weaknesses Pharmacy p ractice faculty rated Dr. Marvanova: 1. On her responsibilities relevant to the role of the chair as fair for it ems focused on developing collegiality and cooperation among faculty members, rewarding faculty for their contributions to the department, and stimulating faculty vitality/enthusiasm. 2. On her personal characteristics as fair for flexibility and adaptabilit y in dealing with individuals and situations. 3. On her administrative methods as fair for the importance of faculty morale to the Chair. Conclusion The IDEA Feedback System for Chairs survey found that pharmacy practice faculty identified Dr. Marvanova a mix of as good , in-between , and fair (1 = poor , 2 = fair , 3 = in-between , 4 = good , 5 = outstanding) for her chair related responsibilities, personal characteristics, and administrative methods. Items measuring good indicate s he is a strong advocate for the department . She is focused on department needs, facilitates curriculum development, support s good teaching and assessment, and 4 oversee s essential administrative tasks . She ensur es faculty are working at capacity, maintain s standards of performance, and facilitat es relationships between faculty and staff. Items measuring fair and indicating opportunities for professional growth included: 1) developing collegiality/cooperation among faculty members, 2) rewarding faculty in accordance with their contributions to the department, 3) stimulating or rejuvenating faculty vitality/enthusiasm, 4) flexibility/adaptability in dealing with individuals/situations, and 5) demonstrating that high faculty morale is vital to her. As commented, p harmacy practic e faculty perceive Dr. Marvanova to be an advocate for the pharmacy practice department and for faculty at clinical practice sites . Faculty appreciate her decisiveness. Areas of concern arising from the perceptions of p harmacy practice faculty include com ments that Dr. Marvanova should attend more department and campus events, listen to and solicit feedback from faculty, and be more respectful of faculty time when conducting meetings. Pharmacy practice faculty feel the most important challenges facing the department which she has to overcome are diminishing student applicant pools, budget constraints, a continual need to fill open faculty positions , and faculty feeling overworked. Pharmacy practice faculty feel changes to the workload document and promoti on and tenure policy as well as increased opportunities for collaboration within and outside of the faculty would contribute to depar tment effectiveness. Of note, 'low morale' and a 'culture of fear' were phrases used several times throughout the qualitat ive comments. Additionally, suggestions were made that Dr. Marvanova seek training s through the North Dakota St ate University Human Resources department with regard to fair faculty expectations . Several opportunities for professional growth were noted . Dr. Marvanova is encouraged to consider action s, where appropriate, to address these opportunities. Dr. Marvanova is encouraged to invest more time engaging with her faculty , including prioritizing listening and soliciting input from her faculty . Dr. Marvanova is encouraged to empower faculty by giving them more autonomy in their work and through the support of faculty governance. Dr. Marvanova is encouraged to s upport needed changes to the workload document and promotion and tenure guidelines, as these were cited as being important to faculty. Doing so may increase faculty morale. 1 Dr. Marketa Marvanova Evaluation Committee Report #2 The committee assigned to evaluate Dr. Marketa Marvanova, Chair of the Department of Pharmacy Practice, respectfully submits the following report. This report summarizes a survey of faculty, staff and external reviewers in the College of Health Professions (CHP) and the School of Pharmacy (SOP) who routinely work with Dr. Marvanova in her capacity as Department Chair. The review w as conducted in accordance with NDSU Policy 327: Evaluation of Academic Deans, Directors, and Department Chairs/Heads. The Process Dr. Charles Peterson, Dean of the CHP and the SOP, initiated the review process on September 18, 2018. Dr. Dan Friesner, Asso ciate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development in the CHP and the SOP, chaired the review committee. The other members of the review committee were: Kristine Steffen (Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Mark Strand (Professor, Pharmacy Practice), Yagna Jarajapu (Associate Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Jeanne Frenzel (Associate Professor, Pharmacy Practice), Amanda Brooks (Assistant Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Lisa Richter (Assistant Professor, Pharmacy Practice), and Jean Trautmann (Staff, Department of Pharmacy Practice).

These summaries are provided below. 3 IDEA Feedback System for Chairs Evaluation Committee Report - Pharmaceutical Sciences, Staff, and External Reviewers Ratings Dr. Marketa Marvanova Overall Ratings of Effectiveness Twenty -nine out of 56 pharmaceutical sciences faculty, School of Pharmacy staff, and external reviewers completed the online IDEA Feedback System for Chairs survey for Dr. Marketa Marvanova in December 2018. Overall, 82.6% pharmaceutical sciences faculty, School of pharmacy staff, and external faculty, agreed or strongly agreed that they have confidence in Dr. Marvanova's ability to provide future leadership to the department and 83.3% agreed or strongly agreed that Dr. Marvanova has provided excellent leadership. Summary of IDEA Feedback System for Chairs Survey Pharmaceutical sciences faculty, School of Pharmacy staff, and external reviewers were asked to evaluate Dr. Marvanova on her responsibilities associated with the role of the departm ent chair and her personal characteristics and administrative methods most highly related to successful accomplishment of chair responsibilities. Survey responses were scaled using a Likert of 1 = poor , 2 = fair, 3 = in-between , 4 = good , 5 = outstanding. Strengths Pharmaceutical sciences faculty, School of Pharmacy staff, and external reviewers rated Dr. Marvanova: 1. On her responsibilities relevant to the role of the chair as good for attending to administrative tasks, fostering good teaching and assessment of student learning, leading in establishing and monitoring department goals, developing sound procedures for assessing faculty performance, communicating the department's needs to administrators, communicating expectations of campus administration to faculty, promoting the department to off -campus constituencies, guiding the development of a plan to carry out departmental programs, facilitating curriculum development, stimulatin g research, scholarly activity, and/or creative endeavors, promoting a positive image of the department on campus, fostering the development of faculty member's talents, facilitating successful recruitment of faculty, and ensuring that new faculty and staff are acquainted with departmental procedures, priorities, and expectations. 2. On all her personal characteristics as good including problem solving abilities, practical judgment, consistency, trustworthy, organizational skills, enterprising, institution -centered, clarity, demonstrates caring, fairness, and flexibility/adaptability in dealing with individuals/situations. 3. On her administrative methods as good for maintaining standards of performance, advocating for departmental interests to higher authorities, ensuring faculty are working up to capacity, lets faculty members know what is expected of them, provides feedback to faculty, allocates faculty responsibilities in an effective and equitable manner, tries out new ideas with the faculty, ensures work of the faculty is coordinated, puts faculty suggestions into action, explains the basis for her decisions, acts as though v isible department accomplishments were vital to her, makes sound suggestions for developing/changing departmental directions/priorities, promotes inclusiveness and diversity among students and faculty, lets faculty members know when they have done a good j ob, makes sure her part in the department is understood by all members, encourages teamwork among members of the faculty, and facilitates positive relationships between faculty and the clerical/technical staff. 4 Weaknesses None of the evaluated areas were rated as fair by the Pharmaceutical sciences faculty, School of Pharmacy staff, or external reviewers. Conclusion The IDEA Feedback System for Chairs survey found that the Pharmaceutical sciences faculty, School of Pharmacy staff, and external reviewers identified Dr. Marvanova a mix of as good and in-between (1 = poor , 2 = fair , 3 = in-between , 4 = good , 5 = outstanding) for her chair related responsibilities, personal characteristics, and administrative methods. Pharmaceutical sciences faculty, School of Pharma cy staff, and external reviewer comments from the IDEA Feedback System for Chairs survey identified Dr. Marvanova as good or in-between for her chair related responsibilities and administrative methods, and good for personal characteristics. She is perceived to be a strong advocate for the pharmacy practice department. Pharmaceutical sciences, staff, and external reviewers suggest that she attempt to strengthen her engagement with faculty and others and work on promoting a positive culture within the College. These respondents recognize that budget constraints, student recruitment, and faculty recruitment and retention have been challenges for Dr. Marvanova. Dr. Jagdish Singh Evaluation Committee Report The committee assigned to evaluate Dr. Jagdish Singh, Chair of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, respectfully submits the following report. This report summarizes a survey of faculty, staff and students in the College of Health Professions (CHP) and the School of Pharmacy (SOP) who routinely work with Dr. Singh in his capacity as Department Chair. The review was conducted in accordance with NDSU Policy 327: Evaluation of Academic Deans, Directors, and Department Chairs/Heads. The Process Dr. Charles Peterson, Dean of the CHP and the SOP, initiated the review process on September 18, 2018. Dr. Dan Friesner, Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development in the CHP and the SOP, chaired the review committee. The other members of the review committee were: Kristine Steffen (Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Mark Strand (Professor, Pharmacy Practice), Yagna Jarajapu (Associate Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Jeanne Frenzel (Associate Professor, Pharmacy Practice), Amanda Brooks (Assistant Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences), Lisa Richter (Assistant Professor, Pharmacy Practice), and Jean Trautmann (Staff, Department of Pharmacy Practice). The Committee communicated through both email and meetings. The review committee submitted its r eport to Dr. Peterson on January 25, 2019. When discussing the best approach and empirical methods to assess Dr. Singh, the review committee noted several considerations. First, respondent anonymity (both actual and perceived) must be ensured. Second, the methods used to collect information must be valid and reliable. Third, it is vital to disaggregate responses based on the respondent's professional roles and responsibilities. Put differently, faculty in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences may have very different assessments of Dr. Singh's work as Department Chair than other respondents. In many areas of evaluation, the responses of faculty within the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences may carry greater weight than other responses. Fourth, staff are an integral part of the evaluation. However, staff do not have the protection of faculty, and may have fundamentally different assessments than faculty. These distinctions may make the responses of staff who work within the Department of Pharmaceuti cal Sciences potentially identifiable. To address these issues, the review committee chose to contract with an external vendor to collect the information used to generate this report. After considering various options, the review committee chose the Kansa s State University IDEA Center's -Feedback -Systems/Feedback -System -for-Chairs . The review committee concluded that the use of an external vendor was important in order to ensure respondents that their responses were truly anonymous. Perhaps more importantly, this system has been used extensively and consistently over time by many acade mic departments across the U.S. As such, it is extremely likely to produce valid and reliable results. It assesses more than 50 different areas of leadership germane to Department Chairs, including administrative responsibilities (21 items), personal characteristics relevant to unit leadership (11 items), administrative methods (21 items) and overall success (2 items). The system also asks Dr. Singh to self- assess his competencies and performance in each of these areas. Gap scoring is used to compare Dr. S ingh's assessment with those of the respondents. Respondents also have the opportunity to provide open -ended comments. The IDEA Center's assessment items allow for general evaluations of any given Chair's performance. The review committee also wanted to assess several issues that are potentially unique to the SOP. NDSU APPENDIX 8MPolicy 327 has been in place, and followed by the CHP and SOP, for a number of years. Several surveys of CHP and SOP administrators have been created and implemented as a part of these evaluations. Upon perusing these surveys, the review committee determined that the following items would be added to the IDEA system surveys: 1. The Chair shows and fosters respect and appreciation for each person, whatever that person's background, age, race, gender, disability, values, lifestyle perspectives, or interests. 2. The Chair shares governance with others when appropriate. 3. The Chair supports and defends academic freedom. 4. The Chair appropriately responds to the needs and/or suggestions of external const ituencies. 5. The Chair fosters a culture of collaboration between departments in the School of Pharmacy. All items, including the IDEA items and these items, are evaluated using 5 -point Likert scales, with 1 indicating a low or negative response, 3 indicatin g a neutral response, and 5 indicating a high or positive response. More specifically 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = in -between, 4 = good, 5 = outstanding. To address the final concerns, the complete survey instrument (inclusive of comments, IDEA items and NDSU -authored items) was sent to three different groups of respondents, and separate, disaggregated results are provided for each group: 1. Faculty within the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences 2. Faculty, staff and administrators within the CH P who work directly with Dr. Singh 3. Graduate students in the Ph.D. program in Pharmaceutical Sciences With regard to the latter two groups, Dr. Singh declined to provide names and contact information for external stakeholders outside of the CHP to survey. He did, however, request that graduate students be surveyed. Staff working with the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences were included with all other CHP staff, administrators and faculty in the CHP to ensure anonymous responses. The survey was opened November 21, 2018, and remained open through December 19, 2018. Dr. Friesner sent emails to CHP personnel to inform them that they would receive an opportunity to participate in the process by completing the survey (and that the invitation would come from the vendor). Reminder emails were sent every 4 days to non -respondents. After closing the survey, all responses were gathered and summarized by IDEA and forwarded to the review committee. Survey items with five point response scales were summarized using descriptive statistics. Open -ended comments were compiled and major themes were identified. These summaries are provided below. A full set of responses is attached to this report as an appendix. Dr. Singh Evaluation Summary Demographics Faculty: Ten of twelve faculty surveyed responded for a response rate of 83% Graduate students: A total of 14 graduate students in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences responded for a response rate of 54%. SOP Respondents: Thirty -six individuals from the School of Pharmacy responded for a response rate of 68%. Overall Effectiveness Among the faculty in the department of pharmaceutical sciences, 70% agreed or strongly agreed (A/SA) that have confidence in the chair's ability to provide future leadership t o the department and 60% agreed or strongly agreed that overall the chair has provided excellent leadership. Ratings by the graduate students were slightly higher at 79% (4.1/5, A/SA) and 86% (4.3/5, A/SA) respectively. While 78% of SOP respondents agre ed or strongly agreed that they have confidence in the chair's ability to provide future leadership to the department and overall the chair has provided excellent leadership. Responsibilities Among the department faculty, 15 of the 21 attributes assessed rated above 70% with 6 rating between 50 and 69%. The highest rated attributes were attending to essential administrative tasks (90%) and communicating the department needs to the dean and other appropriate administrators (90%). Graduate student respondents also noted several of the same strengths. He has received the highest rating of 4.6 with an overwhelming majority of responders, 90%, indicating A/SA for 'attending to essential administrative tasks', an important attribute of 'responsibilities'. SOP respondents all (100%) gave a positive rating (\"good\" or \"outstanding\") that the chair assists in securing funding from external sources (grants, contracts, partnerships etc.). Communicating the department's needs (e.g., personnel, space, monetary, technol ogy) to the dean and other appropriate administrators (94%) and stimulating research, scholarly activity, and/or creative endeavors in the department (93%) were also noted strengths. The faculty respondents identified developing collegiality/cooperation (50%, A/SA) and facilitating curriculum development (56%, A/SA) as areas for improvement while the chair ranked them as high priority. Graduate students identified 'Guiding the development of sound procedures for assessing faculty performance' and 'fostering the development of each faculty member's special talents and interests', which received ratings of 3.6 and 3.7 with only 63% and 66%, respectively, indicating A/SA. An area for improvement, based on the SOP respondents included facilitating curriculum development, which was rated positively by 35% of respondents and rated as a high priority item by the chair. Additionally, guiding the development of sound procedures for assessing faculty performance (47%, A/SA) and fostering good teaching in the departm ent (encourages course updating, the use of appropriate technology, attending to student feedback) (50%, A/SA) were noted as areas for development. These areas were also noted as high priority items by the chair. Administrative Characteristics Generally, the faculty rated the chair highly for his personal characteristics with the highest (90%) rated attributes being practical judgment and institution -centered. The graduate students also rated the chair highly for his personal characteristics. He received a minimum rating of 4 (out of five), in nine of the eleven attributes that are indicators of his persona. The survey revealed that graduate students highly appreciate that he is trustworthy and institution -centered, which have received ratings of 4.3 and 4.4, respectively, with 86% of responders A/SA. Among the other attributes of responsibilities, he received rating of 4.5 or 4.4 for 'promoting a positive image of the department within the campus community and to off -campus constituencies by a response r ate (77 and 75%) indicating A/SA. Written comments further emphasized that the chair has several strengths that include leadership, problem solving, caring, approachability, to list a few. Some strong characteristics and administrative methods of the chair that SOP respondents rated as positive (\"more strength than a weakness\" or \"definite strength) included enterprising (95%), provides feedback to faculty on their major activities (91%), problem solving ability (89%) and effectively advocates for departme ntal interests to higher authorities (89%) were noted in the evaluation. The faculty indicated that consistency (3.8) and clarity (3.9) are both areas of personal improvement (60%), while graduate students giving \"fairness\" an average rating of 3.6 with o nly 50% indicating A/SA and 4 neutral responders. Both faculty (50%) and graduate students (66%) rated the attribute, 'makes sure the work of the faculty is coordinated'. Additionally, faculty noted that promoting inclusiveness and diversity (60% or mean 3.9/5) and reducing, resolving, and/or preventing conflict among departmental faculty members (60% and mean 3.8/5) are areas of improvement. SOP respondents offered some insight into areas for improvement in reducing, resolving and/or preventing conflict among department members (56% positive ratings) clarity and allocates faculty responsibilities in an effective and equitable manner (both 60% positive ratings). This was well aligned with the faculty responses Extra Questions Faculty rated the chair's \"app ropriately responds to the needs and/or suggestions of external constituencies\" the highest at 4.4/5, while they noted the attribute with the greatest area for improvement are \"shows and fosters respect and appreciation for each person, whatever that perso n's background, age, race, gender, disability, values, lifestyle perspectives, or interests\", which averaged 3.8/5 with 10 respondents. In line with the faculty respondents (3.7/5), the SOP respondents indicated that the chair \"supports and defends academ ic freedom\" was most highly rated at 4.3 while \"fosters a culture of collaboration between departments in the School of Pharmacy\" was the lowest rated attribute at 3.5. All responses to these questions were answered above the neutral range (average 3.5 - 4.3). Among the 14 graduate student responders, all attributes were highly rated, varying between 4.1 and 4.4. Comments Written comments from the faculty noted several strengths, including professionalism and caring, honesty, leadership, and support of faculty and students. Written comments from the graduate students further emphasized that the chair has several strengths that include leadership, problem solving, caring, approachability, to list a few. Many positive comments from SOP respondents were noted surrounding leadership (4 of 11 comments), research (4 comments) and friendliness (3 comments). Several examples include: \"Chair clearly advocates for his department and priorities\" as well as \"He is a friendly person. He has a strong interest in gran t funding and research for his department.\" Some faculty comments indicate that there are areas for growth, including dealing with conflict, promoting inclusiveness, being respectful of students and other departments, and ending favoritism. Graduate stud ent comments also indicated some challenges that are currently being experienced, which included lack of infrastructure. A few comments indeed questions chair's 'culture -of-respect' in the department, which is in agreement with the previous evaluation. Fro m SOP respondents, comments for improvement were largely related to development of teaching in the department (4 of 12 comments), being more involved in the SOP (4 comments) and communication/listening (4 comments). Several examples include: \"Challenge the Pharmaceutical Sciences faculty to engage in the PharmD Program as a program, not just a teaching responsibility. Holding Pharmaceutical Sciences faculty accountable for developing as teachers. Holding Pharmaceutical Sciences faculty accountable for impro ving teaching (i.e. writing measurable objectives, utilizing active learning, promoting long -term understanding/retention of concepts rather than memorization, coordinating among team -teaching faculty).\" Other comments included: \"Be more active within the School of Pharmacy - attend committee meetings and positively contribute to tasks\" and \"Listen more. Talk a lot less. Listen to EVERYONE no matter who they are. Treat everyone with the same amount of respect and equality. Don't play favorites.\" 1 Dr. Marketa Marvanova Evaluation Committee Report #1 The committee assigned to evaluate Dr. Marketa Marvanova, Chair of the Department of Pharmacy Practice, respectfully submits the following report. This report summarizes a survey of faculty, staff and external stakeholders in the College of Health Professions (CHP) and the School of Pharmacy (SOP) who routinely work with Dr. Marvanova in her capacity as Department Chair.

Overall, 52.9% of pharmacy practice faculty agreed or strongly agreed that they have confidence in Dr. Marvanova's ability to provide future leadership to the department and 47.1% agreed or strongly agreed that Dr. Marvanova has provided excellent leadership. Summary of IDEA Feedback System for Chairs Survey Pharmacy practice faculty were asked to evaluate Dr. Marvanova on her responsibilities associated with the role of the department chair and her personal characteristics and administrative methods most highly related to successful accomplishment of chair re sponsibilities. Survey responses were scaled using a Likert of 1 = poor , 2 = fair, 3 = in -between , 4 = good , 5 = outstanding. Strengths Pharmacy p ractice faculty rated Dr. Marvanova: 1. On her responsibilities relevant to the role of the chair as good for items focused on department needs, facilitating curriculum development, supporting good teaching and assessment, and overseeing essential administrative tasks, and new faculty and staff development. 2. On her personal characteristics relevant to the role of the chair as good for problem solving abilities , organizational skills, and practical judgement. 3. On her administrative methods as good for items focused on ensuring faculty are working at capacity, promoting inclusiveness and diversity, maintain ing standards of performance, facilitating positive relationships between faculty and staff, and advocating for the department. Weaknesses Pharmacy p ractice faculty rated Dr. Marvanova: 1. On her responsibilities relevant to the role of the chair as fair for it ems focused on developing collegiality and cooperation among faculty members, rewarding faculty for their contributions to the department, and stimulating faculty vitality/enthusiasm. 2. On her personal characteristics as fair for flexibility and adaptabilit y in dealing with individuals and situations. 3. On her administrative methods as fair for the importance of faculty morale to the Chair. Conclusion The IDEA Feedback System for Chairs survey found that pharmacy practice faculty identified Dr. Marvanova a mix of as good , in-between , and fair (1 = poor , 2 = fair , 3 = in-between , 4 = good , 5 = outstanding) for her chair related responsibilities, personal characteristics, and administrative methods. Items measuring good indicate s he is a strong advocate for the department . She is focused on department needs, facilitates curriculum development, support s good teaching and assessment, and 4 oversee s essential administrative tasks . She ensur es faculty are working at capacity, maintain s standards of performance, and facilitat es relationships between faculty and staff. Items measuring fair and indicating opportunities for professional growth included: 1) developing collegiality/cooperation among faculty members, 2) rewarding faculty in accordance with their contributions to the department, 3) stimulating or rejuvenating faculty vitality/enthusiasm, 4) flexibility/adaptability in dealing with individuals/situations, and 5) demonstrating that high faculty morale is vital to her. As commented, p harmacy practic e faculty perceive Dr. Marvanova to be an advocate for the pharmacy practice department and for faculty at clinical practice sites . Faculty appreciate her decisiveness. Areas of concern arising from the perceptions of p harmacy practice faculty include com ments that Dr. Marvanova should attend more department and campus events, listen to and solicit feedback from faculty, and be more respectful of faculty time when conducting meetings. Pharmacy practice faculty feel the most important challenges facing the department which she has to overcome are diminishing student applicant pools, budget constraints, a continual need to fill open faculty positions , and faculty feeling overworked. Pharmacy practice faculty feel changes to the workload document and promoti on and tenure policy as well as increased opportunities for collaboration within and outside of the faculty would contribute to depar tment effectiveness. Of note, 'low morale' and a 'culture of fear' were phrases used several times throughout the qualitat ive comments. Additionally, suggestions were made that Dr. Marvanova seek training s through the North Dakota St ate University Human Resources department with regard to fair faculty expectations . Several opportunities for professional growth were noted . Dr. Marvanova is encouraged to consider action s, where appropriate, to address these opportunities. Dr. Marvanova is encouraged to invest more time engaging with her faculty , including prioritizing listening and soliciting input from her faculty . Dr. Marvanova is encouraged to empower faculty by giving them more autonomy in their work and through the support of faculty governance. Dr. Marvanova is encouraged to s upport needed changes to the workload document and promotion and tenure guidelines, as these were cited as being important to faculty. Doing so may increase faculty morale. 1 Dr. Marketa Marvanova Evaluation Committee Report #2 The committee assigned to evaluate Dr. Marketa Marvanova, Chair of the Department of Pharmacy Practice, respectfully submits the following report. This report summarizes a survey of faculty, staff and external reviewers in the College of Health Professions (CHP) and the School of Pharmacy (SOP) who routinely work with Dr. Marvanova in her capacity as Department Chair.
