A number of factors can play a role including eating greasy or spicy foods, eating too much or too quickly, consuming too much alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, or carbonated beverages, anxiety, smoking, and certain antibiotics. Knowing what causes indigestion can help you avoid it, but there are also natural remedies you can use to soothe an upset stomach if it occurs.

Carbonated Drinks Some people find that the bubbles in carbonated drinks help soothe an upset stomach, in part by making it easier for them to burp and release stomach pressure.
