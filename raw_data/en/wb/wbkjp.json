including empiric treatment ( e.g. in-person visit or via telemedicine) (any NAI or baloxavir) https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary -clinicians.htmOseltamivir Treatment of Outpatients RCTs have shown that oseltamivir treatment has significant clinical benefit when started within 36 -48 hours after illness onset versus placebo Pooled meta -analysis of 5 RCTs in children (oseltamivir n=770 vs. placebo n=838) Treatment started within 48 hours of onset: Reduced illness duration by 18 hours overall and by 30 hours in children without asthma (-29.9 hours; 95% CI: -53.9 to -5.8 (oseltamivir n=1565 vs. placebo n=1295) Treatment started within 36 hours of onset: Reduced illness duration by 25.2 hours (-25.2 hours; 95% CI: -36.2 to -16.0 hours) 44% Reduced risk of lower respiratory tract complications occurring >48 hours after treatment requiring Dobson Lancet 2015 Oseltamivir Efficacy in Uncomplicated InfluenzaBaloxavir Treatment of Outpatients RCTs have shown that baloxavir treatment has similar clinical benefit to oseltamivir and significant clinical benefit versus placebo when started within 48 hours after illness onset RCTs in adolescents and adults (aged 12 yrs) Treatment started 48 hours of onset (baloxavir vs. placebo vs. oseltamivir): Single -dose baloxavir (n=456) significantly reduced illness duration by a median of 26.5 hours vs. placebo (n=231) in non- high -risk persons (95% CI, 72.6 to 87.1 hours;

hospitalized adults, 36 countries; 2009 -2011) NAI treatment (mostly oseltamivir) started on the day of admission was associated with a 19% overall reduction in duration of hospitalization compared with no or later initiation of NAI treatment (aIRR , 0.81 [95% = 2009 -2014) Starting NAI (mostly oseltamivir) treatment within 6 hours after hospital admission was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization versus starting antiviral treatment later (p<0.001).

The current network covers nearly 100 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program states (CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM, NY, OR, and TN) and four additional states through the Influenza Hospi talization Project (IA, MI, OH, and UT) The network represents approximately 10% of US population (~32 million people). Cases ar e identified by reviewing hospitals, laboratory, and admissions databases and infection control logs for patients hospitalized with COVID -19. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on clinician -ordered SA RS-CoV-2 testing. Therefore, the unadjusted rates provided are likely to be underestimates as COVID -19-associated hospitalizatio ns can be missed due to test availability and provider or facility testing practices. COVID -NET hospitalization data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital admissions are subject to lag. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rat esare updated accordingly. All incidence rates are unadjusted.*Starting the week of May 29, 2022, Iowa data are removed from weekly rate calculations.

RBD, anti -NC), antibody class (IgG vs. IgM vs. 'total'), or isotype specificity (e.g., IgG1 vs IgG2) Measures only one variable in a heterogenous product (content of other antibodies, coagulation factors, among others) Characteristics of an individual donors' immune responses will differ -Generally, no available information on donor infection ( e.g. severity of disease, timing of illness/recovery), strain - specificity, or cross -variant binding and neutralization72Considerations in Immunosuppressed Data in this population are generally limited to small subgroup analyses of RCTs, matched - control observational studies, and case series While noting this limitation, review of studies at the time of EUA reissuance found that the potential benefit of CCP in the immunosuppressed population, including relatively later in the course of illness, appeared to be larger than in immunocompetent patients, and EUA criteria were met in both the inpatient and outpatient setting73Additional Considerations Manufacturing, study, and use of CCP is challenged by heterogeneity in donors, emerging variants, and lack of centralized approach to collection and testing It remains difficult to precisely characterize the biologic activity of CCP collected from a given donor and have assurance of potency against variants in a potential recipient Available evidence indicates that CCP donors who were previously vaccinated, but have recovered from recent infection, are more likely to have higher titers and relatively improved cross -variant binding and neutralization -Polyclonality offers theoretical benefit with respect to immune escape Baker, MD, ScD, FIDSA 77Masking to Prevent RTI Transmission in Health Care SettingsCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases CDC Source Control Recommendations in Healthcare Settings Alex J.

When SARS -CoV-2Community Transmission levels are not high, healthcare facilities could choose not to require universal source control. However, even if source control is not universally required, it remains recommended for individuals in healthcare settings who: Have suspected or confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection or other respiratory infection (e.g., those with runny nose, cough, sneeze); or Had close contact (patients and visitors) or a higher -risk exposure (HCP) with someone with SARS -CoV-2 infection, for 10 days after their exposure; or Reside or work on a unit or area of the facility experiencing a SARS -CoV-2 outbreak; universal use of source control could be discontinued as a mitigation measure once no new cases have been identified for 14 days; or Have otherwise had source control recommended by public health authorities\" Infection Control: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) | CDCCDC's Core Practices Originally compiled by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee Fundamental standards of care that should be implemented in all settings where healthcare is delivered Standard Precautions: 5.e. Minimizing Potential Exposures \"During periods of higher levels of community respiratory virus transmission*, facilities should consider having everyone mask upon entry to the facility to ensure better adherence to respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette for those who might be infectious. Such an approach could be implemented facility -wide or targeted toward higher risk areas (e.g., emergency departments, urgent care, units experiencing an outbreak) based on a facility risk assessment. *Examples of potential metrics include, but are not limited to, increase in outbreaks of healthcare -onset respiratory infections, increase in emergency department or outpatient visits related to respiratory infections.\" https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/core -practices/index.htmlMasking to Prevent RTI Transmission in Health Care Settings: Adapting Current Masking Guidance to Local Settings Chanu Rhee, MD, MPH, FIDSA Associate Hospital Epidemiologist, Brigham and Women's Hospital Physician, Divisions of Infectious Diseases and Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Associate Professor, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care InstituteCDC/IDSA Clinician Webinar: Dec 3, 2022 Meghan A.
