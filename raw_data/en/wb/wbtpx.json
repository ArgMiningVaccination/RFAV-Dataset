The data were collected from three localities : El Fashir , Daresalam , and Kalemindo. Seventeen villages/communities/government officials where the Taadoud II program operates were selected for the study . The study findings revealed that there are CBNRM committees in the majority of the studied communities . This reflects their important role in regulating livelihoods and ecosystems . The ir crucial strength is the nominat ion of committee members by the community themselves. Thus , their legitimacy comes from the community , which provid es their power to work and succeed in various fields of natural resource access and livelihood systems. However, t he Umsialla Community -based Development Committee was established as a state g overnment initiative , and their activities mainly focus on realizing government policies rather than nomad interests. Additionally, a bout 50% of poor women1 were unaware of the work of the CBNRM committees , and further investigation on inclusiveness and relationships between these committees and vulnerable groups of resource users is needed . CBNRM committees have influence over integrated natural resource management ( INRM ) strategies throu gh their interconnected work with government authorities. Their work is focused on assisting the respective official institutions , raising awareness about INRM , and improving livelihood systems. The practical effects of CBNRM committees on local communitie s' livelihoods were confirmed by state and locality government officials and institutions in North Darfur. The differences in the ways of working between CBNRM and traditional systems indicate that the CBNRM committees are well organized and gender balanced. T he role of traditional systems broad ly includes INRM but with an unclear distribution of responsibilities . Additionally, the role of women is almost not recognizable. Furthermore, the role of the Native Administration in regulating INRM h as been weakened over the last two decades, while the CBNRM committees have bec ome more acknowledged and recognized by local communities. In general , the work and activities of the CBNRM committees in the three localities are clearly perceived by the majority of agriculturists, agropastoralists ,2 and governments authorities. Various extension and training programs delivered by the committe es have increased awareness of the environment . This is reflected in the livelihoods of the people in these areas. Inclusion of women in the executive offices of the CBNRM committees has induced changes in attitudes towards environment al resources and wome n's participation. Initiatives focused on raising awareness of the environment , the participatory nature of INRM , farm demonstration s, and construction of terraces and dams have played a crucial role in environmental protection and livelihoods improvement. The village saving s and loans funds have helped households , especially women , in establishing home gardens and have improved access to education and 1 The assignment of \" poor\" to these women is subjective: there is no standard measure , and it only reflects the opinions of the key informants. 2 Farmers rearing livestock and pastoralists cultivating agricultural crops. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 3 medication family Karkara, Abuzeriga , Shangil Tobay, and Sagannaam communities. The most common challenges limit ing the success of CBNRM committees in the area are the setting of informal terraces ,3 outbreak s of zarzoor (birds , a pest ), talaig4 time , expansion of agriculture, increasing number s of animals, financial limitations , and the scarcity of fuel sources. Almost all people in the three localities practice agriculture, livestock -rearing, and the collection of fuelwood and building wood, gum arabic , wild tree fruits , and fodder from forests and rangelands . Recently , some of them have begun to collect agricultural residues, gravel, sand , and stone as livelihood strateg ies and source s of income. While the types of crops produced depend on the soil characteristics and the aims of the farmer, pr oduction of cereal crops is the most common rain-fed agricultural practice in all study areas . The m ajority of sedentary villagers have become agropastoralists and keep livestock such as goats, sheep, and cows as well as practicing agriculture. Likewise , nomads such as the Umsialla nomad community are engaged in crop cultivation alongside livestock keeping. The conversion of farmed lands into gr azing lands during talaig effectively enables the existence of two livelihood strategies and two production systems in the same space but at different times. However , increasing trends towards selling crop residues and dry season cultivation in clay soil using artificial irrigation by farmers may change the free access habits to farmed lands during summer months , hence changing the historical integration pattern between farming and pastoralism. According to the majority of respondents , coordination between institutions has become better due to the training and awareness -raising they have received from non- governmental organizations (NGOs ) over the last twenty years. Nevertheless, various renewable natural resources such as soils, farmlands, rangelands, and forest elements have been subjected to overuse due to the increas ing population and numbers of livestock. The capability of the land to produce sufficient crops and fodder , especially in goz lands , has been greatly reduced due to the variability of rainfall and soil infertility. The acknowledgement by some local communities of the role of CBNRM committees in the management of the natural environment and livelihoods system s could be used to set strategies for INRM . On the other hand, further measures should be taken to engage vulnerable communities such as women and nomads in the committees ' executive office s in order to ensure their interests and priorities are meaningfully represented . 3 Formal terraces are constructed under the supervision of professional s, at a reasonable elevation and in a specific shape to allow the water to run towards neighboring farmlands. Informal terraces are made by farmers as they see fit and may be in a shape or at an elevation that won't fill easily or easily allow water to go to other farmlands. 4 The date on which farmed lands turn into rangelands. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 4 1. Introduction Traditional livelihoods, farming and herding, and related INRM systems in Darfur have been disrupted by a range of factors, inc luding changing patterns of land use and access, and the protracted conflict over the last two decades (Siam et al. 2019; Sulieman and Young 2020) . As a result , relationships between some herder and farmer groups have become polarized, resulting in a significant shift in access to and use of natural resources (Fadul 2004; Y oung and Ismail 2019) . As with other Darfur s tates, North Darfur was seriously affected by the conflict , which displaced more than two million people, many of whom now live in internally displaced persons ( IDP) camps around the main towns. As security has improved, people have started to return home to cultivate their land , particularly during the rainy season . However , many of these returnees have faced significant challenges . For example , newcomers have moved in and occupied the land previously farmed by the displaced populations , and lands can sometimes be under tight and violent control by armed militia associated with some tribal groups (Buchanan -Smith and Jaspars 2007) . The seasonal movement of nomads is also threatened by continued insecurity and the blocking of historical animal grazing routes. The sus tainability and resilience of socio -ecological systems and safe access to natural resources mainly depend on the rules and regulations set by local informal and formal institutions. Local communities, in collaboration with NGOs , including Oxfam America and its partners in North Darfur, established CBNRM committees in various localities and villages within the Taadoud program (see S ection 1.2 for more details on Taadoud) . It is necessary to understand these institutions \u2014the context in which they were created , the way they function, both past and present, and their interrelations \u2014in order to develop informed policies and approaches to the sustainable use of natural resources and livelihood systems in the drylands5 environment of North Darfur. Box 1: History of NGOs in North Darfur 1.1. North Darfur contex t Livelihood systems in North Darfur, which include pastoralism and farming, are largely reliant on the drylands environment. Cultivation usually takes place across a number of different land types, from sandy lands (goz) and sand dunes to clay soil and valley banks (wadi s). The clay soil usually provides suitable 5 Drylands are characterized by their extreme rainfall variability, which varies from year to year and even within the rainy season, with variable start dates to the rainy season, varying intensity of showers, and sometimes long gaps between showers. Although drylands are typically arid, plants and animals survive, adapted to the variable distribution of rainfall and seasonally high temperatures. There is a l ong history of successful development projects by NGOs in North Darfur. For instance, it is known that O xfam implemented projects of crop seed banks, agricultural extensions, animal traction , and animal health in 40 villages in Kebkebia and Jebel Si, North Darfur from the mid- 1980s through Community- based Management Units , which became the Kebkebia Smallholder Charitable Society (KSCS ) in the late 1990s. Jaspars (2010) and the United Nations E nvironment Programme ( ) (2014) reported that UNEP , SOS Sahel, the Darfur Development and Reconstruction Agency ( DDRA) initialized and carried out various CBNRM processes in North Darfur, under the name Community Environmental Action Planning ( CEAP ). Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 5 conditions for growth and production of agricultural crops and high- quality fodder plants ,6 because it contains essential plant nutrients and retains moisture for longer periods compared to sandy soil. Conversely , the sandy soil ( goz) covers a greater area but is less fertile and suitable only for the growth of limited crops and fodder species. According to the majority of farmers and Umsialla pastoralists spoken to as part of this study, the main crop species produced by the communities are dukhun (millet) , dura and shattaa (hot pepper). Most of the communities grow millet and sorghum as cereal crops and groundnuts and sesame as cash crops. Some crops such as tomatoes are grown according to moisture availability around water courses. Crops such as tobacco, 7 tomato, shattaa, okra , and kerkedai are produced by people who farm in the clay soil or by relatively wealthy people who are capable of supplementary irrigation during the dry seasons. Since the early 1970s , factors such a s recurrent drought and rainfall quantity and distribution variability have imposed challenges on crop production, and farmers and herders remain uncertain about seasonal and annual precipitation patterns . 8 Thus, some rural farmers change their livelihood strategies to adapt to the harsh environment by increasing cultivated areas, using plough techniques, rearing small animals , and adopting water -harvesting techniques. However , such adaptation strategies hav e compounded the degradation of the natural environment. Cattle, sheep, goats , and camels are the main sources of livelihoods for pastoralists and agropastoralists. According to the study respondents, the communities also keep hens, donkeys , and horses. Most families have at least goats, but some very poor families have nothing. The communities also source forest products such as fuelwood, charcoal, gum Arabic, and fruits to sell in the market for income. Continuous variability of pastures, water resources, prevailing land -use systems, and some development projects are major challenges to nomadic livelihoods in Darfur. Large -scale infrastructure projects such as El Fashir airport have blocked animal routes and hindered seasonal movement. Darfur has undergone many changes in governance patterns and rules since the Anglo- Egyptian conquest in 1916, which have shaped the opinions of many in the Darfur community with regards to natural resource access, particularly land tenure. Historically, land was controlled by the sultanate and via customary systems (e.g., the Native Administration ), and land was allocated to their own people and to others through these mechanisms (Dauod 2009; Bromwich 2020). In the hakura land-tenure system, selling of the land wa s not allowed because land was considered communal and deeply connected to the identity of the various groups, not just a usable resource (DLC 2007). In 1970, the Unregistered Land Act was issued , which stated that any unregistered lands were presumed to b e government lands. This act also 6 The most important grasses and fod der plants in the area according to the study respondents are banu acacias , which are also used as fuelwood. Grass species are important for cattle, sheep, donkey , and horse fodder, while the trees and shrubs are suitable forage for camel s and goats. 7 Tobacco cultivation has particular economic impacts and interests as North Dar fur tends to be the major potential source of production in the country. 8 The variability of rainfall, with its associated natural resource depletion, is widely perceived by people of North Darfur as a causative factor of the Darfur armed conflict (Siam et al. 2019). Contrary to this perception , Kevane and Gray (2008) stated that rainfall trends in the northern part of Darfur weakly support the claims that climate has a direct relation to the Darfur conflict. The rainfall fluctuation in Sahel Africa is not accidental; it is a historical event, and the variability will continue (Hermance 2014). Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 6 canceled the Native Administration system . Historically , disputes between farmers and herders around land access were resolved through Native Administration and customary laws. In the last two decades , these conflicts have b ecome bloodier due to political interventions and the acute polarization of society in Darfur. The Darfur conflict has political aspects related to the nature of customary authority, governance of land, and ethnic identities (Bromwich 2020). More informa tion on the North Darfur context can be found in Annex 1. 1.2 About Taadoud II Taadoud II is a resilience program that builds on Taadoud I, which aims to support conflict -affected households to rebuild their livelihoods and to prepare them to deal with fut ure shocks and stresses. Taadoud II aims to improve INRM and governance, reduce chronic malnutrition, and increase the resilience of livelihoods of vulnerable populations within all five Darfur states to achieve more sustainable access to natural resources . See Figure 1 for a map of Taadoud program areas. Figure 1: Map showing areas of Darfur in which the Taadoud program operates. 2. Background and rationale Rural communities in North Darfur have been managing natural resources for centuries, but customary institutions and traditional authorities have been weakened by a number of interrelated factors, such as competition over diminishing natural resources, a harsh natural environment, changing governance Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 7 patterns and ru les around land access and tenure, and the ongoing conflict. These and other interconnected factors have sparked interventions and initiatives from various formal and informal actors aimed at ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources and equity of distribution . One such initiative is the CBNRM approach. According to Josserand (2001), t he CBN RM approach is defined as the joint management of resources by the community in partnership with other legitimate stakeholders. COOPI and SECS (2018) define CBNRM as the collective use and management of natural resources in rural areas by a group of people using comm unally owned facilities. The essential feature of CBNRM is that it starts with communities, tak es them into confidence , and ha s confidence in them that enable s the resource users to get rights and benefit from resources (Acharya 1984; Uphoff 1998; Addison et al. 2019). A focus on community participation in processes and strategies of use of the natural environment is characteristic of the CBNRM approach, and it is aimed at creating or recreating the conditions under which communities, especially different groups of users, can successfully manage their resources in a sustainable, peaceful, participatory , and equitable way (Cox et al. 2010) . CBNRM ha s become an important mechanism in promoting environmental and ecological sustainability as well as improving community access to ecosystem services. Despite the presence and activities of CBNRM committees in various rural areas in North Darfur, so far it is not clear how committees are formed and what mandates and procedures are applied in their management of natural resource access. Can CBNRM committees effectively influence INRM strategies in practice and contribute to peaceful coexistence between the different user groups? What forms of collaboration can be identified between CBNRM committees and official instit utions at locality and state levels? What are the main perceived challenges to CBNRM committees? A better understanding of CBNRM committee roles, their scope of work , and their stakeholders' perceptions of their successes and constraints seems a necessary step towards setting collective strategies for the sustainable management of Darfur's natural environment. 3. Objectives The overall objective of this study wa s to identify the ways in which access to and use of natural resources in North Darfur is effectively regulated through CBNRM mechanisms and what impact committees have on people's livelihoods. The specific objectives were : 1. To assess how CBNRM mechanisms in North Darfur have changed in the last 20 years; 2. To identify the relationship between CBNRM mechanisms and formal (government) institutions; 3. To identify the ways CBNRM committees operate ( their structure, procedures , and institutional context) and how operations have transformed over the last 20 years; 4. To assess local communities' perceptions of CBNRM committees and formal institutions at local and state level; 5. To identify the main types of natural resources and livelihood systems and how their access and use have changed over the last 20 years. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 8 4. Methodology Prior to data collection, a comprehensive desk study was undertaken to establish the context in which the CBNRM committees operate and to further refine the study research questions. S ee Annex 1 for more detail on the North Darfur context. The data collection was done using focus group discussions ( FGDs), key informant interviews (KIIs) , and household (HH) interviews by a research team from the U niversity of E l Fash ir in three localities in North Darfur where O xfam and its partners are implementing Taadoud II : El Fashir , Daresalam , and Kalemindo. Program activities take place in 16 villages in El Fashir , 8 villages in Kalemindo, and 6 villages in Daresalam. Our sample covered 17 communities across these three locali ties ( 7 from El Fashir and 5 each from Daresalam and Kalemindo) and consisted of 11 communities that were either village s or nomad ic groups and 6 government officials . We selected government employees working in natural resource management institutions, ma inly from the Forest National Corporation (FNC) and the State Ministry of Production and Economic Development (SMPED) departments. The FNC 's North Darfur Deputy Director, SMPED R epresentative, and the Agriculture O fficer and Forest O fficer for Daresalam and Kalemindo localities were interviewed. Table 1 below shows the details of our sample.

One team covered the El Fashir locality , conducting five FGDs , eight HH interviews , and 9 Azagarfa arfa, Maba, Arari , and Obied . 10 of two villages, Zamzam Elhila and Govolo. 11 Oxfam and its local partners, Darfur Development and Reconstruction Agency ( DDRA) , Kebkebia Smallholder Charitable Society (KSCS ), and the Voluntary Network for Rural Health and Development (VNRHD) in North Darfur have detailed information about the communities wher e they are implementing Taadoud II programs. The key entry persons (facilitators) for the field teams were from DDRA and VNRHD. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 9 two government official interviews. The other team covered Daresalam and Kalemindo localities with five FGDs , eight HH interviews , four interviews with go vernment officials (two per locality) , and one nomad KI I. The collected data were reviewed and analyzed using qualitative method s. During the group discussions and interviews, all measures set up by the health authorities in order to avoid the spreading of COVID -19 were applied. 5. Challenges and limitations The study faced a number of challenges and limitations : Field data collection was scheduled to last for 8 days but in practice took place over 30 days : lack of car fuel made travel difficult , and it was not possible to reach the respondents within the original time frame; Insecurity due to disputes between nomads and farmers in Daresalam locality and near Kuma Garadayat village, El Fashir locality , disturbed the schedule of data collection ; Access to nomadic groups was challenging because by the time the data collection started they had moved away from the villages in Daresalam locality , and it was not easy to hold the FGD. As a result, data from the Daresalam nomads were collected through a KII with the Native Administration leader . Likewise , the FGD with five people (two females a nd three males) representing the Umsialla community was d one in the Darfur Development and Reconstruction Agency ( DDRA) office in El Fashir ; The e mergence of COVID -19 delayed the data collection timeline by over six months , and restarting the study entailed resizing the number of target sites and individuals. Originally, it was planned to collect data from 14 village/nomad communities , 9 government officials , and several FGDs that would include at least a total of 20 people from each community . However, the number s after COVID -19 were reduced to 11 village/nomad communities , 6 government employees , and the total number of people across the FGDs in each community ranged from between 5 to 10 persons ; Due to lack of records and documentation, relyi ng only on verbal information regarding the changes in the activities and names of the CBNRM committees was a real limitation. 6. Findings 6.1 Formation of a C BNRM committee The establishment of a CBNRM committee is usually initiated by NGOs that implement development projects. The NGO (or NGOs) contacts the Humanitarian Aid Coordination government authority, other respective government institutions , and the Native Administration in the project area. The NGO also identifies some key informants from the local community, both from the traditional system ( Sheikh, omda , sharatay , elders, etc.) and the formal system (commissioners, ministry directors, etc.) in order to gather information on what activities and projects the committee should be addressing. The date of committee formation is announced through the Native Administration and via written posters, which invite all the community members to a meeting . The NGO determines the number of executive office members, the proportional representation of gen ders, professions , and livelihood systems, and the procedures of selection. The participants in the meeting select at least three people from among them to Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 10 supervise the election following the guidelines provided by the NGO. The NGO representative asks the community if they have a similar community -based committee and, if affirmative, whether they agree with the continuation of such committee or would like to establish a new CBNRM committee. CBNRM committee members must be well known to the community. Their service on the committee is unpaid and supposed to be in the general interest of the community. CBNRM committee members are supposed to have the trust of the community. Following the establishment of the CBNRM committee, their members are trained in INRM (water management, range pasture, tree plantation, shelter belts , etc. ). The NGO calls relevant government or freelance experts and professionals to train the committee members. The training is designed to provide the necessary background knowledge for the implementation of the activities that are part of the project. The CBNRM committee's goal is to promote a participatory approach for INRM , and initiate and arrang e effective communication between state and local institutions to ensure effective management of the natural environment to sustain livelihoods. According to the study respondents , the work of the CBNRM committees is based on statutes and guidelines and depe nds on laws such as the Forest and Natural Resource Act (2002) and the Environment Protection Act (2001). We collected some written CBNRM guidelines . See Appendix 6. The main responsibilities of the committees are: Link the community with service provider s such as government institutions and NGOs; Act to increase community awareness of INRM ; Promote peaceful coexistence and use of natural resources between different user groups; Mobilize the community to participate in environmental issues; Committee members must be committed to attend the periodic meetings of committee; Document the activities of the committee and share reports with other relevant stakeholders . 6.2 Changes in titles and activities of CBNRM committees over the last 20 years CBNRM committees were established in our three study areas between 2003 and 2019, as reported in the FGDs and HH interviews , and most were the initiative of Practical Action .12 According to interviewee responses, significant changes have taken place because of the ir work and related livelihood activities over the last 20 years . Table 2 below shows the year of establishment of the community -based committees, and changes in their names and activities . Our research also showed that, i n general, about 50% of poor female interviewees were not aware of the year the CBNRM committees were established , and 25% of them did not perceive the effects of their work. About 10% of poor men did not remember the year of establishment , and 25% could not speak to the effe cts of the CBNRM committees. The government officials who were interviewed were aware of the CBNRM committees and their activities. They confirmed that the authority of the committee comes from local communities, the Native 12 Practical Action was previously known as the Intermediate Technology Organisation.

Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 15 Box 2: The establishment of Nadia Forest 6.3 Benefits of and challenges to CBNRM committees An FNC officer said tha t the work of CBNRM committees has had practical consequence s for local communities ' livelihood s, including : Improved nutrition through the provision of vegetables and fruits at cheap prices ; Use of agricultural extension to introduce new crop varieties; The road of Um Gedeibo facilitates the transport ation of crops from the field to the markets and villages; Increased construction of water -harvesting infrastructure, provision of improved seeds , and the introduction of modern techniques , which has contribute d to increased production; According to the Agricultural O fficer in Daresalam locality, the committee has had a clear impact on the effectiveness of crop protection from insect and fire damage, which has led to increased production; Community awareness about the ecosystem was increased , as told by a locality forest officer. However, the SMPED Officer had no idea about what changes had been brought about due to the work of the CBNRM committees. There are also various challenges faced by the CBNRM committees , as perceived by respondents . Table 3 below summarizes these challenges along with some solutions. Nadia Forest, established in 2007 in El Fashir locality , is an example of a change brought about via a CBNRM committee, in this case the Women's Development Association (WDA). Nadia Forest (also known as t he Shagra Community Forest) is in Shagra C, a village with a population of around 7,000 that relies mainly on agriculture and animal rearing. The area of land that is now forest measur es 9.4 fadden and was once bare, sandy land with a dry season lasting 8-10 months. Sponsored by Practical Action UK, the World Food Programme , and contributions from members, the WDA helped to create a forest to shelter Shagra from the wind, stabilize the soil, prevent sand- creeping , and provide shade and fodder. The WDA area , and protecting the forest (e.g. , from animals). During the first four years , they transported water from some three kilometers away every dry season until the trees were established. The WDA also played an important role in the improvement of livelihoods through the construction of an improved seed bank, the establishment of demonstration farms, and increasing the awareness of the importance of gubraka farms. They also established a savings fund to cover the cost of education services and emergencies such as medical treatment or funerals. While successful, there are ongoing challenges around payment of forest guards and protecting the trees, as well as other ongoing technical and social problems.

The lack of water around or near the animal routes , weakness in the rangeland and pasture laws, and managing the sharing of resources with IDPs were also cited as challenges. According to one FNC officer, the main challenges are traditional farming \u2014monoculture and tree -cutting, practiced by some people \u2014and informal terraces. 6.4 CBNRM committees and f ormal ( government) institutions According to the majority of interviews we conducted, the CBNRM committees complement the roles of government institutions and coordinate with various institutions and other relevant committees. The CBNRM committee s influence INRM strategies by connecting their work with that of the government Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 17 authorities. C ommittee members also receive technical advice from respective government institutions and NGOs. El Fashir Respondent s from Karkara, Zamzam , and Umsialla mentioned that their committees operate alongside government authorities where they work together to ma nage natural resources. Azagarfa: The people interviewed in Azagarfa said that their CBNRM committee coordinates with other community -based organizations ( CBOs ) and committees, for example the agricultural committee, nutrition committee, veterinary assist ant, and women's committee. According to respondents, the committee furnishes the government institutions with information about the needs and requirements of the community , and the government institutions direct the respective units to respond to the requests. Karkara: The committee works in connection with other committees, especially the ajaweed committee (in solving disputes between different groups ), the disaster prevention committee, and the early warning committee, as well as in coordination with the Native Administration . If things become complicated, they report it to the judiciary. The Karkara CBNRM committee coordinates with respective institutions, for example the Rural Water Supply Administration, Water and Environmental Sanitation Project, SMPED , and the FNC. Sometimes members of the committee are members of more than one CBO. Zamzam: The Zamzam committee, in collaboration with government authorities (water corporation), DDRA, and Practical Action, established terraces and a dam. The Zamzam committee also coordinates with the Rural W ater Supply A dministration and Department for Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) with regards to water use. According to Zamzam interviewees, the statute and constitution of the committee are approved by state government authorities. Shagra: In Shagra village , the FNC provides seedlings for the committee , and the Water Supply Administration connects pipelines and provides water. Nomads: The dev elopment committee of Umsialla nomads in El Fashir locality was established as a s tate government initiative , and it therefore has connections with governmental institutions and works in connection with government authorities. As mentioned by Umsialla respondents, the A gricultural Advisor, V eterinary A ssistant , and H ealth A ssistant who received training from respective government institutions coordinate with the committee. The El Fashir FNC officer confirmed that CBNRM committees operate in connection with government authorities. For example, the forest law gives legal delegation to the Native Administration. However, the El Fashir Agricultural Officer mentioned that CBNRM committees do not work in a regular way and do not have formal links with government i nstitutions: the laws and statutes of the CBNRM committees are still in development. Daresalam and Kalemindo In Daresalam and Kalemindo , as mentioned the FGD s in Abuzeriga and Abu Deleik , the committees share information and reports, exchange meetings , and visit government authorities. However, according to one HH from Abuzeriga and Sagannaam , there is no relation ship between the committee and government officials. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 18 Daresalam: The A gricultural O fficer in Daresalam and an individual female HH i n Abu D eleik told us that there is coordination between government authorities: if there is conflict or a wildfire , the committee will inform the traditional leader . The traditional leader then informs the respective government authorities. According to re spondents, the committee in Daresalam coordinates with the Range and Pasture Administration in opening the animal routes. Shangil Tobay: The Shangil Tobay CBNRM committee works in coordination with SMPED , the water committee work s in coordination with wate r department , and the h ealth committee work s in coordination with the State Ministry of Health. According to one HH from Shangil Tobay, for any activity, the committee should inform the government official first , and any technical activity should be done by the related department. Kalemindo : According to the Agriculture and Forest Officers in Kalemindo, the committee also works in coordination with formal institutions such as the forest, agriculture , and livestock department s. Nomads: In contrast , the Kalemindo nomad committee works under the traditional leaders but has no connection to or coordination with government authorities , unlike the El Fashir nomad committee . The nomad community has negative views towards the CBNRM committees , as stated by the interviewees. Moreover, the Daresalam locality Forest O fficer mentioned that there is no coordination between the committee and government institutions. 6.5 Differences between CBNRM committees and traditional system s There are differences in the way CBNRM and traditional systems work, according to the majority of respondents in the three localities. CBNRM committees CBNRM committees w ork mainly via linking the community with service provid ers. According to Abuzeriga, Shangil Tobay , and Sagannaam respondents, the committees coordinate closely with government authorities on natural resource use. They educat e stakeholders on how to participat e in issue s pertinent to INRM and raise community awareness, especially around women in nutrition, health , and income -generating activities. The respondents believe that the committees assist traditional leaders by contributing to raising community awareness of natu ral environment use. They s eem more engaged in activities and decisions concerned with improving resource use and production than land administration aspects . Shagra respondents told us that the CBNRM committee differs from the traditional system in regulating the use of the environment. CBNRM committees in Karkara, Zamzam, Shagra, and Umsialla hold regular meetings that include men and women. According to Karkara respondents, the D eputy C hairman of the committee is a woman. Ongoing and specific dutie s are determined and organized. Zamzam respondents mentioned that the designation of duties for every individual and group is very clear in CBNRM committees compared to traditional systems. There is a good distribution of work responsibilities relative to traditional institutions , according to respondents. CBNRM committees are well trained by NGOs and government institutions. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 19 Traditional systems Native Administration s focus on land distribution and administration of people's access to resources. Shagra respondents told us that in traditional systems the role of women in INRM is absent and the relationship between institutions and community is not clear. According to the Umsialla nomad s, in traditional systems women are not allowed to participate in regulating the use of the environment. Most of the government officials mentioned that CBNRM committees are different from traditional systems in that the committees ' work is confined mainly to raising community awareness, and less in regulating the use of natural resources through coordination with respective government institutions and NGOs. However, according to one Abu Deleik HH interview and the Kalemindo Forest O fficer, there is no difference between CBNRM committees and traditional institutions in INRM . 6.6 Community perception of the impact of CBNRM c ommittees on livelihood s According to the views of the respondents , the inclusion of women in the CBNRM committees has induced big social changes : Involvement of women in Karkara was a great help to the community by bringing about changes in behavior , increasing awareness about environment resources, and decreas ing gender -based discrimination ; Women have contributed to conflict resolution , a woman be came a trainer -of-traine rs in the Zamzam area, and a woman became a member of the Gedaim Dam C ommittee ; The inclu sion of women in the Abuzeriga and Shangil Tobay areas helped them establish a village savings fund and loan association in the area, which improved the sources of income and helped the women establish home gardens (see Box 2 ); As told during the Sagannaam and Abu Deleik FGDs , the involvement of women in the committee contributed to raising the awareness of women on health, nutrition , and gubraka farming, establishing a village savings association, construction of an improved seed bank, and the est ablishment of demonstration farms. However , individual males from HHs in Sagannaam and Abu Deleik told us that the involvement of women has had no effects. A female HH from Sagannaam told us that she has no idea about the roles and effects of the committe e. The farmer and agropastoralist respondents from the three localities agreed that the training -of-trainers programs delivered by committees had increased awareness and was reflected positively in the livelihood s of people in the area. Agricultural and ve terinary extension programs, nutrition programs, and saving funds are examples of other useful committee activities. In the Shagra area, there has also been adoption and practice of terrace- making to harvest water, cropping rotations, fertilizer addition, acquir ing of external experiences, and the establishment of a community forest. According to the FNC O fficer, the irrigated agriculture during the summer (dry season) brought about through CBNRM initiatives has provided work opportunities for people. Daresalam locality officials told us that the committee work has contributed to protection of crops from damage by animals, protection of natural resources from fire, organizing forest -use by the community, providing improved seeds , and use of agricul tural mechanization to increase production. Kalemindo government officials reported that the C BNRM activities have Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 20 increased water -harvesting techniques, provided improved seeds , and increased the capacity of beneficiaries through training. The nomad community in Umsialla also perceived that livelihood s in the area have been positively affected by the work of the d evelopment committee , as told by FGD respondents. The committee members received training on INRM , agricultural extension , and veterinary services conducted by DDRA and s tate government departments ( animal resources, a griculture, f orest and w ater resources). As a result , new crops such as groundnuts, berseem ,15 adsia, and potato were introduced, and animal diseases were reduced due to vaccination. Nevertheless, the respondents indicated that the development programs set by government institutions and NGOs do not represent the interests and priorities of many beneficiaries. Kalemindo nomad respondents reported that the committees have no clear role as the nomad representatives are not interested in voluntary work. They believe that the CBNRM committees have contributed to an increase in compensation money owed by animal owner s when their animals destroy the crops. Box 3: The success story of a female farmer in Shangil Tobay village 6.7 The natural environment and livelihood systems Current use The majority of people surveyed via FGDs and HH interviews in the three localities mentioned that land, soil, water, forests , and pastures are the main natural resources on which the livelihoods of different user groups depend. According to the respondents, the main livelihood systems in the study area are agriculture (both on clay and sandy soils), rangelands for livestock grazing, and grass trading. Kharasana (gravels), sand, building stones , and limestone also form part of the livelihood system of Karkara and adjacent communities due to the construction of the El Fashir -Khartoum highway. 15 Berseem (alfafa) is a source of nutritious fodder and is mainly produced in closed system livestock farms around cities and densely populated cent ers all year round. During the survey , an example of good practice was identified concerning one of the female farmers from Shangil Tobay village in Daresalam locality. She mentioned that she has a piece of land in the wadi basin. Before the formation of the CBNRM committee, she used this land f or producing crops like okra and local sorghum. After the formation of the committee , she received training in agricultural extension and water -harvesting techniques. After this training , she received 500 g of improved tomato seeds as well as 3 kg of impro ved sorghum seeds from the CBNRM committee and VNRHD. She cultivates these two species as well as adsia (pigeon pea, Cajanus cajan) as shelter belts to protect the crops from wind destruction. During harvesting time , she separates the big, healthy tomato fruits and heads of sorghum. She dries these fruits and extracts the seed s to use as improved seed s for the next season. In the first season, she extracted about 3 kg of tomato seeds and three sacks of sorghum seeds. She said that she sold 50% of these improved seeds to other farmers and used the remainder on her farm. She also harvested more than one sack of adsia seeds, sold some, and kept the rest for family use. The farmer said that her livelihood has improved and her income has increased. She mentioned that her husband works with her as a guard for the farm instead of staying at home. Now she is a well -known improved -seed producer and merchant in the area. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 21 Regulation and access to n atural e nvironment According to the people surveyed via the HH interviews and FGDs at all three localities, land regulation and access is normally the responsibility of traditional leaders. They are responsible for distributing land for farming and grazing to community members based on comm unity traditions and norms. The common rangelands (fallow lands, natural forests) are freely accessible to everybody, while farming lands are accessible to all only after the crop harvest . Farming lands can be used by the residents and pastoralists either for grazing or collection of crop residues for animal feeding, building material , or selling in the market. Access to land for cultivation is either free through the local leader or via renting, sharing, or buying from landowners . Also, there are some priv ate lands, which are sometimes accessible by renting , in-cash, or by production ratio (1:2 or 1:1 ; renter and landowner respectively ) systems. There is common land (Zaribat Elhawa) , which is illegally fenced by some people and therefore not accessible to community members , as stated by the Abuzeriga community in Daresalam l ocality. According to Azagarfa respondents , the Native Administration , government institutions, the resistance committee ( ligan el magawama: youth committees that worked against the former regime and currently support the transitional period of government ), NGOs , and youth groups are responsible for INRM . The Native A dministration and community committees coordinate with respective government institutions such as the FNC, SMPED, Rural Water Corporation, and the Administrative U nit of Rural El Fashir . For example, if there are technical problems, the community -based committees inform the respective government institutions. The community -based natural resource management committees are responsible for raising community awareness about the safe exploitation of the natural resources in all study villages. In the field of agriculture, the farmers adopted a multiculture system instead of monoculture. In the forests , people avoid the illegal cutting of trees. In the field of social service s, health and education awareness in the village has improved. Changes in natural environment access and use over the last two decades According to the majority of interviewees, over the last twenty years the institutions have progressed due to the training and awareness -raising they have received from NGOs. T oday, t here is a better link and contact between the service providers (NGOs an d government institutions) and beneficiaries (local communities) . The surveyed HHs and FGD participants at Zamzam in El Fashir locality told us that the rangelands were affected by insecurity in other areas and the expansion of agriculture , especially after the set -up of the Zamzam IDP camp . Due to many pastoralists grazing their animals in the relatively secure study area near to El Fashir , the carrying capacity of the grazing land has been exceeded, which has caused rangeland degradation and deterioration. The rangeland in the study area is communal and access ible to everybody at all times and is freely used, as mentioned by respondents. For example, Abuzeriga interviewees stated that there are open and communal rangelands and there are no laws or norms that prohibit the ir exploitation, which lead s to deterioration. According to many interviewees, the selling of crop residues by some farmers and dry season cultivation in clay soil using artificial irrigation seem to be increasing commercial trends, which have a positive impact on the farmers but a negative impact on other users, especially animal herders. Water of hafir and some wells is free for everyone and their animals to use. But boreholes and hand pumps require service fees16 in order to gain access . 16 Fees used in maintenance and worker's payment. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 22 The variability of the rainfall, in terms of quantity and distribution, impacts the capability of lands to produce crops and fodder , as mentioned by the majority of respondents. Also, some respondents mentioned that productivity decreases because of infertility due to continue d cropping, sand- blow, and overgrazing, especially in the sandy soil . Such phenomena force farmers to shift from sandy soil to clay soil for cultivation , which lead s to agricultural expansion in clay soil. The cultivated areas have also expanded due to the use by farmers of animal s and machines to plough the land as well as because of labor availability from the IDP camps, particularly in the Zamzam, Azagarfa, Shagra , and Shangil Tobay areas. Obtainment of firewood, charcoal , and other forest products has become difficult and too far away because of forest deterioration due to illegal tree felling. The rangelands have also deteriorated , and obtainment of fodder during the dry season has bec ome difficult. The number of animals has increased , causing rangeland deterioration and the disappearance of good- quality fodder plants , especially begail (Blefaris linarifolia ), and the appearance of low -quality and toxic fodder plants , as stated by respondents . Most of the nomads have bec ome agropastoralists and have started cultivating crops , such as in the case of Umsialla community (see B ox 4). Box 4: Livelihood strategies and natural environment use\u2014Umsialla nomads 7. Discussio n 7.1 Formation and legitimacy of CBNRM committees Our re search has shown that there are CBNRM committees in the majority of North Darfur 's communities , which reflects their importance in regulating livelihoods and ecosystems. They are also Locality: El Fashir Damra: Umsialla Livelihood strategies: Pastoralism: we keep sheep, camel, goats, cows, horses, donkeys , and hens. Cows are owned only by some people , and 50% of people own camels ; Agriculture: in goz lands we produce sorghum, millet, sesame, luba, watermelon, and kerkedai ; In clay soil we produce tomato, potato, soybean, onion, carrot, okra, vegetables, fruits, watermelon , and berseem . Changes in livelihood activities : Potato planting was introduced, and planting groundnuts and dura in goz lands ; The rangelands have become scarce and too far away because of agricul tural expansion around home vicinities ; Increase in animal numbers due to increase in veterinary care; Improved breed rearing and increased community awareness ; Water became available due to digging of boreholes ; Presence of more and alternative livelihood opportunities. CBNRM: We have a committee known as the \" Development Committee \" established in 2019 on the occasion of the tree festival ; The committee has involved women as members from the start ; The committee's authority comes from the Native Administration and government ; The committee works in connection with government authorities. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 23 identified as competent authorities17 for protecting and conserving the environment according to A rticle 16(d) of the Environment Protection Act 2001 (MEPD 2001). Th e wide recognition they receive from local communities, government authoriti es, traditional leaders, and development agencies enables the m to facilitate equitable resource use and access, and coordinate between user groups and other INRM stakeholders. Their main strength is the nomination of committee members by the community the mselves. Because of this, the community acts as the original source of committee authority , which is supplemented by financial and legal support given to the committees by development agencies and government authorities. The legitimacy from the community c oupled with this support provide s the committee s with the power needed to work across all aspects INRM and livelihood systems . When local communities participate in managing their own affairs, projects are most likely to succeed and can be sustained, because community members see the results and benefits from actions taken (Unruh 20 18; Smiley et al. 2010; UNEP 2014; Mohammed and Mengist 2018). However , this was not the case across all the communities we surveyed. The lack of committees among the Daresalam nomads can be attributed to the continuous mobility of these groups and their low level of awareness and willingness to partici pate. Furthermore , the current committee of the Umsialla nomad s is a government initiative , which necessarily focuses on implementing the policies and strategies of official authorities. 7.2 Changes in the titles and activities of CBNRM committees over th e last 20 years The change s over time in the titles of the CBOs working in areas related to INRM and access largely reflect the trends in projects delivered by the government and NGOs. The goals and activities of the se projects largely determine the names and activities of the CBOs, as the se projects finance the CBOs' activities and provide technical and administrative training for local people. The name change s of the Azagarfa, Karkara, Zamzam , and Shagra agriculturist and agropastoralist communities ' committees are good examples of this. Recently , the work of most community -based institutions has used titles related to INRM and peaceful coexistence, due to the perceived link between the natural environment and the Darfur conflict among the wide r community and NGOs .18 As the titles and activities of CBNRM committees have changed over the last two decades, so the awareness of the community about the natural environment has also improved. Interconnected work by NGOs such as DDRA, VNRHD, and Practical Action have led to the adoption of new production techniques and have improved livelihood systems in the study area s. Agricultural productivity and animal 17 Competent authority: includes national societies and institutions interested in the promotion and protection of the environment, permitted to work in the state. 18 While there is significant evidence that environmental and natural resource degradation have been major contributors in triggering land ownership di sputes and the onset of armed confrontation in the Darfur region (Fadul 2004; Abdul -Jalil 2009), politics also provoke fear and doubts between different user groups. For example, hakura- owning sedentary farmers accuse the nomads of trying to obtain the lan ds by force in affiliation with the central government; meanwhile the nomads accuse farmers of trying to expel the nomads ( abbala herders) from Darfur. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 24 resources have improved due to the construction of formal terraces and dams, multi -cropping system s, improvement s in animal and crop varieties , and changes in environmental use habits. Furthermore, communication and experience exchanges with the international community have contributed to promoting awareness , introducing appropriate technologies , and improved understanding among local communities of the necessity of I NRM and how this can be achieved, as well as the importance of respecting the interests of different user groups, as attested by Shagra village. It was obvious that the CBNRM committees' activities focus mainly on livelihoods and regulating INRM and pay comparatively less attention to administration and land allocation issues . Because of historical, and statutory and customary laws , CBNRM committees face various challenges in managing land distribution. 7.3. Challenges to CBNRM committees The most common challenges limiting the success of CBNRM committees in the area are the construction of informal terraces, pest outbreaks such as zarzoor (birds), the expansion of agriculture, increasing number s of animals, talaig time, financial limitation s, scarcity of fuel sources, infertile goz soil, and scarcity of water during the dry season. Construction of informal terraces prevent s the flow of water to neighboring farms and provoke s disputes between farmers. A gricultural expansion and increasing number s of livestock coupled with a decrease in grazing areas, animal routes , and carrying capacity of rangelands often lead to disputes and conflict between different user groups. Infertile soil and lack of water during dry seasons hinder the scale- up and wider adoption of new technologies introduced by the CBNRM committees, such as cultivating new seed varieties and dry season cultivation by the farmers. P ests such as zarzoor (the most harmful pest ), diminishing rangelands due to agricultural expansion because of workforce availability , and scarcity of fuel sources often affect the work of committees. Th ese challenges can negatively affect the success of extension programs and production innovation (e.g., demonstration farms, seed dispersions on rangelands , and safe use of woody vegetation) and limit their adoption by the community. Towards s olution s One of the common challenges is talaig time. Talaig time is officially known to start on February 7 in North Darfur. However , nomads, especially camel herd ers, do not respect the talaig , either intentionally or out of ignorance of the actual date , and allow their animals to enter farms before harvesting has been completed. This can lead to conflict between the farmers and herders . Some crops such as watermelons and tomatoes still flourish and produce fruits after February 7, so some farmers do not allow animals to enter the farms until this harvest is over. The herder s believe that once talaig has started , their animals should have access to the farms, by force if necessary, triggering conflict. Having a fixed date for the start of the talaig does n ot seem suitable in North Darfur, because it is the rainfall patterns that determine the production cycles of farming and grazing, and these fluctuate from year to year . 19 Therefore, it is advisable that the timing of the talaig should be flexible and be determined 19 When precipitation is scarce, the crops fail to mature or will be harvested early, and this can be ac companied by poor grazing lands. On the other hand, when rainfall is good (in terms of intensity and/or distribution) the farming season might stretch to the end of February. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 25 every season through some kind of joint mechanism that includes all stakeholders that depend on agricultural crops and the condition of grazing lands for their livelihoods. The organization of a community conference to discuss talaig time and to raise awareness and build capacity among different groups of resource users on natural environment access and variability may help achieve flexibility in talaig timing and a more peaceful co- management of access rights. Community members have to learn to widen the scope of sustainable ecosystem management in order to secure long -term productivity and protection of resources (Harvey et al. 2018; Okereke and Stacewicz 2018). 7.4. CBNRM committees and formal (government) institutions Government institutions set the general policies for INRM , development, access , and protection to ensure sustainability and encourage community participation in sustainable production, facilitating the movement of herders across states, and in the technical supervision of farmlands, for ests, and rangelands. In order to implement these policies , they have short -, mid -, and long -term strategies and plans, and often allow the CBOs to work or be an implementing partner within their institutional frameworks , which enables the CBNRM committees to influence INRM strategies. At the state level, f or example, the committees work within the framework of policies and laws of the FNC, Water Supply Corporation, and SMPED . At the national level, specific commissions have been founded within the framework of Darfur Peace Agreements, in addition to INRM line ministries and departments . See Box 5. The practical effects of CBNRM committees on local communities' livelihoods were confirmed by the majority of s tate and l ocalit y government officials and institutions in North Darfur. However, the statements by the El Fashir Agricultur al Officer and Daresalam FNC O fficer declaring that there is no coordination between their institutions and CBNRM committees may indicate some gaps that need to be addressed. Furthermore, about 50% of poor women were unaware that the work of CBNRM committees should be seek ing new ways to include all community members, particularly vulnerable groups. Box 5: Darfur Peace Agree ments and INRM 7.5. Differences between CBNRM committees and traditional systems Popular and government institutional context s and traditional systems for management and access to natural resources, for both farming and pastoralism activities, have greatly changed in Darfur (Jaspars The Abuja 2006, Doha 2011 , and Juba 2020 agreements established specialized commissions to deal with issues of land and natural resources in Darfur. However, there were practical challenges that hindered the success of these commissions in the Abuja and Doha agreements. The prominent challenge was the refu sal of IDPs and refugees (who fled to neighboring countries during the conflict) to return to their original lands due to insecurity and before receiving compensation for their losses. The rejection by some armed groups of the agreements was also a real ob stacle. The implementation of the Juba agreement has just started , but its fate will be more or less similar to the previous ones unless a comprehensive agreement including all armed factions can be achieved and supported by IDPs, refugees, and nomads. Wit hout collective agreement , any settlement of lands and natural resource rights as stated in agreement documents w ill not be possible ; hence no commission or institution will be able to accomplish its mandate. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 26 2010; Young and Ismail 2019). The differences identified by respondents in the ways of work ing between CBNRM committees and traditional systems indicate that the committees are relatively well organized, gender balanced , and function specific in comparison to traditional systems . The work of the CBNRM committees is focused on assisting government institutions regarding INRM and rais ing awareness in the target communities around regulating the use of natural resources and improv ing livelihood systems . Traditional systems have a broad er remit that includes INRM and access, but with an unclear distribution of responsibilities and almost no inclusion of women. Furthermore, the role of the Native Administration over the last two decades has been weakened with regards to regulating INRM and access, while acknowledgement and recognition of the CBNRM committees has increased . 7.6. Commu nity perception of CBNRM committees' impact on livelihoods It was acknowledged by the majority of FGD respondents and government officials that CBNRM committees have had a positive impact on livelihoods. The work and activities undertaken by the committees were clearly perceived by the majority of agriculturists, agropastoralists , and government authorities across all three localities. Various extension and training programs delivered by the committees have increased awareness of INRM , and this has been reflected in the livelihoods of people in these areas. However , there is little awareness of the committees and their work among poor women and nomads. Inclusion of women in the executive offices of the CBNRM committees and their general participation in their work has induced changes in the understanding of and behavior towards environmental resources among the nine communities this study looked at. The village savings and loan funds have helped households, especially women, establish ho me gardens and have supported access to education and medication for family members in Azagarfa, Karkara, Abuzeriga, Shangil Tobay, and Sagannaam communities. Membership of woman in the Gedaim Dam Committee meant that wom en were fundamental in setting loca l development policies and making decisions in the Zamzam area. However , in the nomad communities of Daresalam and Kalemindo , women are still under -represented in decision- making with regards to natural resource access. The Umsialla Community -based Development Committee's work on the introduction and cultivation of new crops, such as alfalfa , coincided with the settling of many agropastoralists. This may indicate a shift in livelihood system s, from complete dependence on open rangeland pastures to using par tially cultivated fodder. Despite this possible impact, the activities of the committee do not necessarily prioritize the interests of the nomads as it was an initiative of the state government. Nomads in Daresalam and Kalemindo appeared to have little or no knowledge, or a negative impression, of CBNRM committees. While the positive perception of the local community could be leveraged to further en hance and disseminate INRM strategies, it is clear that many vulnerable people do not seem aware of the work and impact of the CBNRM committees. Further efforts from the committees, government authorities, NGOs, and Native Administration s remain necessary to reach and involve the nomads and vulnerable agriculturist and agropastoralist groups. Further investigation into the relationship between vulnerable people and CBNRM committees is necessary to understand the reasons behind these detected shortcomings in order to improve interactions. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 27 7.7. Livelihood systems, regulation, and access to the natural environment The natural ecosystems are major sources of vital services if properly managed and could be a base for transformative change (Nawrotzki et al. 2011; ADBG 2014). Despite a hiatus during the conflict year s when resource management institutions collapsed, triggering changes in land resource rights (PA 2014; Unruh 2018 ), access to and regulation of the natural environment has been controlled by the Native Administration in coordination with related government institutions and other CBOs, particularly CBNRM committees. However, according to the Abu Deleik respondents, traditional leaders were weakened during the conflict years because of the absence of government and formal institutions, while the role of CBNRM commi ttees became more prominent and acknowledged by community members. In the study area, r esponsibility for land distribution and access for farming lies with the Native Administration and is based on community traditions and norms. During talaig , the sandy f armlands are freely accessible to everybody and can be used by the residents and pastoralists without prior permission, either for grazing or collection of crop residues for animal feeding, building material , or selling in the market. The existence of the institution regulating talaig is evidence of the co -evolution of pastoralism and farming as integrated production systems in the same space but at different times. Such resource- use pattern s through agreed mechanism s of rights of access can facilitate maximum benefits to different groups of users (Young et al. 2020) . 7.8. The changes in the natural environment over the last two decades While the understanding of government and non- governmental institutions about the necess ity of inter - coordination has improved over the last twenty years , various renewable natural resources such as soils, farmlands, rangelands , and forest elements have been subjected to overuse due to an increas ing population and increasing numbers of livest ock (Fadul 2004; Hadi 2013) . The capability of the land to produce sufficient crops and fodder , especially in goz lands , has been reduced because of soil erosion, soil infertility , and rainfall variability (UNEP 2007; SMA 2014) . The coping responses and strategies developed by communities in the ways of land use, such as water - harvesting techniques, terrace -making , and the transition from agriculturalist /pastoralist to agropastoralist have had positive effects on livelihoods. For example, t he quality and quantity of water sources ha ve improved due to the public and private construction of boreholes, hafir , and terraces , which have rendered drinking water available and dry season cultivation possible , providing extra livelihood options. Howeve r, increasing trends in selling crop residues , and dry season cultivation in clay soil using artificial irrigation by farmers to increase profits , have reduce d the grazing areas available during summer months and threaten the free access to the land. This changes the historical integration pattern between farming and pastoralism. Furthermore, the increasing trend towards agropastoralism means different groups are looking to use the same resources at the same time , which increase s competition. However , if agropastoralism is managed wisely , it seems to be a good tool for different user groups to understand and respect each other and could be used to develop effective INRM system s. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 28 Increas es in IDP camp construction on farmers ' land and the adopti on of a sedentary mobility system20 by livestock keepers ha ve caused the depletion of potential rangeland resources around the Zamzam area. However , the practice of short -distance or long- distance mobility can lead to improvements in the grazing area (Sulieman and Young 2019). The di sappearance of good -quality fodder plants , especially begail (Blefaris linarifolia ) species, and appearance of low -quality and toxic fodder plants are example s of the impact of climate extremes and over-exploitation in the study area. The d isappearance of palatable high -quality plant species immediately impacts livestock production and therefore the livelihoods and food securi ty of people (FAO 2007; Siam et al. 2019). Depletion of forest resources make obtainment of firewood, charcoal , and other forest products difficult and too far away for many in the study area . The variation between accessible biomass production and consumption demand has become greatest near to populated centers and has resulted in significant change in vegetation (UNEP 2008). Informed measures and means should be taken by CBNRM committees, government, traditional institutions , and NGOs to reduce further the vulnerability of livelihoods and to secure sustainable socio- ecological system s that ensure equity of distribution of access rights. 8. Conclusion The establishment and presence of CBNRM committees in the majority of North Darfur 's communities reflect the ir impor tant role in regulating livelihoods and ecosystems. The ir legitimacy stem s from the community and provides the committees with their power to work and succeed . CBNRM committees work in collaboration with government , traditional authorities , and development organizations. The practical effects of C BNRM committees on local communities ' livelihood s were confirmed by the majority of s tate- and locality -level government officials and institutions in North Darfur. However , about 50% o f poor women were unaware of the work of CBNRM committees, and the lack of CBNRM committees among the Daresalam nomads demonstrates the need to see k new ways of engag ing all members of the communities in INRM issues. The most common challenges limiting the success of CBNRM committees within our study area were the construction of informal terraces, outbreak of pest s, expansion of agriculture, increasing number s of animals, talaig time, financial limitation s, and the scarcity of fuel sources. The role of the Native Administration in regulating INRM has been weakened over the last two decades by various factors, while the CBNRM committees have bec ome more widely acknowledged and recognized by local communities. Inclusion of women in the executive offices of CBNRM committees has brought about changes in the way communities think and act in terms of environment al resources, and there was women's participation in public actions among the communities of eight villages. The vil lage saving s and loan funds have helped households establish home gardens and have supported access to education and medication for family members in Azagarfa, Karkara, Abuzeriga, Shangil T obay, 20 According to Sulieman and Young (2019) , there are three types of mobility: long -distance mobility, short -distance mobility , and a sedentary system of mobility, defined as grazing confined to the home area all year round. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 29 Although over the last twenty years government and non- governmental institutions have improved coordination due to training and increased awareness, various renewable natural resources such as soils, farmlands, rangelands , and forest elements have been sub jected to overuse. The majority of sedentary villagers and Umsialla nomads have become agropastoralists. The conversion of farmlands into rangelands during talaig time ensures the existence of two livelihood/production systems , integrated in such a way as to be able to maximize the use of the same space in different ways and at different times while minimizing competition for resources. In order to retain the peaceful coexistence and co -management of natural resources, the views and efforts of all stakeholders need to be considered. Raising awareness and a thorough understanding of natural resource access and livelihood production systems tend to be crucial to setting policies and programs that can help in the promotion of effective use and appropriate resi lient options among different groups of resource users. The CBNRM committees' work in the institutional context seems a suitable tool for the effective management of the natural environment and sustainable livelihoods if the committees are able to represen t all resource users.

Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 33 Annex 1: Context Livelihood systems and the natural environment Livelihood systems in North Darfur, which include farming and pastoralism or a combination of both, are largely reliant on the drylands environment. Pastoralism and dryland farming in Darfur are adapted to extre me climate variability (Young et al. 2020). In Darfur , these two systems complement each other and are fundamental to local food security, nutrition, and work opportunities . Hence pastoralism and farming should be seen as and dealt with as an integrated st rategy in INRM . Various climatic factors such as rainfall variability and desertification , and anthropogenic factors such as tree cutting, overgrazing, ill - informed development , subsistence farming , and political intervention have acted against such integr ation , inducing competition and conflict between pastoralists and farmers over natural resources. Political intervention such as arming some groups against others has devastating impacts and subverts the integration patterns of livelihoods . Land access Darfur has undergone many changes in governance patterns and rules since the Anglo- Egyptian conquest in 1916, which have shaped the opinions of many in the Darfur community with regards to natural resource access, particularly land tenure. Historic ally, Darfur was a s ultanate before the Anglo -Egyptian conquest in 1916. Thereafter , it became Darfur P rovince before being divided into two provinces (North and South Darfur) in 1973, which were both answerable to the central government in Khartoum. In 1980, the Regional Governance Act was issued , which established the Darfur region (with El Fashir as the capital) and which was governed by regional governors. In 2013 , a presidential decree was issued dividing Darfur into five states. Most recently, the Juba Peace Agreement was signed in October 2020 by the Transitional Government of Sudan and the Armed Movements. This agreement reshaped Darfur as one region to be ruled by a Governor. Sultanate of Darfur The hakura system in Darfur was used to represent the state governance hierarchy, starting from the village up to the s ultan . It was used to maintain the identities, borders, internal security , and relationships between different groups and tribes (Shatta 2010). His torically, land was controlled by the sultanate and via customary systems in places such as Darfur, Dar Masalit, Dar Zaghawa, Dar Rezeigat, Dar Habania, Dar Bani Halba, Dar Taisha, etc . that had power to allocate land to their own people and to others (Dau od 2009; Bromwich 2020). In the hakura land-tenure system, selling of the land was not allowed because it was considered communal and deeply connected to the identity of the various groups, not just a usable resource (DLC 2007). Anglo -Egyptian Sudan Vario us land acts were issued during the colonial and national governments. For instance , during the Angelo- Egyptian colony, the Land Settlement and Registration Ordinance (LSRO) 1925 was issued and indicate d that all fallow, forests, and unoccupied lands were presumed to be owned by the government . Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 34 In 1970, the Unregistered Land Act was issued , which stated that any unregistered lands are presumed to be government lands. This Act also canceled the Native Administration system. The Unregistered Land Act created gaps and lack of confidence between hakura owner groups and government, because hakura owners thought that the government was trying to eradicate their historical rights, identity , and culture. On the other hand, according to DLC (2007) , some of those who did not have hakura lands and newcomers supported the new act . Thus the tension between different groups of users increased. The Civil Transactions Act was promulgated in 1984, whi ch among other procedures cancelled the Unregistered Land Act 1970. Although in Darfur the registered lands according to the government Act did not exceed 0.1% (DLC 2007) , the tension between different stakeholders is still going on. Therefore, all the rec ent peace agreements \u2014Abuja 2006, Doha 2011, and Juba 2020\u2014 between armed movement s and the central government of Sudan strive to address the land tenure and access rights in Darfur. For example , the Juba Peace Agreement (JPA) 2020 between the Transitional G overnment of Sudan and Armed Movements decided to establish among other tools the Commission of Lands and Hawakeer21 and the Commission of Nomads and Pastoralists Development in order to tackle land rights and peaceful coexistence issues as detailed in Chapter 6 and 7 of the agreement (JPA 2020). According to JPA, among the authorities of regional government is management, allocation, and exploitation of region lands. The agreement stated that the protecti on and preserv ation of the rights of nomads, pastora lists, and farmers in land use and minimizing the tribal frictions must be assured. All individuals and groups via jurisdiction have rights to retake their lands that have been captured by others after 1989 and during Darfur conflict. These are some theoretical technical clauses mentioned in the JPA regard ing INRM , but it seems that only practical application can bring the trust of the local people. Farming Cultivation in Darfur usually takes place across a number of different of land types, from sandy ( goz) lands and sand dunes to clay soil and valley ( wadi ) banks. Sandy soils are the main soil of the area, found either in flat or stabilized and moving dunes, while clay soils are found on the banks of river and water courses. A small range of farming acti vities are practiced in the relatively more productive alluvial soil near watercourses. Therefore, lands around watercourses have more value and are more desirable to people than goz land in terms of crop production. However , land around watercourses needs more effort in terms of cleaning and weeding. Despite resulting in high- quality fodder, clay soil is not preferred by pastoralists during the rainy seasons because the muddy soil causes difficulties for animal movement. Moreover, the lands with alluvial s oil in the study area are owned by individuals or families within the hakura tenure system because they are the best productive farmlands and are rarely left fallow. However, during the dry seasons , these lands become a good source of high- quality crop residue or fodder. The main food crop s are millet ( dukhun) and sorghum ( dura). Cash crops include groundnuts, watermelons, okra, tobacco, kerkeda i (hibiscus), and various types of fruits. Since the early 1970s, many factors such as recurrent drought and rainf all quantity and distribution variability have imposed challenges on crop production, where the farmers and herders remain uncertain about seasonal and annual precipitation patterns. For example , as shown in Table 4, the total rainfall between 2017 -2020 in El Fashir station was 91.2 mm, 355.4 mm, 327.7 mm, and 316.4 mm per year. The precipitation concentrates 21 Plural of hakura. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 35 mainly in July and August , and the only year with relatively regular distribution across all months was 2019. Table 4 : Rainfall amount and distribution between 2017 and 2020 recorded at El Fashir meteorological station Sept. -Oct. July-August 316.4 2020 Total cereal production failure is a common phenomenon in North Darfur . For example , the shortage in production was more than 90% in 2004 and 2009 (SMA 2014). Thus, some rural farmers change their livelihood strategies to adapt to the harsh environment by increasing cultivated areas, using plough techniques, rearing small animals, and adopti ng of water -harvesting techniques on farmlands. However, such adaptation strategies, especially farmland expansion, tractor ploughing, and wood and fodder collection, have compounded the degradation of the natural environment, including soil, forests, rangelands , and water catchments. Pastoralism and a gropastoral ism Cattle, sheep, goats , and camels are the main sources of livelihoods for pastoralists and agropastoralists . 22 In parts of the drier areas of the region, camel, sheep , and goat herding is practiced. According to Sulieman and Young (2019) , there are three types of mobility: long- distance mobility, short -distance mobility , and a sedentary system of mobility, defined as grazing confined to the home area all year round. Before the conflict in Darfur, the Native Administration determined grazing land and animal routes in the vicinity of every village. The animals, mainly cattl e, goats , and sheep, were moved to grazing areas in the morning and returned to the village in the evening throughout the rainy season ( kfarif ) from germination to harvesting of crops. The main drawback of short -distance mobility and concentrating grazing in limited areas is the deterioration of pastures through overgrazing. Nomad pastoralists, on the other hand, move their livestock, mainly camels and some cattle, long distances from south to north and vice versa at specific times of the year in response t o the changing climate, security , and pasture conditions. The survival and productivity of livestock in semi -arid environments is highly dependent on adaptive responses to the spatial and temporal variability of the resource base and mobility of livestock (Scoones 1991; Kratli 2019). Some main annual and perennial natural grazing plant species in North Darfur are banu, begail , korabe , gao, and haraz . Continuous variability of pastures, water resources, prevailing land- use systems, and some development pr ojects are major challenges for nomadic livelihoods in Darfur. Large -scale infrastructure projects, such as El Fashir airport, have blocked animal routes and hindered seasonal movement. Historically, disputes between farmers and herders around land access were resolved through Native Administration s and customary laws. In the last two decades, the conflicts were bloodier due to political interventions and the acute polarization of society in Darfur. Some nomadic livelihoods strategies have been changed as a result, such as avoiding long- distance mobility and reducing the number of livestock to 22 Farmers rearing livestock and pastoralist s cultivating agricultural crops. Feinstein International Center (fic.tufts.edu) 36 cope with the insecurity. Young et al. (2009) reported that the lifestyle, migratory routes , and socioeconomic characteristics of the nomadic groups changed. The conflict resolution that addresses the interests of all parties and ensures peaceful coexistence between different groups seems to be the best mechanism for the maintenance of rangeland resou rces. Collection of forest products and rangeland forages Collecting and selling firewood, commercial charcoal making, building poles, and harvesting fruits of some forest trees and dry fodders from forests are widely used as livelihood strategies by many farmers and pastoral families. The collection of such items for selling to the urban populations is very common. However, dependence on forest resources as a livelihood is risky for both self -satisfaction and environmental integrity; forests in North Darf ur are mainly composed of scattered desert - and semi -desert thorny trees, which cannot provide sufficient products (charcoal, firewood, or building poles) to satisfy demand. The cutting of scarce shrubs and trees for domestic purposes, especially for selling, accelerates deforestation and desertification processes. It is worth mentioning that the armed conflict has put a lot of pressure on forest vegetation. The placement of IDP camps around commercial town centers has caused the loss of shelter belts, forestry , and farmland (Bromwich 2008) to meet the demands for fuel, construction materials , and brick making. The imbalance between accessible biomass production and demand has become greatest near to Darfur's largest cities and caused significant change in vegetation (UNEP 2008; Lind et al. 2012). According to the State FNC Director, \" High pressure on vegetation cover was made due to needs of fire woods and building poles . Consequently, woody plants especially trees were cleared out around and near IDPs camps .\" In order to increase the resilience of livelihoods of vulnerable communities, the planting of suitable species for drylands, and alternative fuel sources and building materials must be sought and provided in order to fulfill demands for forest reso urces.
