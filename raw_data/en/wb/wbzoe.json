A mindfulness based intervention (MBI) is an intervention package used to reinforce an individual's practice of mindfulness meditation in daily life. MBIs delivered by phone app offer daily prompts to guide bouts of mindfulness meditation, that is, sustained attention to moment-by-moment experience without behavior reactivity.
