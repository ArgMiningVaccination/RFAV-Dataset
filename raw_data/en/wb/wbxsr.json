LEHANA KARMA The term Lehana means the act of licking or lapping up with the tongue. Children are very susceptible to infections. There are so many traditional measures available to combat it and protect from the hostile environment in which drug is mixed with honey or Ghrita are given. The process is called Lehana. So it is the ideal way of administrating drugs in children because it increases the palatability of the drug taken with it and can be easily taken up. This is the most accepted mode of the drug administration to child. Different Acharyas also described various lehan formulations ( balawardhan yogas or strength promoting formulation) for use in balyaawastha (or during childhood period). Lehana karmas purposes: 1. To enhances growth & development by providing sufficient nutrition. 2. Promote health, complexion and strength (immunity). 3. Protect from various infections along with improving intellect and speech (delayed milestone). Indication of Lehana - Children receiving inadequate amount of breast milk due to pregnancy of mother, children having increased demand of food, children passing less amount of urine and stool, children: very lean & thin without any Samhita Sutrasthana, Lehaadhyaya, p.4)2. Contraindications of Lehana - Children having improper digestion, lethargic, passing excessive amounts of urine & stool, suffering from various disorders like eye, ENT disorders ( shiroroga ), fever, diarrhea, edema, jaundice, anemia, cardiac problems, rectal disorder, excessive vomiting & nausea, abdominal discomforts, amaroga (disorders due to toxic residue that is left behind as a by-product of poor digestion) ( Kashyapa Samhita Acharya 2. Acharya Sushruta - has described 4 recipes (containing gold) which provide general immunity, body resistance, helpful in growth & development & enhancing the ghrita8 etc. 4. Acharya Kashyapa - Svaran Prasana - Pure gold (in small quantity) is rubbed in water on a clean stone & given with honey and ghrita, to the newborn result in promote health, growth, complexion delayed milestones).9 Methods to Boost up Vyadhiksamatva In Ayurveda texts, various codes of conducts are described for each persons of any age (from conception to old age) to follow in different seasons, during healthy and diseased conditions in terms of dietetic (ahara) and mode of life ( vihar).These are: (Panchkarma Issue 3, March - 2019 ( www.iamj.in ) Page 405 7.

Rasayana therapy - It promotes and rejuvenate the physiology of body, produce resistance against disease both physically and mentally. BENEFITS OF LEHANA KARMA 1. The like ables are usually in the Leha form. Usually the Lehas are palatable and easy for consumption. The smaller kids will always have difficulties and are reluctant in taking the medicine in the tablet, Churna, or Kwatha form. Incomparable to this Lehana form with added Madura drugs easy to administer. 2. Further the Lehana may be routine procedure or the method by which the body supplements are introduced. As we know that growing child requires the extra caloric food as they are busy with playing and other activities throughout. In the meantime the rate of growth and development is very faster in the first few years of life. To meet the demands of the body in toddler and myelination of nervous system there is need of some extra amount of the fats, amino acids and the carbohydrates which is supplied by Lehana Dravya (in the form of Ghrita, Honey, etc.) 3. In other sense Lehana will have the long standing effect. One should not expect the short term effects in Lehana. It is recommended for the daily usage. It should be given daily as micro and the macronutrients are daily utilized by the body. It will have its own effects in physical and neurological development of the child in future. Classics also explain if it is used for one month, two months or six months the better effects will be seen. 4. The Medhaya Rasayans are explained with special reference in Lehana, may be considering the fact that growth of the brain and the nervous system is very rapid in the first few years of the life which slows down afterwards as evidences by the Head circumference. So idea may be to produce the rich quality neurons in the initial period, so that child will become extra brilliant in future. 5. As we know that nutritious disorders are quite common in the child hood period due to many reasons like poorly fond of particular food, lack of the breast milk, vitiated breast milk etc. There may be vitamin, micro and macro elemental deficiencies which can be corrected by the daily usage of the Lehana. 6. Some of the indications and the contraindication of the Lehana suggest that it could be used as a substitute for the mother's milk or the Dhatris milk in conditions like lack of breast milk or vitiated breast milk. 7. Some of the indications in certain disease conditions suggest that Lehana may be supplementary food along with main stay of treatment. 8. Most of the drugs which are mentioned in the context of the Lehana are also the Rasayana drugs. The Rasayana drugs increase all the Dhatus and maintain the somatic growth of body. 9. We don't find any references to compare Lehana with vaccination, but continuous Lehana may yield vaccination like effect by boosting the immune system and keeping it alert all the time. 10. It is told that the Lehana is responsible for the happiness and sorrow in the future of the baby. By keeping this verse in mind we can say Lehana is essential in once life time as Kashyapa devoted a chapter for this topic. DISCUSSION Swasthasya Swathya Rakshanam is the main fundamental principle of Ayurvedic treatment in which we can conclude the prevention, use of Rasayana drugs, and diet for staying healthy. Rasayana is a specialised treatment influencing the fundamental aspects of the organs i.e. Dhatu , Agni and Srotamsi, leading to overall Megha Dixit Issue 3, March - 2019 ( www.iamj.in ) Page 406 organism, which affords prevention of ageing, resistance against diseases, bodily strength and improvement in mental faculties. The mode of action of Rasayana Dravyas can be considered through the following three ways:- By improving the nutritional value of the Rasa Dhatu, in turn by improving the Dhatu Poshana e.g. Dugdha, Ghrita, etc. By improving the Agni Vyapara (digestion) in the body, there by responsible for proper Dhatunirmana (assimilation) in the body like Chitraka, Bhallataka etc. By in the body, this improves Dhatu Poshana Kriya ( supply of nutritional contents up to the cellular level ) like Guggulu. The prescribed procedure include not only drugs but also daily routine including exercise, diet and nutrition beside mental attitude and discipline one of the therapeutic strategies. Ayurvedic medicine is to increase body's natural resistance to the disease causing agent rather than directly neutralizing the agent itself. CONCLUSION Children are more vulnerable to infection because their immune system is less or under developed. During this period our attempt should be specified to prevention of diseases and to enhance physical, mental and social well-being of children. Ayurveda provides concept of Lehana and Rasayana which can help in prevention of recurrent infections and also provides nutritional supplements which are necessary for proper physical and mental growth of a child. If the Rasayan and Lehana drugs used in appropriate dose with suitable vehicle ( Anupan/Sahapan ) there is no adverse effect reported till now. If the Rasayana and Lehana concept could be jointly run with National Nutritional Programme and other national programmes for the children .By all means we can get better result by means of their better growth, development and eradication of infective diseases.
