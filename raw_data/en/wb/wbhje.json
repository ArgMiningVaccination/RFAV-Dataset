Many terms are used to describe natural medicine, including integrative medicine, holistic medicine, and alternative medicine. But the reality is this can be the way you choose to remain healthy by preventing illness from happening in the first place through your lifestyle and health choices. Natural medicine promotes health rather than treating illnesses. The goal is to restore and maintain health through a combination of nutrition, stress relief, and bodily balance. We use a variety of therapies to achieve the goal of optimal health, including: [Acupuncture](https://www.alternativewholistichealth.com/acupuncture) [Chiropractic](https://www.alternativewholistichealth.com/chiropractic) - Herbology - Homeopathy - Naturopathic [Nutritional](https://www.alternativewholistichealth.com/clinical-nutrition) Acupuncture Acupuncture is the balancing of energy within the body. It is an ancient Chinese technique that uses needles to make sure that the chi is flowing unimpeded through the meridians in the body. Dr. Badanek uses laser and electric pulses as well as needles to help with pain as well as to promote wellness. Chiropractic Chiropractic uses many different therapies to help promote health and to help with pain. The primary treatment is spinal adjustment, which is a hands-on technique that allows the chiropractor to make minor adjustments to the vertebrae in the back and neck. When the spine is out of alignment, the messages from the brain can't get through and this leads to many health issues. Herbology Herbology is the study of plants and their use to treat conditions and to promote health. Herbs have been used medically in many cultures for thousands of years and some of the most successful drugs we have today had their beginnings in herbal remedies. Homeopathy Homeopathy is a form of medical treatment founded around the belief that the body has an amazing ability to heal itself. It uses herbs and minerals to achieve wellness and maintain it. Naturopathic Naturopathic medicine is a form of medicine that emphasizes a healthy lifestyle. The body is treated as a whole with all parts of it contributing to overall wellness, including spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical. Nutritional You are what you eat, but also what you absorb. By adding what is missing from your food in the form of vitamins, minerals, and enzymes, we can help you better digest essential nutrients. Rather than treating illness, the idea is to avoid illness by promoting health. To find out more about naturopathic medicine, call Dr. Badanek of Alternative Holistic Health in "}
