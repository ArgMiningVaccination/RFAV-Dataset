These results often happen quickly and do not generally require medical prescriptions for continued relief. Allergy Desensitization Our doctors at Specialty Natural Medicine have been successfully treating allergy related conditions to foods, inhalants, chemicals and auto immune triggered disorders for years. Learn how Low Dose Allergy Immunotherapy (LDA) can have you breathing free! Weight Loss Injections Semaglutide or Tirzepatide injections help curb food cravings by triggering the \"I'm full\" feeling. Along with lifestyle changes, these weight loss injections have proven to have dramatic results in sustained reduction of weight and waist size. Toxic Mold Many chronic illnesses can occur as the result of toxic molds. Molds release toxins that we can breathe in. These toxins, once trapped in our bodies cause mysterious symptoms from headaches, depression, anxiety, vomiting, fatigue, body aches, pains and rashes. They are now considered to be the underlying reason for fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Mold toxins can impair our immune system, neurological system, endocrine system and act as carcinogens. Mold toxins can contribute to auto-immune disease and can increase the histamine response in the body, increasing allergies or even histamine intolerance states. Mold toxins are now highly correlated with aging brain disorders including dementia and memory loss. Removing mold toxins from the body and regaining health is imperative to symptom resolution, however the approach is unique for individuals based on their history and sensitivity levels. Dr Janel has had extensive training in toxic mold illness and has worked with many patients to remove mycotoxins and resolve chronic symptoms Marcons: Chronic Sinus Problems Marcons is an abbreviation for Multiple Antibiotic Resistant Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus. You may have heard of MRSA which is an abbreviation for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus. Marcons can be resistant to methicillin and many other antibiotics. Marcons overgrow as a chronic infection for patients with toxic mold illness. They impair the immune system function and cause repeated sinus infections. A special lab test can be done with a swab to test for Marcons and for Fungal overgrowth in the nose and sinuses. We can then formulate a treatment specific for the antibiotic resistance and use it to directly wash the nose and sinuses and remove the infection. Since we began using this test and treatment, we rarely see patients with repeat or ongoing sinus infections. IV Therapy Intravenous Therapy is a procedure that uses an intravenous drip to infuse essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids directly into the body. This allows higher levels of nutrients to be introduced into the body than is possible via oral vitamins or supplements. It can be used to treat acute conditions such as colds, flu, dehydration, or shingles, or to help with fatigue and overall immune support. Biopuncture for Pain Management Biopuncture or Neural Therapy Treatment is the injection of tiny amounts of homeopathic formulas into the tissue. This can relieve areas of chronic or acute pain, release trigger points and repair damage. It can often provide permanent relief. Biopuncture is a treatment for arthritis, muscle and body pains, nerve compression, disc herniations, headaches, injuries and other chronic or acute pain conditions. Family Medicine and Primary Care Our doctors are trained as and are considered primary care physicians in the state of Washington. We are able to perform annual physical exams, order labs, order recommended screenings (such as mammograms and colonoscopies) and both physicians perform paps in office. Our annual lab testing is typically more comprehensive than standard annual exams so we often catch potential health concerns earlier than conventional physicians. Thyroid Care Fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, and hair loss are all symptoms of thyroid function issues. Find out from our Naturopaths if your thyroid is functioning correctly and how to help your body heal itself! Hormone Pellet Therapy The doctors at Specialty Natural Medicine use the convenience of intradermal pellets for our patients as an alternative to the daily use of creams and pills. Hormone pellet therapy has been safely practiced for over 50 years. Intradermal pellets are inserted in the adipose (fat) tissue and are undetectable once inserted with the exception of a small incision which will heal in a matter of days. "}
