Then, we will go into the meditation, where everyone will receive the same acupuncture points (*participants have the option of doing acupressure (no needles) instead of acupuncture). This enables us to meditate with the archetypes of the selected acupuncture points as a group. Participants will have the opportunity to explore the interwoven relationships between these energies within themselves. The experience may be similar to an herbal meditation. At the end of the meditation, everyone will have an opportunity to share their experience with the group and Melanie will talk about the deeper meaning behind the points along with any underlying themes that surface during the evening. We will finish with an informal sharing of tea (appropriate for evening time) and participants can depart at their leisure or go for a discounted soak & sauna session. **Participants are invited to bring any desired creature comforts for the meditation, such as blankets, pillows, and/or towels. There are group acupuncture chairs, blankets, and cushions available for use in the space. Acupuncture treatment in a group setting: The Acupuncture points will be located on the head, neck, upper chest above the shirt line, arms (below the elbow), and legs (below the knees). It is suggested to wear comfortable and somewhat loose fitting clothes so the neck, arms (below the elbows), and legs (below the knees) can be easily accessed. Include a discounted soak & sauna session: Enjoy a 60 minute soak and sauna session before or after the meditation for a discounted rate of $13. ~Opportunities available to join a regular biweekly or monthly group!
