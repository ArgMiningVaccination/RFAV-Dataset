As such, the system considers the whole person, not only their symptoms, aiming to address the root cause of the ailment or disease. The approach relies on the principle that \"like cures like\". In other words, the concept suggests that the same ingredients and substances that create adverse symptoms can help relieve these symptoms in affected people. So, for example, the same compound in onions (Allium cepa) that causes eyes to burn and water can be used in tiny doses to help alleviate streaming eyes and a runny nose. Homeopathic medicines are derived from plants such as arnica, onions, belladonna, and nettle, animals such as bees, and minerals, such as arsenic. While essential oils are typically associated with a different alternative medicine modality - aromatherapy (which uses aroma therapeutically), practitioners also use them in conjunction with homeopathy for synergistic outcomes. What Are Essential Oils? Essential oils used in aromatherapy are aromatic plant compounds - plant extracts isolated from different plant parts, including seeds, leaves, flowers, roots, and resins. Each oil offers a unique combination of pharmacologically active ingredients with various uses and potential benefits for physical, mental, and emotional soundness. Used for millennia across Egypt, China, Greece, India, and elsewhere, essential oils have been increasingly researched with reliable science validating the value of the compounds. For example, ginger can help ease inflammation, swelling, and pain, while orange oil offers a mood-enhancing and calming benefit. Used in aromatherapy, essential oils are applied topically, massaged, or inhaled. The Use of Essential Oils in Homeopathy Traditionally, homeopathy advocates avoiding anything with a strong scent when using homeopathic medicines, as these were historically thought to negatively impact or disrupt efficacy - essentially representing an antidote to the treatment. By this rationale, using essential oils in conjunction with homeopathy would not be recommended. However, as research findings and insights have expanded, essential oils have mostly been exonerated as antidotes, encouraging homeopaths to confidently use these potent natural substances as part of a safe and effective treatment protocol. For example, the homeopathic use of chamomile is more effective when combined with the topical use of Roman [Chamomile](https://www.adv-bio.com/chamomile-extract-natural-6146/) essential oil when helping to address teething issues and pain. Hence, a combination approach is welcomed by modern-day homeopaths also schooled in aromatherapy and potential interactions. Essential oils can be a single chemical entity or an aromatic composite, including [tea tree](https://www.adv-bio.com/tea-tree-oil-natural-3037/), [sweet almond](https://www.adv-bio.com/sweet-almond-oil-natural-3021/), [lemongrass](https://www.adv-bio.com/lemongrass-extract-natural-6180/), [lavender](https://www.adv-bio.com/lavender-essence-natural-6227/), and [rose](https://www.adv-bio.com/bulgarian-rose-oil-type-natural-3003/). To ensure products work as they should for the desired outcome, the following considerations apply: - Always open homeopathic formulations in an area away from and free from strong aromatics; for example, avoid the kitchen, bathroom, essential oils, and candles. - To be safe, wait for one to two hours before applying the essential oils. - Only use both modalities together under the guidance and supervision of a certified practitioner. In addition, to take optimal advantage of the synergistic benefits of homeopathy and aromatherapy, practitioners must rely on high-quality oils formulated from reliably certified natural sources using advanced industry-approved techniques, technology, and tools. This type of purity ensures that the unique essence of the source botanical is available in the oil, free from impurities, and as intensely concentrated as possible for maximum potential benefit.
