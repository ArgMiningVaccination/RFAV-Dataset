Va meldingen van 3 of 82 Abstract Adverse Events Following Immunisation under the National Vaccination Programme of the Netherlands Number XIII- Reports in 2006 Adverse events following immunisation (AEF I) in the National Vaccination Programme of the Netherlands (RVP) have been monitore d through an enhanced passive surveillance system by RIVM since 1962. From 1984 until 2003 evaluation has been done in close collaboration with the Health Council. An RIVM expert panel continue d the reassessment of selected adverse events from 2004 onwards. Repor ts were received mainly from Child Health Care professionals, primarily by telephone thro ugh the operating servic e for information and advice on vaccines and vaccinations . Further data have been ob tained, if necessary, from parents, general practitioners, paediatricians and other prof essionals. After supplementation and verification of data a (worki ng) diagnosis is made and causa lity assessed. In this annual report on 2006 an overview of all reported AEFI is presented with classification according to case definitions and causality. Trend analysis , reporting bias, bac kground rates of specific events and possible pathophysiology of symp toms are discussed. On a total of over 1.4 million vaccination dates 1159 AEFI were re ported. Of these, 2 were unclassifiable because of insufficient information. In 76% (875) of the classifiable events a possible causal relation with vaccination was es tablished. These concerned majo r adverse reactions in 51% and minor adverse reactions in 49% of the repor ts. Of the reported adverse events 24% (282) were considered chance occurrences. Compared to 2005 there was an increase in number of reports, probably due to reduced underreporting. Perhaps the phased in troduction of a DTP- IPV-Hib vaccine with five pertussis compone nts was of some importance. The uptake of Pneumococcal vaccination in the programme, simultaneously administered with DTP-IPV- Hib vaccine, had little influence on this incr ease. The Netherlands Vaccination Programme has a very favourable risk balance.

RIVM report page 11 of 82 Summary Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEF I) under the National Va ccination Programme (RVP) of the Netherlands has been monitored by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) since 1962. From 1984 until 2003 evaluation has been done in close collaboration with the H ealth Council (GR). An RIVM expert panel continued the reassessment of selected adverse events fr om 2004 onwards. The 24h-telephone service for reporting and consultation is an important tool for this enhanced passive surveillance system. RIVM reports fully, on all incoming reports in a calendar year, irrespec tive of causal relation, since 1994. This report on 2006 is th e thirteenth annual report. The majority of reports (90%) came in by teleph one. Child Health Clinic staffs are the main reporters (77%). Parents, GP's and/or hospital provided additi onal data on request (88%). RIVM made a (working) diagnosis and a ssessed causality after supplementation and verification of data. The assessment has been communicated to the re porter, usually by phone (93%). Written assessments of selected more se rious or complicated events, were sent to all medical professionals involved. In 2006, on a total of over 1.4 million vaccination dates, 1159 AEFI were submitted, concerning 1059 children. Of these only two we re not classifiable because of missing information. Of the classifiable events 875 ( 76%) were judged to be possibly, probably or definitely causally related with the vaccination (adverse r eactions) and 282 (24%) were considered coincidental events. So-called \"minor\" local, skin or systemic even ts were assessed in 574 cases with 409 reports (71%) classified as possible adverse reactions. The so-called \"major\" adverse events, grouped unde r fits, faints, discoloured legs, persistent screaming, major-illness, encephalopathy and deat h (with inclusion of some local reactions) occurred in 585 cases. In 80% (466) these we re considered possibl e adverse reactions. Discoloured legs were reporte d 124 times with possible causa l relation in all but five. Collapse, including atypical a nd incomplete episodes, was diagnosed 76 times, in only 16 cases without causal relation. Eleven breath holding spells were re ported, in eight with inferred causality and 82 times fainting in older children. Convulsions were diagnosed in 63 cases, in all but 6 with fever. Of the convulsions 45 were considered causally related. Atypical attack ( 19) had possible causal relation in 10 of cases. Epilepsy (3) was considered not causally relate d with the vaccinations in all instances. Of persistent screaming 57 out of 61 repor ts were considered adverse reactions. Fever of > 40.5\u00b0C was the working diagnosis in 53 re ports of the major-illness group, in all but 9 with inferred causality. Of the other 58 major-illness cases 22 had a possible causal relation. These events were \"vaccinitis\" (12) all with very high fever (> 40.5oC), ITP (5), arthritis/osteomyelitis (3), apnoea (1) and chills (1). There were 6 abscesses, all occurring after DTP-IPV-Hib. One culture was positive for Haemolytic Streptococcus group A. page 12 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 One case of encephalopathy /-itis was repor ted in 2006, not induced by the vaccination but considered coincidental. In 2006 all six reported deaths were cons idered chance occurre nces after thorough assessment. Four children were examined post mortem. One child had myocarditis, one child was known with a metabolic disorder and an in fection may be have been fatale. One child had a congenital heart anomaly, but obduction s howed no cause of death. One child is diagnosed as SIDS. Of the other two children one died of ARDS and one was diagnosed as clinical SIDS because no autopsy was perfor med and there was no plausible explanation for diagnosed as death. Most frequently (736) reports involved si multaneous vaccinations against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio (DPTP) and Haemophilus type b infections (Hib). Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was involved 310 times, 290 times with simultaneous other vaccines. In 74% of these re ports there was possible causal relation with the vaccination(s). For the other vaccine combinations this percentage was 76%. In 2006 the number of reports increased compared to 2005. This was probably due to reduced underreporting. Perhaps the phased introduction of a DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine with five pertussis components was of some importance. The addition of the Pneumococcal vaccine to the programme, simultaneously administered w ith DTP-IPV-Hib in infants, had little influence on this rise. The total of 1159 reports should be weighted against the large number of vaccines administered, with over 1.4 m illion vaccination dates and near ly seven million vaccine components. The risk balance greatly favours th e continuation of the vaccination programme. RIVM report 240071004 page 13 of 82 1 Introduction Identification, registration, and assessment of adverse events following drug-use are important aspects of post marke ting surveillance. Safety surve illance is even more important in the programmatic use of pr eventive interventions, esp ecially when young children are involved. In the Netherlands the National Instit ute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has the task to m onitor adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) under the National Vaccination Programme (RVP). This pr ogramme started in 195 7 with adoption of a passive safety surveillance system in 1962. Since 1994 RIVM has reported annually on adve rse events. These annua l reports are based on the year of notification. They include all re ported events, irrespec tive of severity of symptoms or causal relationship with the vaccination. Reported events are ordered by nature and severity of the symptoms and by causal rela tion. The present report contains a description of the procedures for soliciting notifications, verification of symptoms , diagnosis according to case definitions, and causality assessment fo r 2006. It also includes a description of the background, organisation and pr ocedures of the National Va ccination Programme and the embedding in the Child Health Care System (JGZ). We will discuss the effect of the introducti on of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), simultaneously administered with an acellula r DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine for infants born from April 2006 onwards. For children offering HepB vaccination a hexavalent DTP-IPV-Hib-Hep was implemented at all time intervals to avoi d giving three vaccinations at the same time. This resulted in an extra dose for HepB. Halfway 2006 an acellular DTP-IPV vaccine replaced the separate vaccinati ons of DT-IPV and aP at four years of age. Reports in the current year have been carefully monito red for unexpected, unknown, new severe or particular adverse events and to changes in trends and severity. In the present report we will go into the number of reports and the different aspects of the nature of the reported adverse events in 2006 and compare them with previous years. This thirteenth RIVM report on adverse events is only issued in English. The summary and aggregated tables will be posted on the RVP website, www.rvp.nl . page 14 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 RIVM report 240071004 page 15 of 82 2 The Netherlands Vaccination Programme 2.1 Vaccines and schedule In the Netherlands mass vaccinations of childre n were undertaken since 1952, with institution of the National Vaccination Programme (RVP) in 1957. For the current schedule see Box 1. From the start all vaccinations covered, were fr ee of charge and have never been mandatory. Box 1. Schedule of the National Vaccinati on Programme of the Netherlands in 2006 At birth HepB0a 2 months DTP-IPV-Hib1(+HepB1) + PCV7 1b 3 MenC DT-IPV5 + aP 9 years DT-IPV6 + MMR2 a = for children born from HepB carrier mothers from 1 January 2006 b = for children born from April first 2006 c = halfway 2006 DTP-IPV In the year under report the pneumoc occal conjugate vaccine was introduced. 1 HepB vaccination is only offered to children of parents native from countries with moderate and high risk of hepatitis B carriage and to children of HBsAg positive mothers. 2 For this last group an additional neonatal HepB vaccination was introduced. To avoid three vaccinations at the same time, children offering HepB are vaccinated with DTP-IPV-Hib-HepB at 2, 3, 4 and 11 months. BCG vaccination is not included in the RVP. Vaccination is howev er offered free of charge to children with higher risk of acquiring tube rculosis when travelling to or staying in countries with a high prevalence. Usually BCG vaccination takes plac e in the second half- year of life. 3 Children of refugees and those awaiting political asylum have an accelerated schedule for MMR and catch up doses up till the age of 19 years. 3 For the RVP the age limit is 13 years. Vaccines for the RVP are supplied by NVI and ar e kept in depot at a regional level at the Provincial Immunisation Administration (PEA). 3,4 The PEA is responsible for further distribution to the providers. It also has the task to implement and monitor cold chain procedures at the Child Health Clinics (CB) and Municipal Health Services (GGD). The Medical Consultant of the PEA (MAE) pr omotes and guards programme adherence. The databases of the PEA contain name, sex, address and birth date of all children up till 13 years of age. The databases are linked w ith the municipal population registers and are updated regularly or on line, for birth, death and migration. All administered vaccinations are entered in the databases of the PEA on individual level. page 16 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 Summarised product characteristics of all used vaccines in 2006 are in Appendix 2 and full documents at www.cbg-meb.nl . 2.2 Child Health Care system The Child Health Care system (JGZ) aims to enrol all children living in the Netherlands. Child Health Care in the Netherlands is programmatic, following national guidelines with emphasis on age-specific items and uniform regi stration on the patient charts, up till the age of 18 years. 5 Up till four years of age (pre school) children attend the Child Health Clinic (CB) regularly. During these visits physical check-ups are performed. These include full medical history and growth and developmental screening at appropriate ages and tests for vision and hearing. The child is seen depending on age specific problems. At school entry the Municipal Health Service (GGD) takes over. From then on the Child Heal th Care gets a more population-based approach, with sp ecial attention to risk gro ups and fewer individual check- ups. The RVP is fully embedded in the Child Heal th Care system and vaccinations are given during the routine visits. Good professional stan dards include asking explicitly after adverse events following vaccination at the next visit an d before administration of the next dose. The four-year booster shot with DT-IPV and aP is us ually given at the last CB visit, before school entrance. Booster vaccination with DT-IPV and MMR at nine years of age is organised in mass vaccination settings. Attendance of Child Health Clin ics is very high, up to 99% a nd vaccination coverage for the primary series DTP-IPV-Hib is ove r 97% and slightly lower for MMR 6,7,8,9,10 (Accurate numbers on birth cohort 2003-2005 have not been released as yet). 2.3 Safety surveillance The surveillance of the RVP is an acknowledged task of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM): both sa fety surveillance and surveillance of effectiveness are performed by Epidemiology a nd Surveillance (EPI), independently from vaccine manufacturers. 11 EPI is part of the Centre for In fectious Disease Control (CIb) of RIVM. Requirements for Post Marketing Surveillance of adverse events have been stipulated in Dutch and European guidelines and legislation. 12,13 The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises on monitoring of adverse events follo wing immunisations (AEF I) against the target diseases of the Expanded Programme on Im munisation (EPI) and on implementation of safety surveillance in the monito ring of immunisation programmes. 14 The WHO keeps a register of adverse reactions as part of the global drug-monitoring programme. 15 Currently RIVM report 240071004 page 17 of 82 there are several international pr ojects to achieve increased qual ity of safety surveillance and to establish a register specifically fo r vaccines and vaccination programmes. 16,17,18 Close evaluation of the safety of vaccines is of special importance for maintaining public confidence in the vaccination programme as well as maintaining motivation and confidence of the health care providers. With the successful prevention of the target diseases, the perceived side effects of vaccines gain in importance. 19,20 Not only true side effects but also events with only temporal association with vaccination may jeopardise uptake of the vaccination programme. 21 This has been exemplified in Sweden, in the United Kingdom and in Japan in the seventies and eighties of the last century. Commotion about assumed neurological side effects caused a steep declin e in vaccination coverage of pertussis vaccine and resulted in a subsequent ri se of pertussis incidence with dozens of deaths and hundreds of children with severe and lasting sequelae of pert ussis infection. 22 Also in Eastern Europe the diphtheria epidemics are (mainly) the result of anxiety about safety of vaccination (procedures). 23 But also recently concerns about safety rather than actual ca usal associations caused cessation of the hepati tis B programme in France. 24,25 Even at this moment the uptake of MMR in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland is very much under pressure because of unfounded allegations about asso ciation of the vaccine with autism and inflammatory bowel disease. 19,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34 Subsequent (local) measles epidemics have occurred. 35,36,37,38 In the Netherlands the basis for the safety su rveillance is an enhanced passive reporting system, based on a telephone service. Profe ssionals call for consu ltation and advice on vaccination matters like schedules, contra-indi cations, precautions and adverse events. Reporting can also be done by regular mail, fax or e-mail. The annually distributed vaccination programme (Appendix 1) encourages Health Care providers to report adverse events to RIVM, giving addre ss, telephone number, fax number and email address. Most municipal and regional Child Health organisa tions, which provide the vast majority of vaccinations, have explicit guidelines for notifying AE to RIVM. RIVM promotes reporting thr ough information, education and pub lications. Feedback to the reporter of AE and other involve d professionals has been an im portant tool in keeping the reporting rate at high levels. Any severe event, irrespectiv e of assumed causality and me dical intervention, is to be reported. Furthermore peculiar, uncommon or unexp ected events and events that give rise to apprehension in parents and providers or to adverse publicity are also reportable. Events resulting in deferral or cessation of further vaccinations are considered as serious and therefore should be reported as well (see Box 2). Vaccine failures may result from programmatic errors and professionals are therefore invited to report these also. Box 2. Reporting criteria for AEFI under the National Vaccination Programme - serious events - uncommon events - symptoms affecting subsequent vaccinations - symptoms leading to public anxiety or concern page 18 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 All notifications are acc epted, registered and assessed by RIVM, irrespective of nature and severity of symptoms, diagnoses or time inte rval. No discrimination is made for formal reports or for consultations regarding adve rse events. See for detailed description on procedures chapter 3. Aggregated analysis of all reported adverse events is published annually by RIVM. Signals may lead to specific follow up and system atic study of selected adverse events. 39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51 These reports support a better u nderstanding of pathogenesis and risk factors of specific adverse reactions. In turn, this may lead to changes in the vaccine or vaccination procedures or schedules and adjustme nt of precautions and contra-indications and improved management of adverse events. The an nual reports may also serve for the purpose of public accountability for the safety of the programme. 52 RIVM report 240071004 page 19 of 82 3 Materials and methods 3.1 Post vaccination events Events following immunisations do not necessarily have causal relation with vaccination. Some have temporal association only a nd are in fact merely coincidental. 19,20,4 Therefore the neutral term adverse event is us ed to describe potential side e ffects. In this report the word \"notification\" designates all ad verse events reported to us. We accept and record all notified events; generally only events within 28 days of vaccination are regard ed as potential side effects for killed or inactivated vaccines and for live vaccines this risk window is six weeks. For some disease entities a longer risk period seems reasonable. Following are some definitions used in this report: Vaccine : immuno-biologic product meant for activ e immunisation against one or more diseases. Vaccination : all activities necessary for vaccine administration. Post vaccination event or Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) : neutral term for unwanted, undesirable, unfavourable or adve rse symptoms within certain time limits after vaccination irrespec tive of causal relation. Side effects or adverse reaction (AR) : adverse event with presumed, supposed or assessed causal relation with vaccination. Adverse events are thus divided in coincidental events and genui ne side effects. Side effects are further subdivided in vaccine or vaccination intrinsic reac tions, vaccine or vaccination potentiated events, and side effects th rough programmatic errors (see Box 3). 3,39,53,54 Box 3. Origin / Subdivision of adverse events by mechanism a- Vaccine or vaccination intrinsic r eactions are caused by va ccine constituents or by vaccination procedures; Examples are fever, local inflammation and crying. b- Vaccine or vaccination potentiated events are brought about in children with a special predisposition or risk factor. For instance, febrile convulsions. c- Programmatic errors are due to faulty pr ocedures; for example the use of non-sterile materials. Loss of effectiveness due to faulty procedures may also be seen as adverse event. d- Chance occurrences or coincidental events have temporal relationship with the vaccinat ion but no causal relation. These events are of course most variable and tend to be age-specific common events. 3.2 Notifications All incoming information on adverse events following immunisations (AEFI) under the RVP, whether intended reports or requests for consultation about cases are regarded as page 20 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 notifications. In this sense also events that co me from medical journals or lay press may be taken in if the reporting criter ia apply (Box 2). The same applies for events from active studies. All notifications are r ecorded on individual level. Notifications are subdivided in single, multiple and compound reports (Box 4). Most notifications concern events following just one vaccination date. These are filed as single reports. If the notification concerns more than one distinct event with severe or peculiar symptoms, classification occurs for each event separately (see also paragraph 4.3). These reports are termed compound . If the notification is about differe nt vaccination dates, the report is classified under the most appropriate vaccinati on date, as single if the events concerned consist of only minor local or systemic symp toms. If however there are severe or peculiar symptoms following different dates of vaccinations then the report is multiple and each date is booked separately in the relevant categories. If notifications on different vaccinations of the same child are time spaced, the events are treated as distinct reports irre spective of nature and severity of symptoms: this is also a multiple report. Notifications concern just one person with very few exceptions. In case of cluster notifications special procedures are followed because of the potential of signal/hazard de tection. If assessed as non-important, minor symptoms or unrelated minor events, cluster no tifications are booked as one single report. In case of severe events the original cluster notification will, afte r follow-up, be booked as separate reports and are thus booked as se veral single, multiple or compound reports. Box 4. Subdivision of notifications of ad verse events following vaccinations single reports concern one vaccination date have only minor symptoms and/or one distinct severe event compound reports concern one vaccination date have more than one distinct severe event multiple reports concern more than one vaccination date have one or more distinct severe event following each date or are notified separately for each date cluster reports single, multiple or compound group of notifications on one vaccination date and/or one set of vaccines or badges or one age group or one provider or area 3.3 Reporters and information sources The first person to notify RIVM about an adverse event is considered to be the reporter. All others contacted are \"informers\". 3.4 Additional information In the first notifying telephone cal l with the reporter we try to obtain all necessary data on vaccines, symptoms, circumstances and medical history. Thereafter physicians review the RIVM report 240071004 page 21 of 82 incoming notifications. The data are verified and the need for additional information is determined. As is often the case, appreh ension, conflicting or missing data, makes it necessary to take a full history from the parent s with a detailed desc ription of the adverse event and circumstances. Furthermore the involved GP or hospital is co ntacted to verify symptoms or in case of incomplete records or severe, complex or difficult to interpret events. 3.5 Working diagnosis and event categories After verification and completion of data a diag nosis is made. If symptoms do not fulfil the criteria for a specific diagnosis, a working di agnosis is made based on the most important symptoms. Also the severity of the event, the duration of the symptoms and the time interval with the vaccination are determined as precisely as possible. Case definitions are used for the most common adverse events and for other diag noses current medical standards are used. For the annual report the (wor king) diagnoses are classified under one of the ten different categories listed and clarified below (Box 5). Some categories are s ubdivided in minor and major according to the severity of symptoms. Ma jor is not the same as medically serious or severe, but this group does contain the severe events. Definitions for Serious Adverse Events (SAE) by EMEA and ICH differ from the criteria for major in this report. Local (inflammatory) symptoms : consist of inflammatory symptoms and other signs around the injection sites which ar e classified as minor if they are not extensive and are of limited duration. Atypical or unusual mild or mode rate symptoms at the injection site are included in this category. Inflammation that is very extensive or extremely prolonged will be listed under major-local re actions, as well as abscess or erysipelas. In cases with accompanying systemic symptoms, the event is only booked in this category if local symptoms prevail or are considered major. General illness : includes all events that cannot be specifically categorised in the other event categories. For instance fever, respirat ory or gastric-intestinal symptoms, crying, irritability, change in sleepi ng pattern or feeding behaviour, upper airway symptoms, rash illness, etceteras, fall under this category. Mild or moderate symptoms are listed under minor general illness, severe symptoms unde r major general illness. Fever of 40.5\u00b0C and over is listed, by consent, as major general illness, except if associated with febrile convulsion or as part of a nother specific event. Persistent screaming: (sudden) screaming, non-consolable and lasting for three hours or more, without one of the other specific di agnostic groups being applicable. This is considered a major event. General skin symptoms : skin symptoms that are not part of general (rash) illness and not considered extensions of a local reaction fa ll in this category. Like exanthema or other rashes as erythema, urticaria, that are not restricted to th e injection site. Circumscript lesions distant from the injection site ar e included and the harlequin syndrome is booked page 22 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 under skin symptoms as well. Some mild syst emic symptoms may be present. Subdivision is made according to severity in minor and major if applicable. Discoloured legs : symptoms are diffuse or patchy disc oloration of the leg(s) and/or leg petechiae, with or without swelling. Extensiv e local reactions are not included. By consent discoloured legs is a major adverse event. Faints : collapse reactions (HHE, hypotonic hypore sponsive episode), a sudden pallor, loss of consciousness and loss of muscle tone are included unless these symptoms are explicable as post-ictal state or part of a nother disease entity. If symptoms are incomplete or atypical this is added as an annotation. In collapse followi ng fierce crying that suddenly stops with or without the clear-cut breath hol ding phase, specific annotation will be made too. In case of classical breath holding spell with no or very short period of pallor this event will be listed under faints as a separate group. Fainting in older children is listed as a separate group within this category also. Ju st pallor or apathy or prolonged sleeping or limpness only is not considered collapse reac tion and are grouped unde r general illness. Fits: convulsions are all episodes with tonic and/or clonic muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. There is discrimination by body temperature in non-febrile and febrile convulsions. If fever is > 38.5\u00b0C it is booked as febrile convul sion unless the convulsion is symptomatic for meningitis or for other illness. Febrile seizures of more than 15 minutes or asymmetrical or recurring within 24 hours are complex as opposed to simple (classic). Definite epileptic fits or epilepsy are include d in this category als o. Unspecifiable atypical attacks are a separate gro up under fits. These are paroxys mal occurrences without the specific criteria for collapse or convulsions or could not be diagnosed definitely as chills or myoclonics e.g. Nocturnal myoclonics are not included, neither are episodes of irritability, jitteriness or chills; these are grouped under general illness. Encephalitis or encephalopathy : children younger than 24 m onths with encephalopathy have an explicit or marked loss of conscious ness for at least 24 hours which is not caused by intoxication and not explicable as post-ictal state. In child ren older than 24 months at least 2 of the 3 following criteria must be fulfilled: - change in mental status like disorientation, delirium or ps ychosis not caused by drugs; - marked decrease in consciousness not caused by seizures or medication; - seizures with (long lasting) loss of consciousness. Also signs of increased intra-cranial pressure may be present. In encephalitis, apart from the symptoms of encephalopathy there are a dditional signs of inflammation as fever and elevated cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid. Anaphylactic shock: circulatory insufficiency with hypotension and life threatening hypoperfusion of vital organs with or wit hout laryngeal oedema or bronchospasm. This reaction should be in close temporal relation wi th intake of an alle rgen and with type I allergic mechanism involved. Urticaria or wheezing alone is not included. Death: all reported children who died followi ng immunisation are in cluded in this category and not under one of th e other listed categories. RIVM report 240071004 page 23 of 82 Box 5. Main event categories with subdivision according to severity local reaction minor mild or moderate injection site inflammation or other local symptoms major severe or prolonged local symptoms or abscess general illness minor mild or moderate general illness not included in the other specific categories major severe general illness, not included in the listed specific categories persistent screaming major inconsolable crying for 3 or more hours on end general skin symptoms minor skin symptoms not attributable to systemic disease or local reaction major severe skin symptoms or skin disease discoloured legs major disease entity with di ffuse or patchy discoloration of legs not restricted to injection site and/or leg petechiae faints major collapse with pallor or cyanosis, limpness and loss of consciousness; included are also fainting and breath holding spells. fits major seizures with or without fever, epilepsy or atypical attacks that could have been seizures encephalitis/encephalopathy major stupor, coma or abnormal mental status for more than 24 hours not attributable to drugs, intoxication or post-ictal state, with or without markers for cerebral inflammation (age dependent) anaphylactic shock major life threatening circul atory insufficiency in close connection with intake of allergen, with or without laryngeal oedema or bronchospasm. death major any death following v accination irrespective of cause 3.6 Causality assessment Once it is clear what exactly happened and when, and predisposing factors and underlying disease and circumstances have been establishe d, causality will be a ssessed. This requires adequate knowledge of epidemiology, child health, immunology, vaccinology, aetiology and differential diagnoses in paediatrics. Box 6. Points of consideration in appraisals of causality of AEFI - diagnosis with severity and duration - time interval - biologic plausibility - specificity of symptoms - indications of other causes - proof of vaccine causation - underlying illness or concomitant health problems The nature of the vaccine and its constituents determine which side effects it may have and after how much time they occur. For differe nt (nature of) side effects different time limits/risk windows may be applied. Causal relati on will then be appraised on the basis of a checklist, resulting in an indication of the probabi lity/likelihood that the vaccine is indeed the page 24 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 cause of the event. This list is not (to be) used as an algorithm a lthough there are rules and limits for each point of consideration (Box 6). After establishing to what extent the vaccine or vaccination has contributed to the event, its causality will be classified under one of th e five listed differe nt categories (Box 7). Certain (conclusive, convincing, definite), if the v accine is proven to be the cause or if other causes are ruled out definitely; there should be a high specificity of the symptoms and a fitting interval. Probable causal relation, if there are no signs of other causes, there is a fitting interval and a satisfactory biologi c plausibility of vaccine/vacci nation as cause of the event. If, however, other possible causes exist or the time interval is only just outside the acceptable limits or symptoms are rather unspeci fic causal relation is classified as possible . If a certain, probable or possible causal relation is established, the event is classified as adverse reaction or side effect. Box 7. Criteria for causalit y categorisation of AEFI 1-Certain involvement of vaccine vacci nation is conclusive through laboratory proof or mono-specificity of the symptoms and a proper time interval 2-Probable involvement of the vaccine is acceptable with high biologic plausibility and fitting interval w ithout indication of other causes 3-Possible involvement of the vaccine is conceivable, because of the interval and the biologic plausibility but other cause are as well plausible/possible 4-Improbable other causes are established or plausible with the given interval and diagnosis 5-Unclassifiable the data are insufficient for diagnosis and/or causality assessment If causal relation is considered (highly) improbable there is implausible temporal relation or established other cause of the event. The event is then considered coincidental or chance occurrence. This category in cludes also events without any causal relation with the vaccination. If data are insuffici ent for a (working) diagnosis and causality assessment, the event is listed under unclassifiable . Generally it is evaluated as well, to what exte nd the vaccine or vaccination has contributed to the event and how. This is espe cially important in case faulty procedures are involved or individual risk factors exist. This may have im plications for management of side effects or contraindications. See also paragraph 3.1 and Box 3. By design of the RVP most vaccinations cont ain multiple antigens and single mono-vaccines are rarely administered. Therefore, even in case of assumed causalit y, attribution of the adverse events to a specific v accine component or antigen may be difficult if not impossible. Sometimes, with simultaneous administration of a dead and a live vaccine, attribution may be possible because of the different time intervals involved. RIVM report 240071004 page 25 of 82 3.7 Recording, filing and feedback Symptoms, (working) diagnosis, event category and assessed cau sal relation are recorded in the notification file together with all other in formation about the child, as medical history or discharge letters. All notifica tions are, after completion of assessment and feedback, coded on a structured form. If there is new follow-up in formation or scientific knowledge changes, the case is reassessed and depending on the inform ation, the original categorisation may be adapted. Mostly information on the likelihood of a cau sal relation is given during the notifying telephone call or a later feedback call. Severe and otherwise important adverse events as peculiarity or public unrest may be put down in a formal written assessment and sent as feedback to the notifying physicia n and other involved medical prof essionals. This is done to ascertain that everyone involved gets the sa me information and to make the assessment (procedure) transparent. This document is file d together with the ot her information on the case. 3.8 Annual reports and aggr egated analysis The coded forms are used as data sheets for the annual reports. Coding is done according to strict criteria for case defini tions and causality assessment. Grouped events were checked for maximum consistency. Yearly we re port on all incoming notifications. 3.9 Health Council and expert panel Since 1984 the Health Council (GR) advises the Mi nister of Health, We lfare and Sport on the safety of the National Vaccination Programme . A permanent committee has been appointed. Up till 2003 GR has based their safety advice on the re-evaluation of the formal written assessments by RIVM, the international medical literature and the aggregated reports of all notifications assessed by RIVM. Summarised re assessments of the GR committee have been published in annual GR reports to the Minister of H ealth, Welfare and Sport. 55,56,57 As off 2003 an internal GR realignment of the task s of this committee resulted in stopping the individual reassessments, so the footing of th e advice on the safety of the RVP was no longer based on that aspect. RIVM very much values a broad scientific discussion on particular reported events and therefore has set up an expert panel since 2004. Currently this group includes specialists on paediatrics, neurology, immunology, pharm acovigilance and microbiology. Written assessments are reassessed on diagnosis and causality. page 26 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 3.10 Quality assurance Assessment of adverse events is direct ed by standard operating procedure. There have been internal inspections up till 2002 and the GR regular audits over the years up till 2003. This has been commented upon in the GR report over 2001-2003. Severe, complex, controversial a nd otherwise interesting events are discussed regularly in clinical conferences of the physicians of RIVM. 3.11 Medical control agency and pharmacovigilance RIVM sends expedited reports on so calle d serious adverse events (SAE) to the manufacturers and to Lareb, thus allowing the Dutch medical control agency (CBG) to fulfil its obligations towards WHO and EMEA. Lareb se nds reports directly received from other reporters on programmatically used vaccines to RIVM. At the same time RIVM sends line listings of al l adverse events (AE) every three months to the specific vaccine manufacturer s that contribute to the National Vaccination Programme. RIVM report 240071004 page 27 of 82 4 Results 4.1 Number of reports In 2006 RIVM received 1159 notifications of adverse events, invol ving 1059 children. 57 Notifications were multiple, resulting in 116 reports. 33 Notifications were compound. Two notifications were compound and multiple, re sulting in 10 reports. (Table 1). Multiple and compound reports are listed under the respecti ve event categories. See paragraph 3.2 for definitions.

For the period 1994 till 2004 there was a gradual increase in number of reported adverse events due to reduced underreporting, introdu ction of new vaccines and changes of the schedule. 40,41,42,43,45,46,48,49 The increase in 2004 followed adverse publicity on the safety of the DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine starting in the first week of January 2004. 50 In March 2004 the GR advised the Minister to change to an acellular pertussis cont aining vaccine as soon as possible. 58 In 2005, for the first time in years, the number of reports went dow n, both for single events as for compound and multiple events following the introduction of DTP-IPV-Hib with three acellular pertussis components. In 2006 we gradually switched to an infant combination vaccine with five pertussis components. Also we added the se ven valent pneumococ cal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) to the programme for children born fr om April first onwards; numbers increased significantly (Table 2). page 28 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 Table 2.

In 2001-2005 this varied between 75% and 81%. Parents of 121 children (10.4%) were the primary repor ters (range 8.2%-12.6% in 2001-2005). The share of the Municipal Health Service in reporting was 6.9%. In 2001-2005 this fluctuated from 2.0% to 7.3%. The share of other report sources was more or less stable (detailed information in Figure 1 and Table 3).

In many reports this is (preliminarily) achieved in the notifying phone call. In most reports further verification and additional information is necessary for final assessment. F eedback, both to professionals and parents, is mostly done by telephone. A full written asse ssment followed 86 (7.4%) reports (range 6%- 12% for 2001-2005, Table 5). These concerned the more complex events or those causing (public) anxiety or extreme uncertain ty about subsequent vaccinations. Table 5.

Standardisation of the rate per 1000 vaccinated infants is done according to coverage data from the PEA. In Table 7 the rates were calculated with vacci nation coverage data of Praeventis, the new centralised web based vaccination register. Since the regular summarised reports of coverage data do not contain information on timing of the vaccination there wi ll inevitably remain some inaccuracy in estimated rates per region. The birth cohort increased from a little below 190,000 in 1996 to 206,619 in 2000. Subsequently the birth cohort decreased yearly to 185,057 in 2006. 59 The reporting rate was 6.2 per 1000 vaccinated infants (DTP-IPV- Hib3) in 2006. Range for 2001-2005 is 5.5-11.4 (DTP-IPV-Hib3). There was less dispersion of th e reporting rates over the different regions, compared to 2005. page 32 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 Table 7.

The country's average reporting rate for major events is 3.1/1000. Range for 2001-2005 is 2.6-6.6. One region had a higher reporti ng rate for major events only and one region a lower. We will present and compare differ ences in numbers of specific events in the respective paragraphs under 4.9. For more information see Table 7. 4.5 Vaccines In the current year 95% of the notifications were about recent vacci nations. Some of the 53 late reports arose from concerns about planned booster vaccination or vaccination of younger siblings. In 11% of these cases the pa rents reported. The vaccine involved in these late reports was most often DTP-IPV-Hib (32) and MMR (11, of which 6 simultaneously with MenC). All reports are included in the tables. In Table 8 scheduled and actually administered vaccines are listed. According to previous years (except 2005) reports on the first DTP-IP V-Hib dose were the most prevalent. The relative frequencies of involved vaccinations changed a little compared to previous years (Figure 3). RIVM report 240071004 page 33 of 82 Table 8.

In 2004 we received 1730 reports after DTP-IPV-Hib, wh ile in 2005 this number was 593. The number of reports concerning DTP-IPV-Hib varied during the year, similar to previous years. There is no trend in increasing numbers, despite the changes in the vaccination programme.

From the addition of MenC to the progr amme in 2002 onwards the number of AEFI following MMR1 and MenC at fourteen months in creased yearly. In the current year numbers decreased. The same applies for reports after DT-IPV5 at the age of four years from the introduction of simultaneous aP in 2002 for cohort 1998 onwards. The number of AEFI (88) following DT-IPV6 /MMR2 has increased compared to 2005. Three children were reported with events following BCG and four with non-RVP vaccines only.

See for more precise de scription Table 7 and the respective event categories b pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) was added for children born from April first onwards. Compared to 2005, a statistically si gnificant rise in reported adve rse events is seen. However, the total is still lower than numbers for the period 2001-2004. Within and between the different event categories there are some ch anges. These will be commented upon in the specific event paragraphs. Absolute numbers ma y be deceptive as the rate depends on actual number of vaccinations and only preliminary vaccine coverage data are available for this reporting period, with no information on the timing. The relative frequency of the different even t categories has changed a little since the introduction of acellular DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine (F igure 4). General illness (minor and major) is still the largest ca tegory, with a relative frequency of around 40%. The share of faints and discoloured legs increased compared to 2005, bei ng the first year we used an acellular DTP- IPV-Hib vaccine. page 36 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 0%20%40%60%80%100% 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006deat h encephalopathy/-itis anafylactic shock fits faints discoloured legs skin symptoms persistent screaming major illness minor illness local reaction Figure 4. Relative frequencies of events in reported AEFI 1996-2006 4.6 Severity of reported events and medical intervention The severity of reported adverse events is historically categorised in minor and major events. The number of the so-called major events was 585 of 1159 (50.5%), with positive causality in 466 (40.2%) reports. In 2001-2005 the share of major events ranged from 47.5%-57.5% with positive causality in 36.4%-49.4% (Figure 5).

Proportion of re ported major AEFI and major Adverse Reactions in 1996-2006 The level of medical intervention may also illust rate the impact of adverse events. In 18.3% (212) of reports either no medical help was s ought or was not reported to or recorded by us (range 16-21% for 2001-2005). Parents administ ered paracetamol suppositories, report 240071004 page 37 of 82 rectiole or other home medication 159 times (14%; range 13-27% fo r 2001-2005). In Table 10 and Figure 6 intervention is shown according to highest level. In 67% parents contacted the clinic or GP, called the ambulance or went to hospital, with 9% admittance. For the five previous years these percentages varied from 57-69% and from 8-13% for hospital admittance. Table 10.

In 2006, 76% of reports were adverse reactions , with exclusion of two non-classifiable events. Range for 2001-2005 is 73%-83%. The other events (282) were considered coincidental with improbable or ab sent causal relation with the vaccinations. There are great differences in causality between th e different event categories (Table 11), but over the years very consistent. See for descript ion and more detail the specific paragraphs under 4.9 and discussion in chapter 5. Table 11.

For vaccinations with only (DT-IPV, DTP-IPV- Hib, Hib, aP, MenC, HepB, HepA and Influenza) possible causal relation was assessed in 76% of the reports. 4.8 Expert panel RIVM very much values a broad scientific discussion on particular reported events. Until 2004 the GR re-evaluated a selection of severe and/or rare events. From 2004 onwards RIVM has set up an expert panel. Currently this gr oup includes specialists on paediatrics, neurology, immunology, pharmacovigilance and microbiology. Written assessments are reassessed on diagnosis and causality. In 2006 the expert panel has focussed on 59 cases. RIVM report 240071004 page 39 of 82 Table 12: Numbers of reports reassessed by the expert panel event Expert panel total (% *) local reaction - 102 (0) general illness minor 8 403 (2) major 23 111 (21) persistent screaming - 61 (0) skin symptoms - 97 (0) discoloured legs 1 124 (<1) faints 1 169 (<1) fits 19 85 (22) anaphylactic shock - - encephalopathy/-itis 1 1 (100) death 6 6 (100) total 2006 59 1159 (5) * = % reassessments All members of the expert panel agreed w ith the causality assessment of the reports, determined by the RIVM. 4.9 Categories of adverse events Classification into disease groups or event categories is done after full assessment of the reported event. Some disease groups remain \"empty\" because no events were reported in 2006. 4.9.1 Local reactions In 2006, 102 predominantly local reactions were reported, more frequently after DTP-IPV- Hib (55%) than DT-IPV and aP (36%) vaccinati ons (Table 13). Focussing on major reactions only, there is more emphasis on DT-IPV and aP vaccinations at four years of age. As can be expected, all reported local events were asse ssed causally related with the vaccination. The majority of the reported local reactions (74) were classified as minor reactions. 28 Reports were considered major local reactio ns because of size, severity, intensity or duration. Common inflammation was the most prev alent aspect in 77 reports (20 considered major). 14 Reports concerned atypical local re actions with local rash or discoloration, possible infection, (de)pigmentation, haematoma, fibrosis, swelling, itch or pain, atypical time interval or combination of atypical symp toms. Three children had marked reduction in the use of the limb with mild or no signs of inflammation. This is booked separately as \"avoidance behaviour\". page 40 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 Table 13.

Three of the 6 abscesses were drained surgic ally; others drained spontaneously. Once the culture was positive for haemolytic Streptococ cus Group A. Twice no culture was taken, for three abscesses this information is lacking. No faulty vaccination procedures were detected. 4.9.2 Systemic symptoms Events that are not classifiable in one of the other specific categories ar e listed under general illness, depending on severity subdivided in minor or major (see paragraph 3.5). Minor general illness In 403 children the event was considered to be minor illness. Of these reports 31% were considered to have improbable causal relati on with the vaccination. For 2001-2005 this range was 27-34% (Table 14). 67% of reported events concer ned the scheduled DTP-IPV-Hib vaccinations. In 2005 this was 60%. Although rising again, it remains lower than in 2001-2004 (75-81%). RIVM report 240071004 page 41 of 82 Table 14.

Fever is the most prominent symptom in 135 re ports, 123 times considered possibly causally related. Of the other (working) diagnoses, in 177 reports fever was an accompanying symptom. Crying was the main feature in 61 re ports, predominantly following the first two vaccinations. These numbers ar e in line with 2001-2003 and 2005, but much lower than in 2004. Since the introduction of acellu lar pertussis vaccine for infa nts, pallor and/or cyanosis (16) and myoclonics (8) are less frequently reported. The number of rash illness is higher than before. Children with rash and fever, related to MMR (vaccin itis) are reported less frequently. For the other working diagnoses numbers remained more or less the same over the last years (Table 15). page 42 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 Table 15.

Reported persistent screaming appears to be age/dose dependent, as has been noticed in former years (see Ta ble 9). Additional symp toms were pain and swelling at the injection site, restlessness, pall or, myoclonic jerks and fever. 22 Parents gave suppositories, 14 contacted the GP and three chil dren were seen in the hospital (Table 10). 4.9.4 General skin manifestations In 2006 skin symptoms were the main or only feature in 97 reports. In 2001-2005 this ranged from 73-106. The percentage of reports cons idered adverse reactio ns was 62% (range 2001- 2005 is 38%-63%). See Table 11 and 19.

Children with petechi ae on the legs only are categorised under discoloured legs. 31 Cases concerned live attenuated vaccines, 27 times combined with MenC or DT-IPV. In 77% there was a possible causal relation (range 48-77% for 2001-2005). For the inactivated vaccines or combinations, possible causal rela tion was assessed in 36 out of 66 events, 55% within the range for the five pr evious years 32-57%. See Table 20. Table 20.

Leg petechiae without noted discoloration and are also grouped in this category. The same applies for swollen limbs. In 2006, 124 reports were received, more than tw ice the number of 2005. (Table 21; range 2001-2004 134-279). There is no trend in increasing numbers of reported discoloured legs during the year, despite the gradual change to an acellular DTP-IPV-Hi b vaccine with five pertussis components and the subsequent in troduction of PCV7 in the programme for children born since April 2006. 12 Reports were cons idered to be blue legs (11 double-sided), 60 red legs (27 double sided) a nd 30 (15 double sided) purple legs . In total, 44 reported leg petechiae, with or with out prior discoloration. In 2005 the share of discoloured legs reporte d after the first two doses of DTP-IPV-Hib diminished to 53%. In the current year this percentage (77%) returned to levels of 2001-2004 (72-79%). Causal relation with the vaccines was inferred in all but five cases. Only inactivated vaccines were involved.

This is equal to 2005 but a sharp decrease in numbers compared to 2001-2004. In 61% of cases collapse occurred after the first DTP-IPV- Hib vaccination. In 2005 this was 37%. In 2001-2004 this ranged from 60%-73%. Numbers diminished with dose number and age, similar to 2001-2004. 39,47,50 In 16 reports the event was assessed as not related becau se of the too long time interval and/or other causes (range 6- 16 for 2001-2005). BHS occurred 11 times, of which 73% was causally related to the vaccination; the children turned blue, after stopping to breathe in expiration when crying vehemently or after other stimuli, with a very short phase of diminished responsiveness and no limpness or pallor. Fainting in older childr en was reported 82 times, again an increase compared to the five previous years, in all but one case with assessed causality. Table 23.

For inactivated vaccines only 97 of the 116 cases (84%) were co nsidered adverse reactions. (Table 23) page 48 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 4.9.7 Fits Epileptic seizures and (febrile) convulsions are filed in this category. In the subcategory of \"atypical attacks\" paroxysmal events are listed in case no definite diagnosis could be made and convulsion could not be fully excluded either . See also paragraph 3.5 for case definitions. Most reported convulsions were febrile (57 out of 63), occurring predominantly after the fourth DTP-IPV-Hib (9) and MMR1/MenC (44) vaccinations. For MMR this number is equal to 2005, for DTP-IPV-Hib4 there is a decrease, co mpared to previous years. In 42 of these the fever was possibly caused by the vaccina tion and therefore these convulsions were considered adverse reactions. 15 Febrile convulsions were not c onsidered causally related, as there was another cause established and/or an implausible time interval with the vaccination. See also Table 24 and 25. Table 24.

Six non-febrile convulsions were reported. Thre e of these were considered possibly provoked by the vaccination because of co rrect time interval, the other three were considered chance occurrences. Three children with epilepsy were reported. In none of these children (fever caused by) the vaccine was regarded as trigger. In 2006 atypical attacks were r ecorded 19 times, a decrease comp ared to previous years. In 10 cases there was a possible cau sal relation with th e vaccination. None of the children fulfilled the case definitions for collapse or convulsion. The reported atypical attacks were RIVM report 240071004 page 49 of 82 also most frequent after the v accinations in the one year olds (Table 24). Of the reported atypical attacks 11 were without feve r. Three children had fever of > 40.5oC, two times considered causally related to the vaccination. Table 25.

Causality was assumed in 38 cases (70%, range for 2001-2005 is 67-89%). For inactivat ed vaccines 57% of the reported events were considered adverse reactions (ra nge 2001-2005 37%-71%). 4.9.8 Encephalopathy/encephalitis The only event reported in 2006 listed in this category was considered a chance occurrence and not induced or aggravated by the vaccination (Table 26). Table 26. Encephalopathy/encephalitis and vaccines of reported AEFI in 2006 child sex agea vaccines interval symptoms/diagnosis Anaphylactic shock There were no reports on ana phylactic shock in 2006. As a ma tter of fact, we have never received notification of anaphyl actic shock with inferred causali ty and/or appropriate time interval since the surveillance system was installed. 4.9.10 Death In 2006, six children were reported, who died fo llowing vaccination (Table 27). The reports concerned five boys and one girl. Autopsy wa s performed four times, however not in all instances inclusive of full toxicological, micr obiologic or metabolic work-up or with post- mortem examination of the brain. Without full post-mortem investigation a definite diagnosis is often impossible. In all six cases death wa s judged not to be caused or hastened by the vaccination. page 50 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 Table 27.

Mere registration and reporting of possibl e adverse reactions is not enough to sustain confidence in the safety of the programme. 60,61,62 The intensified awareness of the public and professionals with regard to the safety of vaccines may have adverse consequences for the willingness to pa rticipate in the programme. It may also influence the number and the type of adverse events following immunisation reported to the safety surveillance system. We will discuss the characteristics of the current enhanced passive surveillance system and comment on its strength and weaknesses. We will also discuss how the information in the current system may play a role in the manageme nt of adverse events and in the risk-benefit communication to professi onals and parents. The Achilles' heel of passive surveillan ce is underreporting. Especially selective underreporting creates bias. Therefore we will comment upon the representative ness of our data regarding AEFI. The year under report was given special atte ntion because of the introduction of 7-valent (PCV7) admi nistered simultaneously with the DTP-IPV- Hib vaccine for infants born from April first 2006 onwards. The Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport thus followed the advi ce of the GR of October 2005. 1 We also switched gradually to a DTP-IPV-Hib with five acellular pertussis components. Reports of the current year have been carefully monitored for unexpected, unknown, new severe or particular adverse events a nd for changes in trends and severity. Below we will go into the increase in number of reports and the different aspects of the nature of the reported adverse events in 2006. We will discuss the safety of the vaccination programme in the light of the here presented results, with regard to the literatu re and consider future approaches. 5.1 Number of reports In 2005 there was a substantial decrease in reports, which was assigned to a DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine with an acellular pertussis component. This is in line with expe ctation since acellular pertussis vaccines are known to have a more fa vourable safety profile, both for the more common and the more severe adverse events. 63,64,65 In 2006 the number of reports increased with 12% compared to 2005. Th e number of multiple and co mpound reports increased also page 52 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 compared to 2005, approaching the level before 2004. However, there have always been fluctuations in these numbers, par tly depending on degree of follow up. In the year under report ther e were several changes in the programme, as mentioned above. However, there was no trend of increasing number of notifications during the year. 5.1.1 Distribution over vaccines and dose The increase in reports was mainly due to the DTP-IPV-Hib vaccinations. DTP-IPV-Hib reports account for 64% of all reported adve rse events, compared to 57% in 2005. In 2001- 2004 this ranged from 75% to 81%. There was more predominance (39%) of the first dose compared to 2005 (35%). In 2004 this was 42% and 47% on average in 2000-2003. The first vaccination with DTP-IPV-Hib always has a hi gher number of reports than the later doses. To some extent this may be due to more c oncern about the young child and questions about subsequent vaccinations, but the majority is caused by the higher incidence rate of some young-age specific events. The gradual change to a different composition of the DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine with five instead of three pertussis components might have influenced the number of reports, although a systematic review revealed no difference in safe ty profile between vacc ines with a different number of acellular pertussis components. 66 Usually a safety profile is not based on rare and/or late adverse reactions, which are covered by a passive safety surveillance system. Therefore we can not rule out this change ha s influenced the number of reported adverse events. However, the introduction of PCV7 hampers a more precise evaluation of this effect. The PCV7 was implemented after the first quarter of 2006, so we expect the share of reports involving a first dose of DTP-IPV-Hib combined with PCV7 to be appr oximately 50% of the total reports on this dose. Actually this percen tage is only 30%. After correction for the fact that part of the birth cohort received two v accines, the adjusted re porting rate for DTP-IPV- Hib+PCV7 notifications is 2.5/1000 infants (95% CI 2.3-2.7) compared to an unadjusted rate of 3.2. So we can conclude th at expanding the RVP with PCV7 doesn't explain the increase in reports. The number of reports following MMR1 and MenC levelled off. The same applies for the reports following DT-IPV and aP. Until this y ear reports following these vaccinations showed a repeated annual increase, caused by the introduction of an extra vaccination and reduced underreporting. Ongoing surveillance will show if these numbers will stabilise or change again. Reports following the vaccinations of the ni ne-year-olds have increased compared to 2005. See for details the following paragraphs. 5.1.2 Distribution over events The increase in reports is apparent in nearly all event categories, espe cially discoloured legs. The number of reported fits, encephalopathy and death did not change. To get more accurate RIVM report 240071004 page 53 of 82 estimations on the incidence of specific advers e events, we continued the questionnaire study of the more severe adverse events followi ng DTP-IPV-Hib started in December 2003 (to be reported later). No new or unexpected events were detected in infant age groups in 2006. See for additional information the subparagraphs in 5.2. 5.1.3 Severity, causality, level of int ervention and reporting interval In 2005 the absolute number as well as the rela tive share of so called major adverse events decreased. This is consistent with the better sa fety profile of a DTP-IP V-Hib vaccine with an acellular pertussis component. 63,64,65 This year the relative share of major adverse ev ents increased. Furthermore the percentage of all reports with assessed causality (adverse r eactions) increased to 76%, compared to 73% in 2005 (range 2001-2004 is 78-83%). Both the increase in major events and the rise in causality are caused by more reports on acknowledged adverse reactions, like faints and discoloured legs, historically catego rised as 'major' events. In 2005 the percentage of coincidental re ports was relatively high, a common phenomenon after introduction of a new vaccine in the sche dule. With new vaccines professionals tend to report more events that they formerly would ha ve rejected as obviously not causally related. 39,67 This year the absolute number of reporte d adverse events with inferred causal relation (282) remained almost the same compared to 2005 (279). Apparently the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine did not cause the same effect. For the other vaccines or vaccine-combinations the percentage of adverse reactions was similar to previous years. The level of medical intervention (GP, clinic and hospital visit) was simila r to previous years. Relatively fewer children were admitted to hospital in 2006 (9%) compared to 2005 (11%). For both years nearly 70% of these hospitalisations were due to coincidental, unrelated adverse events. 5.1.4 Underreporting Reducing (selective) unde rreporting is of special importance in passive surveillance systems. Since 1994 we continuously put extra effort in this, as has been discussed in the previous reports. All repeated annual increases in notifications can be explained by reduced underreporting, introduction of new vaccines or changes in schedule or vaccine composition. 41,42,43,45,48,49,50,51 The reduction of reports in 2005 was caused by the change to an acellular DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine with an ackno wledged better safety profile. 63,64,65 Perhaps the expectancy of both public and health clinic work ers that this new vaccine \"does not have side effects at all\" may have strengthened this decrease. In the current year total number of reports increased significantly, not influenced by the uptake of PCV7, as shown in the previous pa ragraphs. Possibly the \"honeymoon\" effect of the acellular DTP-IPV-Hib is fading away. The ra ther stable even distribution of the reporting page 54 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 rates over the country and the increase in causality underline this. Perhaps the phased introduction of a DTP-IPV-Hib with five pertus sis components may have an additional effect on this rise of reported adverse events. Continued surveillance is necessary to augm ent our knowledge on the safety of acellular pertussis vaccine, administered with PCV7 in the Netherlands, The questionnaire study on the more severe, rare events following DTP-IPV-Hi b(+PVC7) vaccine is expected to lead to more precise incidence estimates. 5.2 Specific events In addition to the more general remarks in the above paragraphs some specific adverse events will be discussed below. 5.2.1 Local reactions Since the introduction of aP at four years of age for the birth cohort 1998 and later the number of local reactions after simultaneous administered DT-IPV and aP increased, most prominently in 2003 and 2005. This year the nu mber of major loca l reactions following booster dose op DTP-IPV-Hib increased again. Re markable was the type, extension and the long time interval with vaccination. This may be partly due to decreased underreporting, but is suspect for a true increase in local r eactions after pertussis booster vaccinations. 68,69,70 In 2006 we performed a questionnaire study on adverse events after DT-IPV and aP to follow up this signal. Pain, reduced use of the arm, redness, and swelling occu rred significantly more often at the DT-IPV injection site than at the aP injection site ( p < 0.05). Local reactions were mainly mild and transient. 71 We will repeat this study in 2008 with a combined DTP-IPV booster in four-year-olds primed w ith whole cell pertussis vaccine. 5.2.2 Minor illness The number of reports in the current year in this category returned to the level before 2004. 212 (53%) of these reports involve fever <40.5oC, crying and pallor. Three quarters (163) concerned DTP-IPV-Hib, equal to the per centage of 2005. For th e years 2000-2004 this percentage was approximately 90%. Fever, crying and pallor are acknowledged common adverse events following infant vaccinati ons. A systematic review in 2003 shows no difference in safety profile between acellular pertussis vaccines with different number of pertussis components. 66 In 33% of the DTP-IPV-Hib reports PCV7 was given simultaneously. This is comparable with the overall percentage of reports, involving PCV7 and lower than expected. (See for more detail s paragraph 5.1.1) Therefore the addition of PCV7 had no major influence on these numbers. Schmitt et al evaluated the safety of DTP-IP V-Hib compared to DTP-IPV-Hib + PCV7 and found only minor differences in fever and drowsiness in the latter group. 72 Several studies on the reactogenicity of DTP-IPV- Hib-HepB compared to concu rrently administered 240071004 page 55 of 82 Hib-HepB and PCV7 showed a significant incr ease of fever <39\u00b0C for the group, receiving two vaccines. 73,74,75 However comparing these results is hampered by different schedules, vaccine combinations, methods and levels of a ssessment and lack of uniform case definitions. 64,65,66 Moreover, our passive safety survei llance has a known underre porting for these common adverse events. 76 Results of the questionnaire study for acellular DTP-IPV-Hib, partly combined with PCV7 are not available yet. We must bear in mind that this annual report does no t cover a full year's usage of DTP-IPV-Hib+PCV7. 5.2.3 Very high fever Fever is an unspecific sympto m of many medical conditions. It is also an acknowledged adverse event following immunisation. In all pr e registration trials fever is covered. The Brighton Collaboration covered this symptom in th e first series of six case definitions with stipulations how to report in increments of .5 degrees centigrade (Celsius). 77 We have registered events under very high fever ( 40.5\u00b0C) only if the event was not part of another disease entity. This year 77 events were reported, involvi ng very high fever, of which 29 following DTP- IPV-Hib (four times with PCV7). Compared to 2005 the number of very high fever has increased, but with less emphasis on the one-year-olds (35% and 74% in 2006 and 2005 respectively). In literature difference in fe ver between DTP-IPV-Hib(+HepB) vaccine with or without PCV7 are described, but variable cut off points of very high fever hamper a good comparison. 72,73,74,75 Longer passive follow up is necessary. More precise estimates will be determined by the current questionnaire survey. 5.2.4 Persistent screaming The number of reports of persistent screami ng is rather stable, except for 2004, which was marked by a tremendous increase, due to adve rse publicity. There has always been a known underreporting of persistent screaming in the pa ssive surveillance. Exact incidence rates are difficult to compare, because of different case definitions. 78,79,80,81 Moreover it is stated that infants cry on average 2 hours a day during the first months of life, with a peak at 6 weeks with 2.5 hours on average. Our case definition of persistent screaming includes three or more hours continuous crying. This differs from la tely redefined Bright on Collaboration case definition, which states \"more\" than 3 hours crying. 82 We register the duration however in order to be able to pool or compare results. In literature, estimates of persistent scr eaming are 1-10 per 1000 children depending on case definition and age involved. 82,83 For the Netherlands we expect results from the current questionnaire study of the acellular pertussis va ccine, whether or not co-administered with PCV7. page 56 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 5.2.5 Collapse After the introduction of acellular DTP-IPV-Hi b the number of reported collapse decreased, due to the better safety profile of acellular vaccines compared to w hole cell vaccines. In 2005, one quarter of the reported collapse reac tions occurred followi ng whole cell pertussis vaccine, whereas in 2006 all DTP-IPV-Hib vaccines contained an acellular pertussis component. However the number of reported colla pse is equal for both years. This may be due to a temporary underreporting of collapse reac tions in 2005. Maybe the gradual change to a DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine with five pertussi s components had some influence, but the introduction of PCV7 hampers a more pr ecise evaluation of this effect. Collapse reactions occurred most frequently after the first and second dose (88%). In 2006 47% of these reports concerned DTP-IPV-Hib si multaneously administered with PCV7. This is higher than the averag e this year (30%). Ongoing surveillance is necessary to gain insi ght in incidence rates for collapse following DTP-IPV-Hib combined with PCV7 vaccine. A questionnaire study on rare severe adverse events following whole cell DTP-IPV-Hib s howed a good performance of the enhanced passive surveillance system for more complex even ts like collapse. In the near future we will look into collapse reactions, re ported to the enhanced passive surveillance system in relation to acellular pertussis vaccines more carefully. 5.2.6 Discoloured legs Numbers of reported discoloured legs have more than doubled compared to previous year. In 2005 77% of the reports followed DTP-IPV-Hib, all but six with an acellular pertussis component. In the current year 94% of the reports occurred afte r DTP-IPV-Hib, in 42% simultaneously administered with PCV7. Again th is percentage is high er compared to all reports on average (30%). The increase may be an indication of reduced underreporting of disc oloured legs following acellular pertussis vaccines. Maybe the phase d introduction of DTP-IPV-Hib with five pertussis components played a ro le. Perhaps it is also influe nced by the concomitant PCV7 vaccination, although there is no trend in increas ing numbers of discoloured legs during the year. We have to bear in mind that this re port does not cover a fu ll year use of PCV7. Ongoing surveillance is necessary to gather more accurate numbers on this subject. 5.2.7 Convulsions and atypical attacks The number of (classic) febrile convulsions was considerably lower than in previous years. Most reported febrile convulsi ons occur in the one-year-o lds. The number following MMR and MenC is equal to 2005, for DTP-IPV-Hib4 the number is lower. This maybe caused by the lower rate of fever followi ng acellular pertussis vaccines. 63,64,65 After a full year use of acellular pertussis vaccine the incidence rate, irrespective of assessed causality, for DTP-IPV-Hib4 is 0.5 (95% CI 0.2-0.8) per 10,000 vaccinati ons. This is lower than previous estimates RIVM report 240071004 page 57 of 82 following whole cell pe rtussis vaccine. 84,85 In the following year s with only acellular pertussis vaccine in use, the performance of the acellular pertussis vaccine will become manifest. The number of reported atypical attacks was substa ntially lower than the five previous years. Numbers fluctuate however. This is not surprising if one consider s this subcategory to be the dustbin of paroxysmal events not otherwise cl assifiable. We follow the reports in this subgroup with scrutiny but up till now no specifi c trends or signals were observed. The numbers in this subgroup are (very much) de pendent on completeness of information. Thus, transfer to and from other event categories in different years. 5.2.8 Pervasive disorders and retardation Press allegations about possible causal relation between MMR vaccination and autism dented the confidence of parents in the vaccination programme. 86,87 Despite the fact that based on scientific evidence renowned (groups of) scient ists have refuted these alleged associations, the vaccination coverage dropped considerabl y, especially in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. 88,89 In the current year we have rece ived very few reports on behavioural problems in the autistic spectrum or other sp ecific problems in mental retardation. Some parents have no real suspicion bu t have been made insecure; others simply clutch the last straw. In none of the reported cases a cau sal relation was found, and in some the event preceded the vaccination. It is to be expected that the number of reports of events that have attracted public attention will increase. A passive surveillance system, even an enhanced one, is not the proper tool for a refutation of false hypotheses, or for substant iating true ones for that matter. Recently a few systematic studies have been published showi ng no causal relation of disturbances in the autistic spectrum with MMR vaccination or thiomersal c ontaining pertussis vaccine. 90,91 Studies the causal of ence phalopathy or retarda tion with pertussis vaccinations have been publishe d earlier and confirmed lately. 92 In fact, in Australia 11 of 14 children with alle ged vaccine encephalopathy appeared to have a SCN1A mutation. 93 This mutation is associated with Severe Myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI). Most mutations are \"de novo\" and not inherite d. In collaboration with the section for genetic counseling of the UMC Utrecht, we w ill investigate all reported complex febrile convulsions, epilepsy or pervasive disorders of the years 1997-2006 to see if this mutation plays a role. 5.2.9 Epilepsy The number of reports on epilepsy was within the range of the last five years, with comparatively a rather large variation, as is to be expected with such small numbers. In none of the reports causality was assumed. Current scientific data do not support any causal relation between epilepsy and vaccinations. In th e past years a number of studies have been performed on the aetiology of epilepsies. 83 However, it may not be possible to exclude this page 58 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 causal relation definitely in an individual case. Vaccines may cause convulsions, mainly indirectly through fever, in pr one children. As for West syndrome, epidemiological evidence refutes a causal relation. 94 However, the age at which West syndrome occurs coincides with the vaccination schedule. 5.2.10 Death This year six children were reported who died some time after immunisations. The number of reports in this category is in line with exp ectations considering the background rate. After thorough evaluation in none of the children causality with the vaccinations was assessed. Neither indirect causality was considered, due to delay in treatment or aggravation of symptoms because of the vaccination. Systematic studies and evaluation of the Institute of Medicine have shown infant death to be unrelated to childhood vaccinations. 95 In an individual case, this may not be demonstrated easily. Especially in th e case of possible SIDS this poses a problem. Diagnosis of SIDS is possible only after extensive post-mortem examination has not revealed a cause of death. Th erefore it is of utmost importance to insist on full post-mortem investigations and to report fully on all infant deaths following vaccinations. Even if causation is very remote, it is known that in the direct vicinity of the case there is an adverse effect on compliance to the programme, of pub lic and professionals. It should be emphasised that de ath in close time relationship, i. e. for inactivated vaccines within one month and for live vacc ines within six weeks, should be reported in all instances, regardless of cause. Sooner or later someone will question the effect of the vaccinations even if on first sight causal relation seems to be remote. It is better to be pro- active than to have to follow up on (public) disquiet. If parents are not aware of not ification, reporting anonymously is the better choice than to post pone until parents are consulted. Explanation to parents that assessment of the involvement of prior vaccination is performed routinely, and not only if there is suspected contribution of the vaccination to the death, will satisfy most parents. 5.3 Safety surveillance of the RVP Safety surveillance of the vaccination progra mme seems to be of increasing importance. 19,20,96,97,98 The Dutch system has several strong point s. Denominators are known, because the PEA registers all administered vaccines on individual level. 4,5,10 The installation of the web- based new central vaccination re gister will allow more specifi c and timely data extracting (Praeventis). The data warehouse tool will make data extraction more efficient (Praemis). The RVP is embedded in the regular Child Health Care with its near total coverage and programme delivery by a relatively small group of specifically traine d professionals. Good professional standards include aski ng after adverse events at the next clinic visit and before the next dose. The RIVM's central telephone information and consultation service for professionals is an important and effici ent tool in adverse events reporting. 99 It also allows a close watch on risk perception and programme a dherence. Reporting in low-level terms with RIVM report 240071004 page 59 of 82 signs and symptoms and not only (assumed) dia gnoses allows application of standardised case definitions and stratified analysis if necessary. Validation and supplementation of reporting data from medical reco rds and eye witness case historie s is an important aspect of the system, resulting in homogeneous event cate gorisation. The wide repo rting criteria allow sensitive signal detection of new adverse events or interactions. Trend analysis is possible. The nominal reports facilitate follow up and some other systematic studies, like nested case- control studies. 49,100 The current enhanced passive surv eillance system performs satisfactory (LIBRIS). The strength of the system outwei ghs the inherent weaknesses. Additional active surveillance studies should s upplement the passive system. See for further details the subparagraphs below. 5.3.1 Causality assessment and case definitions Assessing causal relation is essential in mon itoring the safety of the vaccination programme. 101,102,103,104 Of course, after vaccination does not mean caused by vaccination. The RIVM expert panel has continued the former GR ac tivities of broader scientific assessment of selected cases with complete agreement on di agnosis and causality. Some other countries have followed suit, like Canada (with its ACCA, Advisory Committee on Causality Assessment, since 1994), the USA (CISA, Clini cal Immunization Safety Assessment Centres, since 2001) and Australia.105,106,107 Five different categories ar e used for causal relation for the purpose of international comparison. Howe ver, different design and criteria for surveillance systems, diagnostic procedures, ca usality assessment and inconsistent case definitions and case ascertainment hamper international comparison. 108 Also different schedules and/or vaccines and combinations do preclude direct analyses or pooling of data and require cautious interpretation. The Brighton Collaboration, in which RIVM also participates, aims to arrive at defined standardised case definitions for specific a dverse events following immunisations. Use of these case definitions is proposed for both pre-licensure studies and post-registration surveillance. 16,104 Performance of vaccines in comparative pre-registration field trials may differ from experiences in actual use in large unselected populations. Therefore (new) vaccines should be monitored intensely a nd exactly, when they are in actual use. 5.3.2 Passive surveillance vers us active surveillance The current enhanced passive surveillance syst em need to be supplemented by more active monitoring and systematic studies to test ge nerated signals and hypotheses. Problems arising from privacy legislation should be addressed. The introduction of a unique medical personal identifier should facilitate da ta linkage studies, using hospita l databases or other electronic medical files. The centralised vaccination register is an asset towards these goals. With the possible uptake of new vaccines at diffe rent age-groups, there is a growing need for monitoring adverse events, especi ally auto-immune disorders. 109 Background incidences are an essential part of such a m onitoring system, in order to dete ct a possibly causal related rise page 60 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 in adverse events after introduction of a new v accine. We will study the possibilities of such a monitoring system in the near future. The enhanced passive surveillance however, will remain the backbone of safety surveillance. In an EU study in several European countri es, including the Netherlands, possibilities for improved safety surveillance of vaccinati on have been explored (EUsafevac 2001-2003). 110,111,112 Different Health Care systems and vaccine delivery organisations and logistics, with different legislation, traditions, among other things, but also ex isting differences in safety surveillance already in place, make that no unique recommendation could be made. Stressed is however that vaccination re gisters are a first requisite. 113 These registers should also qualify for safety surveillance. In the Netherla nds the new centralised vaccination database fulfils these criteria; vaccination regist ers existed since the early seventies. In Canada the national safety surveillance system is placed at the Public Health Agency of Canada (CAEFISS) to ensure that vaccine safety surveillance with its specific aspects, is guaranteed. They have an active surveillance system in place for severe adverse events following immunisation, vaccine failure and (f uture) vaccine preventable infections (IMPACT, a collaboration of the Canadian Paedia tric Society and the Centre for Infectious Diseases). In the USA vaccine safety surveilla nce is also separate from the drug monitoring system situated at the CDC in collaboration with FDA (VAERS). The vaccine safety data link project (VSD) links immunisa tion record with medical info rmation in the database of some large Health Maintenance Organisations (HMO) to perform active studies testing signals from the passive system. In the Nether lands the placement of the safety surveillance system at RIVM (LIBRIS) with its expertise should guarantee high quality assessment of the safety of the RVP. The collaboration with Lare b should ensure that European legislation is followed. In the Netherlands the feasibility of using the Paediatric Surveillance Unit for active signal testing for specific adverse events has been explored, but more continuous collaboration should be undertaken. The performance of the system and the degree of participation and coverage should be guaranteed how ever. Possibilities of electr onic databases of paediatric diagnoses should be explored. For the more severe common adverse events questionnaire survey could be done on a regular basis to test the safety profile of the (new) vaccines or schedules in the programme. For the more rare complex adverse events questionnaire surveys appear to be less suitable. Perhaps targeting cert ain selected adverse events at the clinic will give a better yield. 5.3.3 Information and consultation service We hold the telephone service to be an important tool in the safety surveillance of the RVP, both for capture of important adverse events or potential adverse reactions and with regard to the quality of data. 114 This low threshold reporting ch annel has proven to have great advantage over written report forms not onl y because of superior possibility of communication, timeliness and supplementation of data. Written reports by regular mail, by fax and by e-mail are also accepted. The telephone service is also an important tool for RIVM report 240071004 page 61 of 82 adherence to the programme, to promote proper use of contrai ndications and for guidance of the professionals to ensure adequate vaccination in special circumstances or underlying disorders. There is a growing public demand for more and better information, both for general questions and for child specific problems. More readily available and accessibl e printed general and specific information is needed, also for professionals. 115,116,117,118,119 The RVP communication project of RIVM in close collabo ration with other parties has developed fact sheets and web based material for parents in sp ring 2004. It is planned to add more in depth material for professionals. ( www.rvp.nl ) Feedback of the summarised annual reports on the safety of the vaccination programme should be ready in a more accessible and timel y manner both for professionals and public. See also the following paragraphs on management of adverse events and risk communication. 5.4 Management of adverse events The increasing relative importance of potential si de effects makes carefu l surveillance of the safety of the vaccination programme even more important than before. Just signal detection isn't enough. Evaluation and fee dback communication should complement mere registration. Signals should be followed up with more syst ematic studies. Information about reported adverse events should have a place within th e risk communication to parents. Some side effects are unavoidable, but wh ere possible the aim should be to prevent adverse reactions. Adverse coincidental events are truly chance occurrences however. Sometimes postponement of vaccination might free the vaccine and the vaccination programme fr om allegations of causing an event or disorder that would in evitably have occurred. But deferral should be avoided as much as possible because it will delay protecti on of the child. 5.4.1 Prevention and treatment of adverse events Adverse reactions or side effects do occur a nd parents should know wh at to expect. They need instruction about what (not) to do to alleviate symptoms. In the communication about the risk of vaccination, attention should be paid to the decrease in (awareness of the risk of) occurring target diseases. It should however al so be stressed that not everything occurring after a vaccination is indeed caused by the vaccin e. One of the most severe adverse events is undue, even fatal delay in recognising severe coincidental illness, because symptoms are wrongfully attributed to the vaccine. 39,40,41,42,43,45,46,48,49,50 Some education of the professionals in this respect seems warranted also. The vaccination as cause should be in the differential diagnosis, nothing less bu t at the same time nothing more. Proper procedures and techniques are important in minimising adverse reactions and the proper use of paracetamol should be incl uded in the information to parents. page 62 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 5.4.2 Contraindications Contraindications for the RVP vaccines have been abandoned more or less completely. 3,120,121,122,123 Proper application of true contraindications should be adhered to however to prevent undue side effects. But false contrai ndications should be a voided on the other hand because they lead to missed opportunities to provide protection. Applying more strict contraindications will not contri bute much to prevention of adve rse reactions but will result in a loss of protection. 124 5.4.3 Risk communication The telephone information service and the adve rse event surveillance system have made us increasingly aware of the need of (at least a group of) parents for more balanced and readily accessible information about the pro's and c on's of the vaccination programme. More and more providers signal the need for more apt and specific information to be communicated (by them) to parents. The providers may be th e best-informed professionals in vaccination matters but they also need timely information for their own reflections. They do need up-to-date facts and figures. Providers and parents should be system atically informed about the risk-benefit balance of the programme. The suc cessful control of the target diseases has diminished awareness of the severity of the targ et diseases and increase d the perceived risk of complications and sequelae. Child Health Care personnel should be equipped with more direct, adequate, up to date information on ma tters of vaccine safety. The present anti- vaccine-movements and the confusion they crea te make this argument more compelling. The Minister of Health has recogni sed the need for this repeated ly and answered as much to questions by members of the parliament rep eatedly. Halfway 2003 the necessary funds have been allocated to RIVM and since then a special project for improved and enhanced education and communication has been underway, in close colla boration with providers and PEA. This comprises web-based information, f act sheets on different topics of the RVP, newsletters and comprehensive training material. Needless to say this ca nnot be available all at the same time. Since information needs to be updated and new needs ar ise, this requires a continuous project, in order to reach the goals. From January 2004 information is available on www.rivm.nl and since April 2004 on www.rvp.nl . The experiences in 2004 with extreme public medi a concern about the safety of the vaccines have indeed accentuated the need for timely up to date information. Especially professionals have stressed that they should be informed pr oactively, not only by news letters but also through specific scientifically referenced fact sheets. 5.4.4 Causality assessment Causality assessment is important for surveilla nce purposes of the vaccines, the vaccination programme and for the individuals concerned. 101,102,103,104 Individual conti nuation of the schedule depends on proper assessment. It is im portant for the entire population served, as both in quietude and commotion will result in diminished coverage. One should acknowledge RIVM report 240071004 page 63 of 82 genuine adverse reactions and recognise evidentl y coincidental events both. Careful causality assessment will exonerate the programme from se vere but unrelated adverse events. It will also detect new rare adverse reactions a nd as yet new unrecognised more common side effects. Therefore thorough causality assessment will enhance the safety of the programme. 5.5 Considerations for the safety surveillance of the RVP In 2006 we implemented a DTP-IPV-Hib vaccine with five pertussis components for infants and added the conjugated pneumococcal vaccin e to the programme. The year under report showed an increase of (causal related) re ported adverse events, not explained by the introduction of the PCV7. Perhaps the phase d introduction of DTP-IPV-Hib with five pertussis components has influenced this rise. However aanalysis of this effect is hampered by the introduction of the PCV7 in th e second quarter of 2006. Probably reduced underreporting is a good explanation fo r the increase in reported AEFI. Passive safety surveillance in the next years will reveal the safety profile of this combination in more detail. However frequent changes in product and additions to the schedule may impede comparisons. For some adverse events the results of the questionnaire study will supply incidence estimates. It's worth to increase the reach of the sy stem not only among the current providers, but especially among pediatricians. This may yield more reports but this also should result in more timely reports. Depending on type of event, supplementation of the system with active surveillance through parental questionnaires or pediat ric surveys is necessary. Possibilities of data linkage mu st be explored. Shortcomings like undue privacy concerns and the absence of outcome database s or common personal identifiers that may be used for data linkage purposes should be addr essed. Without the use of thes e new epidemiological designs that may expand our knowledge of adverse even ts may be hampered. Medical data must be validated and must contain sufficient informa tion to apply (internati onally) agreed case definitions. An adequate database system is a prerequisite for this as well. The data put into the system must be of good quality neverthele ss; therefore this should get a lot of attention. \"Rubbish in rubbish out\" also applies to safety surveillance. Structural feedback to reporters and otherwise involve d professionals should be addressed in the new database application. This also serves (expedited) passing on of reports to Lareb and manufacturers. We acknowledge the need for timely and up to date safety information. Results from the surveillance system and the inference and impli cations should be available in comprehensive format, both for professionals as for public. The system should also decisively address adverse publicity and other signals. We plan to produce proactively scie ntifically based fact sheets on severe and rare events that may count eract unfounded future allegations. Those fact sheets will help the professionals to deal with co rrect or inappropriate c ontraindications. page 64 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 RIVM report 240071004 page 65 of 82 6 Conclusions and recommendations In 2006 the number of reported events increas ed significantly. The addition of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine from April 2006 onwards had little influence on this rise. The possible effect of the change to a DTP-IPV-Hib with fi ve pertussis components is hard to establish, due to the gradual implementation, followed di rectly by the introducti on of PCV7. Data on 2007 will give more insight in the simultane ous administration of these two vaccines. Continuous safety surveillance is an essential pa rt of the vaccination programme. The passive safety surveillance will remain the backbone a nd where appropriate will be supplemented by more systematic studies. Feedback to professionals and public is necessary. Incidence rates of more common events like fever and crying are expected from the questionnaire study. For the more rare coll apse and convulsion the enhanced passive surveillance system performs sa tisfactorily, as was shown by the questionnaire study of 2004. For rare severe events special study designs are needed to assess causal relation with the vaccination. Results sometimes may confirm suspect ed causal relation and other times refute allegations. The new adopted database system for adverse ev ent surveillance will allow further detailed aggregated analysis of the reports and also facilitate systematic feed back to the reporters as well as data exchange with other bodies, nati onally and internationall y. Safety surveillance systems in the future should be prepared to st udy generated signals of specific rare or long- term adverse effects on short notice. Especia lly now that introduction in the RVP of more (novel) vaccines is expected in the forthcomi ng years (foreseeable) safety concerns should be included in the discussion about intr oducing the vaccines in the programme. 109,125,126 Introduction of new vaccines should be organised in a way that allows safety studies on the long term also. Only then it will be possi ble to study new suspected adverse reactions properly and to adequately refute allegations. A problem is that one can not know what the next signal will be. National and internationa l collaboration should be expanded, in order to move towards a comprehensive safety su rveillance network of childhood vaccination programmes. This may also help perform need ed specific studies and increase scientific knowledge about adverse events following vaccinations. Eventually this will boost public confidence in the programmes. For the coming year, if resources permit, the next topics are recommended: further implementation of database applica tions and mutual adjustment with Lareb; annual report on 2007; maintenance and evaluation of the cu rrent passive surveillance system; further increasing reporting complian ce of child health care providers; promoting safety surveillance and info rmation system among paediatricians; second case control study on fo llow up of collapse reactions; exploration of possibilities of data linkage or sentinel studie s, to test generated hypotheses; study on vaccinations and SIDS; page 66 of 82 RIVM report 240071004 study on epilepsy/retardation and SMEI; study on events following DTP-IPV/HIB and pneumococcal vaccinations of preterm infants; active follow up of cha nges in the programme. The total of 1159 reports must be seen in re lation to a total of over 1.4 million vaccination dates administered with nearly 7 million components. We showed that the vaccination programme is safe with the pot ential side effects far less in weight than the apparent achievements/prevented illness and complicatio ns. We plan to keep up a thorough high quality safety-surveillance-system and to stimulate reporting in the coming year. RIVM report 240071004 page 67 of 82 van Gorcum, 4 Verbrugge HP.
