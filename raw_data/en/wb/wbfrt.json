To Request an Action Plan to Address Sleep Difficulties [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Sleep difficulty can involve trouble falling asleep when you first go to bed at night, waking up too early in the morning, or waking up often during the night. It can also involve combinations of these patterns. Everyone has an occasional sleepless night, and this is not a problem for most people. As many as 45% of Americans report occasional sleeping problems, however Chronic sleeping problems affect about 20% of people. The lack of restful sleep can affect your ability to carry out daily responsibilities because you are too tired or have trouble concentrating. All types of insomnia can lead to daytime drowsiness, poor concentration, and the inability to feel refreshed and rested in the morning. Most adults do best with about 8 hours of sleep each night until age 60, after which 6 hours may be enough. Even though the elderly need less sleep, almost one half of people over 60 experience some degree of insomnia. The best measure of the amount of sleep needed is how you feel. If you awaken feeling refreshed, you are getting enough sleep. For some people, this may take only 4 hours. Others may need up to 10 hours to feel rested. Using medications to treat insomnia can be useful in certain situations, but there are potential risks. Antihistamines (the main ingredient in over-the-counter sleeping pills) can lead to dependence, tolerance and over time may affect your memory. Sedative medication should be used under the close care of a physician because they can also cause dependence and tolerance. Stopping these medications can cause rebound insomnia and withdrawal. As with all medications, certain unknown side-effects can occur. Doing some research on the medication and understanding what the side-effects are and the potential complications is prudent. Discussing these with your medical doctor or pharmacist is important. It is rare for a life-threatening disease to be the cause of problems with sleep.

If you are depressed, antidepressants can help both the sleeping problem and the depression. These medications do not carry the same concerns about tolerance and dependence as sedatives. Still it is important to become informed about the possible side-effects and complications, as with all medication. Counseling may help with nightmares and dreams that interfere with sleep. Sleeplessness in adults may be due to: IN INFANTS Most newborns wake several times during the night, but by the age of 6 months they usually sleep through the night. At age 1, babies will sleep an average of 16 out of every 24 hours. Two to three hours of this sleep will be during the day. Sleeplessness in infants may be due to: Some people may need medications to help with sleep for a period of time. Your healthcare provider can talk to you about using prescribed medications if they think it will be helpful.

And many times your Medical Doctor will keep you on it after the safe and recommended time period for the medication has passed. Some antidepressants such as Trazadone can be used at bedtime because they make you drowsy. If insomnia is caused by depression, treating the depression with the right medications or therapy should solve the problem. Benzodiazepine sedatives such as clonazepam (Klonopin) or lorazepam (Ativan) are anti-anxiety medications that can also help people sleep. They must be used with caution because they can cause addiction. Newer sleep medicines called hynpotics help reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep. They are less likely to be addictive than benzodiazepines. Two examples are the prescription medicines zolpidem (Ambien) and zaleplon (Sonata). WARNING: The FDA has asked manufacturers of sedative-hypnotic sleep medicines to put stronger warning labels on their products so that consumers are more aware of the potential risks. Possible risks while taking such medicines include severe allergic reactions and dangerous sleep-related behaviors, including sleep-driving. As with all medication, certain side-effects are known and others are not known. It is important to consider the side-effects and to do some research into the medication being prescribed to determine if the side-effects are worse than the symptoms associated with your sleep concerns. Discuss these with your medical doctor or pharmacist. Dr. Huntoon has lots of experience with supporting people back to normal sleep cycles.
