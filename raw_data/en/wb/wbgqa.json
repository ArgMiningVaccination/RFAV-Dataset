The answer to this question will probably have a variety of responses depending on one's orientation and perspective. Being personally well-versed in both, I'll offer my feelings as simply a personal perspective. Our family used homeopathic remedies almost exclusively for over twenty years, and then a good friend introduced me to the world of essential oils. As much as I appreciated and valued homeopathic remedies, essential oils quickly far surpassed much of what I'd experienced in homeopathy, especially in regard to pain and breathing issues. We eventually felt that using essential oils alongside homeopathy is appropriate and beneficial, such as in the case of a fall or head injury where we might first give Arnica homeopathic remedy and then apply Lavender or BruisEase topically. Kurt Schnaubelt, PhD wrote in The Healing Intelligence of Essential Oils: \"When combining essential oils with homeopathy, check the antidotes for individual remedies. For example: Peppermint will antidote remedies in the Natrum family (Nat. Mur., Nat. Phos., etc.). Chamomile and oils with high camphor content may have an effect on some homeopathic remedies. Otherwise the two protocols should be compatible. As a case in point, Madam Marguerite Maury, using essential oils, and her husband E. A. Maury, M.D., using homeopathic remedies, practiced together to the benefit of their patients.\" We are careful to always open homeopathic bottles in a room without essential oil or other aromas present and administer the pellets there. We may wait about 30 minutes and then apply essential oils topically. If we take essential oils internally, we prefer to have a space of 2 hours between the essential oil use and taking the homeopathic remedy. Preferably, the homeopathic remedy is taken first. Most homeopaths feel strongly that one should avoid eucalyptus, peppermint and possibly tea tree when taking homeopathic remedies. Some homeopaths suggest that all aromatics be avoided because they feel the aromatics might antidote the remedy, but they may also feel that they want to have a good picture of how the person is responding to the homeopathic remedy and therefore would not want the person to take anything that might alter the outcome. As Schnaubelt noted, homeopaths versed in naturopathy have used both homeopathic and essential oils successfully. One reported that the Psoric class of remedies (such as Sulphur and Psorinum) are the most susceptible to being antidoted by aromatics, coffee, mints and so on. Others feel that essential oils may combine their efforts with homeopathic remedies and give better results than either used singly. Dr. Vivian Lunny is an aromatherapist who has also studied homeopathy, and she has found that Chamomile homeopathic granules used with a child cutting teeth is more effective when Roman Chamomile essential oil is applied topically on the cheeks than if either are used independently. My personal experience has been that both homeopathic remedies and essential oils can be used effectively together within reason. We definitely only open the homeopathic bottles and administer them in a 'safe' room (no aromatics from kitchen, candles, essential oils and so on) and then apply essential oils if we feel they will benefit the situation. In some circumstances, one might feel to take the remedy, and then wait an hour or two to use the essential oil. We currently offer a small selection of homeopathic remedies that we've found helpful alongside using essential oils. There are many we could carry, but for now, we offer this limited selection due to experience and the \"demand\" for them. These remedies are beneficial for many aliments, but here we'll only offer brief explanations for how we've used them and found them helpful. For more detailed information, you may want to invest in a user-friendly book such as Homeopathic Medicine at Home by Maesimund B. Panos, M.D. and Jane Heimlich.
