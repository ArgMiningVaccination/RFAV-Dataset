Served as stuffing or dressing, this buttery herb toasted bread dish is absolutely incredible!", "sitename": "How Sweet Eats", "date": "2020-11-02", "cleaned_text": "Our Favorite Buttery Herb Stuffing. This is the best stuffing recipe ever! Seriously, it's our favorite stuffing and the only one I make now. The edges are golden and crunchy, the inside is soft. It's wildly flavorful and buttery and filled with herbs and most importantly, a delicious neutral flavor that truly goes with any meal. Stuffing is by FAR my favorite side dish. In fact, Thanksgiving is alllll about the side dishes for me. Each one gets better than the last. And yes, technically this would be considered dressing since I'm serving it outside the bird. However! You can use this to stuff the bird if you wish. I've done it both ways, because we have a few family members who loved stuffing from inside the turkey. I also think it's a fairly regional thing? No one here calls stuffing \"dressing\" - really ever! It's always stuffing, and that's what I grew up with. But that's neither here nor there. I wanted to share my favorite best stuffing recipe with you today because we're all about the classics this year. I want my Thanksgiving plate to taste like it did all those wonderful, comforting cozy years ago. P.S. yes this is one of very few recipes you will find where I use celery. I still loathe it, but find it an important building block of flavor in stuffing! My mom has always made delicious stuffing. It's completely traditional and classic because as I've said every year, my family absolutely loses it if there is an unconventional dish on the table. I mean, remember the one year I tried to bring butternut squash lasagna? Did not go over well. But really, my mom's stuffing is so good. This recipe is a modern twist on hers - very similar ingredients, but more fresh herbs. Also, still lots of butter. LOTS. It's worth it! It's Thanksgiving, and butter gives you that toasty, rich flavor with the crispy crunchy edges. This recipe feeds about eight people, but I'll be the first to tell you that in my house, stuffing always goes first. It's one thing that people usually take seconds of, and it's the one dish they also want to take home for leftovers! So because of that, I never mind making a lot. If you're scaling down your celebration this year, I'm happy to tell you that this recipe can be cut in half easily! And if you're feeling more people, you can easily double this too. Honestly, I always double this for the reasons above. I liiiiive for stuffing. If you have leftover stuffing... I suggest using it for a [ breakfast hash skillet with eggs](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2011/11/day-after-thanksgiving-breakfast-hash-with-cheddar-mashed-potato-pancakes/). I've also successfully thrown it in a waffle maker to create a stuffing waffle. Now that is incredible. You can use it on a Thanksgiving leftover sandwich, stuff in inside of bell peppers or simply freeze it to bring it our on a chilly night in winter. It's the best dinner time treat! Now I know that I'm all about the classic stuffing this year. But if you're craving more variety, I have quite the selection to choose from. Last year I showed you how to make this [but grilled the bread](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2019/11/grilled-bread-stuffing/), which adds a really great twist. I've also done [slow cooker stuffing](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2017/11/slow-cooker-stuffing/) before too, in case you don't want to really bother with it! And, this [double bread stuffing recipe](https://www.howsweeteats.com/2011/11/double-bread-stuffing-with-brown-butter-bacon-sage/) that so many of you use every year and love! Which stuffing is your favorite to make?! Best Stuffing Recipe! Our Favorite Buttery Herb Stuffing Ingredients - 18 to 24 ounces bread cubes, (1.5 loaves of bread, or about 12 to 14 cups) preferably toasted or stale - 1 cup [unsalted butter](https://www.target.com/p/land-o-lakes-unsalted-butter-1lb/-/A-13227053?aflt=plt) - 3 cups diced sweet onion, roughly 2 large onions - 2 cups [diced celery](https://www.target.com/p/celery-hearts-16oz-2ct-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-78873570?aflt=plt) - 6 [garlic cloves,](https://www.target.com/p/spice-world-fresh-whole-garlic-3ct-bag/-/A-14917318?aflt=plt)minced - kosher salt and pepper - 3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage - 3 tablespoons [chopped fresh parsley](https://www.target.com/p/gourmet-garden-lightly-dried-parsley-0-35oz/-/A-49132051?aflt=plt) - 3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary - 2 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable stock - 2 [large eggs](https://www.target.com/p/vital-farms-pasture-raised-grade-a-large-eggs-12ct/-/A-18783617?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab) - a mixture of fresh herbs for sprinkling Instructions - Note about the bread cubes! You have options here. Stale or toasty bread works best. The first option is that you can cut 1 \u00bd pounds of bread into cubes, place it in a large baking dish, loosely tent with foil and let it sit overnight. You can also cut the cubes and put them in oven, toasting them at 350 degrees F until they are like croutons, about 15 minutes or so. Finally, you can buy the toasted bread cubes in bags from the store. It's your choice! You can also choose the size of your cubes. They can be small or larger for a more rustic stuffing. - My mom has always used a mixture of stale and fresh bread. Also, I like to use different kinds of bread (usually two), like a sourdough and italian, and mix the cubes. It provides great texture. - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush a 9x13 baking dish (you can also use a larger baking dish or a larger foil roasting pan too!) with melted butter, olive oil or spray with nonstick spray. Place the bread in a large mixing bowl (this may be easier for you to stir!) or the baking dish that you will bake it in. You can also separate this into two baking dishes if it's easier. - Heat the butter in a large skillet or dutch oven over medium heat. Once melted, stir in the onion, celery and garlic with a big pinch of salt and pepper - at least \u00bd to 1 teaspoon each. Cook until the onions and celery soften, about 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the sage, parsley and rosemary. Cook for another minute. Stir in 1 cup of stock. - Pour the onion celery mixture over the bread crumbs and toss well to coat. - In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the remaining 1 \u00bd cups stock and 2 eggs. - Pour that mixture into the bread cubes and stir and fold the bread cubes until thoroughly combined. Bake the stuffing for 45 to 50 minutes, until the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F. If the stuffing is getting too browned, you can tent it with foil. - I have successfully made this a day ahead of time and reheated it - it's just as good! emove the pan from the fridge 60 minutes before reheating it. You can also use this mixture to stuff the bird if you wish! - To serve 4: Cut this recipe in half exactly and bake it in an 8x8 or 9x9 inch dish. I bake for the same amount of time. - To serve 12 to 18: Double this recipe exactly. Bake in a large baking dish, like a 10x15 roasting pan, or baking in two 9x13 baking dishes. I bake for roughly the same amount of time, or about 15 minutes longer. Notes [bon appetit](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/simple-is-best-dressing-51124210) Did you make this recipe?
