Ayurveda: A Life of Balance The Complete Guide to Ayurvedic Nutrition and Body Types with Recipes [Maya Tiwari](https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Maya-Tiwari/410047840) Table of Contents About The Book Product Details - Publisher: Healing Arts Press (December 1, 1994) - Length: 368 pages - ISBN13: 9780892814909 Browse Related Books Raves and Reviews \"In her book, Maya introduces the Ayurvedic diet with a universal flavor and shows how to awaken Ahamkara (the memory of who we really are) through the proper use of wholesome foods. By understanding our individual body types, and using foods that best support and enhance each one, we are employing a powerful and essential method of attunement. I am truly grateful to Maya and a handful of other Vedic scholars who continue to devote their lives to sharing this knowledge with the rest of the world. A world that is in great need and which, hopeful, may finally be ready to receive it.\" - Lindsay Wagner Actress and author \"Ayurveda: A Life of Balance is a very complete and authoritative manual on the Vedic principles of health and nutrition, written by a well-respected expert in the field. It will be of great benefit to the layman and professional alike.\" - Deepak Chopra, M.D. Author of Quantum Healing and Perfect Health \"Bri. Maya is indeed the shining Yogi. Her book will benefit everyone who is conscious of personal health and global environment. - Barbara Y.E. Pyle Vice President Turner Broadcasting System \"Maya Tiwari has been carving her own life-niche for many years. Forced by cancer to re-evaluate and refine her life that it might help to heal her, she returned to her own roots in Ayurveda, and from those roots has sprouted this book, a book which is both part of her therapy and a way to share her experience with others who need to heal. Inspired by Ayruveda, this book testifies to how Maya has successfully integrated its principles into her own life, and how others can do the same, to make their lives happy, healthy, and harmonious.\" - Dr. Robert E. Suoboda Ayurvedic physician and author of Prakruti \"Here is a very special person who has journeyed through cancer, healed herself and now teaches others how to cross over the dark passages to light and life. This deeply personal and spiritual offering is a necessity to everyone who seeks to know the ancient secrets of healing from the Ayurvedas.\" - Dr. Wally Burnstein Physician and anti-food irradiation activist \"Maya Tiwari's gift to us is that her life of study, reflection, healing and becoming is a perpetual unfolding act. She has through personal experience and example acquired rich insight into an elusive ancient subject. Her book is faithful to the original precepts of Ayurveda which reveals the immortal principles of health and, ultimately, Self-realization.\" - Scott Gerson, M.D. Director, Ayurvedic Medicine of New York President, Foundation for Holistic Medic Resources and Downloads High Resolution Images - [Book Cover Image (jpg): Ayurveda: A Life of Balance](//d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/onix/cvr9780892814909/ayurveda-a-life-of-balance-9780892814909_hr.jpg)Trade Paperback 9780892814909 You may also like: Thriller and Mystery Staff Picks More to Explore Our Summer Reading Recommendations Red-hot romances, poolside fiction, and blockbuster picks, oh my!
