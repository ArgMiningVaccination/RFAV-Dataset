It claims well over one million membersand counts nearly two and a half million worshipersin its churches in any given week. Founded in HotSprings, Arkansas in 1914, its headquarters since1918 have been in Springfield, Missouri. 1 As Pentecostals, Assemblies of God members trace their history to a revival that began in Kansas in1901 and flowered in Los Angeles between 1906 and1908. Marked by a conviction that the end of theworld was upon them, participants in this revivalbelieved they were part of an end-times restoration of the power of New Testament Christianity, completewith the signs and wonders that had followed Christand the apostles. Many accepted the name \"ApostolicFaith Movement\" and claimed that the New Testament gifts of the Spirit were restored among them. They spoke in tongues, interpreted tongues,prophesied, exercised gifts of healing, and reveled in intense religious experiences, but their greatestpassion was evangelism. Since they thought Christwas about to return, they felt they had an urgent call to save the world. 2 The burst of spiritual energy that animated thousands of ordinary men and women in this turn-of-the-century revival ultimately shaped a handful ofnew denominations as well as many less structuredThe Assemblies of God Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions By Edith L.

Blumhofer is Professor of History and Director of the Institute for the Study of Ameri can Evangelicals at Wheaton College.THEASSEMBLIES OF GODTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSassociations, but its first result was a confusing array of options\u2014and abuses. A radical empha-sis on faith beckoned some to set out, with novisible means of support, to evangelize theworld; a stress on spiritual gifts led to the use oftongues and their interpretation to obtain divineguidance on whom to marry or where to live;enthusiasm for the power of the Spirit con-vinced some that formal education inevitablyquenched the Spirit. To respond to such ten-dencies and to provide a degree of order whilepreserving congregational autonomy and \"freedom\" in the Spirit, several hundredPentecostals\u2014most, but not all, white\u2014heeded the summons to a \"general council\" forPentecostals. There they organized the Assemblies of God. They knew they needed sta-bility, but they prized independence from \"deaddenominations\" so fiercely that they called theirnew association a \"fellowship\" rather than achurch or a denomination, and they did not bother to articulate a statement of faith. That statement came two years later, when a \"revelation\" about the Trinity disruptedAmerican Pentecostalism and permanently frac-tured relationships among emerging clusters ofchurches. In the throes of a mass exodus by those who rejected orthodox views on the Trinityand accepted rebaptism to manifest their newopinion, the Assemblies of God in 1916 crafteda Statement of Fundamental Truths. This docu-ment met the needs of the moment with a longsection on the doctrinal issues at stake in thecurrent controversy, though it did not offerstatements on the full range of Christian doc-trine. That came only in the 1960s, as theAssemblies of God assumed an ever larger rolein the post-World-War II evangelical community.Despite its omissions, the 1916 Statement ofFundamental Truths included clear language on the four points that are often regarded as the denomination's four cardinal doctrines:humankind's need for salvation by faith inChrist; divine healing as \"in the atonement\";holiness\u2014or sanctification\u2014as God's call forbelievers; and the premillennial and alwaysimminent physical return of Christ to \"rapture\" the church. DIVINE HEALING Belief in divine healing characterized early Pentecostals, who regarded it as integral to the gospel. The Assemblies of God was stronglyinfluenced by an array of people who hadembraced the notion of divine healing under theuncompromising teaching of a fiery turn-of-the-century preacher named John Alexander Dowie.A Scotsman by birth and education, Dowiebegan his career in Australia, then migrated to the United States in the 1880s and settled inChicago during the 1890s. He organized theChristian Catholic Church in 1895 and attractedsuch a large following that in 1901 he unveiledplans for a utopian community called Zion City.Located twenty-five miles north of Chicago onLake Michigan, Dowie's Zion became home tosome 6,000 of his followers. Dowie's effortsrevolved around healing. He prayed for thesick; bullied the medical profession; and sternlydenounced all medicines, pork products, tobac-co, and alcohol. No medicine could be pur-chased in Zion; no one could smoke within its boundaries; no physician could practice. Dowie refused to pray for anyone who did not manifestfaith by discarding medicine. He welcomed theill to large homes he called faith homes. There(without their medicines) they received instruc-tion in divine healing, ate a healthful diet, andwere buoyed by the earnest prayers of Dowieand his associates. The communal aspect ofZion City life disintegrated in 1907 amid eco-nomic woes and allegations of improprieties onDowie's part. This disintegration coincided withthe appearance in Chicago of the firstPentecostal evangelists, who easily attracted some of Dowie's staunchest adherents, men andwomen accustomed to stating their beliefs in nouncertain terms and then acting upon them.Some of these followers had been tarred andfeathered in American towns when they pro- 2claimed Dowie's gospel of physical healing. They brought their no-nonsense message of faith for healing\u2014and their adamant rejection ofmedicine and doctors\u2014into the Assemblies ofGod. 3 The insistence that healing was \"in the atone- ment\" meant that Pentecostals believed Christ'sdeath had purchased physical healing as well asspiritual redemption. They quoted familiarwords from Isaiah 53: \"By his stripes we arehealed.\" They took healing \"by faith\" just asthey appropriated the forgiveness of sins, andthen they acted upon their conviction. Theyaccounted for those whom their prayers did notheal by explaining that either sin or lack of faithprecluded healing. Early Pentecostals thoughtthat the whole community of believers hadresponsibility to pray for the sick, while pastorsand church leaders had a special responsibility\u2014following the instructions in James 5\u2014to anointthe sick with oil and offer prayer for healing.But actual healing was up to the believer, whowas responsible to appropriate it by faith, unhin-dered by known sin or unbelief. 4 Early Pentecostal publications record many testimonies to physical healing in response tothe prayers of local communities of believers.But they also indicate that Pentecostals acted ontheir belief that some people possessed special\"gifts of healing\" by seeking out such peopleand requesting their prayers. Some with these\"gifts\" offered prayer cloths for those who couldnot attend services, but any evangelist who wasperceived to exercise gifts of healing couldcount on a steady stream of health seekers solic-iting his or her special prayers. Prayer wassometimes accompanied by the laying on ofhands and anointing with oil. Throughout thetwentieth century, a changing group of highlypublic figures have claimed these gifts, andhopeful believers have flocked from one to theother in search of healing. 5Evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson was famous in the 1920s days\" she included in her largecity-wide campaigns. 6After World War II, Pentecostals\u2014including many Assemblies of Godmembers\u2014thrilled to the miracles and preaching of Oral Roberts, JackCoe, A. A. Allen, and Kathryn Kuhlman. Theconcentrated and sustained efforts of healingevangelists after World War II led some to duban interrelated cluster of ministries a salvation-healing revival. 7This heritage of fervent prayer for miracles, of dependence on prayer as thepreferred source of healing, and of nagging guiltabout lack of faith or the presence of hidden sinwhen prayer does not bring a miracle, are partof the contemporary legacy of many members ofthe Assemblies of God. A constituency attunedto seeing and feeling direct evidences of thesupernatural nurtures a preference for miracleseven as its leaders wrestle with modern com-plexities in the light of a heritage that oftenprefers to discount historical development andattempt a restoration of apostolic Christianity. Dowie was not the only source of a radical rejection of medicines and doctors. Another sizable part of the first Assemblies of God con-stituency came from a split in the ChristianMissionary Alliance whose leader, A. B.Simpson, staunchly supported the message ofhealing in the atonement. Simpson did notabsolutely condemn medicines, but he urged hisfollowers to relinquish doctors in favor of prayeras a better way. He taught \"divine health,\"which held that the gospel \"quickened the mor-tal body\" as well as saved the soul, and arguedthat its physical advantages stood available tothe well and the sick. Other Assemblies of God adherents had been part of the Holiness Movement, which often embraced the samemessage of divine healing. The consensus inthe first generation might be stated somethinglike this: When one was taken ill, the properresponse was searching the heart to determinethat no sin stood in the way of one's prayers.Believing prayer on the part of the individual and a supportive community followed, oftenincluding anointing with oil by one's pastor oranother religious leader. Doctors, medicines,and traditional hospitals were simply notoptions, but \"anointed handkerchiefs\" from 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERpeople who claimed the gift of healing were.8 Teaching about divine healing in the atonement gave this view a theological base while economicrealities made it a practical response. The insis-tence that healing was in the atonement andoffered to all in response to believing prayermade it available to any and all without ritual or price. The same \"whosoever will\" thatundergirded their Arminian gospel soundedfrom Assemblies of God pulpits when the sub-ject was healing. In The Pentecostal Evangel , a weekly publica- tion of the Assemblies of God, poems like \"Jesusmy Health\" offered devotional encouragement to the ill. 9Pentecostals found it necessary fre- quently to denounce Mary Baker Eddy, since herfollowers also refused medical aid and seemed toskeptical outsiders to resemble Pentecostals. 10 The question of medical precautions for the growing number of Assemblies of God mission- aries led to the first unofficial easing of the popular \"hard line\" on medicine. Though not all took advantage of the opportunity, evidencesuggests that missionaries were quietly told thattaking malaria pills was a decision they couldmake for themselves. In the 1920s, the govern-ment of the Belgian Congo refused a party ofAssemblies of God missionaries permission totravel unless they took malaria pills. They wait-ed three months for advice from Assemblies ofGod headquarters. When it came, it reflected the hard-nosed common sense of one of thedenomination's founders: trust God and takeyour medicine. 11 The 1920s also brought increased awareness of the relationship among sanitary conditions,diet, and health. In May 1926, The Pentecostal Evangel reported on the Indianapolis Faith Hospital, started in 1924 on the model of a faithhome by Assemblies of God Pastor Earl Clark.The hospital was next door to the Four-Fold Gospel Tabernacle. There the faithful tended the sick (without medicines), prayed for theirhealing, and travailed in prayer for their souls. 12 A gifted physician who joined the Assemblies of God, Lilian Yeomans, beat the anti-medicinedrum during the '20s, '30s, and '40s by recount- ing her own addiction to morphine, her healingin response to the prayers of John AlexanderDowie, and her cynicism about modern medi-cine. Her writings and evangelistic efforts kepther opinions before the Assemblies of God constituency at least until World War II. 13The Assemblies of God still offers some of her books, as it does books compiled from the ser- mons of another stalwart foe of medicine, theoutspoken British Pentecostal evangelist SmithWigglesworth, whose work has surged in popu- larity in the past decade. Meanwhile, at the sametime that such people thundered against themedical profession, Assemblies of God membersorganized to minister to the sick in hospitals invarious ways\u2014often with evangelistic motive.They worked in the same way in military hospi- tals, and among lepers and other gravely ill onthe mission field. 14 It is important to recognize this legacy, for its vestiges persist, strengthened in recent decadesat the popular level by tendencies in parts of theindependent charismatic renewal. Pentecostalsof all denominational labels and none still flockto those who claim the ability to lengthen legsor exorcise the \"demon\" of cancer. 15While the Assemblies of God distanced itself officially inthe 1960s from what was known as theSalvation-Healing Revival, the impulses thatshaped that movement continue to thrive. Theuse of signs and wonders for evangelism remainsattractive, and utterance gifts like prophecy andtongues still appeal to those intent on giving andreceiving personal guidance, while \"spiritualmapping,\" territorial demons, and \"dream read-ings\" show that the Pentecostal and charismaticmovements' creative impulses still flourish. 16 Apprehending an Assemblies of God \"posi- tion\" or \"view\" on medical and ethical choicesis complicated by this history, as well asAssemblies of God polity. For most of its histo-ry, the Assemblies of God resisted acknowledg-ing itself as a denomination. Rather, it regardeditself as a fellowship of ordained ministers andother authorized (credentialed) workers who 4 THEASSEMBLIES OF GODTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSTHEPARKRIDGE CENTERpresided over churches that had considerable autonomy within guidelines provided by aGeneral Council. This Council organized its members into geographic districts that largelyfollow state lines and later added regional districts to accommodate its sizable Hispanicmembership. Adding to the diversity is the fact that Assemblies of God congregations embrace widely different worship styles. Some stressexperience and nurture emotional release, while others embrace a conservative style thatfocuses on preaching rather than on individualexpression. The Church Growth Movement has considerable appeal, as has contemporaryworship. The majority of Assemblies of God adherents gather in small congregations, some of whichare more \"plugged in\" to denominational pro-grams than are others. Although in recent decades the denomination has found ways todemand doctrinal conformity\u2014especially onspeaking in tongues as \"uniform, initial, imme-diate\" evidence of the baptism of the HolySpirit\u2014it remains difficult to describe a \"typical\"Assemblies of God congregation, and impossibleto state conclusively that Assemblies of Godmembers adhere to all the same views regardinghealthcare decisions. Ministers (and any whohold denominational credentials, e.g., evangel-ists, missionaries) are required to uphold officialstatements, but the rank and file may choose tobe guided or not by those statements. This real- ity is further complicated by the fact that onlyslightly more than half of those who attendAssemblies of God churches bother to join. The Assemblies of God places negligible empha- sis on ecclesiology and it often attracts a mobileconstituency. While there are many ways ofidentifying different subcultures within theAssemblies of God, here it is probably most useful to note two major streams: those who are fourth- and fifth-generation Assemblies ofGod adherents, and those who have recently embraced the denomination's emphases. Both streams have in common the Statementof Fundamental Truths, with its affirmation of divine healing as an \"integral part\" of theirChristian faith. Since the 1970s, the denomina-tion's highest legislative body has issued occa-sional Position Papers that seek to clarify for the constituency a proper response to the mostcompelling modern religious, social, and ethicalissues. While these statements have officialstanding and must be affirmed by ministers and other credentialed workers, their actualinfluence among a constituency that values asubstantial degree of independence for the localchurch is difficult to assess. The headquarters also offers \"Perspectives\" on complex questions,brief statements providing guidance rooted inperceived consensus but without official sanc-tion of the General Presbytery, the highestAssemblies of God legislative body. Takentogether, these statements document a clearmove away from the views on health and healing that characterized the first generation. Several factors have influenced this shift. The constituency is more educated, and after World War II a tradition of clergy education beyond Assemblies of God institutions undoubt- edly played a role in accelerating change. Ethicsis a relatively new discipline in the Assembliesof God college curriculum, where it remainsmore conspicuous for its absence than for itsinfluence. An end-times movement that settlesin for the long term eventually turns its atten-tion to this-worldly questions, and the experi-ences of history force it to wrestle with issuesthat once seemed to have easy answers. Suchhas been the case with the Assemblies of God. Affirming the turn of its members to the medical world for healing solves some problemsbut also creates new dilemmas. In recentdecades, the Assemblies of God has addressed\u2014formally and informally\u2014a growing list of ethical questions posed by advances in modernmedicine. It approaches all of them from firm,biblically based convictions about the sanctity of human life and the sufficiency of scripture asthe guide for all of life's choices. The followingguiding principles underlie Assemblies of God 5THEASSEMBLIES OF GODTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSunderstandings of health and healing: Humankind is created by God and bears God's image. God values human life. All human life is sacred. God gives life, and God takes life. God is in control; assertions of personal autonomy rebel against God's sovereignty. God offers forgiveness and reconciliation, but God never condones sin. Agrowing number of Assemblies of God members are healthcare professionals. A handful hold degrees from prestigious medicalschools, and since the 1950s, Evangel University(formerly Evangel College), the Assemblies ofGod liberal arts institution in Springfield, Missouri, has offered a popular nursing pro-gram. Unlike Lilian Yeomans, for whom healing entailed relinquishing a medical practice, thesemodern Assemblies of God healers and care-givers find no inherent conflict between God and medicine. Some even hold Assemblies ofGod credentials. As has been the case on other issues, the concerns of Assemblies of God mis-sionaries helped force reconsideration of healthcare at home. After considerable resistance\u2014andbefore it dealt with the relationship between divine healing and medicine at home\u2014theAssemblies of God approved a fully equippedhospital in Calcutta. It has since vastly expand-ed its medical presence abroad. The Assemblies of God teaches that human beings are created by God in His image. It holds that Christians should emulate Christ's love andconcern for suffering humanity and espouses anethic that values self-denial in service to others.Caregivers serve others as ministers or servants ofChrist, extending His compassion to those in need. When Assemblies of God adherents are patients, the denomination's teaching encouragesthem to look to God as Source of healing whilethey comply with the medical advice they areoffered. When possible, adherents are encour-aged to seek out Christian physicians and to prayand counsel with them before beginning medicalprocedures. All Assemblies of God adherents\u2014 caregivers and patients\u2014are always encouraged toevangelize, and so the concern of either for thesoul of the other may become evident in anyrelationship. The Assemblies of God teachesthat one can be absolutely certain of one's salva-tion and that one who has trusted Christ neednot fear death. Adherents believe that God's willoverrules, that prayer is effective, and that salva- tion is ultimately more important than healing. CLINICAL I SSUES Self-determination, informed consent, and truth-telling The denomination encourages physicians to dis- cuss with patients the choices and circumstancesof medical treatments so that patients can beinformed and involved. Patients whose immedi-ate families do not share their religious beliefsmay value the counsel of fellow believers overthat of family members. They may also respondmore readily to the advice of an evangelical physi-cian than to the opinions of someone who doesnot speak their language of religious conviction. Anticipating difficult treatment decisions The Assemblies of God urges its members to think about care decisions before they becomecritically ill and to seek the counsel of spiritualleaders, Christian physicians, and family inanticipating decisions. (See also \"Forgoing life-sustaining treatment,\" CENTERFAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATION The Assemblies of God strongly endorses the nuclear family and affirms the sanctity of marriage. It supports with enthusiasm theviews and programs of the popular speaker andauthor, James Dobson, and his \"Focus on theFamily.\" The denomination rejects sexual activ- ity outside of marriage and actively discouragesdivorce and remarriage. Assemblies of Godchurches often sponsor marriage enrichment opportunities. Assemblies of God leaders responded to the growing cultural awareness of homosexuality with a Position Paper, Homosexuality and the Bible , which summarizes the denomination's views on the subject. The denomination holdsthat homosexual behavior is a sin and thatgrowing public acceptance of\u2014or tolerance for\u2014 homosexuals is a symptom of a broader \"spiritu-al disorder\" that poses a threat to the traditionalfamily, the government, and the church. Thepaper argues that homosexual behavior runscontrary to God's created order for relationships,but also that, like other sins, homosexualbehavior can be forgiven and the offender reconciled. The Assemblies of God issued its Position Paper on homosexuality in 2001 amid cultural changes that made clarification of the denomi- nation's historic stance seem urgent. Whilelabeling homosexual behavior \"sinful,\" theAssemblies of God seeks to help the penitenttoward \"deliverance\" from the homosexuallifestyle. It urges members not to hate or fearhomosexuals, but instructs them not to condonehomosexual behavior. And it advises membersto enlist the help of professional counselors andpastors as well as the support of appropriateChristian organizations in the struggle to helphomosexuals abandon their past and embracethe traditional relationships that adherentsbelieve the Bible teaches.CLINICAL I SSUES New reproductive technologies If a couple is unable to have children, the religious community prays for a miracle. The couple may also opt for fertility treatments. While the denomination has no specific stance on artificial insemination by donors, its mem-bers are always encouraged to evaluate decisions in the context of the sanctity of family and theunderstanding that life is a gift from God.While procedures using spousal ovum and sperm might be acceptable, artificial insemina-tion by another donor might pose problems. Contraception Birth control is widely practiced to postpone or space the births of children. Abortion isabsolutely rejected as a form of birth control, as is the aborting of a physically abnormal fetus(see \"Abortion and the status of the fetus,\"below). Prenatal diagnosis and treatment Assemblies of God members regard the embryo as a human being from conception. While theydo not object to prenatal diagnosis and treat-ment of the fetus, they do not believe that anyone has the right to take the life of anyunborn child. Abortion and the status of the fetus Abortion is another health-related issue that agitated the culture sufficiently to elicit aPosition Paper from Assemblies of God leader- ship. The main points of A Biblical Position on Abortion are as follows: The Assemblies of God unequivocally opposes abortion, calling it\"immoral\" and \"a sin.\" In the following quota-tions from the note the repetition of\"The Bible recognizes . . . ,\" a reminder thedenomination's firm commitment to the verbalinspiration of Scripture: THEASSEMBLIES OF GODTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS1. The Bible recognizes that a woman is with child even in the first stages of pregnancy. . . . 2. The Bible recognizes that God is active in the creative process of forming new life. To abort apregnancy is to abort the work God is doing. . . . 3. The Bible recognizes that God has plans for the unborn child. Only He knows the potential of thisnew life. . . . 4. The Bible recognizes that God is sovereign in all things, including the quality of life of theunborn child. . . . The last point addresses directly the matter of aborting deformed fetuses, an action denomina-tional leaders reject. When pregnancy threatensthe life of the mother, on the other hand, thePosition Papers offers no direct guidance beyond urging prayer and the advice of a prolife physician. The Assemblies of God finds many ways to encourage adherents to act on the abortion issue as involved citizens, and local churchesoften act on behalf of the unborn. Their leadershope that Assemblies of God members will prayabout America's moral decline and find publicforums that allow them to present biblical moralinstruction. They urge adherents to counselpregnant women about the alternative of adop-tion. For many years, the Assemblies of God has acted on this view by supporting theHighlands Child Placement Services andMaternity Home, a facility in Kansas City,Missouri. The denomination also encourages its members to support prolife legislation, toalert their elected representatives to their views,and to oppose any legislation that threatens the\"moral fiber\" of American society. 8GENETICS The Assemblies of God has strong reserva-tions about cloning. It urges members to remember \"the ofhuman life\" and warns human life outside of God's parame-ters is an attempt to usurp God's greatest act ofcreation, that of human life possessing bothbody and soul.\" While the denomination's Perspective paper, Genetic Alteration and Cloning , offers guarded approval of the cloning of animals\u2014as long as animals are not mistreat-ed\u2014it firmly rejects any mixing of human andanimal cells.THEPARKRIDGE CENTERWith assurance that \"our mortal body\" does not inherit the kingdom of God and that at death \"we have no more need of the fallenmortal bodies we now bear,\" the Assemblies of God supports organ donation, offering somenovel rationales. Not surprisingly, one of theseis evangelistic: if the organ goes to one who isnot yet \"born again,\" that individual may gain\"time and opportunity to accept Christ.\" If theorgan goes to a fellow believer, it may enableeffective Christian service on the part of the recipient. A Perspective titled Organ Donation imagines the potential impact if Christiandonors stipulated that the organs be deliveredwith a hand-written letter of testimony to theirfaith. The same document states clearly that itis not sinful to refuse to donate one's organs.The choice is left to the individual, who is encouraged to state a preference before a crisis arrives. 9ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION MENTAL HEALTH Since World War II, the Assemblies of God has sponsored a growing emphasis on coun- seling and psychology. Its seminary and itsundergraduate colleges offer courses that trainits workers to address from a clinical standpointsituations that earlier Pentecostals would havedeemed spiritual rather than mental problems.Although the denomination has no official pro-nouncement on mental health issues, its train-ing of mental health professionals indicates itsrecognition of the need for available resourcesto counsel and treat the mentally ill. Assemblies of God doctrine emphasizes human sinfulness and brokenness apart fromthe saving work of Christ. It recognizes as wellthe lingering effects of substance abuse andother addictions in the lives of many recent con-verts. Just as the Assemblies of God endorsesmedicine, so it embraces the healing arts oftherapy and treatment for the mentally troubled.As with other forms of illness, the denominationprays for healing while encouraging adherentsto seek the assistance of competent mental health professionals. While the denomination has no official stance on specific clinical procedures that may be usedin mental institutions, it always encourages participation of family and spiritual leaders indecisions about treatment and encourages thepatient's input insofar as possible. The denomination offers training for people who plan to use counseling skills within thedenomination as well as in the secular market-place. It prepares professionals to work in stateand federal institutions, substance abuse clinics,juvenile centers, and hospitals and medical clinics as well as in counseling centers andchurch-related settings. The focus of Assemblies of God mental health professionalsis to integrate biblical, theological, and psycho-logical principles in a way that will stimulateself-understanding and healing.THEASSEMBLIES OF GODTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSThe Assemblies of God teaches that to be \"absent from the body\" is to be \"present with the Lord.\" Death is the entrance to eternallife, and although parts of the end-times calen-dar await future fulfillment, those who die goimmediately to heaven or to hell\u2014to abundantlife or to eternal punishment. There is no official consensus on determining the moment of death, and opinions may differabout offering sustenance, especially when thedying can no longer take food and drink bymouth. Members are urged to counsel withtheir spiritual leaders and to make decisionsprayerfully, recognizing that God is the sourceand end of life and that the believer need notfear death. CLINICAL I SSUES Suicide, assisted suicide, and euthanasia Most basically, the Assemblies of God regards assisted suicide as an assault on the sanctity ofhuman life and as part of a larger \"evil philoso-phy\" that devalues suffering people. In A Biblical Perspective on Assisted Suicide , a Position Paper, the denomination urges on its pastors their responsibility to \"proclaimhumankind's dignity as God's sovereign cre-ation,\" \"reassert God's and meaning andhope for suffering humanity.\" The belief in thesanctity of human life is rooted in adherence toa doctrine of creation that makes God the cre-ator of humankind. Made in God's image, peo-ple are valuable to God who, in Christ, paid theprice for sin and purchased for His own those ofHis creatures who trust in Him. Suicide\u2014assist-ed or not\u2014manifests a penchant toward personalautonomy rather than a recognition of God'sright to His purchased possession\u2014or of the value God places on every human life. The denomination is committed to the view that God rules human existence and that Godsets the boundaries of human life. Just as God chooses the time of birth, God appoints a time for death. Thus, suicide, like abortion, is fundamentally \"a violation of His prerogative\"that ignores the \"profound spiritual implica-tions\" of the transition from life to death to life eternal. It unduly magnifies the self andrebels against the sovereignty of God. The core emphasis on the sanctity of all human life and the conviction that only God\u2014who gives life\u2014has the right to take life away also undergird Assemblies of God opposition toeuthanasia. In a Perspective called Euthanasia, [sic] and Extraordinary Support to Sustain Life , leaders urge the constituency to be aware ofabuses that may follow openness to euthanasia.They hark back to their history: \"Believing that supernatural healing is always possible, no matter what the medical prognosis may be,members of the Assemblies of God are moreinclined to pray for healing than to approve thetaking of life, even to avoid pain and suffering.\"And, since modern medicine can generally alleviate pain, they urge the faithful to remember that fear of pain does not justifymercy killing. In A Biblical Perspective on Assisted Suicide , Assemblies of God leaders acknowledge themystery of suffering and urge effective medical care combined with emotional and spiritualhelp, such as is often available through the hospice movement. They encourage membersto work toward \"changing people's hearts\" as aprerequisite to changing their views on the sanc-tity of life. For Assemblies of God members, the only way truly to set things right in thisworld is to win souls to Christ, thus changingtheir hearts. The denomination also encouragesadherents to offer loving care and emotionalsupport as hospital chaplains, hospice workers,or nursing facility staff. And they advise theconstituency to voice its commitment to moralvalues in the public arena, speaking out andelecting officials who share their convictions 10DEATH AND DYINGabout the dignity of human life and humankind's dependence on God. Forgoing life-sustaining treatment The Assemblies of God approaches the matter of sustaining life with medical technology byreminding adherents that each one has an\"appointed time\" to die. Denominational lead-ers encourage people to anticipate the questionof life support and to draw up a living will thatclearly declares the patient's wishes. Patientsare urged to make the decision about life-sustaining treatment after prayer and consulta-tion with a Christian physician and a spiritualleader. The basic issues here reflect tension between the valuing of human life and the Christian viewof death as entrance into heaven. Assemblies of God members have clear teaching on whathappens when a believer dies. They understandthat to be \"absent from the body\" is to be \"pres-ent with the Lord,\" and so they are taught toaffirm the joyous hope of eternal life in thepresence of God rather than to fear death. The Assemblies of God does not have an officialstance on life support, and its leaders recognizethat what one person chooses may not be appro-priate for another. And so they simply leave thedecision to individuals, while urging members to recall that questions of life and death restultimately with God, making it appropriate toseek God's will for specific situations. Last rites, burial, and mourning customs The Assemblies of God offers no last rites, although the family may welcome the presenceand prayers of its pastor. The denomination hasno stance on cremation; a small but increasingnumber of adherents opt for cremation overburial. The Assemblies of God reminds adher-ents that they \"sorrow not as others who haveno hope.\" Throughout the funeral and burial,sadness is tempered by the hope of resurrectionand eternal life. 11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERSPECIAL CONCERNS For Assemblies of God members\u2014especially \"old-timers\"\u2014concerns about modern healthcare issues start at the beginning with theuse of medicine itself. The Statement ofFundamental Truths, section 12, reads: \"Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel.Deliverance from sickness is provided for in theatonement, and is the privilege of all believers(Isaiah 53:4, 5; Matthew 8:16, 17; James 5:14-16).\" Not surprisingly, the denomination'sPosition Paper on healing, Divine Healing: An Integral Part of the Gospel, declares this state- ment \"scripturally sound,\" but it goes on to givethe statement a gloss that those who wrote it in1916 would likely not recognize. In the end,after a long, disconnected list of observations onspecific verses from the Old and NewTestaments that touch on healing, the writers admit: \"In humility we recognize that we donot understand all that pertains to divine heal- ing. We still see through a glass darkly. We donot understand why some are healed and othersare not. . . . Scripture makes it clear, however,that our part is to preach the Word and expectthe signs to follow.\" In 2000, the denomination issued a Position Paper called Ministry to People With Disabilities: A Biblical Perspective , in which leaders articu- lated a theology that made room for both supernatural miracles and compassionate out-reach to the permanently disabled. They calledthe church to find ways to relate to people withdisabilities and to affirm their dignity beforeGod. The denomination regards disabilities as a reminder that we live in a sin-cursed world,and it urges congregations to open themselvesto the disabled as people created in God'simage. While insisting that the greatest need ofthe disabled is salvation from sin, it calls Assemblies of God members to set an \"exampleof servanthood that [takes] ministry beyond miracles.\" For several generations, the vast majority of Assemblies of God members have enrolled inhealthcare plans and made use of doctors andmedicine. In one sense, the experiences of peo-ple who turned to medical help when they failedto find supernatural healing made it inevitablethat, sooner or later, Assemblies of God leaderswould feel a need to offer guidance on the evi-dent disparity between profession and reality.Denominational leaders now state plainly thatthe use of medicine and physicians is compati-ble with belief in divine healing. In fact, in thePerspective titled Modern Medicine and the Assemblies of God , they have turned oldassumptions upside down by describing those who refuse medicine as \"inconsistent in theirapplication of faith.\" This shift leads to anattempt to combine the old with the new: \"The use of modern medicine by Christians islegitimate but must never be a substitute fortrusting God. Whether we are healed throughthe aid of medicine or supernaturally, the goodgift of healing is from the Father.\" And so adherents are urged to pray while they consultphysicians and take their medicines. And theyare reminded that medical records can attest amiracle should God choose to act supernaturally.A fundamental tension between the full appre-hension of salvation now and aspects of theexperience that await the eschaton is nowheremore evident than in discussions of healing inthe atonement. 12 THEASSEMBLIES OF GODTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS1.

See, for example, The Pentecostal Evangel , 9 April 1927, 10. 15. Perhaps the best source for a general sense of how this contemporary religious scene operates may begained from Charisma , a glossy monthly magazine that is a mouthpiece of the charismatic renewal. In the1980s and 1990s, the Toronto Airport Vineyard andthe Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Fla.,were highly visible centers of the popular enthusiasmfor emotion-packed mass meetings featuring healingsand other spiritual phenomena. 16. The denomination's specific problems with the Salvation-Healing Revival had as much to do withpractice as with theology. Evangelists often lackedaccountability and made claims on the finances andloyalties of those who sought their prayers. Someopted to emphasize a wide range of supernatural services\u2014exorcisms, words of knowledge, or dreamreadings. Their interest in spirits led them to identifyterritorial demons and generational curses, any ofwhich might cause disease. As their interests expand-ed, they preached deliverance as well as healing, withan emphasis on the individual's deliverance fromSatanic oppression of any sort. 13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERNOTESTHEASSEMBLIES OF GODTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSAssemblies of God Position Papers (available at www.ag.org/top/beliefs/position_papers/0000_index.cfm): A Biblical Perspective on Assisted Suicide (1998) A Biblical Perspective on Abortion (1985) Divine Healing: An Integral Part of the Gospel (1974) Homosexuality and the Bible (2001) Ministry to People With Disabilities: A Biblical Perspective (2000) Non-binding Assemblies of God Perspectives (available at www.ag.org/top/beliefs/contemporary_issues/issues_00_list.cfm): Euthanasia, [sic] and Extraordinary Support to Sustain Life (1995) Genetic Alteration and Cloning (1995) Modern Medicine and the Assemblies of God (1995) Organ Donation (1995) Dedicated issues of The Pentecostal Evangel : 18 February 2001: \"Healing Is for Human Life\" 14BIBLIOGRAPHY16 THEASSEMBLIES OF GODTRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSReligious beliefs provide meaning for people confronting illness and seeking health, par- ticularly during times of crisis. Increasingly,healthcare workers face the challenge of provid-ing appropriate care and services to people of dif-ferent religious backgrounds. Unfortunately,many healthcare workers are unfamiliar with thereligious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practi-cal information about the values and beliefs ofdifferent religious traditions. It should assistnurses, physicians, chaplains, social workers, andadministrators in their decision making and caregiving. It can also serve as a reference for believ- ers who desire to learn more about their own tra-ditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should notsubstitute for discussion of patients' own reli- gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
