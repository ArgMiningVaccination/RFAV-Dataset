A.1.2 Mission The mission of Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada (SLAM NV) is to prepare students for postsecondary studies and careers through an engaging educational program emphasizing sports leadership and management career preparation. The proposed middle high school program will offer students in grades 6-12 opportunities in career exploration and internships through the following academies in the sports leadership and management arena: 1) Sports Medicine; 2) Sports Marketing and Entertainment Media; and 3) Sports Business and Management. A.1.3 Vision The vision of SLAM NV is to provide viable innovative educational choices for students ultimately yielding college bound and career-oriented graduates. A.1.4 Philosophy The School's instructional model is based on the philosophy of the three R's: Rigor, Relevance, and Relationships in the learning process. This model has proven successful in raising student achievement across middle and high schools nationwide. Attributed to the research of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the three R's represent the essential components that must be in place to effectively prepare students for the demands of the 21 st Century. A study conducted by Ronald Newell and Mark Van Ryzin of EdVision Schools, a Gates Foundation project, found that simply making greater demands on students will not ensure long-term success \"...especially for the students who have had little success in traditional settings.\" The study analyzed the effects of Rigor, Relevance, and Relationship in bringing about educational reform. It claimed that academic gains are \"short-lived if not accompanied by deeper levels of change in the learning community along the lines of the Rigor, Relevance, and Relationships (Newell & Van Ryzin, 2004).\" In order to produce college bound and career-oriented graduates, the founders of SLAM NV believe that the School must deliver Rigor and Relevance while cultivating Relationships in the educational program. These attributes, incorporated in the specific instructional strategies and in the academies, in addition to differentiated instructional techniques in the core curriculum, will serve to achieve the school's mission. Based on the R's model, SLAM NV Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 2 teachers will develop thematic lessons (as described in Attachment 3, herein) to provide real-world relevance to core subject matter while addressing rigorous content and key areas of the curriculum in alignment with Nevada Academic Achievement Standards (NACS). SLAM NV will actively seek and encourage both parental and community involvement in the school's programs in order to foster relationships that empower students to continuously strive for academic and personal success. The program will promote higher levels of student engagement in the curriculum through mentoring opportunities, community service projects, career advisors and athletes as role models, allowing for students to build positive relationships with their peers, their teachers, and their community. SLAM NV will use motivational engaging elective courses connected to the sports leadership arena to add Relevance to the Rigor of the core curriculum. Emphasizing specific measures of performance, standards-based instruction will incorporate: \u00b7 Opportunities for active and genuine Relationships among students, families, and community mentors within the career exploration model to create richer learning communities that hold all stakeholders accountable for success; \u00b7 Relevant learning opportunities through career-related projects, real-world application initiatives and community service. \u00b7 Project-Based Learning initiatives emphasizing individual and collaborative projects as the foundation for learning; \u00b7 Performance-based curricular objectives in alignment with Nevada Academic Achievement Standards (NACS). \u00b7 Curriculum pacing of essential standards based on nine-week intervals, in each content area; Curriculum Delivery Based on the SLAM Model - The three R's (Rigor, Relevance, and Relationships) framework allows for all stakeholders to assess and reevaluate what students are actually experiencing and learning in each learning community or academy cluster. Below is an example of the how the school will use the Rigor, Relevance, and Relationship framework to guide instruction delivery aligned to authentic assessments both in and out of the classroom. This model will also be used as a guide for collaborative discussions among teachers and to conduct professional development for teachers and community mentors. The Rigor, Relevance and Relationship Framework, according to Coalition of Essential Schools Northwest/Small Schools Project (2004): Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 3 RIGOR RELEVANCE CONTENT Instruction is grounded in content that is: - Complex - Ambiguous - Provocative - Emotionally or personally challenging Instruction is: - Inherently meaningful - Engages students in multiple domains - Stimulates intellectual curiosity - Offers value beyond the classroom INSTRUCTIONAL PROCESS - Students engaged in active participation, exploration and research - Focus on competence, not coverage (work shows evidence of understanding, not just recall) - Clear expectations define what students should know and be able to do - Teachers and students set learning goals and monitor progress toward academic excellence - Activities draw out perceptions and develop understanding - Students develop resilience, flexibility, and confidence by facing academic challenges - Teacher utilizes the diversity and culture of each student to build effective learning experiences. - Learning activities represent issues that require a personal frame of reference for the students (activities invite an emotional or internal commitment on the part of the student, in addition to a cognitive interest) - Students make decisions about their learning with their teachers/peers/mentors - Learning activities develop within each student the habits and curiosity associated with life-long learning ASSESSMENT - Assessment tasks extend beyond traditional \"paper and pencil\" tests - Students exhibit higher order thinking through: - substantive conversations, - Project Based Learning Activities - Portfolios and - Performances and Expositions - Assessments are not strictly evaluative: they are an opportunity for teachers to reflect on instruction and modify teaching to meet the changing needs of their students. - Students have voice in the design and type of assessments. - Assessments are meaning ful to students, and offer students insights into their own learning. - Assessment tasks sometimes ask students to communicate their knowledge, present a product or performance, or take some action for an audience beyond the teacher, classroom, and school building RELATIONSHIPS - Teachers know students (and often families) so well that instructional and learning opportunities can be tailored to the needs of each student - Teachers model integrity and open-mindedness for their students. - Teachers model integrity and open-mindedness for their students - Teachers are intentional in creating safe, nurturing, democratic classrooms so that Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 4 The school's educational model (The R's framework), along with a standard-based curriculum aligned to Common Core and national best practices, will prepare students to think critically and apply knowledge across disciplines, and in real world predictable and unpredictable situations. SLAM NV's unique program intends to provide an innovative educational option that sets high academic standards for all students, engages and enables them to succeed through real world application initiatives, and empowers them through relationships with school and community mentors. Through this motivating program, students at SLAM NV will benefit from a rigorous curriculum, allowing them to understand their unique learning styles, evaluate their post-secondary and career interests and to make informed decisions about their future. The following is a description of the major components of SLAM NV's program design as validated by the research: 1. Autonomy: having choices, setting your own goals and timelines, choosing what to study and when, viewpoints are accepted. We believe that students rarely adopt higher academic learning goals in response to \"surface\" reforms, such as changes in curriculum or subject matter; however, if the reforms permit higher levels of autonomy for students, encourage higher levels of peer and teacher support, and provide higher levels of \"task\" goal orientation, then academic results will not only appear but will be longer lasting. Research - Autonomy affects motivation and has a direct relationship to persistence and engagement, as well as graduation rates (Deci, Nezlek, & 2004). 2. Belongingness: perceiving high levels of support from peers and teachers, mentors, and parents in both personal issues and academic issues. Belongingness is a direct measure of Relationships. The School will foster these positive STUDENT - TEACHER RELATIONSHIPS self-esteem and trust develop in students. - Teachers know students (and often families) so well that instructional and learning opportunities can be tailored to the needs of each student. - Teachers model integrity and open-mindedness for their students - Students trust their teachers so well they grant teachers the authority to challenge them STUDENT - STUDENT RELATIONSHIPS - The community of learners is strong so that students are committed to their own success, as well as the success of their peers - Students embrace a sense of ownership in their learning community or academy because their voice impacts the direction of classroom activity. STUDENT - COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS - Students often communicate and collaborate with people beyond their classroom (i.e. community members, other students, experts and other staff members.) - Learning activities develop within each student a sense of belonging and responsibility to the local and global community - Students see themselves as active and conscientious citizens. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 5 relationships through the practice of mentoring and career advisors, athletes as role models and other community partners. Research - The need for strong, mutually supportive relationships is a fundamental human need (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). In the school setting, belongingness refers to the quality of interpersonal relationships with teachers and peers. High levels of belongingness lead to increases in motivation, positive social behavior and academic achievement (Wentzel, 1994, 1997, 1998; Wentzel, Barry, & Caldwell, 2004; Wentzel & Caldwell, 1997). In contrast, socially rejected students show lower levels of engagement, have higher levels of academic and behavioral problems (DeRosier, Kupersmidt, & Patterson, 1994), and can be at significant risk of dropping out of school and eventually running afoul of the law (Parker & Asher, 1987). Belongingness can also enhance school adjustment, perceived competence, and perceiving high expectations from teachers; belief that effort will be recognized; emphasis on deep understanding rather than shallow recitation. Goal orientation is a good measure of the Rigor of an educational environment; Schools that are uniformly rigorous and emphasize deep understanding will see high scores in \"task\" goal orientation. Both project-based learning and mentoring activities come together to inspire a positive \"task\" goal orientation. Research - Students who perceive a positive or \"task\" goal orientation in school will seek challenges and show persistence in the face of adversity, use more effective learning strategies, have more positive attitudes, and demonstrate more engagement in learning (Roeser, Midgley, & Urdan, 1996). On the other hand, students who perceive a negative or \"performance\" goal orientation seek to avoid challenge and, in the face of failure, attribute their results to lack of ability and exhibit a \"learned helplessness\" response, which refers to a negative emotional response and a defeatist attitude (Eccles & Midgley, 1989). 4. Student and Community Engagement: a reflection of the student work ethic, concentration and attention paid to schoolwork; behavioral, and emotional involvement in school. The School will implement Career Portfolios, wherein students will create self-imposed performance goals geared at community engagement and personal development. At the beginning of the school year, students will create goals for their Career Portfolio, building upon each goal every year thereafter (Attachment 3 A.3.3). The goals will comprise of: 1) Academic and/or Career Goal - (i.e. increasing one letter grade in their lowest performing subject. Through development of this goal, students will gain greater autonomy and realize their potential through the school year as they monitor and reflect on their progress; 2) Self - Esteem/Character Development Goal : students will be able to identify their learning strengths, challenges, and passions and create a plan of action for their life-long learning based on this evaluation. They will be challenged by their mentors and peers and will be expected to learn to take responsibility for managing their own behavior in these situations. Students will be given opportunities for leaderships and character building projects to attain their goal. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 6 Behavior management techniques are an important part of the curriculum and increase-self-esteem by providing opportunities for academic success: and 3) Community Service Goal: The School will expect all students to be active and contributing citizens of their school and community. Students will understand the effect that they have upon the community, and will take the initiative to better themselves and the community as a whole by choosing one community or school-based service goal that they will complete by the end of the school year. Research - A lower level of engagement usually means a student will not complete work on time and will not learn much of value. An engaged learner will do superior work, obtain a deeper level of understanding, and retain the knowledge and skills for a longer period of time. A higher level of engagement is a reflection of the amount of effort and passion a student will put into learning (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004). 5. Project -Based Learning - When only academic gains are measured, there may be an immediate level of growth, but these gains will be short-lived if not accompanied by deeper levels of change in the learning community along the lines of the 3 R's. Simply making greater demands on students will not ensure long-term success, especially for the students who have had little success in traditional settings. But when long-term changes in the learning community are geared towards Rigor, Relevance and Relationships , long-term academic success is more likely. Therefore, our program will incorporate Project-Based Learning into our career academies to create Relevance for students, which will increase their academic achievement on a long-term scale. Through PBL tasks, teachers will: \u00b7 Implement challenging, multidisciplinary curriculum aligned to NACS; \u00b7 Engage students in complex, real-world projects through in which students develop and apply skills and knowledge through portfolio presentations; \u00b7 Require students to draw from many disciplines in order to solve problems; \u00b7 Encourage student decision-making; \u00b7 Discuss problems are presented without a predetermined solution; \u00b7 Put students in charge of accessing and managing the information that they gather; and \u00b7 Expect students to reflect and evaluate their own learning continuously. Research - Project-based learning enables students to pursue their own interests and passions, what is \"in the moment\" rather than imposed. Project-Based Learning emphasizes individual and collaborative projects as the foundation for learning and includes very little of the whole-class instruction typically found in traditional secondary schools (Newell, 2003). Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 7 A.2 School-Specific Goals and Objectives A.2.1 Assurance regarding performance frameworks SLAM NV will adhere to the State Public Charter School Authority and Nevada Department of Education's School Performance Framework. SLAM NV will establish educational goals for improving student achievement through Mission Specific Goals and Objectives aimed at continuously increasing student proficiency annually. At minimum, the school has set the following Goals: \u00b7 Goal 1 - Seventy-five (75) percent of students enrolled at the school for a three consecutive year period will achieve proficient on the state's annual assessment. This goal is applicable to students who have been enrolled for three consecutive years at SLAM NV. \u00b7 Goal 2 - Seventy (70) percent of students will improve reading and mathematics skills as evidenced by at least 1 year growth in reading and mathematics skills annually. \u00b7 Goal 3 -- The School will increase the number of students taking academically rigorous courses (i.e. advanced, honors, AP) by 5 % as measured by comparing enrollment in such courses using the first year as baseline. \u00b7 Goal 4 - The School will demonstrate a ninety (90) percent satisfaction rating in an annual survey administered to parents or designated legal guardians of students attending the school each academic year. \u00b7 Goal 5- The School will generate a minimum of five (5) percent fund surplus each school year. \u00b7 Goal 6 - The licensed teacher retention rate will be at least eighty (80) percent each year, not including separations for health or family reasons. A.2.2 Assessment tools/data/artifacts For determination of attainment of goal 1, the Smarter Balance/End of Course Exams (or other standardized assessment subsequently adopted by the Nevada Department of Education) results will provide evidence. For goal 2, Nevada Department of Education's Smarter Balance, End of the Course (or other standardized assessment subsequently adopted) may be utilized to evaluate this goal. In addition, the school may use standardized commercially available assessments such as AIM's Web or STAR Assessments. Please see Attachment 10 A.4.1 for more information on the attachment plan. For goal 3, evaluation is done through comparing enrollment data in academically rigorous courses (i.e. advanced, honors, AP), and external reports (i.e College Board). School climate Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 8 surveys with a Likert scale will provide evidence toward the attainment of goal 4. Annual financial records will provide evidence toward the attainment of goal 5. Personnel records will provide evidence toward the attainment of goal 6. A.2.3 Reasonableness of goals As evident in the Mission, Vision, and Educational Philosophy SLAM NV is committed to providing an innovative, relevant, and rigorous curriculum to create college-bound and career-oriented graduates. SLAM NV is a replication of the successful Sports Leadership and Management Middle High School in Miami, Florida (SLAM). SLAM's thematic approach will offer students a unique opportunity to explore career choices through partnerships with local sports franchises and community organizations. The school design is modeled after the existing SLAM in Miami-Dade County, Florida, which is a part of the Mater Academy Inc. network of high-performing schools (Attachment 33). Mater Academy, Inc., has been operating high performing and fiscally sound charter schools in Florida for over 15 years. Mater currently operates 25 charter schools serving students across Miami-Dade County. With more than half the schools considered Title I, Mater continues to make significant strides towards closing the achievement gap and increasing the level of education, especially for minority and economically disadvantaged students. SLAM, the newest addition to the Mater network, opened this past school year in Dade County. The majority of the students entering the school came from the surrounding communities of Little Havana, Allapattah, Overtown, both predominantly minority and poverty-stricken urban neighborhoods. The majority of these students receive Free and/or reduced meal services and lack academic support at home due to families who lack formal schooling or have little or no English proficiency. Despite these challenges, the school outperformed nearby schools in various areas, as displayed below: 2014 FL-DOE School Accountability Report Card - SLAM Compared to Surrounding Schools Relationship Between Program Elements and Program Goals - SLAM NV will use motivational engaging elective courses connected to the sports leadership arena to add Relevance to the Rigor of the core curriculum, in alignments with the existing SLAM Academy model. Further, the proposed curriculum model (A.3.1) is a replication of the School Number School Name Reading % Satisfactory or Higher Math % Satisfactory or Higher Writing % Satisfactory or Higher Science % Satisfactory or Higher Reading Points for Gains Math Gains for Low 25% Points Earned FCAT 2.0 Reading % Satisfactory or Higher Preliminary Grade 2014 Free or Reduced Lunch Rate Minority Rate Region 6015 SLAM MIDDLE SCHOOL 61 46 42 29 68 53 512 61 C 83 95 5 6011 ALLAPATTAH MIDDLE SCHOOL 23 31 36 36 57 83 506 23 D 95 100 5 6361 JOSE DE DIEGO MIDDLE SCHOOL 24 32 54 30 55 76 492 24 D 96 98 5 6091 CITRUS GROVE MIDDLE SCHOOL 31 28 39 31 65 73 493 28 C 97 99 5 Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 9 current model being used by SLAM (Florida). Thus the goals set for by SLAM NV are reasonable in that they are modeled after the existing program's goal and have proven effective with the targeted student populations in only the schools' first year of operation. As discussed in A.3.12, Academy (Florida) integrates a variety of best practices and research-based instructional strategies in order to meet such goals. Furthermore, the curriculum and instructional materials in Mathematics and English/Language Arts are Common Core aligned and will thereby serve to prepare students to be college and career ready and in alignment with Goals 2 and 3. Further, as provided in the affiliation agreement (Attachment 40), professional development on these instructional best practices will be provided onsite by SLAM (Florida) leadership. Following the aforementioned effective practices with fidelity will allow SLAM NV to achieve its academic performance goals, as the Florida schools have been able to accomplish. An affiliation with SLAM (Florida) will provide a wealth of resources and experience educating with successful results that have narrowed or all together eliminated the achievement gap for the targeted subgroup. SLAM's mission, is designed to push students to begin to prepare and dream about a postsecondary education and careers. This is derived from the network's commitment to put all students, regardless of achievement level, disability or economic challenges, on the path toward college. Accordingly, at SLAM NV, all students will benefit from a rigorous curriculum with intervention and acceleration supports, in a motivationally stimulating and engaging educational setting. A.3 Curriculum and Instruction A.3.1 Curriculum Model SLAM NV's curriculum is aligned to the Nevada Academic Content Standards (NACS), which incorporate the Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics, the new Nevada Academic Content Standards in Science (New Generation Science Standards) and the Nevada Academic Content Standards in Social Studies and elective areas. The grade-specific standards will define end-of-year expectations and a cumulative progression to enable students to meet college and career readiness. The ELA Standards (strands in Reading, Writing, Speaking & Listening, and Language) and Literacy standards will emphasize reading and writing in History/Social Science, Science and Technical Subjects and will frame instruction in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language across all disciplines. The Standards for Mathematical Practice and Content will guide teachers to prepare students with the mathematical skills necessary for success in college and future careers. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 10 SLAM NV's mission is to prepare students for postsecondary studies and careers through an engaging educational program emphasizing sports leadership and management career preparation. The NACS are in direct alignment with the SLAM NV's mission. The standards are designed to be robust and relevant to the real world, reflecting the knowledge and skills needed for success in college and careers. Aligned with college and work expectations, the NACS serve as the framework for SLAM NV teachers to develop innovative research-based lessons with rigorous content and require application of knowledge through high-order skills. Thus the SLAM NV curriculum will offer a sports thematic approach to integrating NACS into the curriculum while emphasizing the three R's philosophy of Rigor, Relevance and Relationships in the delivery of the curriculum. Emphasizing specific standard-based measures of performance, SLAM NV will provide \"Rigor\" to educational program, by setting high expectations for all its students through standards-based instruction incorporating: - Performance-based curricular objectives aligned to Nevada Academic Achievement Standards (NACS); - Differentiated Instruction -commitment to serve all students individualized learning needs through an RtI framework using 3 varied tiers of intervention; - Expectation of Rigor for ALL not just some students, while offering support as needed (support strategies and resources for English Language Learners (ELL) and Students with Disabilities/Gifted Students; - Literacy rich environment emphasizing increasing text complexity at each grade level; - Assessment data as the driving force behind instructional decisions and interventions; - Ongoing professional development to target learner-needs; - Before and afterschool targeted tutoring for remediation and weekend seminars for acceleration; - Literacy integration across all disciplines (reading & writing across the curriculum using College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards); - College and Career Preparation - (Springboard, Kaplan SAT Advantage/ACT and SAT preparation); - Commitment to technology and literacy integration throughout the curriculum. The curriculum provides instruction for mastery of the NACS, making students' college- and/or career-ready at the conclusion of their High School career as well as \"21 st century literate.\" Course content for these courses will be delivered in accordance with course descriptions (Attachment 3 A.3.3) and will ensure mastery of the NACS. Please see Attachment 2 A.3.2 for a schedule of courses by grade level. SLAM NV will implement research-based strategies Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 11 (A.3.12) that have proven successful by both the research and the existing SLAM (Florida). The grade specific standards will guide pacing of instruction at each grade level and help ensure that students gain adequate exposure to an increasing complex range of material and skills as they progress from grade 6 through 12. The program will also emphasize effective use of speaking and listening and language skills, higher-order critical thinking and literacy skills in preparation for overall post-secondary preparedness. SLAM NV's elective course offerings afford students opportunities to explore sports leadership related career options, while meeting the requirements for promotion to high school and high school graduation. In grades 6-8, the major concepts and content of the Career Exploration and Decision Making course will be incorporated into these elective courses below to not only provide students an opportunity to meet this requirement, but also to provide a seamless transition into 9 th grade CTE courses to be offered. The CTE electives noted in Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 will provide students opportunities in career exploration and internships through the following academies in the sports leadership and management arena: 1) Sports Medicine; 2) Sports Journalism; and 3) Sports Marketing, Entertainment, and Management. Curriculum Delivery - SLAM NV intends to provide professional development (A.3.13), planning opportunities and resources for teachers to develop stellar lessons that incorporate the NACS's expectations while engaging students though Sports Leadership and Management related activities. Teachers will be provided with Resources for Thematic Lessons and sample lesson plans to integrate the Sports Leadership and Management (SLAM) theme within the core curriculum and allow for students to apply and practice skills required of Nevada Academic Content Standards (NACS). A sample of the thematic lessons is included in Attachment 3 A.3.3 . As teachers build on interdisciplinary connections under the Sports and Leadership umbrella, it is expected that students naturally begin to link information between and among courses, increasing the relevancy of skills and content in such courses. The expectation is that teachers work cooperatively through horizontal and vertical planning opportunities using the Standards to develop these stellar lessons and projects throughout the school year. SLAM NV will use courses as described in Attachment 2 A.3.2 and course descriptions aligned to NACS (Attachment 3 A.3.3) as well as researched-based instructional materials aligned to NACS for each subject area. Curriculum Support - SLAM's educational program is founded on the principals of providing Rigor, Relevance and Relationships to students' academic lives, so that all, not just some, students can be fully engaged in the curriculum and thereby be academically successful. All students will be engaged in, and benefit from, the curriculum including Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 12 students with special needs, ELL students, and students who may enter the school below grade level. The school will offer a 7-period day to allow all level learners the opportunity to enroll in elective courses despite their needs for remediation or advancement on sports and sports-leadership related electives. After school activities, quarterly guest speakers within academy strands, participation in school sponsored events, internship, and volunteer opportunities with school partners will provide students with opportunities benefit from the curriculum and school wide programs beyond the bell. Faculty will differentiate instruction for students, as well as offer tutoring services or other such assistance to ensure students remain successful. Some of the strategies and initiatives to be implemented in support of struggling students include: 1) Literacy strategies in the content areas will be facilitated throughout the curriculum to provide students' additional practice in addition to those taught during language arts classes; 2) Targeted and Required Tutoring - Early bird, Super Saturday, and daily pull-out tutoring may be required for those students consistently demonstrating non- mastery of the standards; 3) Data Analysis linked to target interventions - Students consistently demonstrating non- mastery of benchmarks on teacher generated quizzes, chapter tests, projects, investigations, and poor academic progress will be targeted for supplemental and intensive instruction/intervention; 4) Professional Development - Through professional Development conducted at the beginning and throughout the school year, teachers at SLAM will be trained to examine data, determine the student's areas of strength and areas for improvement, and be active participants in the school-wide plan for student achievement. The use of intervention materials and technology in the classroom as well as differentiation of instruction will help strengthen the student's area of weakness; 5) Progress Monitoring - SLAM will work with parents/guardians to develop an intervention plan to assist the student in meeting state levels for proficiency. Each plan will include provision for intensive remedial instruction through extended school day activities; 6) Support from Mentors - The School will foster positive relationships through the practice of mentoring and career advisors, athletes as role models and other community partners. Teachers, administrators, coaches, peer-tutors, school, career mentors, community partners and volunteers at SLAM will all take part in the responsibility of assisting struggling students by facilitating the school's afterschool tutoring and extracurricular programs. Teacher and the other support personnel will work together to plan and coordinate the activities and initiatives to support remediation and mastery of NACS across the curriculum. Time for this will be allotted during professional development days, common planning periods, and frequent departmental and faculty meetings. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 13 \u00b7 Project-based Learning - SLAM's Sports Leadership and Management academies are integrated into the core curriculum and career academy's school-wide activities allow students to make \"real-world connections\" between the curriculum and their daily lives and/or future careers. \u00b7 Community Involvement - SLAM NV will foster levels of student engagement through mentoring opportunities, career advisors, athletes-as-role-models through positive relationships with these and other community and national partners. Nationally, SLAM has official partnerships with the following: the NBA, MLB, and Nascar.

A transfer of credits to another school in or out of Nevada is applicable since the School will deliver a standards based curriculum that is aligned to the Nevada Academic Content State Standards by grade level. A.3.11 Textbooks - Please see Attachment 9 A.3.11 A.3.12 Instructional Strategies SLAM NV will use motivational engaging lessons connected to the sports leadership arena to add Relevance to the Rigor of the core curriculum. Emphasizing specific measures of performance, standards-based instruction will incorporate opportunities for active and genuine Relationships among students, families, and community mentors within the career exploration model to create richer learning communities that hold all stakeholders accountable for success. The curriculum will incorporate the following researched-based strategies: \u00b7 Differentiated Instruction - The School's ultimate goal is to provide a learning environment that will maximize the potential for student success. Teachers will use differentiated instruction strategies that connect with individual student's learning needs. Teachers will manage instructional time to meet the standards while providing motivating, challenging, and meaningful experiences for students to receive and process information in ways that require differentiation of experience. \u00b7 Scaffolding - Teachers will identify the current developmental skills of individual students based on assessments and provide support structures to help students move to the next level. As the year goes on, the student becomes more adept at skills and at directing his or her learning, and becomes more autonomous. \u00b7 Inquiry-Based Learning - Based on the scientific method, this student-centered strategy will require students to conduct investigations independent of the teacher, unless otherwise directed or guided through the process of discovery. Teachers will use this strategy in developing critical thinking and problem solving skills. \u00b7 Project-based learning - PBL integrates knowing and doing. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter. Though PBL, teachers will engage students in SLAM NV projects where students can take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, collaborative products. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 15 \u00b7 Information Processing Strategies - Teaching students \"how to\" process information is a key factor in teaching students how to strategically organize, store, retrieve, and apply information presented. Such strategies will include memorization, reciprocal teaching, graphic organizers, scaffolding, or webbing. Other High Yield Instructional Strategies According to Classroom Instruction that Works: Research-based Strategies for Increasing Student Achievement , by Robert Marzano (2001) the following strategies are highly effective: \u00b7 Cooperative Learning - Teachers should limit use of ability groups, keep groups small, apply strategy consistently and systematically and assign roles and responsibilities in groups. What This Looks like Classroom: Integrate content and language through group engagement, reader's theatre, pass the pencil, circle of friends, cube it, radio reading, shared reading and writing, plays, science projects, debates, jigsaw, group reports, choral reading, affinity diagrams. Students tackle sample PARCC Prototype Tasks or word problems in collaborative groups and explain their rational for responses. \u00b7 Identifying similarities and differences - Students should compare, classify, and create metaphors, analogies and non-linguistic or graphic representations. What This looks Like in the Classroom: Thinking Maps, T-charts, Venn diagrams, classifying, analogies, cause and effect links, compare and contrast organizers. Question/Answer/Relationship (QAR) sketch to stretch, affinity diagrams. \u00b7 Summarizing and Note Taking - Students should learn to eliminate unnecessary information, substitute some information, keep important information, write / rewrite, and analyze information. Students should be encouraged to put some information into own words. What This Looks like Classroom: Teacher models summarization techniques, identify key concepts, bullets, outlines, clusters, narrative organizers, journal summaries, break down assignments, create simple reports, quick writes, graphic organizers, column notes, affinity diagrams. \u00b7 Nonlinguistic Representations - Students should create graphic representations, models, mental pictures, drawings, pictographs, and participate in kinesthetic (hands-on) activities in order to assimilate knowledge; What This Looks like Classroom: Visual tools and manipulatives, problem-solution organizers, spider webs, diagrams, concept maps, drawings, charts, thinking maps, graphic organizers, sketch to stretch, storyboards, foldables, act out content, make physical models, etc. \u00b7 Generating and Testing Hypothesis - Students should generate, explain, test and defend hypotheses using both inductive and deductive strategies through problem solving, history investigation, invention, experimental inquiry, Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 16 and decision-making; What This Looks like Classroom: Thinking processes, constructivist practices, investigate, explore, social construction of knowledge, use of inductive and deductive reasoning, questioning the author of a book, finding other ways to solve same math problem, etc. A.3.13 Professional Development SLAM NV is committed toward maintaining the level of high quality instructors by implementing a comprehensive professional development plan.

The professional development plan for administrators will encompass both internal and external in-service trainings. Administrators may also participate in professional development conducted through: the National Association of Secondary School principals; and state trainings. A.4 Assessment and Accountability A.4.1 Assessment Plan and Instruments - Please see Attachment 10 A.4.1 A.4.2 Use of student data Student assessment and performance data will be used to evaluate and improve school effectiveness by targeting benchmarks indicating which students need additional support to master specific standards and/or grade level skills. At the beginning of each school year and at least quarterly, the school administrative team will gather baseline data to identify areas of instructional weaknesses pinpointing thresholds of student progress. State standardized assessments will be used to determine mastery of content standards and make decisions regarding school-wide improvement from year to year. Baseline data will be used for baseline and instructional purpose, program reporting, or as a measure for developing improvement plans; classroom assessment and other data will be used for ongoing progress-monitoring of students. In addition to required and mandated assessments, teacher-made and text-adopted classroom assessments will further determine mastery of content standards for earning specific class credit requirements. As a program focused on exposing to students to careers in sports leadership arena, SLAM NV will also consider formative assessments (career portfolios, performance-based tasks, exhibitions and presentations, peer and self-assessments, audio/visual presentations, journals, research projects, reviews/case studies, career portfolio's etc.) when assessing student performance and progress. All Data will be disaggregated and used by teachers to inform instruction on student knowledge and skills relative to the NACS as follows: Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 19 1. Data reports on these and all state-mandated assessments will be disaggregated by student, by standard, by teacher, and by school will be used to inform decisions about adjustments to the educational program. These reports will be made available to all teachers (and students as applicable) to identify areas needing improvement while informing instruction to enhance curriculum delivery and teacher effectiveness. 2. The school leadership team will meet monthly to: Evaluate data and correlate to instructional decisions; review progress-monitoring data at the grade level and classroom level to identify students and their academic levels; identify professional development to enhance students' achievement levels; collaborate, problem solve, share effective practices, evaluate implementation, make decisions, and practice new programs and skills; facilitate the process of building consensus, increasing infrastructure, and making decisions about implementation. 3. Based on the data analysis, administrators and school faculty collaboratively develop an instructional focus calendars with timelines for addressing targeted strands as denoted in assessed benchmarks. Through the use of the calendars, student assessment data will drive-decisions for continuous improvement of the teaching and learning process. 4. Department Chairs will communicate with teachers to determine the areas of students' strengths and weaknesses as demonstrated by class work assignments and assessment results. 5. Each teacher will be training and expected use all data available to determine the instructional focus lessons and differentiate instruction accordingly. Struggling students and students referred by teachers will be targeted for Early Bird tutoring, Super Saturday tutoring, and daily pullout tutoring. Students at and above mastery level will be challenged through the use of additional hands-on investigations, projects and research assignments that will reinforce the mastery of benchmarks. Targeted Interventions - Using real-time data from frequent assessment results, SLAM NV will provide the necessary individual, classroom and/or school-wide intervention programs which include: requiring students to attend specific targeted tutoring during and afterschool; proving for supplemental intervention programs and support within the respective reading, math, science classrooms through academic coaching, lesson modeling, computerized intervention programs and pull out services (as needed). The school will use data on an ongoing basis to inform instructional practices allowing for increased Data will serve as a feedback system to guide teachers in lesson planning and individualizing instruction and to provide students with knowledge of their current levels of performance. The school will use data on an ongoing basis to inform Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 20 instructional practices allowing for increased student-learning outcomes. These actions will enhance instructional interventions by closely monitoring activities and aligning results with effective instructional decision-making. A.4.3 Use of longitudinal data Longitudinal data analysis will be reported annually to measure success and will consist of: 1. A pupil baseline developed during the first year using testing results. 2. A comparison of annual results with the baseline scores to assess progress. 3. Grade-level and school composite scores. 4. A graph of annual results showing year-to-year change. 5. A graph of school scores relative to state and national averages. 6. Sub-analysis of a variety of variables to identify areas for improvement. A.4.4 Data management plan In Accordance with NRS 386.650, the School will participate in SAIN Automated Student Information System and will thereby use software, hardware and telecommunications compatible with its sponsor (State Public Charter School Authority) to fulfill data transfer requirements to the sponsor. The School will report data required by NRS 386.650 to its sponsor by the beginning of the School's first year of operation. The School, sponsored under the auspices of the State Public Charter School Authority will use PowerSchool or Infinite Campus or other SIS that may be required. The school administrator will monitor the mainframe to ensure that data is appropriately maintained and entered in a timely fashion. Parents will be provided with login credentials to monitor their child's progress in school. Monthly teacher planning time (A.3.13) will be provided for collaboration and sharing of successful differentiated instruction. This planning time will also be utilized to evaluate data and provide a forum for intervention strategies. A.5 Tentative School Calendar and Daily Schedule A.5.1 Calendar - Please See Attachment 11 A.5.1 A.5.2 Enrollment dates The proposed date of enrollment is May 1, 2015. A.6 School Climate and Discipline A.6.1 How climate/discipline policies support educational goals The School's discipline policy will adhere to regulations set forth by the Nevada Revised Statutes and the Nevada Administrative Code. In addition, SLAM's philosophy of positive behavior/reinforcement will be a significant Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 21 component of effective disciplinary practices for students. The focus of the learning environment will be positive reinforcement (A.6.2), which is proactive and non-punitive. This type of learning environment will allow the School to attain the educational goals (A.2.1) it seeks to achieve. Pursuant to the concept discussed in the educational philosophy (A.1.4) of Rigor, Relevance and Relationships, the principal and teachers will further refine the discipline policy upon the establishment of the School. The policy will provide for the progressive discipline of students and on-site review of disciplinary decisions. The policy will be developed with input and participation from administrative team, teachers, and other school stakeholders. It shall be consistent with the rules of behavior prescribed in accordance with NRS 392.463; include provisions designed to address the specific disciplinary needs and concerns of the school; and provide for the temporary removal of a pupil from the classroom. Pursuant to NRS 392.4644, the principal will collaborate with the faculty and other school stakeholder's to annually revise the policy. A.6.2 Student behavior philosophy The School's student behavior philosophy will be based on Positive Behavior Support (PBS). Positive Behavioral Support is a collaborative, assessment-based approach to developing effective interventions for problem behavior. The \"use of PBS decreases the need for more intrusive or aversive interventions (i.e., punishment or suspension) and can lead to both systemic as well as individualized change (Cohn).\" Positive behavioral support can target the entire school as well and individual student behaviors, as \"it does not focus exclusively on the student, but also includes changing environmental variables such as physical setting, task demands, curriculum, instructional pace, and individualized reinforcement (Cohn).\" PBS emphasizes the proactive, educative, and reinforcement-based strategies that will achieve meaningful and long-lasting positive behaviors. When PBS strategies are implemented school-wide, it builds environments that are conducive to learning for all students. Research has shown that \"schools that implement system-wide [PBS] interventions also report increased time engaged in academic activities and improved academic performance (Cohn).\" In the implementation of a Positive Behavioral Support program, it is important to collaborate with parents, staff, and faculty. As part of this collaboration, individuals (faculty, staff, and parents) learn more about their own behavior, to work together, and support each other as a community of learners. As indicated in A.3.13, professional development will be provided to implement PBS. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 22 A.6.3 Discipline Policy - Please see Attachment 12 A.6.3 A.6.4 Truancy Policy - Please See Attachment 13 A.6.4 A.6.5 Absence Policy - Please See Attachment 14 A.6.5 A.6.6 Involving Families Parental and community involvement is a fundamental aspect of the mission and vision of SLAM NV. The School will encourage parents to be active participants in their children's education through volunteer opportunities at the school. SLAM NV will reach out to parents and the community through the SLAM NV website, monthly newsletters, and event calendars which will be updated monthly to disseminate information and maintain open lines of communication. The school will also use workshops, parent meetings, open houses and email blasts to inform parents of involvement opportunities at the school throughout the school year. These include activities such as chaperoning field trips, assisting with class projects, helping in the library or office, speaking during Career Week, Family Day, etc. Faculty and staff will also be expected to encourage parental involvement through: Quarterly Parent/Teacher Conferences: hosted in the evenings at the School where parents can discuss topics that affect their children's educational progress. Open houses, Career Fairs, Family Day: events held yearly to recruit new students, maintain communication and involvement between the School and the surrounding community. PTO: Parent Teacher Organization coordinates extra-curricular events involving the community. Through the PTO and other such committees, parent and community members will also be able to partake in the school's decision-making process. The school plans to provide parent workshops on education-related topics, such as decision-making regarding school performance and student assessment needs. Parent satisfaction is critical to the success of the school, as will be determined by goal 4 in A.2.2. Thus, parents will be active partners in the performance planning of relevant goals identified in A.2. As stated in the Bylaws, there will be parent representative on the Board and on the Board's Academic Committee. The purpose of the Academic Committee shall be to review school data, ensure academic expectations and goals are being met, and provide insight to instructional activities that meet specific needs of the students. In addition, the public, especially parents, are notified of Board meetings and may be active participants at the Board meeting by providing public comment and bringing relevant matters to the Board's attention. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 23 A.7 Target Population A.7.1 School Location SLAM NV will have an anti-discriminatory open admissions policy serving any student in grades 6-12, who would qualify to attend a traditional public school in Nevada. The School will not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, disability, or marital status against a student in its school admission process. The program, by design, is intended to attract students seeking career/vocational programs in the sports leadership and management arena. Although the School is open to all Nevada students, the proposed target populations are those who will be attending grades 6-12 and living in the Las Vegas, specifically in the Spring Valley community. A facility has not yet been identified but is targeted for the Spring Valley portion of the following zip codes: 89102, 89103, 89113, 89146, 89147, and 89148. A.7.2 Target Population Within the aforementioned zip codes, there are four traditional public middle schools and four high schools (Attachment 15 A.7.3). Collectively, the schools served 5,096 middle and 9,222 high school students. There are no charter middle high schools in the region and none of the existing schools offer educational programming in the Sports Leadership and Management arena. The need for school choice is evident. The graduation rates of the high schools are dismal with Bonanza High School at 63.11%, Clark High School at 59.63%, Durango High School at 70.65%, and Spring Valley High School at 63.85%. The high schools also have a poor star ratings with two of the schools (Clark and Bonanza HS) assigned a 2 Star Rating, in need for improvement in whole school proficiency and growth. Two of the high schools earned a 3 Star Rating (Durango and Spring Valley HS) where the schools have some areas needing improvement relative to student proficiency and growth on State assessments. Only one school had 100% of its faculty highly qualified, and one school had more than 10% of its teachers not highly qualified. The middle schools in the region do fairly well. Two of the middle schools (Guinn and Sawyer MS) are 3 star schools that have some areas of needs improvement relative to student proficiency and student growth. There is one 4 Star middle school (Lawrence MS) and one 5 Star middle school (Fertitta MS). However, there is a decrease in student success in the transition from middle to high school, which is problematic. In the article \"The Middle School Plunge,\" West and Schwerdt validate that the more transitions a student has between schools the greater the Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 24 decrease in student success. Thus, the ability to keep students in one system by providing a seamless instructional program from grades 6th-12th at SLAM NV will increase student success rates. School size is another concern. The average enrollment of the middle and high schools is 1,274 and 2,305 respectively. In the middle and high schools collectively, there were 452 violent incidents reported with one middle school reporting 126 violent incidents alone. The families and children of this community deserve quality public choice options that would offer students opportunities to develop positive relationships with teachers, peers, and the community. A.7.3 Enrollment projections - Please See Attachment 15 A.7.3 A.7.4 Alignment of school plan w/ target population SLAM NV's mission is to push students to begin to prepare for postsecondary education and careers is derived from the organization's commitment to get all students, regardless of achievement level, disability or economic challenges, on the path toward college. Accordingly, SLAM NV's student population will be afforded a quality option of high rigor, through a motivationally stimulating program. Serving the target student population - SLAM NV's career academy model will offer students a unique opportunity to explore career options through partnerships with local business and sports franchises and academy electives in the areas of marketing, business, media communications and sports medicine. According to Improving High Schools through Rigor, Relevance and Relationships, career focused models reduce delinquent behavior without compromising academic goals and preparation for college. The SLAM curriculum is specifically tailored toward addressing the learning needs of all students through engaging and innovative instructional activities in each core academic area and in each respective career academy as well as in extracurricular programs. The educational program requires the use of standards-based, state-adopted texts and research-based instructional materials, aligned to NACS, and high-yield educational strategies proven to improve student achievement. Therefore, the implementation of this program, with fidelity to all practices and standards described \"Originally created to help inner -city students stay in school and obtain meaningful occupational experience, career academies and similar programs have evolved into a multifaceted, integrated approach to reducing delinquent behavior. Career academies allow youth who may have trouble fitting into the larger school environment to belong to a smaller educational community and to connect what they learn in school with their career aspirations and goals.\" - U.S. Department of Justice - Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \" Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 25 in this petition, will help all students to attain mastery of state standards and to better prepared for high school and beyond. SLAM NV's school design is modeled after the existing SLAM middle and high school, a Mater Academy School, in Miami, Florida. The success of the existing SLAM program is based on the model of the Mater Academy system's use of intensive interventions and engaging instruction. For example, Mater Academy East High School, located less than 3 miles from the existing SLAM schools, graduated 88% of \"At Risk\" students in 2012, despite serving a population (79% Minority and 90% economically disadvantaged), which is statistically by national norms expected to underperform. The school was also the National Silver Medalist for College Readiness by News Week and World Report. Currently, 97% of Mater East graduates are attending a college or university, while Mater's academic programs continue to provide students an opportunity for success at a collegiate level. Overall, the network's graduation rate of 91% exceeds the state average (84%) and more than doubles the national graduation rate for minority students, based on data released by the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE). Additional relevant information on SLAM and the Mater Network schools can be found in A.2.4 and Attachment 33 B.3.1.1. A.7.5 Student recruitment plan - Please See Attachment 16 A.7.5 A.8 Special Student Populations A.8.1 Identification, etc for ELL SLAM NV will identify the primary language of students upon enrollment. All newly-enrolled students are provided an A Home Language Survey (HLS) is included in the enrollment packet. Based on the answers provided to the questions in the HLS, students are administered the WIDA ACCESS screener for English proficiency and may qualify for ELL services. Attachment 17 details the policies and procedures to be followed for English Language Learners. Eligible students are provided services based upon their needs through differentiated instruction and other best practices. A.8.2 ELL Program At the secondary level, the school offers Sheltered-Content ELL. The goals of all of these programs are to: (1) help ELL students achieve comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing competence in the English language; (2) enable students to achieve and maintain grade level status; and (3) enable students to meet graduation standards. The Sheltered Content-Based ESL Instruction Model is an integrated content language approach. The goal of the Sheltered Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 26 Content-Based Instruction Model is for ELL students to develop English language skills in content classes. Please see attachment 17 for more details. A.8.3 Plan to evaluate ELL Program The School plans to give students the tools they need to learn English in a timely manner and receive meaningful access to the School's instruction program. Students will receive sheltered instruction in their core classes. Please see the plan to monitor ELL students (A.8.4 and Attachment 17). A.8.4 Plan to monitor ELL students SLAM NV will monitor ELL students as with all students on a regular basis (Attachment 10 A.4.1, A.4.2) using data to track their progress. In addition, NDOE regulations require that ELL students be reassessed every year \"to determine whether the pupil's proficiency in English is fluent and he is able to succeed in courses of study that are taught only in English.\" (NAC 388.645).The school will monitor all reclassified students for a minimum of two years after they have met language proficiency. For a more detailed description, please see Attachment 17. A.8.5 Title III assurance - Please See Attachment 18 A.8.5 8.6 Identification, etc. for Special Ed..etc. Narrative Services and programs to students with disabilities will be implemented in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS), and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) as enumerated in Attachment 21. The Special Education Continuum of Service (A.8.9) and Special Education Policies and Procedures Manual (21), detail additional information regarding the special education program. The special education program is focused on six principles: Free appropriate public education. Children with disabilities eligible for special education will be provided educational services at no cost to the family. Child find services identify children in need of special education. Appropriate evaluation. Evaluation must include relevant information from a variety of sources such as parents, teachers, classroom observations and formal assessments. The evaluator(s) will use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental and academic information. Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP details the services the student twill receive - general education, special education, and related services. The IEP must be reviewed at least once a year. Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). Students with disabilities will be with the non-disabled peers to the Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 27 greatest extent possible in educational settings and during extracurricular and nonacademic activities. Parent and Student Participation in Decision Making. Parents are equal participants in all aspects of their child's special education program. When appropriate, the student is also part of the team. Procedural Safeguards. These are provided to parents to enforce their child's right to a free appropriate public education. Procedural safeguards are provided to parents at least on an annual basis. Students with disabilities or perceived disabilities who are not eligible for special education qualify for accommodations under Section 504. Students qualifying for Section 504 services receive classroom accommodations and/or adaptations to the educational environment. When a student is having difficulty learning in a regular education classroom, the teacher should attempt a variety of strategies designed to facilitate the child's learning within that classroom. Response to Intervention (RTI) is the mechanism teachers will utilize scientific, research-based interventions in general education environments to address academic and behavioral concerns. The Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) \u00a7388.325 defines the use of scientific, research-based intervention for students who are not yet suspected of having a disability. Detailed information about RTI is found in attachment 20, Response to Intervention Procedures Manual. Programs for special populations will be regularly and routinely monitored through the school principal to ensure that individual learning plans are being met. All personnel who provide related services (e.g. psycho-social counseling will be provided by a psychologist, social worker or mental professional, etc.) to students will meet all required licensure and/or certification requirements pertaining to their area of related service. The School may employ such personnel as necessary dependent on student need determined from actual enrollment. If necessary, the school will contract with agencies that employ licensed personnel. Special education staffing will be aligned pursuant to the requirements of the law. The School will complete federal, state and any other reports deemed necessary in accordance with the time-lines and specifications of the State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA). If the governing body determines the school is unable to provide an appropriate special education program and related services for a particular disability of a student who is enrolled at the school, the governing body may request that the school district of residence of the student transfer the student to an appropriate school. The governing body would request that the student be transferred pursuant to subsection 4 of NRS 386.580. The following would be undertaken: (1) the governing body shall submit the request to the district within 10 days after the governing body Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 28 determines that the school is unable to provide an appropriate special education program and related services for the student; (2) the request to the district will be accompanied by an explanation of the facts and circumstances that led the governing board to determine that the school is unable to provide the appropriate special education program and related services for the student; and (3) a person employed by the governing body will be designated to verify to the district that the information submitted to the school district pursuant to NAC 386.605 is gathered in a format required by the school district. All students will be regularly assessed to ensure that at-risk students are identified in a timely manner (A.3.12; A.4.1,A.4.2). Teachers will implement an intervention plan utilizing RTI interventions for students not making appropriate academic or behavioral progress (Attachment 20, Attachment 12 A.6.3). The parent or guardian of a student at risk for retention, will be notified in a timely manner to provide opportunities for intervention and remediation (Attachment 5 A.3.5). Selected staff will be Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) trained (A.3.13). A.8.7 Special Ed.

This staffing structure is sufficient for accomplishing the educational programs planned for the school. The 30:1 target average is for students to licensed teachers. Numerous studies have yielded inconsistent results to the controversial class size debate. \"A great deal of empirical data have been collected. However, they have so far been less than convincing and not consistent enough to justify the expense of the additional classrooms and teachers that would be required....Targeted remedial programs are generally less costly and easier to deploy (Finn).\" Moreover, a growing body of research indicates that teacher expertise is the most important factor in student achievement (What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future). \"Even after controlling for prior achievement, student demographics, and geographic location, teacher quality at the school level is associated with student achievement (Fuller).\" Since \"the single largest factor in improving the educational outcome of a student is the effectiveness of that student's teacher....the priority in a school should be to create a culture of effective teachers (Wong).\" These studies have no doubt influenced policymaking at the federal level. The Effective Teaching and Leading Act, introduced in 2013, finds that \"teacher quality is the single most important in-school factor influencing student learning and achievement (US Senate Bill 1063).\" Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 39 Research also indicates that the one of the greatest factors of a central office, or in this particular case the governing board, can contribute is to maintain a singular focus on improving instruction (Marzano and Waters). The second year, the school anticipates an increase in enrollment to a total of 480 students. The increased enrollment will require one additional office-staff person, an additional security/maintenance person, 3 additional core/ elective , one additional special education teacher. This maintains a teacher student ratio of 30 to 1. In subsequent years, the school hopes to continue to increase enrollment until it reaches the capacity of the school facility. As the school facility has not yet been located, additional increases in enrollment are difficult to predict. However, staffing increases will be proportionate to the increase in enrollment as set forth in the year two figures listed above. Recruitment Plan - In order to recruit highly qualified and successful teachers, the school will: 1) Recruit teachers through the Nevada Department of Education and teacher recruitment websites such as Teacher to Teacher; 2) Seek to partner with community organizations (A.3.1, A.7.5) to recruit teachers that are familiar with sports, sports medicine, sports journalism, and sports leadership and management; 3) Seek to partner with Teach for America for the provision of a limited number of licensed staff (recognizing that Teach for America staff are on a short term commitment to the profession, the number of staff sought through this program will most likely be limited to avoid constant turnover); 4) Join with SLAM Inc.'s schools in recruiting qualified licensed staff through the Spanish Consolate's Visiting Teachers Program, which provides highly skilled instructors; 5) Place advertisements in local publications; and 6) Coordinate efforts to partner with postsecondary educational institutions to serve as host school for interns, whenever possible (as a means to train and recruit potential future staff). Recruitment efforts will also include advertisements in local newspapers and on the school's website, presentations and fliers at local universities, school job fairs, and via word of mouth. Teacher retention will be a focus and responsibility of both the board and the school administrator. Teachers will be paid salaries commensurate with their experience and comparable to the local school district. A competitive benefits program will be offered to teachers and staff to ensure their retention and employment satisfaction. Teacher's input will be valued. Accordingly, they will be provided opportunities for shared decision making with the school principal. All faculty and staff members employed by the school will possess the personal characteristics, knowledge base of and belief in the educational and curriculum design as described in this proposal, as well as an ability and motivation to work as part of a team with parental involvement. The school will look for personnel who bring with Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 40 them a sense of enthusiasm and commitment as well as a strong belief in and understanding of the charter school concept. B.4.2 Employment contract negotiation SLAM NV will comply with NRS 386.595 in the negotiation of all contracts for employment with the school. A standard employment agreement will be developed with the assistance of legal counsel and utilized for the employment of licensed personnel. Individual variances in employment term or salary will be negotiated by the hiring authority, typically the school administrator, remaining within the budgetary parameters set by the board of directors. B.4.3 Instructor qualifications The school will ensure that persons who provide instruction at the school comply with Nevada licensure requirements. The U.S. Department of Education and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 require all core academic subject teachers be \"highly qualified.\" To become \"highly qualified\", a teacher must hold a Nevada teaching license in the appropriate area. The school will not employ an individual to provide instructional services if the individual's certificate or license as an educator is suspended or revoked by this or any other state. All employees at the school will undergo screening and background checks in accordance with state and local school district laws and regulations. The school will seek candidates who demonstrate, at minimum, the following qualifications: 1) Educational background: Bachelor's degree or higher in field; 2) State certification for the required position; 3) Excellent presentation and interpersonal skills; 4) Satisfactory recommendation and/or evaluations from previous employer; 5) Personal characteristics, knowledge, and belief in the school's mission; 6) An ability and motivation to work as part of a team in a small-school setting with parental involvement; and 7) Positive references/letters of recommendation. A screening committee comprised of school administrators, teachers and lead staff will interview potential employees. Initial screening interviews will be held, credentials will be verified and official recommendations to hire will be made to the principal, who will make the final hiring decision for faculty and support staff. B.4.4 Teacher evaluations Narrative The teacher evaluation practices and procedures will comply with NRS 391.3125. The primary purpose of an evaluation is to provide a format for constructive assistance. The School principal will evaluate teachers regularly using both formative and summative evaluation tools. Evaluations, while not the sole criterion, must be used in the dismissal Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 41 process. A conference and a written evaluation for a probationary employee must be concluded not later than ninety days after employment. An administrator charged with the evaluation of a probationary teacher shall personally observe the performance of the teacher in the classroom for not less than a cumulative total of 60 minutes during each evaluation period, with at least one observation during that 60-minute evaluation period consisting of at least 45 consecutive minutes. The evaluation of a probationary teacher or a post probationary teacher must include, without limitation: (a) an evaluation of the classroom management skills of the teacher; (b) a review of the lesson plans and the work log or grade book of students prepared by the teacher; (c) an evaluation of whether the curriculum taught by the teacher is aligned with the standards of content and performance established pursuant to NRS 389.520, as applicable for the grade level taught by the teacher; (d) An evaluation of whether the teacher is appropriately addressing the needs of the students in the classroom, including, without limitation, special educational needs, cultural and ethnic diversity, the needs of students enrolled in advanced courses of study and the needs of students who are limited English proficient; (e) If necessary, recommendations for improvements in the performance of the teacher; (f) A description of the action that will be taken to assist the teacher in correcting any deficiencies reported in the evaluation; and (g) A statement by the administrator who evaluated the teacher indicating the amount of time that the administrator personally observed the performance of the teacher in the classroom. The teacher must receive a copy of each evaluation not later than 15 days after the evaluation. A copy of the evaluation and the teacher's response must be permanently attached to the teacher's personnel file. Upon the request of a teacher, a reasonable effort must be made to assist the teacher to correct those deficiencies reported in the evaluation of the teacher for which the teacher requests assistance.

B.4.7 Employing administrators At the time the school would need to consider a candidate for the principal position, the school's governing board will implement a plan to identify qualified candidates for the administrative positions at the school. Using job placement ads in national industry publications and local advertising/marketing such as Education Week and, teacher/non-profit recruitment websites such as Teacher-Teacher and Idealist, the school's governing body will develop a database of highly qualified candidates meeting all state and local school district standards and qualifications. Applicants will be screened by a team of professionals, including the governing board, trained to identify the individuals best suited to carry out the mission of the school. Background checks and fingerprinting will be completed in accordance with NRS 386.588. At minimum, the governing board will seek an individual who has: extensive administrative (preferably in a school setting) and teaching experience; experience working with school or advisory educational boards; strong managerial capabilities; knowledge of the needs of diverse student population; positive evaluations from previous administrative position(s); letters of recommendation; and excellent communication skills. In the event of a vacancy in an administrator position, the school will utilize the database used during the initial recruitment process to identify a suitable individual to fill the vacant position. In addition, the school will consider potential candidates who already work at the school. The Board interviews and hires the school principal and will ensure that all administrators are highly qualified and match the needs of the school and its students. The principal will be an employee of the school, not an employee of the Educational Management Organization.

C.2.8 Minimum number of pupils necessary - Please see Attachment 45 C.2.8 The absolute minimum number of pupils necessary is 180. C.3 Facilities C.3.1 Facilities The committee has not yet obtained a suitable facility and, as such, is currently seeking a Subsection 7 Charter. The following information is provided pursuant to NAC 386.140(4): (a) Given the state of the real estate market in Las Vegas it is difficult to find existing facilities that are zoned and school ready. Most existing facility owners are not willing to expend funds to build out and properly zone a facility for a start-up charter school. The committee members are currently working to identify a suitable location for the school. It is contemplated that the school will obtain a facility at the time it receives approval of its application. (b) The school has currently engaged a leasing agent and is looking for a suitable building to lease. There is no affiliation between the broker and any members of the formation committee. The board will require a clause in the lease and the management contract that one is not contingent upon the other. The market analysis the school considers to find a facility is four fold: first, the school will designate a specific area for the facility; second, a certain amount of acreage and square footage for the facility; third, the property has to be properly zoned and permitted; fourth, the lease rate has to fit the budget. This approach allows the school to quickly identify buildings and properties that work within the parameters set and provide a point of comparison to assess proper market values. 1. The committee is currently considering many different sites but will select the appropriate site based upon size and affordability. 2. The committee intends to identify the school location by May 1, 2015. All permits and inspections would be obtained by July 15, 2015. The equipment for the facility would be obtained by August 1, 2015 to furnish the school. The personnel to run the school would be selected by June 1, 2015 with a start date in August 2015. (c) The school plans to open in August 2015. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 49 (d) The equipment at the school will be typical of a middle high school. The school will have an administrative area with desks, phones and computers. Each class will have whiteboards, computers, desks for each student and teacher. The cafeteria will have a warming room to serve lunch and the facility will retain space for storage of supplies. (e) A written estimate by an authorized insurer is included herein as attachment __. (f) Any leases will be conditioned on the approval of the school's application. C.3.2 Insurance Proposal/Affidavit - Please See Attachment 46 C.3.2. C.4 Transportation, Health Services, and Emergency Services C.4.1 Transportation The school will not provide transportation for the students to and from school. The school will work with the parents and guardians of students to facilitate parents interested in creating carpooling groups enabling other means of transportation to and from school. C.4.2 Health Services The school will provide health services to all students identified in need of such services. Upon determination of the number of students who are enrolled who require health services, school administration and staff will determine the extent of the services needed. The governing body will contract with the appropriate trained and qualified health professionals to deliver services to such students. Professional development will be provided to the faculty and staff on the administration of first aid and CPR. Select staff will be Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) trained (A.3.13). A FASA (First Aid and Safety Assistant) will be responsible for planning and carrying out health examinations required by law. In accordance with NRS 392.420, a licensed school nurse will be contracted to train the FASA. A training contract is not available at this time, but will be provided to the Authority upon its finality. State required examinations will be conducted by the FASA as follows. Students will be screened for auditory and visual problems in Kindergarten, third grade, and sixth grade. Scoliosis screenings will be held in seventh grade. Height and weight evaluations will be conducted in fourth and seventh grade. The FASA will be responsible for notifying the parents/guardians of any student who has a problem in the visual, auditory, height and weight, or scoliosis screenings. Pursuant to NRS 392.420(9), the FASA will also report these findings to the State Health Officer, in the format prescribed by the State Health Officer. Sports Leadership and Management Academy of Nevada 50 C.4.3 Immunization Records The school registrar will be responsible for reviewing, verifying, and maintaining immunization records. He/she will also be responsible for contacting the parents/guardians of students who are not in compliance with state regulations regarding immunizations and for informing school administrators of students who are not in compliance with state law. The principal will schedule parent conferences with students who are still not incompliance with state immunization laws after the first month of school. A student will be excluded from school until he/she has the proper immunizations, if the student has not provided the school with proof of immunization by the end of October.

The College and Career Readiness (CCR) Anchor Standards will help teachers define college and career readiness expectations while the grade specific ELA standards will guide instruction at each grade level and help ensure that pupils gain adequate exposure to an increasing complex range of texts and tasks as they progress from grade 6 through 12. The courses will cover the application of the writing process, effective use of speaking and listening and language skills, higher -order critical thinking and literacy skills in preparation for overall post -secondary preparedness. The reading standards focus on text complexity and the growth of comprehension in reading. The Reading standards place equal emphasis on the sophistication of what pupils read and the skill with which they read. Whatever they are reading, pupils must also show a steadily growing ability to discern more from and make fuller use of text, including making an increasing number of connections among ideas and between texts, considering a wider range of textual evidence, and becoming more sensitive to inconsistencies, ambiguities, and poor reasoning in texts. The writing standards focus mainly on text types, responding to reading, and research . To build a foundation for college and career readiness, pupils need to learn to use writing as a way of offering and supporting opinions, demonstrating understanding of the subjects they are studying, and conveying real and imagined experiences and events. They learn to appreciate that a key purpose of writing is to communicate clearly to an external audience and they begin to adapt the form and content of their writing to accomplish a particular task and purpose. They develop the capacity to build knowledge on a subject through research projects and to respond analytically to literary and informational sources. The speaking and Listening standards focus on flexible communication and collaboration including skills necessary for formal presentations. Speaking and Listening standards require pupils to develop a range of broadly useful oral communication and interpersonal skills. Pupils must learn to work together, express and listen carefully to ideas, integrate information from oral, visual, quantitative, and media sources, evaluate what they hear, use media and visual displays strategically to help achieve communicative purposes, and adapt speech to context and task. To build a foundation for college and career readiness, pupils must have ample opportunities to take part in a variety of rich, structured conversations \u2014as part of a whole class, in small groups, and with a partner. Being productive members of these conversations requires that pupils contribute accurate, relevant information; respond to and develop what others have said; make comparisons and contrasts; and analyze and synthesize a multitude of ideas in various domains. The l anguage standards focus on effective use of language, conventions, and vocabulary . The Language standards include the essential \"rules\" of standard written and spoken English, but they also approach language as a matter of craft and informed choice among alternatives. The vocabulary standards focus on understanding words and phrases, their relationships, and their nuances and on acquiring new vocabulary, particularly general academic and domain -specific words and phrases. To build a foundation for college and career readiness in language, pupils must gain control over many conventions of standard English grammar, usage, and mechanics as well as learn other ways to use language to convey meaning effectively. They must also be able to determine or clarify the meaning of grade- appropriate words encountered through listening, reading, and media use; come to appreciate that words have nonliteral meanings, shadings of meaning, and relationships to other words; and expand their vocabulary in the course of studying content. Course content for the courses listed below will be aligned to the aforementioned Nevada Academic Content Standards (newly adopted Common Core Standards). The College and Career Readiness standards and grade- specific standards are necessary complements \u2014the former providing broad standards, the latter providing additional specificity that together define the skills and understandings that all pupils must demonstrate. Teachers will address all Common Core State Standards for Language Arts and Literacy instruction and will prepare pupils for mastery of those standards focusing on the following: 2 62Attachment 3 Attachment A.3.3 Course Descriptions and Alignment with Standards The Connection: Student Self- Evaluation Goals - Below are examples of project- based task/learning activities related to the Sports Leadership theme to assist teachers in correlating real-world application activities to specific NACS in developing thematic lessons . At the beginning of the school year, Pupils will create Career Portfolios in their Language Arts, which will follow them through the English Language Arts course as they progress from grade to grade. The career portfolio will comprise pupil -managed collection of accomplishments that show progress toward career goals. The portfolio will: Display pupil strengths and abilities. Highlights their accomplishments and assist them in planning for the future. Increases their self -esteem by showcasing their accomplishments. Portfolios will be presen ted as Binders, Scrapbook, CD -ROM or Video formats allowing for pupils to modify and update information as they progress through the program Pupils at SLAM will be expected to create self- imposed annual goals for their career portfolios through Language Arts classes and build upon each goal every year thereafter as follows: Academic and/or Career Goal - Pupils will create a specific goal that they need to meet at the completion of the school year. Goals will be created under the direction of the Language Arts Teacher. These goals may range from \"building and developing work habits necessary to effectively learn subject matter\" or \"increasing one letter grade in their lowest performing subject\" etc. Through development of this goal, pupils will gain greater autonomy and realize their potential through the school year as they monitor and reflect on their progress through the school year. To supplement career exploration, pupils will have access to a career resources office through the school's guidance counselor which will provide them with information about career pathways, industries, job markets and searches, mentoring, career development po rtfolios, co -operative education, internships, service learning etc. Self - Esteem and Character Development Goal - Pupils will be able to identify their learning strengths, challenges, and passions; evaluate this knowledge in terms of their short - and long -term goals; and create a plan of action for their life- long learning based on this evaluation. They will be challenged by their mentors and peers and will be expected to learn to take responsibility for managing their own behavior in these situations. Pupils will be given opportunities for leaderships and character building projects to attain their goal. Behavior management techniques are an important part of the curriculum and increase- self esteem by providing opportunities for academic success. School and Community Service Goal - SLAM expects all pupils to be active and contributing citizens of their school and community. Pupils will understand their responsibilities for learning, behavior, and service learning requirement. Pupils will understand the effect that they have upon the community, and will take the initiative to better themselves and the community as a whole. They will choose either a school -based or a community service project, depending on their grade level and reflect on the accomplishments of this project throughout the school year.

These standards describe how Pupils should use mathematics and provide a mechanism through which pupils engage with and learn mathematics. The Standards for Mathematical Practice remain the same at each grade level; however, pupils will engage with and master new and more advanced mathematical ideas as they progress through each grade level. Accordingly, the Practice Standards will be taught and practiced in conjunction with the Content Standards at each grade level. Through the implementation of the NACS and via the connections of the mathematical practice and content standards, pupils will grow their ability to engage mathematics to reason, communicate, and problem solve (among other things) making them able to remain competitive in an ever changing, fast - paced and technology -rich society. The cultivation of skills and practices will he lp pupils develop a mathematical literacy, wherein they will have acquired the mathematical knowledge, problem solving ability, and communication skills required to become a college and/or career ready contributor, and excel in our ever -changing world. The Connection: Below are some examples of project- based task/learning activities connecting mathematical skills to the Sports Leadership theme for teachers to align real -world application activities to specific NACS in developing thematic lessons. Graphs and Statistical Data: Practicing skills while watching your next favorite sporting event During the game pupils can: 1. Average each player's contribution (scores, yards, hits, etc.) in the game 2. Compare a team's final stats versus other games for the year (and make a performance graph) 3. Measure distances of important field placements (goal -to-goal, basket hoop rim circumference, etc.) 4. Calculate probability of each player's scoring potential (using past scoring numbers) 5. Create a geometry shape from a typical sports action (record average shape distances) 6. Make a pretend fantasy team and hire players using a mock budget 7. Figure percentages of increase or decrease of a league's performance (over one year or multiple years) 8. Find the mean, median, and mode of a team's players' weight and height Creating and Applying Statistical Data: Using a Newspaper 1. Open the sports page of a newspaper, and find a box score. Discuss with the pupils the meaning of statistics. Break down each of the abbreviations in the box, so Pupils understand each the statistics in each section. 2. Ask the Pupils to calculate more statistics using the numbers in the box score. For baseball, have pupils calculate a player's batting average. Divide the hits by the number of times a player is at bat. Calculate the on -base percentage by adding the number of hits and walks with the number of times hit by a pitch, and dividing that number by the sum of the player's hit s, walks, times hit by a pitch and sacrifice flies 3. Look at other percentages that can be calculated using sports statistics. Find different sports throughout the year. SLAM Fantasy League Mathematical Practices 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively. 3. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. 4. Model with mathematics. 5. Use appropriate tools strategically. 6. Attend to precision. 7. Look for and make use of structure. 8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning. 14 74Attachment 3 Attachment A.3.3 Course Descriptions and Alignment with Standards 1. Assist pupils in drafting a fantasy basketball, football or baseball team. Look at the players' statistical track records and different salary -cap values to choose the right players for the team. 2. Look at the statistics for the starting players once or twice a week, depending on how often the players play. Look at how many points one player scores compared to another using the game statistics or calculate other statistics using the statistics you have. 3. Follow the team throughout the season, increasing the difficulty of the math questions, and incorporating multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, fractions and algebra as appropriate. Change the teams each season, using different statistics to help develop the pupils ' mathematics skills. The Three R's Framework -The activity below is an example of how the Rigor, Relevance and Relationship Model framework is applied to the curriculum. This lesson depicts how SLAM's engaging and innovative educational model can be applied in and out of the classroom. Pupils use complex material (Rigor) content that is relevant to their daily lives, offers value beyond the classroom (Relevance), and allows them to communicate and collaborate with people beyond t heir classroom (Relationships). Algebra and Sports Stats Pupils can use algebraic equations to interpret athletic performance by calculating statistics for any sport. Teachers first teach an equation used to find batting averages: A= x S + K T + N In Baseball, if a batter goes into a game with a seasonal batting average of \"S\" after a total of \"T\" times at bat, and gets \"K\" hits in that game for \"N\" times at bat, the player's new batting average is determined by this algebraic equation. The teacher then shows how the same equation could be used for other sports statistics: In Basketball, a Miami HEAT player goes into a game with a seasonal free throw average of F after a total number T free throw shots, he scores M free throws in that game for N times at the foul line. A= T x F + M T + N In Football, this equation will give you the total seasonal carries where: \"W\" = player's average seasonal yards \"Y\" = yards in that game \"C\" = carries in that game. A = SC x W + #Y SC C PBL Activity - Pupils use the formula to practice solving equations by determining their favorite athlete's performance stats. They can also create equations for other sports. Literacy Connection: Pupils write an explanation of how they determined the results and make predictions regarding next season's results or the probability of player's future status with the team. Interdisciplinary Extension - Pupils prepare follow-up questions to conduct an interview a 51's baseball player about his seasonal batting average and overall performance and future plans. Through the school's partnerships with Major League Baseball, these opportunities will be afforded to p upils through career day visits at the schools. 15 75Attachment 3 Attachment A.3.3 Course Descriptions and Alignment with Standards Courses Course Title: Mathematics 6 Grade Level: 6 This course will focus on four critical areas: (1) connecting ratio and rate to whole number multiplication and division as well as using concepts of ratio and rate to solve problems; (2) completing understanding of division of fractions and extending the notion of number to the system of rational numbers, which includes negative numbers; (3) writing, interpreting, and using expressions and equations; and (4) developing understanding of statistical thinking.

The Connection: Teachers can use real -world application activities that incorporate Essential Science Components in developing thematic lessons. Below is a sample project -based lesson activities connecting Science to the Sports Leadership theme. Lesson: Science of NHL Hockey: Newton's Thr ee Laws of Motion Purpose: Pupils watch a video on the actions involved in playing hockey. Although all sports are subject to Newton's three laws of motion in one way or another, hockey shows particularly clear examples. The activity will help pupils understand Newton's three laws of motion and how they relate to the conservation of momentum. Procedure: 1. After the pupils view the video, discuss Newton's three laws of motion. Have volunteers summarize the presentation of inertia and conservation of momentum in the video, and point out ex amples of the three laws as they view the video again - perhaps in slow motion or with the sound muted. Emphasize to pupils that a hockey puck obeys Newton's laws, just as colliding hockey players do. (The same is true for a ball in other sports, such as basketball, soccer, golf, or jai alai.) Pupils focus on exploring each of the laws, using guided questions to start the discussion. 2. Teacher guides pupils to design investigations for Newton's three laws by actually practicing with an object/hockey puck or ball in the school gymnasium or cafeteria. In areas where pupils are not involved with ice hockey, pupils could video record groups playing a few minutes of their favorite sport(s) and then analyze the motion in the video for examples of the three laws of motion and compare those with the motion in the ice hockey video.

Based on the R's model, SLAM NV teachers will develop thematic lessons (as described in Attachment 3, herein) to provide real -world relevance to core subject matter while addressing rigorous content and key areas of the curriculum in alignment with Nevada Academic Achievement Standards (NACS) . The school administrator in collaboration with the faculty will select the text books that will best support the core curriculum. Due to the changing nature of publications , textbooks listed may not adequately provide the intended curriculum. For example, several Nevada schools adopted McGraw -Hill's Lead 21 textbooks (2011), and subsequently discovered that the phonics was grossly lacking. According ly, much school's transitioned into McGraw - Hill's Wonders textbooks (2013). The principal and faculty need to have the discretion to choose their textbooks to select the best curriculum for specific student needs. The textbooks will be chosen at the discretion of the principal and faculty to allow for the flexibility of keeping the textbooks current. Texts will be aligned to Nevada State Standards. Texts to be used may include but are not limited to the following: Content Area Proposed Textbook Publisher Year Grade 6 English Springboard ELA 1 Literature -Language and Literacy (for Reading) College Board Pearson Prentice Hall 2011 2010 Science Integrated \u00a1Science Course 1 McGraw -Hill 2012 Math Springboard Math 1 or Glencoe Math Course 1 College Board McGraw -Hill Education 2011 World History Discovering Our Past: A History of the World McGraw -Hill 2011 Grade 7 Reading Literature -Language and Literacy Pearson Prentice Hall 2010 English Springboard ELA 2 Literature -Language and Literacy (for Reading) College Board Pearson Prentice Hall 2011 2010 Science Integrated \u00a1Science Course 2 McGraw -Hill 2012 Math Springboard Math 2 Springboard Math 3 Or Glencoe Math Course 2 College Board College Board McGraw -Hill Education 2011 US History/ Nevada History The American Journey/ Nevada, A Journey of Discovery McGraw -Hill/ Gibbs -Smith Education 2012 2005 Grade 8 English Springboard ELA 3 College Board 2011 Math Springboard Math 3 Springboard Algebra Or Glencoe Math Course 3 College Board College Board McGraw -Hill Education 2011 Geography World Geography and Cultures School Education Group/McGraw -Hill Education 2012 Science Integrated \u00a1Science Course 3 McGraw -Hill 2012 Health Glencoe Teen Health Nevada Edition McGraw -Hill 122Attachment 9 Attachment A.3.11 Textbooks Content Area Proposed Textbook Publisher Year Grade 9 English Language Arts Springboard English Textual Power 4 College Board 2011 Mathematics Springboard Mathematics with Meaning: Algebra I Springboard Mathematics with Meaning: Geometry College Board College Board 2011 Science Miller & Levine Biology Campbell Biology, AP edition, 9th edition Pearson Prentice Hall Pearson Prentice Hall 2014 2011 Health Prentice Hall Health Pearson Education Inc., publishing as Prentice Hall 2012 2013 Grade 10 English Language Arts Springboard English Textual Power 5 College Board 2011 Mathematics Springboard Mathematics with Meaning: Geometry Springboard Mathematics with Meaning: Algebra 2 College Board College Board 2011 Science Miller & Levine Biology Campbell Biology, AP edition, 9th edition Pearson Prentice Hall Pearson Prentice Ha ll 2014 2011 Social Studies Glencoe World History Traditions and Encounters, AP edition, 5th edition Glencoe McGraw -Hill Glencoe McGraw -Hill 2010 2011 Grade 11 English Language Arts Springboard English Textual Power 6 AP - Language of Composition 2008 College Board Bedford, Freeman 2011 Mathematics Springboard Mathematics with Meaning: Algebra 2 Springboard Mathematics with Meaning: Precalculus College Board College Board 2011 Science Pearson Chemistry Chemistry: The Central Science, AP edition, 12th edition Pearson Prentice Hall Pearson Prentice Hall 2012 2012 Social Studies The American Vision American History: Connecting with the Past, 14th edition (for AP) Glencoe McGraw -Hill Glencoe McGraw -Hill 2010 2012 Grade 12 English Language Arts Springboard English Textual Power Senior English AP Literature - Bedford Intro to Literature 8th Ed.

Other of forms of assessment and data collection will include the State standardized assessment. At this time, it is expected that the assessment will be provided by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. SLAM NV will administer whichever assessment is chosen to be utilized within the State's accountability system. The School will participate in the statewide assessment program and comply will all applicable requirements under NAC 386.150(7), NRS 386.550 (1)(g- h), and NAC 389.048- .083. The School will also participate in all federal and state required assessment programs as directed by the Sponsor following all required policies and procedures with regard to administration of tests and standardized practices. The types and frequency of assessments wi ll include: All Required State Assessments Teachers will provide a variety of assessments to determine student growth and progress monitoring. School -Based Assessments in all Courses will include: Weekly teacher -generated quizzes Monthly teacher -generated and textbook -adopted assessments Quarterly Exams Portfolios and presentations Class participation/presentation and PBL rubrics Quarterly projects /investigations Teacher Made Performance- Based Assessments UDL Design Framework* *Universal Design for Learning supports teachers' efforts to meet the challenge of diversity by providing flexible assessment strategies that help teachers differentiate instruction to meet varied needs, especially for Special 124Attachment 10 Attachment A.4.1 Assessment P lan and Instruments Education and ELL student populations. It does this by providing options for Instruction (Presenting information and content in different ways) and Assessment (Differentiating the ways that students can express what they know) . In alignment with Common Core Assessments, performance tasks elicit a demonstration of the student's mastery of one or more benchmark standards; they may require students to create a product, demonstrate a process and/or perform an activity. Performance tasks will be evaluated with teacher customized scoring rubrics/exemplars. SLAM NV's mission is to expose students to careers in the sports leadership arena, therefore Career Portfolios, Performance -Based Learning Task and Assessments, Exhibitions and Presentations, and, Peer and Self - Assessments will also be considered when assessing student performance and progress. Additionally, since SLAM NV's mission is to prepare students for college, the students will participate in college preparation exams. College Preparation Examinations include: Preliminary ACT (PLAN) - curriculum- based test to be administered to interested 10th graders - covers skills and knowledge commonly taught in the nation's schools. This timed test consists of four subtests: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science. Advanced Placement E xaminations (AP) - administered to eligible students taking AP courses in order to receive advanced placement and/or credit for college- level studies. College Board Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test PSAT/NMSQT - administered to all students in Grade 10, and optional for Grades 9 and 11. PSAT will compare a student's abilities and general academic development with other students throughout the nation who are planning to attend college. In addition, the school will comply with all required state assessments and administration dates will be aligned with schedules provided by the Nevada Department of Education and any other authority as may be applicable. 125Attachment 10 Attachment A.4.1 Assessment P lan and Instruments Nevada Testing Calendar for the Year 2015- 2016 TBD Program Grades Testing Windows/Dates *** Middle School SBAC ELA/Math 6 - 8 April 7 - May 5 NAA Reading, Math, Science, and Writing 6 - 8 February 4 - April 3 CRT Science 8 April 7 - May 5 NAEP 8 January 24 - March 4 WIDA ACCESS 6 - 8 January 20 - February 27 High School End of Course Exams** 9 - 12 TBD By the NDE NAA** 11 Feb 2 - May 1 NAEP** 12 Jan 26 - March 13 WIDA ACCESS 9 - 12 January 20 - February 27 Additional assessment information regarding the implementation of non -mandated assessments and the school's approach to assessments is respectively found in section s A.4 .2 and A.4.3 . ** SLAM NV will open with grades 6 - 9, and subsequently add an addition grade each year resulting in 6 - 12.

As part of SLAM NV's Educational Philosophy (A.1.4), the third R, relationships, focuses on fostering positive relationships with teachers, peers, and the community. To further empower student's positive behavior the school has adopted a positive behavioral support discipline policy (A.) that will be done through a three -tier Response to Intervention (RTI) Model. The school -wide positive behavioral support model will create a safe and positive school climate. The R TI Model is a researched- based, problem solving process that provides a continuum of tiered interventions with increasing levels of intensity and duration to prevent inappropriate behavior by means of teaching and reinforcing appropriate behavior. With the school's mission and philosophy in mind, this Problem Solving approach is intended to assist and support students in fostering posit ive relationships ; avoiding, whenever possible, the necessity for punitive measures that will interrupt the integrity of the everyday academic or social setting of each student. The goal of Positive Behavioral Support is to encourage appropriate behaviors through the use of positive reinforcement techniques in order to reduce further disciplinary consequences. Students that are struggling with appropriate behavior will be monitored frequently through the use of an individual behavior plan/contract. Since inappropriate behavior is a reflection of a multitude of variables from life at home to school, it is important to understand all aspects contributing to the inappropriate behavior. Since each child has different social and emotional needs, it is vital th at the behavior plan be unique to those needs. The overarching goal of utilizing a positive behavioral support philosophy is to reduce the number of expulsions and suspensions that often serve as a gateway to the justice system. However, there are circumstances which necessitate further consequences and disciplinary response. Students are expected to show respect for themselves and others. Each classroom has a climate in which optimal learning can take place. Students are expected to behave in ways that are acceptable to classmates and conducive to learning. Misbehavior on the part of students can be generally corrected when parents and teachers work together. 130Attachment 12 Attachment A.6.3 Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct The rules, regulations and due process procedures are designed to protect all members of the educational community in the exercise of their rights and responsibilities. Methods of positive reinforcement/rewards and/or loss of privileges will be utilized as described in our discipline philosophy (A.6.2). Administration will make the final decision on disciplinary actions. The school will adopt the Nevada Code of Honor which provides a clear expectation that all students will perform academic tasks with honor and integrity, with the support of parents, staff, faculty, administration, and the community. The learning process requires students to think, process, organize and create their own ideas. Throughout this process, students gain knowledge, self -respect, and ownership in the work that they do. These qualities provide a solid foundation for life skills, impacting people positively throughout their lives. Cheating and plagiarism violate the fundamental learning process and compromise personal integrity and one's honor. Students demonstrate academic honesty and integrity by not cheating, plagiarizing or using information unethically in any way. Expe ctations of behavior apply to ever y student : 1) who is on the school property ; 2) who is in attendance at school or any school -sponsored activity ; and, 3) whose conduct at any time or in any place has a direct and immediate effect on maintaining order and discipline in school. Types of Disciplinary Action include, but are not limited to Verbal reprimand; Teacher or counselor and student conference ; Written reprimand/referral ; Administrator and student conference; Contact with parent; Loss of privileges ; Detention - student will be issued a morning or afternoon detention to be served in school ; Work Duty on Campus - student is assigned to a designated staff member to engage in active work such as cleaning, picking up, and organizing; In -School Suspension - removal from class ; Out of School Suspension - absence from school - student is not allowed on school grounds or at any school -related function; and, Expulsion - student removed from school for the remainder of the school year. Determination of disciplinary actions will be made by the administration after careful review of specific incidents. Disciplinary r eferrals will be issued at the discretion of the administration. The decision regarding the consequen ce will be based on circumstances unique to each individual incident of inappropriate behavior. Factors such as the cause and severity of the offense, the pupil's attitude, length of time since the last incident, and the pupil 's past 131Attachment 12 Attachment A.6.3 Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct behavior records may i nfluence the disciplinary action to be taken. A good record of behavior can result in the administration of minimal disciplinary actions while the student who is more frequently involved in problem behavior can expect more severe consequences. A single incident of severe inappropriate behavior may require the application of a more severe consequence. Crimes such as arson, assault/battery on a school employee, possession of drugs/alcohol, immoral conduct, and possession of a weapon are grounds for expulsion. When a student receives a consequence of suspension (either in -school or out of school) or recommendation for expulsion, the parent(s) or guardian(s) will be provided notice in writing . The student will be afforded an opportunity to his explain his or her conduct. The parent(s) or guardian(s) will have an opportunity to appeal said decision with the school administrator. No student will be suspended, expelled, or otherwise removed from the s chool without the parent's consent, except for reasons for expulsion and suspension stated in Nevada law. Students cannot be removed from the school against the parent's wishes for offenses that fail to meet the standard for expulsion or suspension identified in Nevada law. When inappropriate behavior violates law, school officials will take appropriate disciplinary action as well as make a referral to law enforcement and Clark County Juvenile Justice Services authorities for criminal misconduct. Any action law enforcement authorities might take such as a citation or arrest is separate from any action taken by the s chool. If the student is arrested, law enforcement officials may transport the student to the Clark County Juvenile Detention Center. In accordance with juvenile court practices, the parent is notified by the Clark County Juvenile Justice Services personnel when a child is detained. Items Permitted/Not Permitted in School Students are expected to bring school supplies listed on the official school supply list, homework, lunch money or lunch from home and any other items requested by the teacher. Students are not permitted to bring toys, games or other items not of value to the learning process unless authorized by administration. The school will not be responsible for any lost or stolen items brought to school or that may have been taken away by school personnel. Students who violate this policy may be issued a disciplinary referral. In addition, electronic devices used in violation of the Code of Student Conduct will be confiscated and will remain in the office 132Attachment 12 Attachment A.6.3 Discipline Policy/Code of Conduct until the end of the following day after which a parent or guardian must come to the office to retrieve it . The school is not responsible for any inconvenience this may cause. Wireless Communication Devices Wireless communication devices include two- way communication devices, including cellular phones, mobile phones, beepers, pagers, portable computers, personal organizers, and similar wireless devices. Possessing a wireless commu nication device is not a violation of the Code of Student Conduct. However, a student should not disrupt the educational process or interfere with the safety -to-life issues of students by using a wireless communication device. The following rules must be followed regarding the possession, use, and display of wireless communication devices : Students may possess, display and use wireless communication devices before or after the instructional day. Students shall avoid classroom disruptions, by not displaying, using, or activating wireless communication devices during the instructional day, unless such use is deemed educational and authorized by the teacher. This includes on the school bus, during class, in the library, during lunch breaks, during class changes and during any other structured activity. Students must ensure that devices are turned off during the instructional day. Students must conceal wireless communication devices in a backpack, pocket, purse or other container during the instructional day. The school is not responsible if a student's wireless communication device is lost or stolen. 133Attachment 13 Attachment A.6.4 Truancy Policy When is an absence considered truancy? When a pupil is absent from school without a valid excuse, did not secure prior permission for the absence or did not make- up the class work for an excused absence, the absence is deemed unexcused. In addition, failure to provide an excuse within three (3) school days will result in an unexcused absence. In accordance with NRS 392.130 , an unexcused absence is deemed truancy. What happens if a pupil continues to be truant? Pursuant to NRS 392.140, when a pupil exceeds three (3) unexcused absences (truancies), the pupil is declared a habitual truant . Typically, declaring a student habitually truant will allow the school to focus more attention to the individual student 's attendance pattern. SLAM NV intends to provide interventions with the family to reduce unexcused absences. After the student's first unexcused absence and after a student is declared habitually truant, a parent conference will be held to determine what types of interventions the family may need. The family may be referred to outside resources such as social services. An intervention plan will be developed with the family with the goal of reducing truancy. For example, parents may be referred to a Reset Your Life, an organization that provides counseling and mentoring services for families. In addition, if a student continues to be habitually truant and accumulates more than 20 unexcused absences the student may be retained. However, it is the goal of SLAM NV to work with the families to reduce unexcused absences so that students will be succe ssful. 134Attachment 14 Attachment A.6.5 Absence Policy Regular attendance at school is a necessity if pupils are to achieve to their fullest potential. Parents/Guardians are urged to work with school personnel to resolve issues that may interfere with their child's school attendance. Who must attend school? Pursuant to Nevada revised Statue (NRS) 392.040, pupils between the ages of 7 and 17 years of age must enroll and attend school for the entire time the school is in session. Pupil s who are 6 years of age must attend school, if enrolled, for the entire time the class in which they are enrolled is in session. Enrolled pupils who are 17 years of age are subject to the state truancy laws until they reach their eighteenth birthday. A ll pupils enrolled must follow the rules of the school including those relating to school attendance. What is the procedure that should be followed after an absence? Pupils who have been absent must provide written notice (email is acceptable) from the parent/guardian to the school explaining the reason for the absence within three (3) school days after their return from the absence. Parent/Guardian explanations should include the following information: 1. The first and last name of the pupil ; 2. The date(s) the pupil was absent; and 3. The reason the pupil was physically or mentally unable to attend, how the absence was related to the pupil 's disability, or the nature of the emergency. The principal/designee will determine whether the absence is classified as excused or unexcused. Pupil s or parents/guardians are allowed three school days after the return from a pupil's absence to request homework. Schools must provide at least three school days for the assignment to be completed and submitted. What happens if notification regarding the absence in not provided to the school within three (3) school days? If an acceptable explanation of the absence is not provided within three school days, the absence is unexcused and, in accordance with NRS 392.130, is deemed a truancy. How do parents/guardians arrange an absence? Parents/guardians must submit a written request to the school prior to the absence(s). The maximum number of pre-arranged absences is 10 per school year. Forms to request a pre -arranged absence are available at the school. What happens if a pupil is late to school or class? 135Attachment 14 Attachment A.6.5 Absence Policy Pupils who are late are marked tardy. Secondary pupils who miss more that 30 minutes of any class period are counted absent for that period only. What is the limitation of absences? The limitation of absences for elementary pupils is twenty (20) unexcused total absences per year. The limitation of absences for secondary pupil s is ten (10) unexcused total absences per semester. Pre -arranged absences in excess of 10 during the school year and any pre- arranged absences for which the makeup work was not co mpleted and submitted, as required by the teacher, count toward the limitation of absences. What are the consequences for exceeding the limitation of absences? Elementary pupils may be retained in the current grade. Secondary pupils will not receive credit for any course in which the limitation of absences has been exceeded. For secondary pupils, the school is required to provide written documentation to pupils and parents/guardians regarding options for making up deficient credits. Is there an appeal process to address possible retention and denial of credit? The school is required to provide a written copy of the appeal process procedures to parents/guardians. If a parent/guardian believes that extenuating circumstances, issues that may have led to the excessive absence and/or mistakes in the record have been made, the parent may appeal to the principal/designee. 136Attachment\u0000\u0000\u0000 Attachment A.7.3 Community Demographics: Enrollment Data of Community Public Middle and Schools School NameGrade LevelZipStudents Enrolled Average Class Size Reading Math ScienceELL % IEP % FRL %Violent Incidets% Student Tranciency % of teachers not HQDesignationReading ED + ASWriting ED + ASMath ED + ASScience Average Class Math ScienceDrop Out Rate %Graduat ion Rate %Higher Educatio % Incidets% Student Tranciency % of teachers not HQDesignationReading ED + ASWriting ED + ASMath ED + ASScience ED + AS Bonanza HS 16 Attachment A.7.5 Student Recruitment Plan The School will market via multiple modes to ensure that all families are informed of their educational options. A grassroots recruitment campaign is especially important to make sure that \"harder -to-reach\" families (e.g. single- parent families, low socio -economic households, second language families, etc.) are aware of the choice program and their eligibility to apply for enrollment. A gra ssroots marketing campaign include s: school website, social media such as Facebook , flyers, direct mailers, a dvertisements in varying media, building relationships with community groups, and a \"door to door\" approach . The School will post flyers in local public facilities such as the post office, community centers and other locations of public access. The goal is to reach parents by using various means of information delivery. Promotional flyers and/or postcards will be distributed via direct mail and/or directly to community groups and churches to ensure that harder -to-reach families are aware of the school and their eligibility to apply for enrollment. Materials like flyers, mailer s, advertisements , etc. will be produced in Spanish and English. In addition, SLAM NV's Committee to Form (CTF) will build relationships with community group s and organizations. In partnership with community organizations, informational events at open forums such as community centers, parks , and libraries will b e held to inform the public. All of these methods are key to successful recruitment. It is expected that many of the organizations committed to partnering with the school will help with student recruitment. Locally, the school founders have received numerous expressed commitments to partner with this community -building initiative. Some of these organizations and partners include Joel Vidana, M.D.. Director of Physical Therapy at Centennial Hills Hospital; Cheree Sandness, M.D., Chiropractic Healing Center; Michael Crovetti Jr., D.O. Orthopedics and Sports Medicine; and, Dan Dolby, Branch Executive, YMCA, UNLV Allied Sciences. It is expected that many more organizations will partner with SLAM NV in the coming months. Nationally , SLAM has official partnerships with the the NBA, MLB, and Nascar. In a ddition, they have a partnership with Pitbull P roductions, Inc./Mr. 305, Inc., Mr. Armando Perez, the global recording artist professionally known as \"Pitbull. \" The original SLAM school is located in one of the inner city Miami neighborhoods where Mr. Perez grew up and he has become active in promoting the school nationally. Mr. Perez's involvement with SLAM has been featured on numerous national radio and television shows including National Public Radio, Good Morning America, Today Show, The Katie Couric Show, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Pitbull has partnered with 138Attachment 16 Attachment A.7.5 Student Recruitment Plan SLAM to participate in the implementation of the educational program and afterschool initiatives at the school. Mr. Perez and his production team will provide access to motivational speakers, celebrities, and sports figures to further engage students in school and career initiatives. Working with the local and national partnerships will provide the students with an invaluable real -world experience and will promote the school to organizations and other students. Utilizing all of the connections SLAM has and applying them locally will ensure that SLAM NV will recruit a diverse student body. 139Attachment 17 English Language Learners Manual of Nevada English Language Learners Manual 1 140Attachment 17 English Language Learners Manual Table of Contents SECTION I: IDENTI FICATION, REG INITIAL ASSE SSMENT AND ENT ............................................................................................................ 3 A.

Identification and R egistration of Engli sh Lang uage Learner Students The Dep artment of re gulations requi re schools to identi fy the primary language of each student who enrolls in a school for the first time. (NAC 388.620) . According to the regulations, a studen t's \"...prima ry language will be deemed to be other than En glish if: 1. The pupil first spoke a l angua ge other than Eng lish; 2. The primary languag e spoken in the home of the pupil is not English; or 3. The language most often spoken by the pupil is not English.\" To meet the NDOE requirements, parents or guardians of students en rolling in SLAM NV for the first time shall complete the Home Langua ge Surv ey (HLS) as pa rt of the registration pr ocess. The HLS is included in the registration package and is used to det ermine wh ether students ne ed to be tested for E nglish la nguage pro ficien cy. Based on the r esults, the student m ay qualify for ELL services. SLAM NV will use the HLS provided by the Authority. The questions are: 1. Is your child's first language a language other than English? 2. Is a language other than English spoken at home? 3. Does your child speak a language other than English with his peers? The Principal will design ate a person who is r espo nsible for r egistration (d esign ee) as the individual to ensure that all parents or guardians enrolling students for the first time complete the HLS at the time of registration. If the par ent or guardian needs help in completing th e HLS or any other part of the reg istration process, the designee will se ek assistance from oth er staff in the school. Based on t he respons es on the HLS, the design ee will enter the appropriate code in PowerSchool for English exclusive or route for testing. Student's registration and class assignme nt will not be denied while the language prof iciency assessment is pending. B. Initial Assess ment of ELL Students 1. Initial Assess ment for all Pote ntial ELL St udents Title III of the Elementary and S econda ry Educat ion A ct (ESEA) requires schools the En glish pro ficiency and noti fy the p arent/guardian of any student pending assessment within 30 c alenda r days from the beg inning of the school yea r. Students enrolling after the st art of the school yea r must be tested within 10 days, and parents/gua rdians notified within 15 d ays of enrollment. (See ESEA Title III, Sections 3302.a and 3302. d). NDOE re gulations further require that this assessment \"must be administer ed by a person who is profic ient in Eng lish and who has successfully completed training in the administration and s coring o f the ex amination r equired f or the assessment.\" 3 142Attachment 17 English Language Learners Manual (NAC 388.625) a. Special Rule Ap plicable During School Year If a child is pendi ng asse ssment at the time of placement, the parents or guardians will be apprised of the stude nt's languag e proficien cy status and progra m placem ent within 15 calendar d ays of testin g. b. Initial Assess ment of Students with Disabi lities As required by state regulation, once the school has assessed and classified a student whose prima ry languag e is not Eng lish and a concern is raised that the student m ay have a disa bility, that student will be refer red for assessment as provided und er the Individua l with Disabilities Edu cation A ct (IDEA) and the Nevada Administrative Code. In conducti ng an initial assessment, the school is r equired to use an ex amination approved by the State Department of Education and to determine fluency in English as established by the publisher of the ex amination. (NAC 388.625.1) The tests to be administer ed and the sc ores to be us ed for determini ng fluenc y in En glish, a re outlined below. 2. Steps to be C omp leted after Initial Assessment a. Students Class ified as Non-English or Lim ited Engli sh Proficient For students who are co ded as non-Eng lish or limited En glish proficient as a re sult of the initial assessment, the followin g steps are comple ted within the mandated timelines: 1) Classify students who are eligible for ELL services as no n- English or limited English proficien t. The students eligible for ELL services. 2) Prepare a P arent Notific ation Letter if a student q ualifies for ELL services. Once the parent receives the let ter, th ey may choose to receive E LL instru ctional services. If the par ent or guardian refuses E LL instru ctional services, the school will me et with the par ent or guardian to ens ure that the par ent or guardian unde rstands w hat is being waived. Paren ts or guardians m ay only wa ive ELL instru ctional services - not testi ng. T he school will document the p arent confer ence , and pla ce a copy of the wa iver in the cumulative student folder. 3) Create a binder for each student classif ied as no n-English, limited English proficient, or ful ly Eng lish proficient. The school will maintain the binder and will make it available to the teac hers. b. Students Class ified Fully English Proficient 4 143Attachment 17 English Language Learners Manual For students co ded as fully Eng lish Pro ficient, as a result of the initial assessment, the school will ensure that the following steps are taken within the mand ated timelines: 1) Assig n students who are not eli gible for ELL services the appropriate code; and, 2) Create a binder for each s tudent classif ied as no n-English, limited En glish proficient, or ful ly Eng lish proficient. The school will maintain the binder and will make it available to the teac hers. Students will be evaluated with the World- Class Instructional Design and Assessment's (WIDA) Assessing Comprehension and Communication in English State to State for English Language Learners (ACCESS). Students will receive an English Language Proficiency Level on a scale of 1- 6 (1-Entering, 2 -Emerging, 3 -Developing, 4- Expanding, 5-Bridging, 6- Reaching). Teachers will utilize the score report to better differentiate instruction to m eet the needs of each student. c. Program P lacement Once students are assessed, the Principal will e nsure that el igible students are provided appropriate ELL services. I n addition, Principals or desig nees will ensure that ELL students and their par ents or guardians are awar e of s chool activities and other opportunities at the school in a language they understand . Students who are eli gible for ELL services will receive t hese se rvices until it is deter mined, thro ugh reevaluation procedur es, that they possess adequate E nglish la nguage and academic skills to allow them to per form satis factori ly in general education c lasses without spec instru ctional consider ations. MODELS, EF FECTIVE ELL PRA CTICES, AN D STUDENT EVA LUATION A. Program Models As allo wed by state regulation, the school offe rs Content -Based E LL at t he element ary level. At the secondary level, the school o ffers Shelter ed-Content E LL. The goals of all of these progr ams are to: (1) help EL L students achieve comprehension, speaking , reading, and writing competenc e in the Eng lish la nguage; (2) enable students to achieve and maintain grad e level status; and (3) enable students to meet graduation standards. Below is a description of the programs. Appendix A includes effective instructional strategies for English Language Learners. English Language Learners should be provided with appropriate testing accommodations. See Appendix B. The principal will determine if there is a need for self -contained ESL classrooms. All teachers in self-contained E SL cl assrooms will hold either an endo rsement to teach E nglish as Se cond Languag e (TE SL) pursuant to NAC 391.237, or an endors ement to te ach a program of bilingual education pursu ant to NAC 391.242. 5 144Attachment 17 English Language Learners Manual 1. S econdary Sheltered Cont ent-Based ESL Instruction The Shelter ed Content -Based E SL Instruction M odel is an integr ated content la nguage approach. The goal of the Shelter ed Content -Based Instruction Model is for ELL students to develop Engli sh langua ge skills in content classes. Secon dary E LL students have a limited time to become aca demical ly pro ficient in En glish. Ther efore, ELL students must learn both Eng lish and academic c ontent as quick ly as possible. E nglish is tau ght through content ar eas by includi ng a stro ng langua ge de velopment com . The purpose of t he language de velopment compo nent is to te ach English la ngua ge lea rners to communicate (listen, spea k, read, and write) in English. This compone nt takes into account the ELL student's current English language proficiency le vel and gui des the teach er in providi ng the appropriate instr uction for each level. This model is implemented in an integrated classroom . An integrate d classroom consists of students who ne ed ELL se rvices and native Eng lish sp eakers . At the hi gh school level, this model also allows students to earn credit toward graduation in required c ore subject areas . Emphasis is on cooper ative learning, hand s-on ac visuals, demonstr Teac hers usi ng the Self -Contained Shelter ed Content -Based mo del should have a TESL or biling ual endorsement and be endor sed in the c ontent ar eas. Teachers us ing the Integrated Shelter ed Con tent-Base d model must be endors ed in the cont ent areas and be encouraged to obtain their TE SL or biling ual endors ements. B. Student Perf ormance Evaluation 1. Grading and Reporting Guidelines Secondary teache rs work ing with ELL students a re requi red to teach the objectives stated in the Common Core State Standa rds, ELD Common Core Stand ards, and s pecific content area. Teachers of ELL students will determine gr ades base d on their progr ess toward, and achievement of , objectives. 2. Prom otion and R etention The Principal at each sch ool will ensure appropriate policies are followed. As with non -ELL students, ELL students m ay be retained. In the case of ELL studen ts, the Princip al will ensure that ELL students are not retained based solely on the student's inability to perform in the En glish la ngua In maki ng a det wh ether an ELL student should be retaine d, the Principal will ensure that c areful consider ation is given to the rang e of services and options available prior to making the decision to retain a student. Respo nse to Instru ction ( RTI) data should be us ed to as sist the principal in making re tention decisions re garding an ELL studen t. Adjustments or changes to the student's educational program may be necessary in order to avoid retention. As with Eng lish exclusive students, retention concerns should be ong oing throu ghout the year. If the d ecision is made to retain an ELL student, the Principal will ensure that the student rece ives differ ent services duri ng the year following the retention. 6 145Attachment 17 English Language Learners Manual SECTION III: REASSE SSMENT, ECLASSI sment NDOE re gulati ons requi re that ELL students be reassessed every ye ar \"to deter mine whether the pupil's proficien cy in English is fluent and he is able to succeed in cours es of study that are taught only in English.\" (NAC 3 88.645) As per the NDOE (ESL Technic al Advice Bulletin Number 05-1 dated September 8, 2005 ), when a student is iden tified as Limited E nglish Pro ficient (LEP), the student must be given the test Accessing Comprehension and Communication in English State- to-State for English Language Learners (ACCESS for ELLs ) every y ear until the student exits the ESL progra m, graduates f rom hi gh school or withdr aws from school . Par ents or guardians of LEP children do not have the option of withdrawing their stud ent from pa rticipating in the ACCESS for ELLs . B. Re classi fication NDOE re gulati ons s tate that the school m ay reclassify an ELL student only if the school administers the Accessing Comprehension and Communication in English State- to-State for English Language Learners ( ACCESS for ELLs assess the pupil's profici ency to comprehend, spea k, read and write E nglish and the pupil obtai ns a score on t he examination that is equal to or greater than a score for a pe rson who is fluent in speaki ng, reading and writing Eng lish, as established by th e publisher of the examination. (NAC 388.645 .2). The school will monitor any stude nt reclassified as En glish pr oficient who has not yet met exit criteria. The school will ensure that reclassified students are appropriately placed in general education c lasses. C. Metho ds for Reclassif ication Consistent with NDOE r egulations, ELL students m ay be rec lassified using the recommended languag e proficiency assessment . The school will reclassify students using the ACCESS for ELLs for a student classified as limited- English pro ficient that obtains an over all lev el 5 la ngua ge proficiency sc ore. The school will monitor a student r eclassifie d as fluen t-Eng lish profic ient, but who has not yet met exit crite ria, for no less than two years. D. Monitoring Prog ress of Students who are Mainst reamed The school will monitor all r eclassified stud ents for a minimum of two years after th ey have met langua ge pro ficien cy. The purpose of this monitoring is to ensure that the students have no grad es below a \"C\" in any academic class and are no longe r in nee d of la ngua ge acqu isition assistance. The monitoring from the school will include periodic cont act with the student's teacher(s) to ascertain student progress. The school will also r eview the student's report card annually to review the student's attendance, academ ic and citi zenship grades. dered acad emically successful, a student shoul d have no gr ades below a \"C\" in English, re ading, math, scie nce, o r social studies. 7 146Attachment 17 English Language Learners Manual The ELL monitoring pro cess information should be included in any RT I interv entions that are determined by the school. Specific consideration for languag e proficien cy mu st be tak en into consideration in planning specific interv entions for the stud ent. If, as a result of monitoring , evidence indi cates that the student is not being suc cessful in E nglish- only classes and needs furt her la ngua ge acquisition assistance, the school shall administer the initial assessment te st to ascer tain the student's current English proficiency. A meeti ng will be held with the student's par ents or guardians and the student will be cons idered for reinstatem ent into the ELL progra m, into an academic reme diation pr ogram, or the student will remain in En glish-only classes. The school will continue to monitor the student for languag e and academic progress. I f the student is determined to be aca demical ly unsuccessful, the school and the approp riate te ache rs will seek out other services for the student in order to address a ny academ ic de ficiencies. Prior to making an y cha nges, the principal or desi gnee will me et with the p arent s or guardians to discuss the recommende d cha nges. E. Exited Students The school will reclassify a student as an ex ited ELL student if the following cr iteria are met: Accordi ng to Nevada St ate Department of Educat ion E SL Technic al Advic e Bulletin Number 05-1 (dated March 19, 2008) Limited Eng lish Pro ficient (LEP) students are ex ited f rom the Eng lish as a Second Language (ESL ) progra m by having achiev ed \"proficiency\", the sum of the Oral, Readin g, and Writing scores as desi gnated by gr ade l evel on the stat e's Accessing Comprehension and Communication in English State- to-State for English Language Learners (ACCESS for ELLs ), and have been monitored for a minimum of two y ears to ensure learning success.

In addition , The National Association of State Directors of Special Education in 2005 defined RtI as the practice of: (1) providing high -quality instruction/intervention matched to student needs and (2) using learning rate over time and level of performance (3) to make important educational decisions to guide instruction. RtI involves the systematic use of assessment data to most efficiently allocate resources in order to improve learning for all students. It is \"data -based decision making\" applied to education. The essential components of RtI include: Multiple tiers o f evidence -based instruction service delivery A problem- solving method designed to inform the development of interventions An integrated data collection/assessment system to inform decisions at each tier of service delivery Overview of Response to Intervention 3 156 RtI is comprised of core principles that represent recommended RtI practices (Mellard, 2003). These core principles represent systems that must be in place to ensure effective implementation of RtI systems and to establish a framework to guide and define the practice. The following are Response to Intervention core principles. 1. Use scientific, research -based interventions/instruction. The critical element of R tI systems is the delivery of scientific, research -based interventions with fidelity in general, remedial and special education. This means that the curriculum and instructional approaches must have a high probability of success for the majority of students. Since instructional practices vary in efficacy, ensuring that the practices and curriculum have demonstrated validity is an important consideration in the selection of interventions. Schools should implement interventions, monitor the effectiveness, and modify implementation based on the results. 2. Monitor core curriculum classroom performance. General education teachers play a vital role in designing and providing high quality instruction. Furthermore, they are in the best position to assess students' per formance and progress against grade level standards in the general education curriculum. This principle emphasizes the importance of general education teachers in monitoring student progress rather than waiting to determine how students are learning in rel ation to their same -aged peers based on results of state -wide or other standardized assessments. 3. Conduct universal screening/benchmarking. School staff will conduct universal screening in core academic areas. Screening data on all students can provide an indication of an individual student's performance and progress compared to the peer group's performance and progress. These data form the basis for an initial examination of individual and group patterns on specific academic skills (e.g., identifying lette rs of the alphabet or reading a list of high frequency words) as well as behavior skills (e.g., attendance, cooperation, tardiness, truancy, suspensions, and/or disciplinary actions). Universal screening is the least intensive level of assessment completed within an RtI system and helps educators and parents identify students early who might be \"at -risk.\" Since screening data may not be as reliable as other assessments, it is important to use multiple sources of evidence in reaching inferences regarding students \"at risk.\" RtI Academics and Core Principles 4 157Is this an individual student problem or a larger systemic problem?Decision Making Rubric for use with School-Wide Screening adapted from: Heartland AEA 11, Improving Children's Educational ResultsAre over 20% of students struggling?

Step 1 -What's the Problem? 4. Use a multi -tier mode l of service delivery. The RtI approach incorporates a multi -tiered model of service delivery in which each tier represents an increasingly intense level of services associated with increasing levels of learner needs. SLAM NV has adopted a three -tier approach. In the RtI system, all students receive instruction in the core curriculum, supplemented by strategic and intensive inte rventions when needed. Therefore, all students, including those with disabilities, may be found in Tier 1. Important features, such as universal screening, progress monitoring, fidelity of implementation and problem solving occur within each tier. Problem Identification: What is the problem? 5 158 5. Monitor intervention progress frequently. In order to determine if the intervention is working for a student, the R tI Team s must establish and implement progress monitoring. Progress monitoring is the use of assessments that can be conducted frequently and are sensitive to small changes in student behavior. Data collected through progress monitoring will inform the R tI Team s whether changes in the instruction or goals are needed. Informed decisions about students' needs require frequent data collection to provide reliable measures of progress. Various curriculum- based me asurements are useful tools for monitoring students' progress. 6. Implement all instruction with fidelity . Fidelity refers to the implementation of instruction and interventions as designed, intended, and planned. Fidelity is achieved through sufficient time allocation, adequate intervention intensity, qualified and trained staff, and sufficient materials and resources. Fidelity is vital in universal screening, instructional delivery and progr ess monitoring. Successful R tI systems must consistently maintain high levels of fidelity in the implementation of both interventions and progress monitoring. This means that the intervention plans are applied consistently and accurately. It is the respons ibility of an administrator at each school to ensure fidelity by monitoring the delivery of instruction (e.g., Principal's Walk Through and observation data ). 6 159 Problem Solving is a data- based decision making process that is used to identify needed interventions for students in Tiers 1, 2, and 3. Decisions are made by different RtI Teams that are composed of individuals who are qualified to make important educational decisions and to determine the allocation of resources. As a general rule, the composition of an RtI Team changes by adding specialists' expertise as services are delivered from tier to tier. Whether the team is the school leadership team, teacher team, or multidisciplinary (individual) problem solving team, the problem solving process is applied in a systematic process in order to analyze the data. The Problem Solving Method is simply an organized way for the team to make decisions using available data. The School -based Leadership Team uses the Problem Solving P rocess to inform decisions concerning school wide implementation of all areas if Response to Intervention, including changes to instruction, curriculum, and environment. The Teacher Data Team uses the Problem Solving Process to inform decisions about grade level and classroom level progress in the core curriculum (tier 1 progress), as well as intervention grouping. The Problem Solving Process helps the team use their time efficiently and increases the probability that the right instructional or interve ntion decision will be made the first time. The Individual Problem Solving Team (IPST) uses the Problem Solving Process to inform decisions about individual student academic and/ or behavioral deficits. The following four steps can be applied to any type of RtI meeting and documented : The Problem Solving Process 7 1601. Define the Problem The problem should be stated in objective measurable terms. The defined problem must focus on teachable skills. A problem is defined by the difference between what was measured and what was expected. To determine the extent of the problem, the expected benchmark for the assessment must be known . Once the benchmark is known, a comparison is made between the grade level, class average, and possible individual student average. This information will determine if the proble m should be addressed as a T ier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 concern.

Problem Solving Plan for Student Success ICEL Worksheet Domains: Instruction, Curriculum, Environment, and Learner 11 1643. Develop a Plan A good instructional/intervention plan: Explicitly defines the skills to be taught Focuses on measurable objectives Defines the who, what, when, where, and how of the intervention Describes how the instruction/intervention will be progress monitored. Includes a Goal Statement and Aim Line with clear numerical measures that define success. A goal statement helps to identify the necessary gain a student needs to make to close the gap. Begin by subtracting the student's curre nt performance (or group average of current performance) from the expected benchmark in the next benchmark period. This number will tell you how big the gap is. Determine what progress is realistic for the student. If the gap is extremely large you may h ave to adjust what growth is expected between benchmarks . Divide the necessary gain by the number of weeks for intervention. This calculation will help the team determine the level of intensity necessary to achieve the goal. At this point the Aim Line can be set. 12 1654. Evaluate the Response to Instruction/Intervention Answer the question, \"Is it working?\" Make sure that the growth rate is sufficient and that the gap is not getting larger when compared to peer data Progress Monitor throughout the intervention. The team should assess whether the data shows the student/s are progressing sufficiently along the Aim Line. Step 4 -Is it working? Goal Classroom Intervention IMaking instructional decisions based on the review and analysis of student data Progress monitoring always includes graphingProgress Monitoring Classroom Intervention 2 Modify Plan ba sed on Progress Monitoring data by determining the response. 13 166Positive Response - Gap is closing - Can extrapolate the point at which the target student will \"come in range\" of peers -- even if this is long range . Performance TimePositive Response to Intervention Expected Trajectory Observed Trajectory What do I do if the response is p ositive ? - Continue intervention with current goal - Continue intervention with goal increased - Fade intervention to determine if student(s) have acquired functional independence. 14 167Questionable Respons e - A questionable response is one in which the r ate at which gap is widening slows considerably, but gap is still widening or one in which the gap stops widening but closure does not occur . Performance TimeQuestionable Response to Intervention Expected Trajectory Observed Trajectory What do I do if the response is q uestionable ? - Was the intervention implemented as intended? (Fidelity ). If no, employ strategies to increase implementation integrity of the intervention. If yes, i ncrease intensity of current intervention for a short period of time and assess the impact. If the rate improves, continue this course of instruction and monitor progress. If the rate does not improve, return to problem solving. 15 168Poor Response - Gap continues to widen with no change in the learning rate (as identified by progress monitoring points). Performance TimePoor Response to Intervention Expected Trajectory Observed Trajectory What do I do if the response is p oor? - Consider the question, \" Was the intervention implemented as intended? \" (Fidelity ) If no - employ strategies in increase implementation integrity of the intervention. If yes - Is intervention aligned with the verified hypothesis? (Intervention Design) Are there other hypotheses to consider? (Problem Analysis) Was the problem identified correctly?

This team should examine prior intervention data and all relevant cumulative history in order to problem- solve at the most intense level. A student should not be referre d to Individual Problem Solving Team if the problem is a systemic instructional, curricular, or environmental problem. The IPST therefore functions best when specialists are able to collaborate on learner centered problems. IPST Individual Problem Solving Team 27 IPSTs are multidisciplinary, instruction - driven progress monitoring teams at each school which assists students, families and teachers in seeking positive solutions for all students . The primary goal of the IPST is to support teachers and parents by generating effective research -based academic and behavioral strategies for individual targeted students. IPSTs use school -wide and class -wide data to monitor the success and difficulties of groups of students and can offer academic and behavioral interventions to be applied to class or school -wide issues. Problem solving is a research- based strategy that seeks to ensure that individual, class -wide, and school -wide problems are addressed systematically and that important educational decisions are based on data that is collected frequently over time. INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM SOLVING TEAM (IPST) 180PROCESS The Individual Problem Solving Team revisits each step of the Problem Solving Method to determine why the learner has not yet responded to the instruction and intervention. This step is critical since the children referred to IPST are students who already have data that confirms they are not responding to intervention. Step 1: Review historical data (Gathered by the teacher teams ) Step 2: Review parent contacts and professional collaboration (teacher teams) Step 3: Current data - review and collect: o Acade mic enablers o Academic behavior and performance o Peer/Benchmark Comparisons o Develop Hypothesis and Goal Statement Step 4: Intervention Design and Monitoring Step 5: Check the data, monitor the intervention progress and decide the next steps to take (See the IPST User's Guide in this implementation manual Appendix for Gap Analysis Steps and detailed problem solving process at this level). PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESS 1. Define the Problem The problem should be stated in objective measurable terms. The defined problem must focus on teachable skills. A problem is defined by the difference between what was measured and what was expected. 2. Analyze the Problem Ask \"Why is the problem occurring?\" Think of all relevant hypotheses using data available 28 1813. Develop a Plan A good instructional/intervention plan: Explicitly defines the skills to be taught Focuses on measurable objectives Defines the who, what, when, where, and how of the intervention Describes how the instruction/intervention will be progress monitored. Includes a Goal Statement and Aim Line with clear numerical measures that define success. A goal statement can be formed using steps 3 and 4 of the Gap Analysis process. 4. Answer the question, \"Is it working?\" Modify Plan based on Progress Monitoring data: o Continue on if the growth rate is adequate o Increase intensity, frequency, or duration if growth rate is improving, but not significantly enough. o Change the intervention if the response is poor. Individual Problem Solving Team Guiding Questions In Teacher Data Meetings a general hypothesis will have been discussed for the purpose of grouping students in appropriate interventions. However, at this stage, the IPST should ask questions that dig deeper into the reason the student is not performing such a s: Was the problem identified at the most foundational cause (Problem Analysis) ? Is there enough diagnostic assessment data to be sure the intervention was correctly aligned and targeted to the specific problem? Is there a need to do observations or other assessments to gather more information before suggesting a different Tier 3 intervention? Did the student have enough Academic Engaged Time (AET) in the intervention? Considering the growth rate of the intervention data, how does this student compare to the peers in the same interventions? What is it about the interaction of the instruction, curriculum, environment, and learner that could help the team develop an individualized intervention? Does the team need more information about any of these? (See the IPST User's Guide in this implementation manual Appendix for Gap Analysis Steps and detailed problem solving process at this level). 29 182 Individual Problem So lving Team (IPST) Quick Reference Members Function Tasks Uses this type of data To discuss ...

The IPST fully engages in the Problem Solving Method at each stage. The IPST should examine prior intervention data and all relevant cumulative history in order to problem -solve at the most intense level. A student should not be referred to Individual Problem Solving Team if the problem is instructional, curricular, or environmental in nature. The criteria for a child to be referred from the Teacher Data Team to the Individual Problem Solving Team is that data must show a signific ant discrepancy between the student and the benchmark, a significant discrepancy between the student and their peers, and an insufficient learning growth rate from previous Tier 2 interventions. The reason students should not be referred to the Individua l Problem Solving Team without meeting the discrepancy or growth rate criteria is because the IPST only handles individual learner -centered problems. Gap Analysis: Divide the expected benchmark score by the current student performance. This is your bench mark comparison. Ex: 70% \u00f7 35% = 2.0 Divide the average peer performance by the student performance on the grade level. This is your peer grade level comparison. Ex: 81% \u00f7 35% = 2.3 Divide the average performance score of a selected subgroup (such as SES) by the student performance. This is your Subgroup Peer Comparison. Ex: 65% \u00f7 35% = 1.8 Determine the Gain the student needs to make to close the GAP. To identify the necessary gain subtract the student's current performance from the expected benchm ark in the next benchmark period. Ex: 90 wpm - 56wpm = 34wpm Now evaluate the students growth as evidenced in progress monitoring data in comparison to the growth needed to close the gap. Determine what progress was realistic for the student. Assess the growth rate. Ex: If the expected growth rate for second grade students is 5 words per minute per week on oral reading fluency, then set your expected growth rate in accordance with that rate. Progress Monitor throughout the intervention. The team should assess whether the data shows the student/s are progressing sufficiently along the Aim Line. 1). Define the Problem The problem should be stated in objective measurable terms. The defined problem must focus on teachable skills. A problem is defined by the difference between what was measured and what was expected. 2). Analyze the Problem Ask \"Why is the problem occurring?\" Think of all relevant hypotheses 3). Develop a Plan A good instructional/intervention plan: Explicitly defines the skills to be taught Focuses on measurable objectives Defines the who, what, when, where, and how of the intervention Describes how the instruction/intervention will be progress monitored. Includes a Goal Statement and Aim Line with clear numerical measures that define success. A goal statement can be formed using steps 3 and 4 of the Gap Analysis process. Answer the question, \"Is it working?\" Modify Plan based on Progress Monitoring data: 4). Evaluate the Plan: Continue on if the growth rate is adequate Increase intensity, frequency, or duration if growth rate is improving, but not significantly enough. Change the intervention if the response is poor. 30 183 Appendix School Leadership Team Resources School -Based Leadership Team - Quick Reference RtI Quick Reference Guide Self Assessment of Problem Solving Implementation (SAPSI) - PS/RtI Tier I and II Critical Components Checklist - PS/RtI Tiers I & II Observation Checklist (Initial) - PS/RtI Problem Solving Team Checklist (Initial Version) - PS/RtI Problem Solving Team Checklist (Follow -Up Version) - PS/RtI Teacher Data Team Resources Teacher Data Team Quick Reference Example: Meeting Record Problem Solving for Success Worksheet (ICEL) - PS/RtI Individual Problem Sol ving Team Resources Individual Problem Solving Team Quick Reference Individual Problem Solving Team User's Guide and Forms 31 184 Resources School -Based Leadership Team - Quick Referenc e RtI Quick Reference Guide Self Assessment of Problem Solving Implementation (SAPSI ) - PS/RtI Tier I and II Critical Components Checklist - PS/RtI Tiers I & II Observation Checklist (Initial) - PS/RtI Problem Solving Team Checklist (Initial Version ) - PS/RtI Problem Solving Team Checklist (Follow -Up Version ) - PS/RtI School Leadership Team Resources 32 185 School- Based Leadership Team Quick Reference Members Problem Solving Tasks Uses this type of data To discuss ...

Have our teachers received adequate training in implementing the core and supplemental instruction? Do we have a plan to communicate the RtI Process to our families/parents? Have we analyzed the weaknesses in the core and supplement the core as needed? Looking at Tier 1 Screening Data, what type of instruction and intervention do our students need? Based on data, where do we see the need for staff development in the school? In a grade level? In a classroom? Based on data, where should we 'spend' or place our resources (money and personnel?) What skills and strategies can we learn about in professional development that will enhance our instruction and intervention? Based on Tier 1 data (trends, patterns), what are the strategies and skills we need to provide so all students receive the Differentiated Instruction that they need? Is our data representative of assessments that are reliable, valid, and sensitive measures that define student achievement over time? 33 186 Pennsylvania Training and Technical Assistance Network (PaTTAN) June 2008 34 187 Self-Assessment of Problem Solving Implementation (SAPSI)* PS/RtI Implementation Assessment Directions: In responding to each item below, please use the following response scale: Not Started ( N) \u2014 (The activity occurs less than 24% of the time) In Progress ( I) \u2014 (The activity occurs approximately 25% to 74% of the ti me) Achieved ( A) \u2014 (The activity occurs approximately 75% to 100% of the time) Maintaining ( M) \u2014 (The activity was rated as achieved last time and continues to occur approximately 75% to 100% of the time) For each item below, please write the letter of the option (N, I, A, M) that best represents your School -Based Leadership Team's response in the column labeled \"Status\".

The IPST fully engages in the Problem Solving Method at each stage. The IPST should examine prior intervention data and all relevant cumulative history in order to problem -solve at the most intense level. A student should not be referred to Individual Problem Solving Team if the problem is instructional, curricular, or environmental in nature. The criteria for a child to be referred from the Teacher Data Team to the Individual Problem Solving Team is that data must show a significant discrepancy between the student and the benchmark, a significant discrepancy between the student and their peers, and an insufficient learning growth rate from previous Tier 2 interventions. The reason students should not be referred to the Individual Problem Solving Team without meeting the discrepancy or growth rate criteria is because the IPST only handles individual learner -centered problems. Gap Analysis: Divide the expected benchmark score by the current student performance. This is your benchmark comparison. Ex: 70% \u00f7 35% = 2.0 Divide the average peer performance by the student performance on the grade level. This is your peer grade level comparison. Ex: 81% \u00f7 35% = 2.3 Divide the average performance score of a selected subgroup (such as SES) by the student performance. This is your Subgroup Peer Comparison. Ex: 65% \u00f7 35% = 1.8 Determine the Gain the student needs to make to close the GAP. To identify the necessary gain subtract the student's current performance from the expected benchmark in the next benc hmark period. Ex: 90 wpm - 56wpm = 34wpm Now evaluate the students growth as evidenced in progress monitoring data in comparison to the growth needed to close the gap. Determine what progress was realistic for the student. Assess the growth rate. Ex: If the expected growth rate for second grade students is 5 words per minute per week on oral reading fluency, then set your expected growth rate in accordance with that rate. Progress Monitor throughout the intervention. The team should assess whether the data shows the student/s are progressing sufficiently along the Aim Line. 1). Define the Problem The problem should be stated in objective measurable terms. The defined problem must focus on teachable skills. A problem is defined by the difference between what was measured and what was expected. 2). Analyze the Problem Ask \"Why is the problem occurring?\" Think of all relevant hypotheses 3). Develop a Plan A good instructional/intervention plan: Explicitly defines the skills to be taught Focuses on measurable objectives Defines the who, what, when, where, and how of the intervention Describes how the instruction/intervention will be progress monitored. Includes a Goal Statement and Aim Line with clear numerical measures that define success. A goal statement can be formed using steps 3 and 4 of the Gap Analysis process. Answer the question, \"Is it working?\" Modify Plan based on Progress Monitoring data: 4). Evaluate the Plan : Continue on if the growth rate is adequate Increase intensity, frequency, or duration if growth rate is improving, but not significantly enough. Change the intervention if the response is poor. 53 206 Individual Problem Solving Team (IPST) USER'S GUIDE 54 207 In the Response to Intervention/Instruction model, the three tiers are levels of services of instruction and support for students. The tiers of services are not placements for students, but represent a continuum of increasing levels of support that students may receive and have access to. Tier 1 services are core instruction in any content area that all students receive. In addition to the core instruction, some students may require additional supplemental instruction (Tier 2) or intensive and target instr uction (Tier 3). The Response to Instruction/Intervention model uses data to answer questions about the effectiveness of all Tiers and levels of instruction, beginning with Tier 1. Before teams look at individual students for problem solving, which take s place in the Indiv idual Problem Solving Team ( IPST), schools should have two other teams in place analyzing and considering student data. The School Leadership Team uses school wide data, grade level/department data, and classroom data to determine the effectiveness of the core Tier 1 instruction monthly as new data is collected. Teacher Data Teams use individual, classroom, grade level, and department wide data to determine effectiveness of core Tier 1 instruction, with a specific focus on data trends in dicating student need and the need for differentiated instruction. In order to individually problem solve one student's situation, the Response to Instruction/Intervention model requires schools to determine how many other students are in the same situati on. If more than 20% of a class or of a group of students are experiencing a similar problem, the way to address this problem is addressing Tier 1 instruction since Tier 1 instruction should be effective for 80% of students. If 5% - 20% of students in the class or group are experiencing a similar problem, the way to address this problem is through Tier 2 supplemental instruction. If less than 5% of students are experiencing a similar problem, then it is prudent to individually problem solve this situation. In summary, the identification of the problem and how to approach it is: How many students have this problem? Problem Identification and possible action Teams needed to take action What to use to monitor 20% of class/subgroup/grade level Tier 1 - address instruction that everyone is receiving Teacher Data Teams and School Leadership Team Tier 1 data Between 5% - 20% of class/subgroup/grade level Tier 2 - develop small group Intervention and support Teacher Data Teams and School Leadersh ip Team Biweekly or tri -weekly progress monitoring data 5% of class/subgroup/grade level Individual Student - develop intensive, targeted intervention IPST Weekly ongoing progress monitoring data This IPST USER GUIDE is to be used as a reference for IPST ( Individual Problem Solving Teams) as needed when seeking to problem solve an individual student situation. SLAM NV Indiv idual Problem Solving Team (IPST) 55 208To be clear, this team looks at individual problem solving when 5% of the class/subgroup or grade level is experiencing the same problem and the other two school based teams (School Leadership and Teacher Data teams) have evaluated at Tier 1 Differentiation and Tier 2 Supplemental Instruction. In order to proceed to the IPST, it is assumed that the student is receiving Effective Differentiated Core Instruction at Tier 1 and Effective Supplemental Instruction at Tier 2 and is still showing a need in comparison to the peers in the class and grade level / department. A summary of the forms and five steps are below: STEP 1: IPST FORM 1: Historic and Cumulative Review . This form is the basic review of the student's history. At the onset of teacher concern in academic and/or behavior areas, the teacher gathers historical data on the student. This history helps create a full picture of the student and helps provide information of historic trends, student strengths, and student needs. This may be taken from the cum folder or an electronic source . STEP 2: IPST FORM 2: Parent Contact and Staff Consultations . At the onset of a teacher concern, it is best practice to always inform the parent/guardians of the concern. This form documents when and how this notification of concern occurred. Additionally, the RtI process encourages professional collaboration, and this form also documents a teacher's collaborative effort to inform instruction and address student needs through professional collaboration. STEP 3A: IPST FORM 3A: Academic Data Collection At this step in the process, current student data is collected and the problem identification phase is confirmed. There may be a need to gather more data, however, but once sufficient data is gathered and the problem is confirmed (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3), the data is analyzed. STEP 3B: IPST FORM 3B: Problem Identification, Gap Analysis, Hypothesis, Goal Statement This form collects essential information regarding a student's level of performance compared to benchmarks and peers. In addition, this data on this form identifies enablers and inhibitors to academic and/or behavioral success. Successful identification of enablers and inhibitors will better guide teams to develop effective interventions. In order to complete a GAP analysis, the student data, class data, grade level, and benchmark data on the same measure should be collected. This will help determine the magnitude of a gap from individual student to the benchmark or peers. Based on this data, a hypothesis and goal statement is generated to inform intervention. STEP 3C: IPST FORM 3C: Behavior Data Collection If the problem does not consist of entirely academic concerns or behavior is a concern as well, this form is one example of a data collection tool that gathers information about student behavior to determine trends or patterns. In order to develop a meaningful intervention plan, it is important to identify the function (pay -off) of the interfering behavior and the environmental condition in which the behavior is most likely to occur. By having the teacher(s) provide this type of information before or during the IPST meeting, the team is more likely to generate targeted and useful interventions linked to the specific problem area 56 209 STEP 4: IPST FORM 4: Individual Student Intervention Design and Evaluation The individual student intervention design should be completed by the IPST team. The classroom teacher, intervention teacher, or person providing targeted intervention to the student will provide input and documentation regarding the data points and progress monitoring. A fidelity log may also b e attached for evaluation purposes by the IPST. The intervention teacher provides documentation as to the intervention itself (absences, frequency, etc.,) and the ongoing progress monitoring data (OPM). The IPST team evaluates the effectiveness of the inte rvention and makes decision accordingly. Step 4 is to document individual interventions attempted and the student's response. Data will indicate if the research -based intervention should be continued, modified or if other intervention(s) may be more effective. See form directions for specific instructions. Step 5: IPST FORM 5: Analysis of Interventions and Recommendations This fo rm will be completed by the IPST Chair with input from the team. Consideration is given to data collected throughout the problem solving process, and the IPST team determines educational needs based on the student's response to interventions. Data drives the problem solving process. Through accurate progress monitoring, the team will have sufficient data to make important educatio nal decisions about the student. These decisions may include maintaining the current intervention, modifying the intervention, terminating the intervention, or referring to alternate programs or for a social history and/or psychoeducational evaluation. 57 210 SLAM NV Indiv idual Problem Solving Team ( IPST) Team Process Steps 1 - 5 Note: The following documents represent a framework and process to document the Response to Instruction/Intervention process. The five step process is as follows: Step 1: At the onset of teacher concern in academic and/or behavior areas, the teacher gathers historical data on the student. (Teacher fills out this form). Hard Copy: Use IPST FORM 1 : Historic and Cumulative Review . Step 2: The t eacher notifies parent/guardian of the concern, continues instruction, and seeks professional collaboration as necessary. (Teacher fills ou t this form).Hard Copy: Use IPST FORM 2: Parent Contact and Staff Consultations . Generally, RtI S teps 1 and 2 are before any IPST meetings and are part of the RtI referral process when moving to IPST from the teacher data team meetings. Steps 3-5 are facilitated by the IPST team chair and the multidisciplinary team provides input. Teachers are not to complete RtI steps 3 -5 on their own. Step 3: Current data is collected and the Problem Identification phase begins. Problem Identification may include the need to gather more data. Once sufficient data is gathered, data is analyzed and the problem is identified. Based on this information, a hypothesis and a goal statement are generated. Hard Copy: Use: Documentation form: IPST FORM 3A = Academic Data Collection IPST FORM 3B = Problem Identification, Gap Analysis, Hypothesis, Goal Statement IPST FORM 3C = Behavior D ata Collection Step 4 : Interventio n design. The IPST team will design an intervention to address the goal. Hard Copy: IPST FORM 4: Individual Intervention Design and Evaluation. Step 5 : Evaluation of steps 1 - 4 to determine next course of action. Hard copy: Use IPST FORM 5 Analysis of In terventions and Recommendations . 58 211 SLAM NV Individual Problem Solving Team ( IPST) Documentation Process - Quick Reference Form Title Who/When What IPST FORM 1 Historic and Cumulative Review Classroom teachers complete this prior to any IPST team data meetings. Usually teachers begin to collect this when concerns begin to develop. When a teacher has a concern about a student academically or behaviorally that warrants further investigation, th is form serves to collect this information. IPST FORM 2 Parent Contact and Staff Consultations Classroom teachers complete this prior to any individual problem solving team data meetings. This form documents parent and professional contact for academic and behavioral concerns. IPST FORM 3A Academic Data Collection IPST Team is responsible for this form. Classroom teachers complete the individual student and classroom peer data. Grade level, school, and district data provided by guidance and/or school psychologist. This form documents the student level of performance compared to benchmarks and peers (Beginning of Gap Analysis). IPST FORM 3B Problem Identification, Gap Analysis, Hypothesis, and Goal Statement IPST Team is responsible for this form. School Psychologist should be responsible for both academic and behavioral gap. Behavior analyst should also be involved if available. This form documents the student level of performance compared to benchmarks and peers in terms of magnitude. Additionally, this form documents observation of instruction, curriculum, environment and learner information.. IPST FORM 3C Behavior Data Collection IPST Team is responsible for this form. Depending on the issue, it may involve the School Psychologist, Behavior Analyst, and/or Social Worker. This form is for situations which include behavior concerns and the information is used to determine cause and function of behavior. IPST FORM 4 Individual Intervention Design and Evaluation The IPST Team and classroom teachers design Tier 3 interventions. The classroom teacher is responsible for monitoring progress and reporting on this form for next IPST review. This form documents the fidelity and progress monitoring during intervention, including attendance, etc. IPST FORM 5 Analysis of Interventions and Recommendations IPST Team is responsible for this form. However, School Psychologist and Staffing Specialist must attend. Eligibility may be determined at this time. This form documents the determination of response to interventions during entire process; analysis of fidelity of interventions, and recommendations based on the analysis. 59 212 Student: DOB: ID: Grade: Teacher: YES NO COMMENTS Attendance Concerns Multiple School Enrollment History Vision Concerns Hearing Concerns Speech/Language Concerns Medical, mental health or health concerns Academic Concerns Behavior Concerns Previous Screenings (KBIT, KTEA, etc.) Previous Psychological and/or Social History Written report Retentions If yes, indicate grade level(s) retained PMP, CST, or P roblem Solving T eam History IEP History 504 Plan ESOL / LEP 1 Individual Problem Solving Team (IPST) History and Cumulative Review ii 60 213 WHO: Step 1 is to be completed by the classroom teacher or other staff as appropriate (e.g., guidance counselor, school psychologist, school social worker). WHAT: Step 1 is a review of the cumul ative record (may be electronic) to address areas of attendance, enrollment history, academic history, retentions, previous psycho -educational testing, etc. WHEN: The form is to be completed when a teacher has concerns about a student academically or behaviorally that warrants further investigation of the problem. This is the first information to be gathered before collaborative meetings (grade level meetings, department meetings, before any problem solving meetings). WHERE: The cumulative record and IPST file are resources for obt aining the requested information. WHY: A cumulative review can assist with identifying why a student is having academic or behavioral problems. Information that is obtained through the cumulative record can help identify areas that may be impacting perf ormance (e.g., history of attendance problems, high mobility, sensory concerns, a 504 plan, etc.). HOW : Teachers can fill out RtI Step 1 with information from the cumulative record. When available, an electronic print out can be attached to relieve the teacher from re -copying information. When completing RtI Step 1, simply attach the print -out and complete other areas specified on RtI Step 1 that are not contained within the printed information. Add comments if needed when the response to any item is \"yes.\" SLAM NV IPST FORM 1 Individual Problem Solving Team (IPST) History and Cumulative Review Directions 61 At least one parent contact must be recorded before moving to Individual Problem Solving. Date(s) Plan/Outcome 1st Contact Phone _____ In person _____ Email _____ Name of Parent/Guardian: Signature of parent if in person: 2nd Contact Phone _____ In person _____ Email _____ Name of Parent/Guardian : Signature of parent if in person: School Staff Consultations: Date(s) Plan/Outcome PLC or other teacher collaboration Content Area Contact and/or Specialist (reading coach, Title 1, ESE teacher, specify content area) Building Supports: Guidance (Suggested for behavioral concerns), Speech/Language Path., Administration Other County Supports: School Psychologist, Social Worker, etc. SLAM NV IPST FORM 2 Individual Problem Solving Team (IPST) Parent and Staff Consultations 62 215 SLAM NV IPST FORM 2 Individual Problem Solving Team (IPST) Parent and Staff Consultations WHO: Step 2 is completed by the classroom teacher. WHAT: Step 2 Documents parent/guardian and staff consultations. In addition, the form documents plan of action and outcomes of consultations. WHEN: Step 2 should be initiated when a teacher identifies an academic or behavioral problem that may benefit from communication with the parent. The staff consultations section is accessed when the teacher needs support or assistance from other professionals within the school community. BOTH PARENT CONTACTS DO NOT NEED TO BE MADE BEFORE BRINGING TO TEAM. One parent co ntact should be initiated when concerns arise and it is always best practice. Usually this is when a PMP in initiated, but can be sooner as well. WHERE : When consultations with itinerant professionals may be needed, simply e -mail the school psychologist , school social worker, or other professional to request a consultation or leave a note in their mailbox at the school. For consultations with staff at the school, simply arrange a meeting. The teacher can document parent contact via a parent conference, p hone call, email, etc. WHY : The purpose of Step 2 is to document that the parent is notified and current with their child's progress. In addition, this form allows for flexibility and precision in consultation with colleagues and relieves the teacher of scheduling a large group meeting when problems first arise. Furthermore, if the student is eventually referred to the IPST team and an evaluation is requested, State Board Rules indicate that at least two parent conferences must be held with the parent pr ior to considering eligibility for exceptional student education . This form easily document s those contacts with parents . HOW : Indicate date of contacts/consultations with parents and staff. For the \"plan/outcome\" section of the Parent/Guardian contacts, indicate what the teacher and parent agree to do to address the student's issue. For follow -up parent contacts, indicate the ou tcome of the prior plan. If the previous teacher is on- site, consulting to determine if the student had similar problems in the past can be helpful. If so, determine if the previous teacher had a plan to help the student be successful and utilize a similar plan if appropriate. For the \"plan/outcome\" section of the Staff Consultations, indicate what the teacher and staff agree to implement in order to address the student's issue. Provide outcome anecdotal information and data as appropriate. 63 216 Student Name: Student #: 1).

What percentage of the class exhibits similar academic problems? ___ 5% or less ___ 5%-20% ___ 20% -50% ___ Over 50% 4). If behavior is unsatisfactory, what percentage of the class exhibits similar behaviors? 5% or less 5%-20% 20% -50% Over 50% 64 217 WHO: Step 3A should be completed by the IPST Team and classroom teacher for elementary students. At IPST meeting, the team may request that another teacher/professional provide input who currently works with the student. For middle and high school students, at least 2 teachers currently working with the student within an area of concern should provide in put. A second IPST observation form is required by federal statutes and State Board Rules if the student is referred for a comprehensive evaluation. Statutes further specify that the second observer must be a member of the multi -disciplinary team. WHAT : Step 3A provides essential information regarding a student's level of performance compared to benchmarks and peers. In addition, this form identifies enablers and inhibitors to academic and/or behavioral success. WHEN: Step 3A is used when a teacher considers developing group or (more intensive) individual interventions for students and wants to isolate factors that may lead to successful problem identification and analysis. WHERE: Step 3A should be accomplished through direct observation of the student within the classroom regarding work habits and by reviewing sources of class -wide data and grade level data. In addition, formative assessments provide information regarding academi c performance compared to benchmarks and peers. WHY: Successful identification of enablers and inhibitors will better guide teachers to develop effective interventions. In order to complete a GAP analysis, the student data, class data, grade level, and benchmark data on the same measure must be collected. This will help determine the magnitude of a gap from individual student to the benchmark or peers. Additionally, questions 3 and 4 will help determine how many other students are experiencing the same gap or situation. HOW: For item 1, simply place a check mark by the section indicating how the student is performing compared to expectancy. Utilize data from Tier 1 Core assessments such as FAIR, District assessments, common assessments in the school o r district within the curriculum, etc., and formative assessments to determine the student's academic performance level. For items 3 and 4, determine what percentage of the class has similar problems. Do not make subjective judgments about the percentage o f students having similar problems; rather use your class -wide data and/or grade level data to make this determination.

T he team may request that another teacher/professional provide input who currently works with the student. WHAT : Provides essential information regarding a student's level of performance and rate of progress compared to benchmarks and peers in terms of magnitude . WHEN: When a team is considering developing Tier 3 or more intensive interventions for individual students and w ants to begin isolating factors that may lead to successful problem identification and analysis . WHERE : By direct observation of the student within the classroom regarding work habits and by reviewing sources of class - wide data. In addition, observing the environment and instruction will provide information to develop the goal statement . WHY: Using STEP 3A, STEP 3B and/or STEP 3C, successful identification of enablers and inhibitors will better guide teachers to develop effective interventions. Furthermo re, if the student is eventually referred and an evaluation is requested, federal regulation and State Board Rules indicate that at least two observations of the student must be completed by educators prior to considering eligibility for exceptional student education. This form easily documents those observations. HOW: For item 5, determine the Gap. The Gap is the answer found when dividing the expected benchmark score by the current student performance. (This would be a discrepancy between the individual student and the benchmark on a certain test or criteria, or between the indivi dual student and peers on certain measures). For example, to determine Tier 1 effectiveness, divide the expected benchmark score by the average of student performance on the grade level instead of one student score. For individual student gaps, divide the expected benchmark score by the individual student score. The score reflects the gap the student needs to close to be on grade level. Determine if the Gap is significant. A Gap above 2.0 is usually considered statistically significant , however guidelines will be determined by the district as interpretation of the state statute continues . For item 6 , utilize the directions for the RIOT by ICEL form and the worksheet and attach. Other observation forms of the instructional practices, curriculum, environme nt, and learner may be attached in place of RIOT by ICEL as long as the areas are all considered (not just the learner). For item 7 , determine the Gain the student needs to make to close the GAP. To identify the necessary gain subtract the student's curre nt performance (or group average of current performance) from the expected benchmark in the next benchmark period. The Team determines what progress is realistic for the student. Divide the necessary gain by the realistic progress to determine the number of weeks for intervention . This calculation will help the team determine the level of intensity necessary to achieve the goal. At this point the Aim Line can be set. Ex: 30 words per minute / 3 words per week expected growth = 10 weeks for the intervention. Given the current student performance of 30 words per minute, and growth of 3 words per minute per week, ten weeks from intervention implementation would set the aim line. For item 8, write a hypothesis statement to indicate likely causes of why the pro blem is occurring (i.e., is the problem likely to be related to instruction, curriculum, environment, or learner domains). For item 9, write a specific goal statement linked to the specific area of concern identified. Write the goal in observable and measu rable terms and always include a timeframe. It is important to remember that the goal is not necessarily the benchmark where the student should be performing at that time. You want to ensure that the student is given a goal that is ambitious ye t attainable. For more information on developing the hypothesis and the goal statement, consult with your school psychologist.

If completed by a professional other than the classroom teacher, the teacher must provide input. WHAT: Step 3C includes information to determine cause and function of behavior (functional behavioral assessment). WHEN: Step 3C should be used when a student is exhibiting behavioral difficulties that are not responding to Tier 1 and Tier 2 behavior interventions. In addition, it is recommended that RtI Step 3C is completed prior to completing RtI Step 3b, as the information will be useful in developing goal statements. WHERE: Behavioral concerns may be manifested in multiple settings. RtI Step 3C readily captures the settings and activities in which these behaviors are most likely to occur. WHY: In order to develop a meaningful behavioral intervention plan, it is important to identify the function (pay- off) of the interfering behavior and the environmental condition in which the behavior is most likely to occur. By having the teacher orally respond during the IPST meeting to the questions embedded in this form, the team is more likely to generate interventions linked to the specific problem area. HOW: At the IPST meeting, the IPST Chair will ask the teacher the questions designated on RtI Step 3C. The chair will fill in 3C based on the teachers' and other responses to the data. 69 222 Intervention #: __________ Setting of intervention: Classroom: _______ Other (specify)__________________ Focus of Intervention (specific academic or behavioral target ): _________________________________________________ Monitor Progress: __________x per month x/wk _____ 20 min _____ ESE but no whole class _____ 3 x/wk _____ 30 _____ Counselor _____ x/wk _____ 45 min _____ Title One Teacher _____ Daily _____ 60 min _____ Other (Specify) End date: _____________________________________ (should be at least 5 weeks of interventions after start date) Progress Data: (baseline and include a minimum of 5 data points and attach or behavioral target): _________________________________________________ Monitor Progress: __________x per x/wk _____ 20 min _____ ESE but no whole class _____ 3 x/wk _____ 30 _____ Counselor _____ x/wk _____ 45 min _____ Title One Teacher _____ Daily _____ 60 min _____ Other (Specify) End date: _____________________________________ (should be at least 5 weeks of interventions after start date) Progress Data: (baseline and include a minimum of 5 data points and attach Date: SLAM NV IPST FORM 4 Individual Problem Solving Team (IPST) Individual Intervention Design and Evaluation Based on attached data from the intervention, the problem....____ stayed the same ____increased ____decreased (circle one) Are you continuing this intervention: _______yes _______no If no, what did not work? ______________________________________________________________________ 70 223 SLAM NV IPST FORM 4 Individual Problem Solving Team (IPST) Individual Intervention Design and Evaluation Directions WHO : The Intervention Design and Evaluation Form will be completed by the team. The classroom teacher, intervention teacher, or person providing targeted intervention to the student will provide input regarding the data points and progress monitoring. A fidelity log may also be attached for evaluation purposes. The intervention teacher provides documentation as to the intervention itself (absences, frequency, etc., the TEAM evaluates the effectiveness of the intervention and makes decision (in the middle of the page). WHAT : Step 4 includes information to identify the specific intervention(s) being implemented as well as the provider of the intervention, the group size, the frequency of the intervention, the duration of session (time), the begin/end date of intervention, the baseline data, and progress data toward goal. WHEN : Step 4 will be used when intervention is started. Only include interventions during current school year . In addition to the identified intervention, teachers may be utilizing another intervention. In other cases, teachers may be implementing a second intervention because of poor response to the initial intervention. WHERE : The person directly providing the intervention will have the information to complete this form. WHY: Step 4 is used to document interventions attempted and the student's response. Data will indicate if the research -based intervention should be continued or if other intervention(s) may be more effective. HOW : Indicate the specific intervention that ha s been utilized, the beginning and ending date, and the length of the intervention when meeting (e.g., 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc). Indicate group size, how often (frequency) the intervention group meets, the intervention provider, and the actual performa nce in the form of a data point. Indicate how often intervention will be progress monitored and who will progress monitor. When graphing progress, make sure that data points are entered on a pre -determined regular basis (e.g., every Wednesday) and ensure t hat the time between the data points is equidistant. Remember that interventions need time to work so after establishing baseline, it is recommended that at least 5 data points over a 5 week intervention period are collected. However, frequent progress monitoring allows for more frequent modifications of interventions and analysis of rate of progress. If during the first 5 weeks you are finding that the intervention is not working, the intervention should be modified accordingly. See your school psycholog ist or RtI Coach for more information on graphing and for help in determining if your student is making progress toward the goal. 71 224 Student of support: _____Tier 1 _____Tier 2 _____Tier 3 Was attendance during the intervention sessions as issue?

WHAT: Based on data collected throughout the problem solving process, the team determines educational needs based on the student's response to interventions. WHEN : RtI updates and recommendations are made when the data is sufficient to indicate a response. IPST 5 occurs as the final stage of the IPST meeting. WHERE: The necessary data is documented throughout the entire process and specifically is identified on the Intervention Design and Evaluation Plan (IPST FORM 4). WHY: Data drives the problem solving process. Through accurate progress monitoring, the team will have sufficient data to make important educational decisions about the student. These decisions may include maintaining the current intervention, modifying the intervention, terminating the intervention, or referring to alternate programs or for a social history and/or psychoeducational evaluation. HOW: The IPST Chair will guide the team through this phase of the process by asking guiding questions. The data that is collected throughout Step 4 will be used to determine if the problem has decreased, stayed the same, or increased. All attendees at the meeting will sign on the bottom of Step 5 on the designated lines. It is important for the IPST Chair to determine at the meeting the date/time of the next meeting (if applicable) to discuss response to in tervention (RtI). The parent should be provided with a copy of Step 5 when completed as it will provide them with the team decision(s) and the date/time of the follow- up RtI meeting (if needed). The IPST Chair should maintain an on -going log o f the dates /outcomes of the IPST meetings. The log should include the name of the student, teacher, dates, and type of problem (e.g., reading, behavior, etc.). Recording the number on a log that corresponds to the \"Team Decision(s)\" section of Step 5 is an easy method to track the team based decisions at a school building. 73 226 IPST User's Guide Appendix Forms The appendix forms may be utilized to gather data before or during the IPST process. APPENDIX 1 : Group Intervention Form Weekly Progress Monitoring Form .......................................... 79 (May be used for group intervention documentation) APPRENDIX 2 : Group Intervention Form Two Week Progress Monitoring Form .................................... 80 (May be used for group intervention documentation) APPENDIX 3 : Group Intervention Form Tri -Weekly Progress Monitoring Form ..................................... 81 (May be used for group intervention documentation) APPENDIX 4: ICEL Worksheet ........................................................................................................ 82 (Use with Form IPST Step 3B and Step 3B) APPENDIX 5: Tier 1 Observation Form (Classroom Observation) ....................................................... 83 (May use the ICEL in Step 3B in addition to other times) APPENDIX 6: Tier 2 Intervention Observation Form .......................................................................... 84 (May be used to check fidelity of Tier 2 Implementation and verify student placement in intervention) Group Intervention Forms may be useful for collecting data during RtI Tier 1 and Tier 2 targeted intervention process. These forms document student attendance as well as ongoing progress monitoring data (OPM) in a targeted, s mall group intervention. This data is useful to the IPST process when comparing individual student response to peer response within targeted, small group interventions. Data analysis of individual response compared to peer response will reveal information about if the intervention is working for the peers (is it effective?) and will also give information about the learning rate of individual students and peers in the intervention.

Parents and Children/Procedural Safeguards http://www.doe.nv.gov/SpecialEdResources/Rightsrev2009.pdf Special Education Rights of Parents and The confidentiality of personally identifiable information about students with disabilities is protected through the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), th e Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC). Except under limited circumstances, confidential information contained in education records cannot be accessed or disclosed without the consent of the parent or the student, if not a minor. Confidentiality is critical to the special education process and must be strictly observed . This policy is not intended to inhibit professional communication, but rather to ensure that confidential information about students a nd their families is treated appropriately. Definitions 1. Directory information. Information contained in an education record of a student which would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed . Directory information may be released to agencies, institutions, the military or businesses for the purpose of providing students with yearbooks , class rings, graduation announcements, athletic apparel, school pictures, scholarship opportunities, or other purposes that benefit the student and/or school . Directory information will not be released when the purpose is primarily for commercial or sectarian use. 2. Disclosure . To permit access to or the release, transfer, or other communication of personally identifiable information contained in education records by any means, including oral, written, or electronic means, to any party except the party identified as the party that provided or created the record. 3. Education records . Records that are directly related to a student and maintained by an educational agency or institution, or by a party acting for the agency or institution . The term does not include records that are kept in the sole possession of the maker of the record, are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not a ccessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record; certain law enforcement unit records; certain employment records; certain records on a student 18 years of age or older; certain records created or receive d by an educational agency after an individual is no longer a student in attendance and that are not directly related to the individual's attendance as a student; and grades on peer- graded papers before they are collected and recorded by a teacher. The following types of documents represent common information of this nature: a. Written assessment and diagnostic findings and other documentation (medical , sociological, psychological, or academic) that is used for determining eligibility for special educati on or for determining an appropriate program. This includes test protocols utilized during the assessment process. b. Official correspondence that includes information about the student or the student's family. c. Confidential documents provided by oth er agencies or programs that were provided through a written release of information by the parents or specifically identified as confidential information. d. Written information provided by the parents that is included in the student's confidential speci al education records at the request of the parents. *This is not an exclusive list, and there are other types of information that may qualify as confidential information. 4. Eligible student . A student who has reached 18 years of age or is attending an institution of post -secondary education. 5. Personally identifiable information . Includes but is not limited to the student's name ; the name of the student's parent or other family members; the address of the student or student's family; a personal identifier such as the student's social security number, student number, or biometric record; other indirec t identifiers, such as the student's date of birth, place of birth, and mother's maiden name; other information that, alone or in combination , is linked o r linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty; or information requested by a person who the educational agency reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. 6. Record . Any information recorded in any way, including but not limited to, handwriting , print, computer media, video or audiotape, film, microfilm, of Records The records custodian must ensure that all educational records are maintained in a secure location . File cabinets and other storage containers that are used to store such records and documents must be loc ked and remain locked except for access by authorized personnel . The school principal is responsible for security of special education records and management of confidential information at the school site; however, he/she may designate a staff person to as sist with this responsibility . Files may be kept in a central location or in more than one location in the school as long as security is maintained . Confidential special education files must not be mixed with other types of records on the student (e.g., cumulative school records, files maintained by teachers of students' school work). Directory Information The school may disclose directory information without written consent if a notice has been given to parents or eligible stude nts regarding the types of information that will be disclosed, as well as notification of their right to refuse disclosure of any or all information that the school considers directory information. Although directory information may be disclosed without consent, great care should be taken as to the method of disclosure . For example, identifying special education students as such in a list posted in school hallways, the faculty lounge, or in school bulletins would violate FERPA. Parents may prohibit the disclosure of directory info rmation by providing a written request to this effect. Inspection and Review of Educational Records 1. Timelines for access . Parents have the opportunity to inspect and review any educational records relating to their child who are collected , maintained or used by the school . The school must comply with a request to inspect and review without unnecessary delay and in any event before any meeting regarding an IEP or a due process hearing relating to identification, evaluation, educational placement, or th e provision of a free appropriate public education, and not later than 45 days after the request has been made . It is the policy of the school to respond to a request to inspect and review records within ten (10) working days after the request has been mad e. 2. Interpretations and explanations . Parents have the right to obtain reasonable interpretations and explanations of the information contained in the educational records. The parents may make reasonable requests for the school to explain and interpret the records, and to have their representative inspect and review the records. 3. Copies of records. The parents may request that the school provide them with copies of the records, if, without the copies, any meaningful review of the records is impractical. The school may charge a reasonable fee for photocopying records. 4. Authority of parent . The school may presume that the parent has the authority to inspect and review records relating to the student unless the school has been advised that the parent does not have the authority under applicable state law governing such matters as guardianship, separation or divorce . The school will require a copy of any such legal document prior to denying a parent access to the records. 5. Record of access. The s chool shall keep a record of the persons other than parents and authorized employees given access to educational records . The record must include the person's name, date of access, and purpose for which the person is authorized to use the records. 6. Records on more than one student . If any educational record contains information on more than one student, the parents may inspect and review only the information relating to their child or be informed of that specific information. 7. List of types and loca tions of records . Upon request, the school shall maintain and provide to parents a list of the types and locations of educational records it collects, maintains or uses relating to students. 239Attachment\u0000 Fees. If the school charges a fee for copies of records made for parents , the amount of the fee cannot effectively prevent the parents from exercising the right to inspect and review those records . No fee may be charged for the search or retrieval of the information. Generally, the school will provide copies of sp ecial education records on request . In most instances, the school will not charge a fee for duplication of special education records provided to the parent or guardian; exceptions may be made in appropriate circumstances. Amendment of Educational Records 1. A parent who believes that information in educational records is inaccurate , misleading or violates the privacy or other rights of the student may request an amendment of that information . The school shall determine whether to amend the information within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the request. If the decision is to refuse to amend the information, the school shall inform the parent of the refusal in writing, including the reason for the refusal and the right to a hearing. 2. Upon r equest, the school shall provide an opportunity for a hearing to challenge information in educational records. 3. If, as a result of the hearing, it is decided that the information is inaccurate , misleading or otherwise in violation of the privacy or oth er rights of the student, the school shall amend the information accordingly and inform the parents in writing. 4. If it is decided that the information is not inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student , the parent may place in the records a statement commenting on the information or setting forth any reasons for disagreeing with the decision. The school shall notify the parent that the parent has a right to include such a statement in the record. The school shall retain any such explanation placed in the records as part of the records as long as the record or contested portion is maintained . If the records are disclosed to any person, the explanation must also be disclosed. 5. Any hearing held regard ing the amendment of records must be conducted in accordance with FERPA and other applicable procedures. Safeguards The school shall not disclose personally identifiable information except as authorized by law. Each principal /designee must ensure that a ll school staff that collect or use personally identifiable information receives training to ensure the confidentiality of such information. The school shall: 1. Protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable information at its collection , storag e, disclosure and destruction; 2. Appoint one official to assume responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information; 3. Train or instruct all persons collecting or using personally identifiable information regard ing confidentiality procedures; and 4. Maintain a current listing for public inspection of the names and positions of those employees within the school who may have access to personally identifiable information. Storage of Inactive Confidential Records Inactive special education records and all confidential information maintained on students must be maintained in a secure 240Attachment\u0000 Files of students who have left the school site will be kept for storage until requested by another school. Destruction of information The school shall also: 1. Inform parents when the personally identifiable information is no longer needed to provide educational services to the student; 2. Maintain a permanent record of the student's name, address, telephone number, gra des, attendance, classes attended, grades completed and the year completed; and 3. Upon the request of the parent, destroy any personally identifiable information except the information listed in (2), which is no longer necessary to provide educational s ervices. When destroying personally identifiable information, the school will confer and /or coordinate with the school principal or Special Education Designee. The notice and destruction process will be conducted in accordance with the record retention sc hedules established in state law. Consent Required for Access to Records Parental consent will be obtained before personally identifiable information is disclosed to anyone other than authorized individuals or agencies; or used for any purpose other than meeting a requirement under IDEA . The school will not release information from education records to participating agencies without parental consent unless authorized to do so under FERPA (see EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION). Who May Access Records Without Consent There are several situations where the school may disclose education records of a student without written consent of the pare nt or eligible student. The most common situations affecting special education students are explained below: 1. To school officials with a legitimate educational interest , including any administrator, supervisor , instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel); student teachers and related service interns; a person serving on the School Board; a person or company with whom the school has contracted to perform a special task (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist); or a parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a disc iplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official i n performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional re sponsibility. The principal or Special Education designee is the school official in charge of educational records and shall determine whether a school official is seeking information to carry out his/her official duties and whether the specific informati on sought is necessary in carrying out those duties. 2. To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena . If the education records of a student are subpoenaed, the school needs to make a reasonable effort to notify the parent or student (if 18 years of age or older) before complying with the subpoena . This is intended to allow the parent/student the opportunity to quash or challenge the subpoena. 3. To authorized representatives of federal or state agencies who are engaged in audit or complia nce activities. In such a case, the representatives must sign a record of access stating the purpose of their need to access the education record. 4. The school may disclose personally identifiable information about a student from confidential records in an emergency if the information is necessary for the health or safety of the student or other individuals. 241Attachment\u0000 To officials of another school, school system, or institution of postsecondary education where the student seeks or intends to enroll, or where the student is already enrolled so long as the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment or transfer. 6. To other entities specified in FERPA, 34 CFR Part 99, \u00a799.31. PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS Procedural safeguards are specific rights a nd guarantees given to parents and students through state and federal laws to protect them in matters related to identification, evaluation, educational placement, and the provision of a free appropriate public education . Collectively, these rights and gua rantees are referred to as procedural safeguards, and are described for parents in a document disseminated by the Nevada Department of Education entitled \"Special Education Rights of Parents and Children.\" The IDEA requires that parents be given an opport unity to participate in meetings with respect to the identification, evaluation, educational placement, and provision of a free appropriate public education for students with disabilities. A meeting does no t include informal or unscheduled conversations in volving school personnel and conversations on issues such as teaching methodology , lesson plans, or coordination of service provision . A meeting also does not include preparatory activities that school personnel engage in to develop a proposal or response to a parent proposal that will be discussed at a later meeting. Definitions 1. Consent . Parents must give informed written consent, which means that they have been fully informed of all information relevant to the activity for which consent is sought, i n their native language or other mode of communication . Parents must understand and agree in writing to the carrying out of the activity for which their consent is sought. The request for consent must describe the activity and list the records (if any) which will be released and to whom . Parents must also be informed and understand that the granting of consent is voluntary on their part and may be revoked at any time . If a parent revokes consent, that revocation is not retroactive (i.e., it does not negate an action that has occurred after the consent was given and before the consent was revoked) . If the parent revokes consent in writing for their child's receipt of special education services after the child is initially provided special education and related services, the school is not required to amend the child's education records to remove any references to the child's receipt of special education and related services because of the revocation of consent. 2. Evaluation . Evaluation procedures are used to determine if a student has a disability and the nature and extent of special education and related services that are needed by that student. The term refers to procedures that are individually administered and used selectively with a student and does not include basic tests or procedures used with all students in school (e.g., group achievement tests, general screenings of all students). 3. Notice . The school must provide the parents with prior written notice (see PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE) a reasona ble time before proposals or refusals to initiate or change the identification, evaluation, educational placement, or provision of a free appropriate public education to a student . The notice must be written in language understandable to the general public and provided in the native language of the parent or other mode of communication used by the parent, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so . If the native language or other mode of communication of the parent is not a written language, the school must translate the notice orally so that the parent understands the content of the notice and maintain written evidence that these steps were taken. The notice must contain the following information: a. A description of the action proposed or refused by the school; b. An explanation of why the school proposes or refuses to take the action; c. A description of other options the school considered and the reasons why those options were rejected; d. A description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, recor d, or report used by the school as the basis for the proposed or refused action; e. A description of the factors that are relevant to the school's proposal or refusal; f. A statement that the parents of a child with a disability have protection under the procedural safeguards of IDEA and, if the notice is not an initial referral for an evaluation , the means by which a copy of the description of the procedural safeguards can be obtained; and g. Contact sources for parents to obtain assistance in understan ding the provisions of special education safeguards . A copy of procedural safeguards (the \"rights \" document) must be provided to parents AT LEAST ONCE PER YEAR and at the following junctures: a. Initial referral for evaluation or upon par ent request for an evaluation b. Upon the first request for a due process hearing in a school year c. Upon the first request for a complaint investigation in a school year (the Nevada Department of Education provides this copy to the parent) d. Upon request by the parent e. On the date a decision is made to make a removal that constitutes a disciplinary change of placement 5. Parent . As used in this section, the term parent refers to biological or adoptive parents, a foster parent, a guardian generally authorized to act as the child's parent (but not the state if the child is a ward of the state), an individual acting in the place of a biological or adoptive parent (including a grandparent, stepparent, or other relative) with whom the child lives, or an individual wh o is legally responsible for the child's welfare, a surrogate parent, or a person identified through judicial decree or order to act as the \"parent\" of a child or to make educational decisions on behalf of a child, or the student, if he or she has reached the age of 18. A non -custodial divorced parent also has the right to participate in special education proceedings regarding his or her children . All of the rights that are afforded to parents transfer to the student when he or she is age 18, unless a court of competent jurisdiction has adjudged the student incompetent and a guardian has been appointed. Unless a judicial decree or order has identified a person to act as the parent, the biological or adoptive parent, when attempting to act as the parent unde r this part and when more than one party is qualified to act as a parent , is presumed to be the parent unless the biological or adoptive parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child. 6. Surrogate parent . A surrogate pa rent is a person appointed by the school to represent the interests of a student when neither of the student's parents can be identified or located, or the student is a ward of the State of Nevada, or the student is an unaccompanied homeless youth. A surro gate parent has all the special education rights and authority ordinarily afforded to other parents. In the case of a child who is a ward of the State, the judge overseeing the child's case alternatively may appoint the surrogate parent , provided that the surrogate meets the requirements described below . If the student is an unaccompanied homeless youth, appropriate staff of emergency shelters, transitional shelters, independent living programs, and street outreach programs may be appointed as temporary sur rogate parents. Informed Written Consent 1. Reasonable steps to obtain consent . The school must take and document reasonable steps to obtain parent consent when consent must be obtained before the school can proceed with its evaluation and service provi sion responsibilities . Reasonable steps which must be taken and carefully documented include: Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls Copies of correspondence sent and responses received Detailed records of visi ts to home or place of employment and results 2. Consent requirements. Informed written consent from a student's parents is required in the following instances: When the school initially proposes to evaluate a student to determine his or her eligibility for special education and related services (see CONSENT FOR EVALUATION) \u00a7 If the parent refuses to consent to an initial evaluation, or fails to respond to a request to obtain consent, the school may but is not required to pursue the evaluation through mediation and/or due process. If the school does not initiate mediation or due process proceedings, the school will not be found to have violated its obligations for child find/identification or evaluation, and the school will not be deemed to have knowledge th e student was a student with a disability for discipline purposes. When the school proposes the initial provision of special education and related services for the first time (see PARENT CONSENT FOR INITIAL PROVISION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED SERVICES) \u00a7 If the parent refuses to consent, or fails to respond to a request to obtain consent for the initial provision of special education and related services, the school MAY NOT use mediation and /or due process in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the student . will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to the student because of the failure to provide the student with the special education and related services for which the parent refuses to or fails to provide consent, and the school will not be deemed to have knowledge the student was a student with a disability for discipline purposes. The school is also not required to convene an IEP committee meeting or develop an IEP, although the school may choose to do so for the purpose of making clear its offer of FAPE to the parent. \u00a7 If at any time subsequent to the initial provision of special education and related services, the parent of a child revokes consent in writing fo r the continued provision of special education and related services, the school may not continue to provide special education and related services to the child, but must provide prior written notice before ceasing the provision of special education and rel ated services (see PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE); MAY NOT use mediation and/or due process procedures to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the child; will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to the child because of the failure to provide the child with further special education and related services; and is not required to convene an IEP committee meeting or develop an IEP for the child for further provision of special education and related services. When the school conducts a reevaluation that requires assessment(s) in addition to information already available to the team (see CONSENT FOR EVALUATION) \u00a7 If the parent refuses to consent , the school may but is not required to pursue the reevaluation through mediation and /or due process. If the school does not initiate mediation or use process proceedings, the school will not be found to have violated its obligations for child find/ identification or evaluation, and the school will not be de emed to have knowledge the student was a student with a disability for discipline purposes. If the parent has not responded to a request for consent for reevaluation , the school may proceed with the reevaluation if the school can document it has taken reas onable measures to obtain consent and the student's parent has failed to respond. CONTACT THE PRINCIPAL OR SPECIAL EDUCATION DESIGNEE IN ALL INSTANCES WHERE PARENTS REFUSE TO CONSENT OR FAIL TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS TO OBTAIN CONSENT. 3. Additional inform ation: Consent for initial provision of special education services . Informed written consent for initial provision of special education services must be obtained from parents before a student may receive services . Consent is obtained using the PARENT CONSENT FOR INITIAL PROVISION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED SERVICES form. In most circumstances, parents sign this form when they attend the student's initial IEP meeting. However, in instances where the parents refuse or do not attend after reasonable att empts are made to involve them in the initial IEP meeting, the school must take reasonable steps to attempt to obtain written consent for initial provision of services through other means. This might include telephone calls, correspondence, and sending the proposed IEP and consent form to the parents through the mail with a pre-addressed and postage paid envelope enclosed . When possible, school staff may also take the form to the parent's hom e or place of employment. Each of these attempts must be carefully documented. If the parent withholds consent for the initial provision of special education and related services, IEP services CANNOT be provided. Although federal law does not require that the school prepare an IEP prior to obtaining consent for the initial provision of special education and related services, the school will draft a proposed IEP if parents will not participate in the IEP development, and send the proposed IEP to the parent along with the consent form and a PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE pr oposing development and implementation of IEP services as described in the attached IEP. The school is only required to obtain CONSENT FOR THE INITIAL PROVISION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED SERVICES once, befor e the student is initially placed in a program of special education . Thereafter, the procedures regarding notice and IEP development, review, and revision apply. 4. Reevaluations requiring additional data . Parent consent is not required before reviewing existing data as part of an evaluation or reevaluation , or before administering a test that is administered to all children unless consent is required of all parents . If the IEP Committee and eligibility team need additional data before completing a reevaluation, Withdrawing consent . Consent for evaluation , reevaluation, or the initial provision of special education services may be revoked at any time . However , revocations are not retroactive . A revocation will not negate an action that has occurred after the consent was given and before the consent was revoked . For example, if a parent wishes to revoke consent for an initial evaluation, and the evaluation has already been completed, the revocation is ineffective. If, at any time subsequent to the initial provision o f special education and related services, the parent of a student revokes consent in writing for the continued provision of special education and related services, the school may not continue to provide special education and related services to the student , but must provide prior written notice before ceasing the provision of special education and related services . The school may not use mediation or due process procedures in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services may be provided to the student . The school will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make FAPE available to the student because of the failure to provide the student with further special education and related services . Finally, the school is not required to co nvene an IEP meeting or develop an IEP for the student for further provision of special education of the student. If a parent who revoked consent for special education and related services later requests that his or her child be re - enrolled in special education, the school must treat this request as a request for an initial evaluation, rather than as a reevaluation. IF A PARENT WHO REVOKED CONSENT REQUEST S RE- ENROLLENT IN SPECIAL EDUCATION, CONTACT THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL OR SPECIAL EDUCATION DESIGNEE. 6. S ubsequent to the initial evaluation and the initial provision of special education and related services, the school must use written notice to ensure that parents understand any action the school proposes or refuses. This might include the need for assessm ents determined necessary by the student's IEP Committee in order to provide appropriate services, or completion of a functional behavioral assessment at a time not consistent with the three -year reevaluation juncture. 7. Consent is also required in certain circumstances before the school discloses personally identifiable information. See Confidentiality section for further information. Prior Written Notice and Notification Regarding ET/IEP Meetings 1. Prior Written Notice . In general, prior written no tice is required whenever the school proposes or refuses to take an action related to the identification, evaluation, educational placement, or provision of a free appropriate public education for a student (see PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE). The following list identifies common situations where the school is required to provide parents with prior written notice: The school proposes to evaluate or reevaluate the student The school proposes to develop the student's initial or annual IEP and has specif ic proposals for content The school proposes to implement an IEP The school proposes to conduct an initial evaluation or reevaluation without obtaining additional data The school proposes to change the student's special education placement or IEP services The school proposes to terminate special education services (including termination of eligibility through a reevaluation process, or graduation from high school) The school proposes to cease special education and related services after recei ving a written request by the parent revoking consent for continued provision of special education and related services The school proposes to change or terminate a student's related services (e.g., speech therapy, occupational or physical therapy, coun seling) The school proposes a suspension or expulsion of a special education student which will constitute a change in placement 2. Notification regarding the student's IEP meeting . Since the IEP meeting is the most important mechanism for involving parents in educational decision -making, parents must receive written notification of this meeting. The importance of parental involvement at the IEP meeting is so significant, in fact, that the case manager must take specific action to notify the parents and make reasonable attempts to assure their participation, even when they cannot be present for the meeting in person. It should be noted that the school must proceed with the IEP development without the parents if they refuse or do not attend after reasona ble attempts to involve the parents have been made. See NOTIFICATION OF 245Attachment\u0000 regarding evaluation and reevaluation . The school is required to send PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE when it proposes an initial evaluation of the student's eligibi lity for special education and related services. Also, the school is required to reevaluate each eligible student at least every three years unless the school and parent agree otherwise. Parent notice of reevaluation is provided by sending the PARENTAL PRI OR WRITTEN NOTICE . Parents are also requested (by letter, telephone, or in person) to provide input as to the need for, and scope of, any additional assessments that may be needed. IDEA regulations permit the IEP Committee members and eligibility team memb ers to review the existing evaluation data to determine whether additional assessments are needed, without a team meeting required. If additional assessments are needed, the school must ask the parent to provide written consent for any additional assessmen ts that have been determined to be necessary in order to complete the reevaluation. If no additional assessments are needed, PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of the proposal to conduct a reevaluation without obtaining additional data is sent to the parents, notifying them of their right to request further assessments. 4. Notice regarding proposed changes to IEP or placement . Since the IEP Committee must make all decisions affecting a student's special education services or placement, the PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE sent to the parents must explain the proposed changes. Again, the school must make reasonable efforts to involve the parents in the IEP process. When parents do not respond to requests to attend IEP meetings, the school must seek to include them through other means (e.g., via telephone). Parents must receive a copy o f the amended IEP developed by the IEP Committee. When parents are not in attendance, parents will be provided with PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of the school's proposal to implement the IEP. A change in placement to a more or less restrictive setting is considered a \"change in placement.\" Such changes in a special education student's program or placement require prior written notice and will only occur through the IEP process (PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE and NOTIFICATION OF MEETING ). 5. Notice regarding termination of eligibility/services . If the student's services are being terminated because the student is no longer eligible for services, the following procedure must be followed : a. The eligibility team must conduct a reevaluation and determine whether the student is no longer eligible for special education services. See Reevaluation section for all reevaluation procedures, which must be strictly followed. b. If the eligibility team fi nds the student no longer eligible, PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of the proposal to discontinue services based upon ineligibility must be provided to parents. If the student's services are being terminated because the parent has revoked consent in writin g for the continued provision of special education and related services, the school must provide prior written notice of its proposal to discontinue special education and related services based on receipt of the written revocation of consent. Within a reasonable time after providing prior written notice, the school must discontinue all special education and related services to the student. 6. Notice regarding proposals to change or terminate a student's related services . Prior written notice must be provi ded of the school's proposals or refusals to initiate, change, or terminate a student's related services. Related services (e.g., speech therapy, occupational and physical therapy, counseling) are an important part of a student's IEP. Without these services, many students would not benefit from the special education program provided. For this reason, any decision to initiate, change, or terminate related services must be made by the IEP Committee. If at all possible, it is advisable to have the related service provider participate as a member of the IEP Committee. However, when this is not possible, he or she must supply the rationale for initiating, changing, or discontinuing the services. The IEP Committee determines a student's need for related services. 7. Notice requirements for parental requests . Parents are encouraged to present any requests for changes in eligibility, IEP services or placement in writing. For example, parents may request that the school pay for an independent educational evaluation. They may also request that the school provide additional services for their child. Whether the parents' requests are made in writing or not, parents must be given PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of the school's decisions in response to such requests by parents. CONTACT THE PRINCIPAL OR SPECIAL EDUCATION DESIGNEE FOR ASSISTANCE IN RESPONDING TO PARENTAL regarding suspension/expulsion . There are specific procedures that must be followed when a special education student is suspended or exp elled for more than ten (10) days from school. The basic procedures that must be followed regarding notice are outlined below: a. On the date a decision is made to implement a disciplinary removal that will result in a change of placement, the school must provide PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of this decision and of the intent to conduct a manifestation determination prior to implementing the removal. b. If the IEP Committee determines that the behavior is not a manifestation of the student's disability, the school must provide PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE to the parents of the IEP Committee's decision and the school's intent regarding further disciplinary action. c. If the IEP Committee determines that the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability, the student generally remains in the placement identified in the student's IEP (unless the student is placed in a 45 -school - day interim alternative educational setting for conduct involving weapons, drugs/controlled substances, or infliction of serious bodily injury). The school provides PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of its intention to conduct a functional behavioral assessment (unless one has already been done) and to develop a behavior intervention plan (or review/revise an already existing plan). Appointment of Surrogate Parents 1. Requirement to appoint surrogate parent . A surrogate parent be appointed by the school district when neither of the student's parents can be identified or located, or the student is a ward of the State of Nevada, or the student is an unaccompanied homeless youth. In the case of a child who is a ward of the State, the surrogate parent alternatively may be appointed by the judge overseeing the child's case, provided that the surrogate meets the requirements described below. A student who is eligible for special education at the school and meets any of these conditions will be appointed a surrogate parent to represent him or her in all matters related to special education. 2. Qualifications for serving as a student' s surrogate parent . A surrogate parent cannot be an employee of the Nevada Department of Education, the school district, the school, or of any other agency involved in the education or care of the student. The surrogate must have no personal or professiona l interest that conflicts with the interest of the student, and the surrogate must have knowledge and skills that ensure adequate representation of the student. If the student is an unaccompanied homeless youth, appropriate staff of emergency shelters, tra nsitional shelters, independent living programs, and street outreach programs may be appointed as temporary surrogate parents without regard to whether those staff are employees of agencies involved in the care of the student, until a surrogate parent can be appointed that meets all of the requirements outlined above. 3. Rights and privileges of surrogate parents . Surrogate parents have all the same rights and privileges of biological parents pertaining to the identification, evaluation, educational place ment, and the provision of a free appropriate public education for the student he or she represents. As such, surrogate parents must give consent before initial evaluation, initial provision of special education and related services, and reevaluation of the student if the reevaluation requires additional assessments. They must also be given prior written notice for any proposed or refused action by the school as described in this section. Surrogate parents have all the due process rights of natural parents in a dispute with the school regarding the student's special education program. Independent Educational Evaluation A parent has the right to request an independent educational evaluation (IEE) at public expense if the parent disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the school. However, the school may initiate a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate. If the final decision is that the school's evaluation is appropriate, the parent still has the right to an IEE, but not at the public expense. Information regarding where an IEE may be obtained will be provided to the parent upon request for an IEE, along with the school's criteria for conducting such an evaluation. Whenever an IEE is conducted at the school's expense, the criteria under which the evaluation is obtained, including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, will be the same as the criteria the school uses when it initiates an evaluation. Whether or not the school pays for an IEE, the IEE must be considered in decisions regarding the student's special IEE is an evaluation conducted by an examiner who is not employed by the school or the school district, but possesses qualifications similar to those of examiners employed by the school district. Parents should be encouraged but are not required to notify the school before they obtain an IEE. All parent requests for an IEE should be forwarded to the principal or Special Education designee for review. He/she will tell the parents where an I EE may be obtained and will provide notice of the school's decision regarding their request for an IEE. When an lEE has been requested, the school must without unnecessary delay either provide (pay for) the lEE, or request a due process hearing to establish that its evaluation is appropriate. If the hearing officer determines that the school 1 s evaluation is appropriate, the parent may still obtain an lEE, but at the parent's personal expense. A parent is entitled to only one lEE at public expense each ti me the public agency conducts and evaluation with which the parent disagrees. Mediation Mediation is a process where an impartial person participates in a meeting between parents and representatives of the school in an attempt to resolve issues of disagreement about the student's special education program. Most often mediation is used as an informal method of conflict resolution when parents have filed a request for an impartial due process hearing. Mediation may not be used in place of a hearing nor can it delay the parent's right to a hearing. When disagreements between parents and school personnel over special education issues rise to the level of an impasse, the principal or Special Education Designee should be involved. At his/her discretion, mediatio n may be requested, although other methods of resolution will probably be used prior to taking this step. Mediation usually produces at least some agreement between the parties. Even when parents proceed to a hearing, mediation often reduces or clarifies the issues to be heard. The Nevada Department of Education has established a mediation system, maintains a pool of trained mediators, and will pay for the costs incurred by the mediation. Either party (the school or the parents) can request mediation altho ugh both parties must agree to participate. Each session of mediation must be scheduled in a timely manner and must be held at a location that is convenient for the parties to the dispute. If the parties reach an agreement, the agreement must be set forth in writing and the agreement is enforceable in court. Impartial Due Process Hearings Although a due process hearing may be necessary to resolve a disagreement between parents and the school, there are often oth er effective methods of resolution (e.g., informal negotiation or mediation). Parents and the school should pursue alternatives to due process whenever possible as a way of reaching an agreement about the student's special education program. 1. Impartial due process hearing . Due process is a formal means provided in the law for resolving disputes between the school and parents. Either the school or a parent may initiate a request for a hearing on issues related to identification, evaluation, educational placement or the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) for a student with disabilities (although the school may not request a hearing to dispute a parent's refusal to consent to the initial provision of special education and related services). When a due process hearing is requested , an impartial hearing officer is appointed by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to hear the case and render a decision. In Nevada, either party may appeal the hearing officer's decision to a state -level review officer. If the matter is not re solved at either of these levels, either party may appeal the case to a state court of competent jurisdiction or a U.S. district court. 2. Requesting an impartial due process hearing. Parents may request an impartial due process hearing by writing a lett er to the school principal or Special Education Designee. A model form is available to assist parents in requesting a due process hearing (see MODEL DUE PROCESS HEARING REQUEST) . Within five days of receiving the request, the school must transmit the lette r to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction with a request that the Superintendent appoint a hearing officer. Response to request. Within 10 days of receipt of the request for the hearing, if the school DID NOT already send a prior written notice to the parent regarding the subject matter of the hearing request, the school shall send 248Attachment\u0000 o explanation of why the school proposed/refused action o description of other options the IEP team considered and why rejected o description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record or report used as a basis for proposed/refused action o description of the factors relevant to school's proposal or refusal Within 10 days of receipt, if the school DID already send prior written notice , the school shall send the parent a response that specifically addresses the issues raised in the request for a hearing. A response by the school does not preclude the school from asserting that the parent's due process complaint was insufficient. If the school files the hearing request, the parent must send the school a response that specifically addresses the issues raised in the request for a hearing within 10 days of receipt of request for hearing. Sufficiency challenge. Within 15 days of receipt, the nonfiling party may notify the Hearing Officer and the filing party that the receiving party believes the notice has not met content requirements Within 5 days of receipt of notification of insufficiency, the Hearing Officer makes determination based on the face of the request for hearing and immediately notifies parties in writing If insufficient, the filing party must refile and the request is treated like a new request Resolution meetings. Within 15 days of receiving notice of the pa rents' request for a hearing, the school must convene a resolution session UNLESS the school and the parents agree in writing to waive the session, or agree to use mediation process Resolution session participants: o Parents and relevant member(s) of IEP Committee (parent and school determine relevant members to attend meeting) who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the hearing request ! Includes representative of the school with decision making authority ! May not include attorney of district unless parent is accompanied by attorney Parents discuss request for hearing and the facts that form the basis of the complaint, and the school is provided the opportunity to resolve If a resolution agreement is reached, the parties execute a lega lly binding agreement that is signed by the parent and a representative of the school who has authority to bind the school. The resolution agreement is enforceable in any state court of competent jurisdiction or in a U.S. district court. A party may void the executed agreement within 3 business days of the agreement's execution. Resolution period . If the school has not resolved the complaint to the satisfaction of the parents within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint, the due process hearing may occur The timeline for issuing a final decision begins at the expiration of this 30 -day period Except where the parties have jointly agreed to waive the resolution process or to use mediation, the failure of the parent filing a due process complaint to participate in the resolution meeting will delay the timelines for the resolution process and due process hearing until the meeting is held If the school is unable to obtain the participation of the parent in the resolution session after reasonable efforts have been made and documented, the school may, at the conclusion of the 30-day period, request that a hearing officer dismiss the parent's due process complaint If the school fails to hold the resolution session within 15 days of receiving notice of a parent's due process complaint or fails to participate in the resolution meeting, the parent may seek the intervention of a hearing officer to begin the due process hearing timeline Adjustments to 30 -day resolution period . The 45- day timeline for the due process hearing starts the day after one of the following Both parties agree in writing to waive the resolution meeting After either the mediation or resolution meeting starts but before the end of the 30 -day period, the parties agree in wri ting that no agreement is possible If both parties agree in writing to continue the mediation at the end of the 30 -day resolution period, but later, the parent or school withdraws from the mediation process 4. Stay put . As required by state and federa l law, under most circumstances when a due process hearing has been requested, the student \"stays put\" in the last agreed -upon placement until the issue is resolved, unless the parents and the school agree on an alternative placement. In limited circumstances (e.g., students who exhibit behavior that is harmful or dangerous to self or others), the school may seek a court injunction to bar the student's attendance at school and maintain an alternative placement until the dispute is resolved through the heari ng process. An Interim Alternative Educational Setting (IAES) may become the \"stay put\" placement for a student who has engaged in behavior involving weapons, drugs, controlled substances, or infliction of serious bodily injury. Also, in cases where a revi ew officer agrees with the parents of the pupil that a particular change in the current placement is appropriate, the change in placement must be treated as an agreement between the school and the parents, for purposes of \"stay put\" through any continuing litigation. 5. Procedures for a due process hearing . a. The parent shall submit in writing to the principal or Special Education Designee any request for fair and impartial due process hearing in accordance with IDEA, stating the name of the student, t he residence address of the student, in the case of a homeless child or youth, available contact information for the child the name of the school the student is attending, a description of the nature of the problem including relevant facts, and a proposed resolution of the problem to the extent known and available to the parents at the time. A copy of the request for a hearing must also be submitted by the parent to the Nevada Department of Education. b. The school principal or Special Education Designee, within five working days of the receipt of a hearing request from the parent, shall ask the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an impartial hearing officer. c. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction will officially appoint the i mpartial hearing officer and notify the parties in writing of the appointment. The hearing officer must not have a conflict of interest or be an employee of any public agency involved in the education or care of the student. A person is not an employee of a public agency solely because the public agency compensates the person for the person's services as a hearing officer. d. The school must also take the following additional actions upon receipt of a request for a hearing: 1. The parent shall be notified by certified mail of the time and place of the hearing. 2. The parent shall be informed of any free or inexpensive legal services and other relevant services in the area. 3. The parent shall be informed of the right to request a resolution of the disput e through a mediation process. 4. The parent shall be informed of all procedural safeguards, including the rights listed below: a. At the hearing, a party to the hearing may: (1) Be represented by counsel; (2) Be accompanied by and advised by persons who have special knowledge of or training regarding the problems of students with disabilities; (3) Present evidence; (4) Call, examine and compel the attendance of witnesses; and (5) Cross -examine witnesses. b. At the hearing, the parent has the right t o: (1) Have the pupil present; (2) Have the hearing open to the general public; an d (3) Have the record of the hearing and findings of fact provided at no cost to the parent. c. The parent may examine all pertinent school records before the hearing. d. A party to the hearing may object to the introduction of evidence or evaluations, including recommendations based upon evaluations that have not been disclosed to the opposing party at 250Attachment\u0000 five business days before the hearing. The hearing officer may bar the introduction of such evidence without the consent of the other party. e. The school shall make a verbatim record of the hearing either in writing or, at the option of the parent, by electronic means. The record must be made available to any party to the hearing. f. The school shall take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the parent understands the written notice and the proceedings at the hearing, including arranging for an interpreter for a parent who is deaf or whose native language is not English. g. The hearing must be held at a time and place reasonably convenient to the parent and student involved. h. The hearing officer shall base the decision solely on the evidence presented at the hearing. In addition: A hearing officer's determination of whether a child received FAPE must be based on substantive grounds In matters alleging a procedural violation, a hearing officer may find that a child did not receive a FAPE only if the procedural inadequacies: o Impeded the child's righ t to a FAPE; o Significantly impeded the parent's opportunity to participate in the decision -making process regarding the provision of a FAPE to the child; or o Caused a deprivation of educational benefit A hearing officer may order a school to compl y with procedural requirements A parent may file a separate due process complaint on an issue separate from a due process complaint already filed i. The hearing officer shall render the findings of fact and decision in writing and mail a copy of the decision to the parties within 45 days after commencement of the hearing timeline. A hearing officer may extend the time for rendering a decision for a specific number of days upon the request of either party, except for expedited hearings. The written findin gs of fact and decision must be made available to any party to the hearing. At the option of a parent, findings of fact and decision must be made available to the parent by electronic means. j. The school shall pay the expenses of the hearing officer and any other expenses of the hearing. k. At a minimum, the Hearing Officer: o must not be an employee of the NDE or the school that is involved in the education or care of the child; or a person having a personal or professional interest that conflicts with the person's objectivity in the hearin g o must possess knowledge of, and the ability to understand, the provisions of the IDEA, federal and state regulations pertaining to the IDEA, and legal interpretations of the IDEA by federal and state courts; o must posses s the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings in accordance with appropriate, standard legal practice; and o must possess the knowledge and ability to render and write decisions in accordance with appropriate, standard legal practice A person who otherwise qualifies is not an employee of the agency solely because he or she is paid by the agency to serve as a hearing officer. l. The decision of a hearing officer is final unless the decision is appealed. m. In regard to due process hearings, \"business day\" means Monday through Friday, excluding federal and state holidays. Appeal from decision of hearing officer The parent and the school have the right to appeal the decision of the hearing officer to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The appeal must be made within 30 days after receiving the hearing officer's decision; a party to the hearing may file a cross appeal within ten (10) days after receiving notice of the initial appeal. If there is an appeal, a state review officer appointed by the St ate Superintendent of Public Instruction shall conduct an impartial review of the hearing. The review officer shall: 1. Examine the entire record of 2. Ensure that the procedures of the hearing were consistent with the requirements of due p rocess; 3. Seek any additional evidence necessary and, if a hearing is held to receive additional evidence, afford the parties the rights set forth in NAC 388.310; 4. Afford the parties an opportunity for oral or written argument, or both, at the discr etion of the reviewing officer; 5. Schedule any oral arguments at a time and place which is reasonably convenient to the parent and student involved; 6. Make an independent decision on the completion of the review; and 7. Mail copies of the written findings and decision to the parties within 30 days after receipt of a written request for review. The review officer may extend the time for rendering a decision for a specific number of days upon the request of either party. At the option of the parent, th e findings of fact and decision must be made available to the parent by electronic means. The decision of a review officer is final unless a party brings a civil action. Civil action . A party may appeal from the decision of the review officer by initiati ng a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days after receipt of the decision of the review officer. Expedited hearings . A parent's request for a hearing is expedited under the following disciplinary situations: a. Disagreement with the manifestation determination (the decision regarding the relationship of misconduct to the student's disability); and b. Disagreement with the decision regarding the placement of a student with a disability who violates a code of student conduct. The school may request an expedited hearing to change the placement of a student to an appropriate interim alternative educational setting based upon substantial evidence that maintaining the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the student or to others. This process may be repeated as necessary. An expedited hearing must be conducted within 20 school days of the date the hearing is requested and the determination must be made within 10 school days after the hearing. The resoluti on session must be held within 7 days and the resolution period is 15 days. Transfer of Rights at Age 18 In general, the school shall assure that all rights of the parent shall transfer to the student upon reaching majority, at ag e 18. The exceptions are in the cases where such children are legally determined to be incompetent to make related decisions. In these instances, the legally established guardian will continue to maintain the rights outlined in this document. On or before the date when the stud ent turns 17 (during the annual IEP meeting when the student is 16), the student's IEP must include a statement that the student has been informed of the rights that will transfer at age 18. Application for Parents to Represent Educational Interests of NAA Students The 2007 Nevada State Legislature passed a state statute to allow parents of students with significant cognitive impairments who participate in NAA (the state's alternative assessment) to submit an application to the school district seeking authority to represent the student's special education interests after the student turns 18 (see NOTICE OF APPLICATION, APPLICATION, NOTICE OF DETERMINATION) . This is the ONLY APPLICATION which may be used for this purpose in the school. This process 252Attachment\u0000 to the parents of students with significant cognitive impairments who participate in NAA. Do not provide this application to the parents of any other students. Process State and federal law require that at least one year prior to the student's 18 th birthday , parents and students must be notified that the parent's special education rights will transfer to the student at age 18. This step is accomplished the school by explaining that rights will transfer during the annual IEP meeting held when the stude nt is age 16. For NAA students ONLY: 1. Explain that state law allows parents of NAA students to apply to represent the student's special education interests after the student turns 18. 2. Provide the parent with the NOTICE OF APPLICATION form. 3. Retain a copy of the NOTICE OF APPLICATION and note the \"Date NOTICE OF APPLICATION was provided to parent and student (prior to 18 th birthday)\" - see second line from bottom. 4. Explain that if the parent wishes to represent the student's special education i nterests, the application MUST BE SUBMITTED no later than 90 days before the student's 18 th birthday. 5. The parent must complete the middle APPLICATION section of the document AND provide a copy of the student's IEP reflecting participation in NAA. 6. Within 30 days after receiving the APPLICATION, the school must review the application and determine whether to approve or deny the application. A decision to approve or deny must be made in consultation with the school principal or Special Education Design ee. If the application is complete and the student fits within the specific criteria (students with significant cognitive impairments who participate in NAA ) the application should be approved 7. Immediately after decision to approve or deny, return a copy of the APPLICATION which was submitted by the parent to the parent and the student with the bottom box completed. RETAIN A COMPLETED COPY IN THE STUDENT'S SPECIAL EDUCATION FILE. Unless the parents have been appointed by the school to represent the educ ational interests of the pupil, or a court has adjudicated the student incompetent to make decisions, the school must notify the student and parent that a transfer of rights has occurred when the student reaches ages 18. Whether the student's educational rights have transferred to the student or remain with the parents, the school shall provide any required notice thereafter to the student and the student's parents. IDENTIFICATION Identifying students with disabilities is the first step in providing appro priate educational services to students who are eligible for special education and related services. Child Find The school's \"Child Find\" program is responsible for locating, identifying and evaluating all individuals suspected of having a disability fro m the ages of birth through 21 who are not receiving early intervention or special education services. The school works in cooperation with other agencies in Clark County to: 1. Locate all children and youth with disabilities from the ages of birth throu gh 21 in Clark County. 2. Identify and refer individuals suspected of having a disability for evaluations. 3. Provide information to the community about the Child Find project and increase awareness about the educational rights of individuals with disab ilities and their parents, through the following methods: a. Newspaper articles and other media b. Correspondence with community members c. Annual screenings in schools and in the community 253Attachment\u0000 Teacher training on identifying potential disabilities 4. Maintain a child identification log indicating which children 3-21 years of age are receiving special education and related services and which children were found to be not eligible for service. The log contains the following information, if applicable, on all children referred for evaluation: a. Student Name b. Age c. Date Referred d. Date Evaluated e. Date Service Initiated f. Disability Category g. Reason for Not Serving 5. Coordinate with other agencies providing services to children. The principal or Special Education Designee will make at least two contacts per school year with local agencies to find out if they may have knowledge of children with disabilities who are not being served, explain the referral process, and request that they refer students under the age of 22 to the school district. Before Making a Referral When a child is having difficulty learning in a regular education classroom, it is often assumed that the child should be ref erred for a special education evaluation to determine any learning problems. But before a referral is made, the teacher should attempt a variety of strategies designed to facilitate the child's learning within that classroom. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that chil dren with disabilities be educated as much as possible with their nondisabled peers. By modifying what takes place in the classroom to meet a child's needs, we are addressing the spirit of the law. Frequently, such modifications are effective and may elimi nate or diminish the need for special education services. General Education Intervention If a student is experiencing an educational or behavioral difficulty but is not suspected of having a disability by the schoo l, the school may attempt to remediate s uch difficulty through providing scientific, research -based interventions in general education environments. The Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) \u00a7388.325 defines the use of scientific, research- based intervention for students who are not yet suspected of having a disability. The following procedures shall be used by the school whenever targeted scientific, research- based interventions are provided to a particular student who is experiencing academic or behavioral difficulty: 1. Develop an intervention pl an for the student, to include: a. A description of the academic or behavior concerns, and the degree to which the student's academic or behavior performance fails to meet the demands of the educational setting; b. The interventions to be provided, which are targeted toward improving performance and increasing the rate of learning; c. The data to be collected to measure the student's level of performance and rate of learning; d. The frequency of data collection; a description of how the data will be sum marized; a description of how intervention effectiveness will be evaluated; a schedule for evaluating intervention effectiveness. 2. Provide a copy of the intervention plan to the student's parents. 3. If the eligibility team intends to determine eligib ility for SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITIES based upon the child's RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION, provide the \"NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION POLICY STATEMENT - RESPONSE TO SCIENTIFIC, RESEARCH -BASED INTERVENTION\" document to the student's parents. This Policy Statement is not required if the student's eligibility for SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITIES will be determined based upon the discrepancy analysis model. 254Attachment\u0000 4. Based in part on the results of the targeted, scientific, research -based intervention, determine wheth er the student is suspected of having a disability and should be evaluated for special education eligibility. 5. If the parent requests an initial evaluation for special education eligibility while interventions are being attempted, the school must: a. Conduct the initial evaluation if the school that the student is suspected of having a disability; or b. Provide PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of its refusal to conduct the initial evaluation (if the school does not agree that the student is suspected of having a disability). Any proposed refusal to evaluate a student must be discussed with the principal or Special Education Designee If the school determines that the educational difficulty or behavior of the pupil is resistant to general education interv ention, or if the school determines that the intervention requires continued and substantial effort and may require the provision of special education and related services to be effective, the school may refer the student for an initial evaluation. REFERRAL A student qualifies for all the rights and benefits of IDEA once he or she is determined to be a child with a disability as d efined in the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC). Generally, students are evaluated when either the parents of the child request an evaluation, or when, as a result of the school's \"child find\" or general education intervention activities, school personnel recommend an evaluation. If the school proposes to conduct an initial evaluation of a student, parents must be provided with p rior written notice of the proposed evaluation and a copy of the Parent Rights document. Next, consent for the evaluation must be obtained before the evaluation may begin. See PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS section. In conducting the evaluation, the school must us e a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional and developmental information on the child, including information supplied by the child's parents. Further, the information gathered should relate to enabling the child to be invo lved in and progress in the general curriculum. If appropriate, because there are existing evaluation data (e.g., a student who moved to the school from out of state and evaluation information from the other state was available in a timely manner, or a stu dent making the transition from infant/toddler early intervention services at age three), the school must review existing evaluation data and determine what, if any, additional assessments are necessary. See EVALUATION/REEVALUATION REPORT . On the basis of this review, the school must identify and gather the additional data needed to determine: 1. Whether the child has a disability. 2. The child's present levels of performance and educational needs. 3. Whether the child needs special education and relate d services. The initial referral process is as follows: 1. Identify the student's problem and initiate the special education referral process. a. Complete the Special Education REFERRAL FORM and include the following : Copy of emergency card front and b ack Vision and hearing results (must be a pass) Developmental history completed Student observation form completed Attendance information Copy of educational intervention(s) and modification(s) Academic results, sample of classroom work, test Provide prior written notice of the proposal to evaluate the student ( PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE) with a copy of Parent Rights c. Obtain parent consent to evaluate the student ( CONSENT FOR EVALUATION ) Academic results Behavior asses sment d. Principal's signature on referral form authorizing the initial referral process. 2. Review referral packet for appropriateness and completeness. a. Parent has been given written notice of the school's proposal to evaluate the student. b. Parent has provided consent to evaluate prior to any individually administered assessments given on the basis of the suspicion of disability. c. Parent has been given a copy of Parent Rights, and rights have been explained in their primary language (e.g., Spanis h) d. Student has passed the vision and hearing tests, or has been treated by a physician to correct problem area. or a copy of the \"passed\" or \"normal\" results are provided. e. Copies of data are legible and included. f. Principal has signed referra l. g. Assign designee or case manager for referral. 3. Process referral packet. a. Send copies to the school principal or Special Education Designee who will forward to psychologist or other evaluation coordinator (e.g., speech therapist) to initiate the evaluation. b. Collect further data if needed. c. Send copies of referral page, copy of consent for evaluation, and relevant information to related service provider if assessment is needed and is indicated on referral form (speech therapist, occupationa l therapist, or physical therapist). 4. If applicable, a psychologist will complete the evaluation, write the report, and forward copies to the case manager. If a speech therapist has been the evaluation coordinator, the therapist also serves as the case manager. See Evaluation section of this Manual for further information. 5. Schedule a meeting to determine eligibility (PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE and NOTIFICATION OF MEETING) . See Eligibility section of this Manual for further information. a. Meetin g must include required Eligibility Team members, including, for example: LEA representative Special education teacher (for student with speech/language impairment, speech therapist is the special education teacher) Regular education teacher Parent (s) and/or guardian(s) School psychologist if applicable b. Meeting could also include: Speech therapist Occupational therapist Physical therapist School nurse 6. Once eligibility is determined and if student is found eligible, an IEP must be written. The IEP Committee may include, and is not limited to: a. Parent(s)* b. Regular education teacher* c. Special education teacher* d. LEA representative* e. School psychologist f. Related service provider (speech therapist, occupational therapist, physical therapist , assistive school nurse, etc.) *Required members, in addition to a person who can interpret the instructional implications of the evaluation. 7. Transfer students: Transfers within Nevada . Students with disabilities transferring into the school from another school district in Nevada remain eligible for special education, related services, and supplementary aids and services. Documentation of previous evaluation(s) and eligibility determination(s ) must be obtained from the previous school district. If such documentation cannot be obtained, school staff should contact the Director of Special Services at the district. When the parents register their child for school and indicate the student was receiving special education services at his/her previous school in Nevada, a form indicating the name and location of the previous school will be completed and faxed to the school secretary. Records will requested and sent to the special education office. Attempts to locate/obtain records will be documented . Records received will be provided to the evaluation coordinator. A copy of the IEP will be sent to the case manager. If the student's previous IEP is available, the school must provide the student with a free appropriate public education, including services comparable to those described in the previous IEP, in consultation with the parents, for a period no longe r than 30 calendar days, until the school adopts the previous IEP, or develops a new IEP. If no IEP is available, the student should be receiving services under a 30 -calendar -day interim IEP. Upon the expiration of 30 days after the development of the interim IEP, a complete IEP must be developed. Because the student is already eligible in Nevada, a reevaluation is usually not needed. Transfers from Out -of-State . Students with disabilities transferring into the school from another state must be evaluated to determine whether they meet Nevada's eligibility requirements. The school principal or Speci al Education Designee is responsible for coordinating the process needed to ensure that Nevada eligibility is confirmed, whether under the 30 -day interim IEP timeline (in circumstances when no IEP is available from the previous district), or under the 45-s chool day timeline when the school is providing services comparable to the services provided under the student's out -of-state IEP. Parental consent must be obtained using the CONSENT FOR EVALUATION form . If evaluation information is available, the combined members of the eligibility team and IEP Committee must complete the EVALUATION/REEVALUATION REPORT form. If no additional data are needed, provide PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of this decision. The eligibility team must meet to determine eligibility wit hin 45 school days of obtaining the parent's written consent. If the student's previous IEP is available, the school must provide the student with a free appropriate public education, including services comparable to those described in the previous IEP, i n consultation with the parents, until eligibility in Nevada has been determined and until the school develops a new IEP, if appropriate. If no IEP is available, the student should be receiving services under a 30 -calendar -day interim IEP. If a 30-day int erim IEP has been developed, the student's eligibility must be confirmed and a complete IEP must be developed prior to the expiration of the 30 days. During the 30 -day period, the student should be receiving services either under an interim IEP. Obtainin g/Reviewing Records 1. The case manager is responsible for obtaining all IDEA records relative to a student 2. If the case manager has difficulty obtaining a student's IDEA records, the case manager will forward a records release to the school secretar y asking for assistance in obtaining the records. 3. Once the IDEA records have been obtained, the case manager a. Initiate a records review referral by completing the top portion of the Psychologist Report/Review of Records form b. Copy records for psychologist c. Maintain copies for IDEA file d. Send review of records form attached to psychologist's copies to Special Services 4. The case manager will: a. Date stamp the records review referral attached to the students' records. b. Log the referral date into the computer database. 5. The case manager will forward the referral packet to the school psychologist via mail. 6. The school psychologist will complete the Psychologist Report/Review of Records form which will address issues of: a. Eligibility, including date of an existing Eligibility Statement b. Current psychologist report, including an existing date of evaluation c. Provide further instructions to the case manager d. Forward copies to the school, parent, and the school secre tary 7. The school secretary will log any existing and acceptable dates into database which may include: a. Eligibility determination date b. Evaluation report date (e.g., school psychologist report, speech language therapist report) c. IEP date (if a pplicable) EVALUATION Definitions 1. Eligibility team (ET). A team of professional staff, including the parents who plan the assessment for a student, collect the appropriate information through formal and informal assessment methods, and make a deter mination of eligibility based on the criteria set forth in state regulations ( Nevada Administrative Code [NAC] \u00a7388.330 -440). 2. Academic achievement . The possession of basic reading skills and skills relating to oral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, reading fluency, reading comprehension, mathematics calculation, and mathematics reasoning. For students ages three to five years, this term includes academic readiness and mastery of language concepts (NAC \u00a7388.005). 3. Adaptive ski lls. Communication, self -care, home living, social skills, community use, self -direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure and work (NAC \u00a7388.015). 4. Assistive technology device . Any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a student with a disability (NAC \u00a7388.023). Cochlear implants are not considered assistive technology devices. 5. A ssistive technology service . Any service that directly assists a student with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device (i.e., piece of equipment or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve th e functional capabilities of a student). This includes the evaluation of the need for such devices and services; providing for the acquisition of devices; selecting, designing, fitting, customizing, adapting, applying, maintaining, repairing, or replacing devices; coordinating and using other therapies, interventions, or services; and training or technical assistance for students, families, professionals, employers, or others (NAC \u00a7388.024). 6. Scientific, research- based intervention. The modification of the classroom environment, curriculum or delivery of instruction in general education settings, which is based upon an examination of characteristics of the student as a learner, the instruction being provided and the curricular tasks to be accomplished, and targeted toward improving the 258Attachment\u0000 level of performance and rate of learning. The modification of the classroom environment, curriculum or delivery of instruction is demonstrated through scientifically based research and practice to have a positive impact on a pupil's academic achievement or behavior. 7. Intervention . Strategies developed on the basis of individual need which are designed to have a remedial effect upon any academic or behavioral problems of a student. This does not ordinarily incl ude general disciplinary procedures unless these have a demonstrated superior effect over individually designed strategies (NAC \u00a7388.085). 8. Social and emotional condition . The present thoughts, feelings, and interactive behavior of the student (NAC \u00a738 8.111). 9. Eligibility Determination . A determination by an eligibility team that the student qualifies for special education, related services, and/or supplementary aids and services in the school environment in accordance with the eligibility criteria established in NAC \u00a7388.330 -440. 10. Evaluation procedures . Assessments/evaluation materials must be: o selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial or cultural basis; o provided and administered in the child's native language o r other mode of communication, and in the form most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and can do academically, developmentally, and functionally, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so o used for the purposes for which the as sessments are valid and reliable o administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel o administered in accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of the assessments Assessments and other evaluation materials include those tailored to asse ss specific areas of educational need and not merely those that are designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient. Assessments are selected and administered so as best to ensure that if an assessment is administered to a child with limited se nsory, manual, or speaking skills, the assessment results accurately reflect the child's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the child's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills ( unless those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure). The child must be assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability, including, if appropriate, health, vision, hearing, social and emotional status, general intelligence, academic performance, communicative status, and motor abilities. Assessments of children who transfer from one district to another in the same school year must be coordinated with those children's prior and subsequent schools, as necessary and as expeditiously as possible, to ensure prompt completion of full evaluations. The evaluation must be sufficiently comprehensive to identify all of the child's special education and related service needs, whether or not commonly linked to the disability category in whi ch the child has been classified. 11. Primary diagnostician . A diagnostic professional who is assigned to lead the eligibility team (ET) in planning and conducting the evaluation and interpreting the results. Most often this will be the member of the ET who is most responsible for the evaluation (e.g., school psychologist, speech/language therapist). Purpose The purpose of gathering diagnostic data pertaining to the special student is to accomplish the following: 1. Determine whether the student has a particular category of disability, or in the case of a reevaluation whether the have such a disability; 2. Identify the present levels of academic achievement and related developmental needs of the student; 3. Determine whether the student needs special education and related services, or in the case of a reevaluation whether the student continues to need special education and related services; 4. Determine whether any additions or modifications to the special education and relate d services are needed to enable the student to meet the measurable annual goals set out in the IEP and to participate as appropriate in the general education curriculum; and 5. Formulate possible courses of action. Principles Throughout the evaluation process, the following principles should be emphasized: 1. Multidisciplinary team approach. 2. Confidentiality. 3. Nondiscriminatory testing. 4. Adherence to all procedural safeguards. Process Students who may be referred for special education services are those whose learning and/or behavior problems appear to be beyond the scope of the general educational setting or whose problems have previously not been solved through general education interventions. Students at the school 1) Students enrolle d at the school are processed through interschool channels according to the referral procedures outlined in sections: Intervention, Referral, and Evaluations. Students From Other Counties or States 2) Students having received special education services i n another school district in Nevada or outside of the state of Nevada are processed according to procedures outlined under \"Transfer Students\" in the Referral section. Consultation with Parents After determining that the student will be referred for a s pecial education evaluation, the principal/designee meets with parents to discuss the school's proposal for evaluation, as described below. Meet With Parents Holds a meeting with the parent/guardian to discuss in detail the student's educational difficul ties. Provide Notice of Proposed Evaluation Completes PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE to advise parents of the proposed evaluation of the student. Advise Parents of Rights Advises the parent of special education rights and provides a copy of Parent Rights document. Explain Evaluation Procedures Explains evaluation procedures. Obtain Signatures on Consent for Evaluation Obtains parent/guardian signature on CONSENT FOR EVALUATION form. If Parent Refuses to Authorize If the parent/guardian refuses to authorize an evaluation, contacts Special Services for 260Attachment\u0000 for Exchange Obtains signature on the EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, if appropriate. The Principal or his/her designee is responsible for collecting all forms required in the referral process as follows: 1. The principal/designee should have received documentation of interventions relative to meeting the educational needs in the general curriculum. 2. If the student cannot meet the demands of the general curriculum an d is suspected of having a disability, the process of completing the entire referral packet will commence. 3. All necessary referral forms (e.g., Referral Form, Consent for Evaluation, Vision and Hearing, Student Observation Report, Attendance Data, Confi dential Developmental History, and Exchange of Information/Records) must be completed and forwarded to the Special Services Office. The completed referral packet is then submitted to the Special Services Office. Eligibility Team Members - Roles in Evalua tion An eligibility team (ET) must be based upon the required membership for the suspected disability. (See Table 4 for a summary of ET members, per disability category.) The ET reviews all available referral information and gathers additional data, as necessary, to determine which assessment instruments and methods will be utilized. Following this determination, the ET will assign specific responsibilities to team members for each part of the evaluation. Assessment planning is conducted so as to avoid du plication, to ensure that the evaluation is complete and comprehensive, and to get multiple perspectives relative to the needs of the student. The appropriate ET members conduct assessments and gather other information according to the established plan. If it appears to any member of the team that additional assessments are necessary, (e.g. to determine the student's need for related servic es or to explore other student characteristics) he/she should share these observations with other team members and obt ain consensus on the need for additional assessments. Use REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT to obtain additional assessment data and consider consent requirements. Roles and expectations of team members in the evaluation are as follows: Special Education Teacher The special education teacher must provide specific evaluative information regarding oral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, basic reading skills, reading fluency, reading comprehension, math calculation and math reasoning. School Psychologist The school psychologist assesses: 1) The academic potential of the student by utilizing tests that are administered individually with a wide variety of tasks presented with the resultant expectation that an adequate samplin g of important intellectual functions will be covered. The measures used are global measures of intelligence. The psychologist makes a determination as to what tests are to be used based upon the child's needs. 2) The achievement of the student is measured by using tests that are designed to measure the effects of a specific program of instruction or training. The emphasis is placed upon what the individual can do at the time. It provides an analysis of individual accomplishment. 3) The social maturity and/ or adaptive behavior of the student is measured by utilizing scales designed for assessing the individual's ability to look after his/her practical needs and for taking responsibility, as well as assessing the effectiveness of the individual in coping with natural and social demands in his/her environment. 4) The development of sensory of information skills using instruments assessing visual, perceptual and motor development. 261Attachment\u0000 School Nurse The school nurse must screen the student for vision, hearing, an d health difficulties. It is recommended that additional information be provided regarding recent physicals, medications, and evaluations relative to possible attention deficit disorders, or neurological screenings. Whenever significant alcohol or drug treatment information is available, the nurse should obtain from the parent an Authorization for Use or Release of Information with all appropriate health providers. Other Professionals Other professionals (the speech/language specialist, Adaptive PE teach er, Occupational Therapist, Physical Therapist, Vision Specialist, etc.) complete assessments as requested or required under NAC 388. These results will be presented at the Eligibility Team meeting. Case Manager The case manager may need to collect other information as appropriate: Parent -furnished data; behavioral or social checklists, pre - vocational/vocational, perceptual -motor, etc. This information is to be included as part of the Eligibility Team meeting. Evaluation Steps A timetable for co mpleting the evaluation is established that includes the anticipated date of the ET meeting where assessment information regarding the student will be reviewed and eligibility will be determined. The assessment must be completed and eligibility determined within forty -five (45) school days from the date that the parent signs the CONSENT FOR EVALUATION . This date may be extended only upon written permission from the parent. Gathering the diagnostic data is an integral part of the process leading to provision of special education services. The purpose of this data is to define current student performance levels, identify strengths and weaknesses, establish cause -related factors that affect an individual's performance, and to make recommendations for courses o f action. Confidentiality and adherence to procedural safeguards are imperative throughout the process. 1. Designate school psychologist (or other primary diagnostician) a. When appropriate, student is assigned to school psychologist to complete a psycho- social - educational evaluation. b. Whenever an individual intelligence test is administered, the psychologist must be the primary diagnostician. 2. Gather evaluation data a. Gather initial data 1. Review all available information. a. Confidential fo lder. b. Cumulative file. c. Personal interviews with appropriate staff relating to referred individuals. d. Additional information from parent (see CONFIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY) 2. If appropriate in instances where there is evaluation informatio n available (e.g., out- of- state transfers, or infant/toddlers transitioning to school services at age three), determine whether additional data are needed by meeting with or contacting combined members of ET and IEP Committee (see EVALUATION/ REEVALUATION REPORT) . Parents are contacted by letter, telephone, or in person to review existing data and ascertain whether they believe additional data are needed. Members are not required to sign the form; if the special education teacher contacts them by telephone he or she can simply note the name of the person, the date contacted, and 262Attachment\u0000 whether or not that person thinks additional data are needed. Consensus is not required. If any one member of the evaluation team believes additional data are required, the issue mu st be addressed by the team in designing the scope of the evaluation. b. Collect new information 1. Obtain CONSENT FOR EVALUATION . 2. If needed, conduct a classroom observation (or utilize observation data previously collected) to include: a. A descrip tion of the relevant behavior noted during the observation of the student. b. A statement of the relationship of that behavior to the academic functioning of the student. c. Record observation on the STUDENT OBSERVATION REPORT . c. Administer tests as ap propriate to disability category 1. Appropriate achievement tests 2. Behavior rating scales 3. Other measures as needed d. Formal data may include standardized assessment in the following areas of functioning The evaluation provided by the school psychologist will be combined with the diagnostic information gathered previously at the school to constitute the educational evaluation. Eligibility for special education services will be determined in accordance with the Nevada Administrative Code using all d ata gathered regarding a particular student. No single test or piece of information shall be used to determine eligibility. The school psychologist assesses: 1. The academic potential of the student. 2. The achievement of the student. 3. The social -emotional and/or adaptive behavior of the student. 4. The development of sensory information skills. ELIGIBILITY The purpose of convening the Eligibility Team meeting is to determine whether the student is eligible for special education and related services, and to ensure that all sources of information are considered when determining a student's eligibility. As the final step in the evaluation process, the case manager schedules a meeting to examine the results of assessments and other information regarding the student in relationship to eligibility criteria. This meeting is chaired by the case manager, unless it is agreed that another member will chair. Minimum membership must include the persons specified in the NAC for each disability category (See Table 4). Eligibility Team (ET) meetings are to be held separate from IEP Committee meeting(s), although one meeting may immediately follow the other if parents have been properly noticed and participants that are required by NAC for both ET and IEP meetings are present. At the ET meeting, the group may: 1) Determine if students are eligible for special education services under the disability criteria for which he/she was evaluated based upon the suspicion of disability; 2) Determine if students are eligible for special education under disability criteria other than that for which he/she was assessed (this may require additional assessments); 3) Determine if the students are not eligible according to established criteria for special education (NAC 388.387- 430). If the students are not eligible, the team may still wish to develop recommendations for the students' teachers to promote student success. The parents must be informed of their rights should they desire to contest this decision or to have a due process hearing to determine eligibility for services. PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE is provided to the parent if the ET determines that the student is not eligible for special education. Eligibility Statements will be completed by ET members. This statement will serve to document the eligibility for service for each student and will be completed at the ET meeting. It is important that all team members understand that eligibility decisions are a team responsibility and not the 263Attachment\u0000 any one member. As such, all me mbers must sign the Eligibility Statement and indicate their agreement or disagreement with the decision reached by the majority of the team. Disagreement Among the Team Eligibility is determined by the opinion of a majority of Eligibility Team members. If a single member or a minority of the team members disagree about the decision of the majority, a written minority report must be prepared that provides the following information (a minority report must be prepared in an LD eligibility decision and may be prepared for other disability categories): Basis 1) The basis of disagreement with the majority opinion; Evidence 2) Evidence from assessment information, observations, or other sources that support the dissenting opinion; an Alternatives 3) Altern ative recommendations, if any, pertaining to the student's eligibility or educational program. The minority report must be attached to each copy of the ET Eligibility Statement and a copy included in the student's confidential special education file. A copy of both the ET Eligibility Statement and the minority report must be sent to the principal or Special Education Designee within five (5) working days of the ET meeting. Eligibility Decision -Making Steps 1. Eligibility decision -making a. Prepare eval uation report 1. Psychologist (or other primary diagnostician) gathers all pertinent data and summarizes it in a written report. Included in the report should be statements regarding developmental history and social/emotional development. For students evaluated for Learning Disabilities, specific content is required in the evaluation report (including the scores from the computerized LDDA formula if discrepancy analysis has been used in the determination of eligibility). For students in other disability categories, the report must summarize the assessments conducted and their results, the instructional implications of the assessment results, and any other relevant information. 2. A copy of the evaluation report must be given to the parent either during or shortly after the eligibility meeting. b. Determine eligibility for special education A determination of eligibility must be made within 45 school days from the date the parent signed the consent for evaluation. 1. Parent is notified of the eligibility t eam meeting (may be combined with an IEP meeting) (PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE and NOTIFICATION OF MEETING) . 2. During the meeting, team members share and discuss all information. 3. Parent presents any additional information. 4. Eligibility or non -eligibility is determined during the eligibility team meeting. 5. Appropriate Eligibility Statement is completed consistent with eligibility team's decision. A copy of the Eligibility Statement must be given to the parent. A second copy should be sent to th e psychologist's or primary diagnostician's office for placement in the student's file. 6. If student is eligible for special student services, the special educator (as IEP Committee chair) shall convene a meeting of the IEP Committee including the parent of the student to determine the appropriate educational program for that student based on identified educational needs. This meeting may be held immediately following the meeting of the eligibility team, so long as all required IEP Committee members are p resent and the parent was given notice of the IEP meeting. Once a student for the first time has been determined eligible for special education, an IEP meeting must be held within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of eligibility determination. c. E ligibility criteria Eligibility criteria for each disability category are defined in applicable provisions of the Nevada 264Attachment\u0000 Chapter 388. NOTE: In making a determination of eligibility, a student may not be determined to be a student with a disability if the controlling factor for such a determination is the student's lack of appropriate instruction in reading or math or limited proficiency in English. REEVALUATION In accordance with state and federal regulations, each student receiving special education services will be reevaluated if conditions warrant, or if the student's parent or teacher requests a reevaluation, but at least once every three years (\"triennial\" evaluation) unless the school and the parent agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary. Principal or Special Education Designee must be consulted before any such agreement is made. Purposes Reevaluations of previously identified students with disabilities will be conducted for one or more of the following purposes : 1. Determin e whether the student continues to have a disability; 2. Identify the present levels of academic achievement and related developmental needs of the student; 3. Determine whether the student continues to need special education and related services; and 4. Determine whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services are needed to enable the student to meet the measurable annual goals set out in the IEP and to participate as appropriate in the general education curriculum. Reevaluation Process 1. PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE must be given of the school's proposal to reevaluate the student's eligibility special education services. 2. Reevaluations must be addressed by the triennial anniversary date. For example, a child found eligible on June 6, 2010, must be reevaluated and the student's eligibility must be reconfirmed on or before June 6, 2013. 3. The combined members of the Eligibility Team and IEP Committee must be contacted by letter, telephone, or in person to ascertain whether they believe additional data or assessments are needed to determine continued eligibility. In general, a meeting of these individuals is used for the purpose of reviewing existing data. Use EVALUATION/REEVALUATION REPORT to document the review of existing data against the NAC assessment requirements and the determination of whether additional data are needed to address those requirements. If no additional data are needed, the parent must be given PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of this decision and the reasons for it, including the parent's right to request additional assessments. See Table 1 for the Combined Members of the Eligibility Team and IEP Committee, per disability category, and Table 2 for the NAC assessments required in an evaluation, p er disability category. A new referral must be completed and CONSENT FOR EVALUATION must be obtained before any new assessments can be conducted. If the parent does not respond to a request for consent, the school may proceed with the reevaluation if the school can document it has taken reasonable measures to obtain consent and the student's parent has failed to respond. a. Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls. b. Copies of correspondence sent to the parent s and any responses received. c. Detailed records of visits made to parent's home or place of employment and the results of those visits. 4. Follow EVALUATION AND ELIGIBILITY procedures previously outlined. Documentation Upon 1he completion of 1he reeva luation and based on 1he reevaluation results, 1he eligibility team shall record in writing whe1her 1he student meets 1he continuing eligibility requirements for his/her present disability category. ln making such determinations, the eligibility team shall docwnent in a written Evaluation Report the basis for such determination, including any relevant data or assessment process used for the determination of continuing eligibility. An Eligibility Statement shall also be completed. 265Attachment\u0000 1 : REQUIRED MEMBERS HIP FOR COMBINED IEP & ELIGIBILITY TEAMS DISABILITY CATEGORY PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR SCOPE OF EVALUATION AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER LEA Representative; Special Education Teacher; Regular Education Teacher; Parent; School Psychologist; Speech/Language Spec ialist; One or more persons who have sufficient knowledge of the student to interpret information related to the student's social, emotional, developmental and familial condition.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM (IEP) Placement of a student in any program of special education occurs only after the development of an Individualized Educational Program (IE P). The purposes for developing an IEP are as follows: Plan the Program 1. To develop an individual program for the student which includes specially designed instruction in areas of disability which adversely affect educational performance; Facilitate Communication 2. To facilitate communication between parents and school personnel for proper and effective implementation in IEP, for students with disabilities; Manage Services 3. To serve as a management tool to ensure students receive services as determined by the IEP Committee; Commit Resources 4. To set forth a written commitment of resources to guarantee a free appropriate public education for the student; and Evaluate Progress 5. To serve as an evaluation device to determine if the student has reached the goals and objectives developed by the IEP Committee. The IEP is a written statement for each eligible student describing: 1. Student information data, including eligibility category as determined by eligibility team. 2. Present levels of academic achievement and functional performance, and other relevant developmental areas. 3. Student strengths; parental concerns; and student's interests and preferences. 4. Special factors applicable to students who have needs in the following areas: behavior; limited English proficiency; services for the blind or visually impaired; communication needs for the deaf or hard of hearing; and assistive technology. 5. Transition services. 6. Annual goals and short -term objectives, to include a behavior plan, if necessary. 7. Method for reporting progress. 8. Special education services, supplementary aids and services, and related services required to meet the student's unique needs, including the beginning and ending dates, frequency, and location of the services. 9. Participation in statewide district -wide, and school -wide assessments. 10. Extended school year services. 11. Placement. All students who are eligible for special education must have a current IEP. IEP Meetings 1. Meeting to develop the initial IEP must be held within thirty (30) calendar days from date of initial eligibility determination. 2. Review and revision conducted periodically, but not less than annually . In the case of preschool students, it is advisable to re -visit the IEP at least every six months, if not more frequently. State regulations require that the parents of a preschool child with a disability be given an opportunity to participate in a review of the child's progress every six months. An IEP meeting may be convene d for conducting this review, but is not strictly required. 3. Annual review must occur on or prior to the anniversary date of the IEP. IEP Committee --Minimal Membership 1. LEA Representative: school principal or administrative designee (must hold admin istration or special education license in Nevada) a.

Written notice of the purpose, date, time and location of the committee meeting must be given sufficiently far in advance of the meeting to enable the parent to make arrangements to attend (see PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN N OTICE and NOTIFICATION OF MEETING). In order to satisfy the requirement to provide a copy of parent rights at least once per year, a copy of parent rights will be sent to parents with notification of each annual IEP meeting. The PARENT IEP QUESTIONNAIRE AND WORKSHEET accompanies the NOTICE and NOTIFICATION. b. If parent does not acknowledge receipt of the first notice, two additional notices shall be sent. If there is still no response, the school shall attempt to notify parent by telephone. c.

Parent agreed to an appointment (confirmed by signature on notice to parent or notation in the file based on other communication with the parent) and does not show for appointment (or call to explain absence and reschedule). \"No Show\" must be documented. A copy of any IEP developed without the presence of the parent must be sent home, with a letter of explanation. The letter should detail the reasons why the IEP meeting was held, and advise the parent that they may request another IEP meeting if they wish. Additionally, the parent must be given PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE of the school's intent to implement the IEP if an IEP was developed without the presence or consensus of the parent. 4. Federal and state law permit the school and the parent to agree: a. that the participation of an IEP committee member is not necessary if that person's area of curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed in the meeting; that an IEP committee member whose are a of curriculum or related services IS being modified or discussed in the meeting (the member must submit written input to the parents and the IEP committee prior to the IEP meeting); or c. that an annual IEP may be revised without convening an IEP meeting . See PARENT AGREEMENT AND CONSENT. No staff member at the school may enter into any of these agreements with parents without prior approval from the principal or Special Education designee. Preparation for IEP Meeting \u2014Case Manager 1. Notify committee m embers of date and time. 2. Ensure all necessary confidential information is available to committee members prior to meeting. 3.

Make arrangements to obtain additional information if IEP Committee determines that available information is inadequate for some reason. f. As useful or necessary, the WRITTEN CONSULTATION RECORD may be completed to record d etails of any meeting which does not result in a revision to an IEP, or other document. Note that actual IEP decisions MUST be recorded as revisions to the IEP. 2. Where to start? a. One of the first decisions that the committee has to make in developing and implementing the IEP is where to start. This process involves deciding which needs require major emphasis and which needs require minor emphasis. The following is a list of critical areas to consider in making this important decision: 1. What are the priority parental concerns? 2. What are the priority teacher concerns? 3. What are the requirements for access to and progress in the general curriculum? 4. What are the appropriate developmental sequences of tasks or behaviors that the child would be expected to move through? 5. Other crucial considerations such as behavior problems, social and peer relationships, etc. b. For each of the major areas of need indicated by the present level of academic achievement and functional performance, the special educator must write an annual goal statement. The number of goal statements needed is dependent upon the student's needs and may range from one to many. 3. IEP Development The IEP chairperson, with the input of all committee members, develops the goals a nd objectives of the IEP during the IEP meeting. The first task of the committee in the planning function is to review the information gathered during the student evaluation process. Using this information, the committee should complete the IEP in accordance with the Nevada Department of Education Guidelines for IEP Development (included as an appendix to this Special Education Procedures Manual) and the specific technical assistance guidance provided by the school in staff training. 4. Legally and Educationally Sound IEPs Educational objectives and services include both instructional objectives and related services that are required for meeting the unique needs of the student and are derived from a careful evaluation of the student and his/her environment through the evaluation process. The IEP Committee should take time to develop a defensible IEP; that is, one that is legally and educationally sound. A sound IEP is one that: a. Demonstrates attention to the individual needs of the student; b. I s calcu lated to provide meaningful educational benefits to the student (as shown in part by well - designed annual goals and short- term objectives); c. Includes appropriate placement in the least restrictive environment (with his/h er non -disabled peers) so as to meet his/her educational needs; e. Considers the use of supplementary aids and services to assure placement in the least restrictive environment; f. Provides appropriate accommodations and modifications that the student needs to participate with other students in all school settings; and g. Documents (together with other forms in the student's confidential file) that all procedural safeguards (written consent, prior written notice, notification of rights, parental invol vement, etc.) have been provided. 5. Additional Information a. Length of School Day If the school day is to be modified, indicate the parameters of the modified day on the section for Supplementary Aids and Services. List the reasons why the day has b een modified. Length of school day should only be modified if all committee members agree that it is necessary to provide the student with a free appropriate public education. Any changes made to the length of the child's school day must be accompanied by a plan to reconsider those changes at regular intervals. It is the position of the school that any such modifications are not permanent and efforts will be made to bring the child's school day back into line with others of the child's age or grade level as soon as it is feasible. b. Assistive Technology Assistive technology includes devices and services as part of specially designed instruction, related service, or supplementary aids and services. If a related service, the student must require the devi ce to assist him or her to benefit from special education services. Assistive technology devices are used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities devices, do not fall into the school responsibility area. There are exceptions. Pleas e contact the principal or Special Education Designee if there is such a request. School personnel can act as facilitators to assist students in securing devices outside of the school's responsibility. If the school purchases the device it is, and will remain, school property. The device's use, including home use, must be determined during the IEP meeting. 6. Extended School Year Provision of ESY services is an IEP Committee decision that involves appropriate school personnel and the parents. ESY services are defined as special education and related services provided in addition to the normal 180 -day school year for the purpose of minimizing significant regression of identified skills and for enhancing recoupment of those skills when the regular school ye ar resumes. These identified skills may involve areas of learning related to self - sufficiency, academic, social and/or emotional skills. There are no specific standards set forth in IDEA for determining when ESY services are needed. Regression and the speed of recoupment are factors for the IEP committee to consider while making the decision. Regression is defined as the loss of previously mastered skills when an extended break in instruction occurs. The recoupment of those skills is defined as the ability to regain a skill within a reasonable period of time to previously achieved levels prior to an extended break in instruction. Regression could be considered significant if the student takes more than four to six weeks to relearn skills mastered the previo us year. The IEP committee might base its decision regarding ESY services upon a history of regression during summer months. Regression and recoupment are not the only standards upon which to base a decision of the need for ESY services. Other factors that need to be considered by the IEP Committee include the severity of the student's disability; a review of the student's progress over time; a determination that the student is at a critical learning stage; any information available to the IEP Committee re lating to the student's behavior or physical needs; or curricular areas that are of significant concern for the individual student. It is important to remember that ESY services are based upon the individual needs of the student. Steps for making and docu menting ESY decisions are as follows: a. Provision for ESY is determined annually and is an IEP Committee decision. b. ESY services are designed to maintain acquired skills. New goals and objectives are not added to a student's IEP for implementation in the ESY program unless those goals and objectives are determined by the IEP Committee to be necessary to maintain the skills, behaviors, or other student performance for which ESY services are designed. c. If related services, such as occupational thera py, physical therapy, and/or speech and language therapy, the appropriate professional must be involved in the IEP decision -making. The need for specific related services must be documented, and must be required for the student to ben efit from his or her special education program. The fact that a student currently receives related services does not, in itself, guarantee that the services will be required during ESY. d. The IEP Committee should identify the specific goals to be addressed during ESY instruction, if the student requires more than four to six weeks at the beginning of the school year to regain previously mastered skills, an ESY program should be considered. e. The IEP Committee decisions concerning ESY are documented on the EXTENDED SCHOOL YEAR SERVICES form, which assists the school in planning for or providing the ESY services. ESY is not the same as summer school, which refers to educational programming made available to students for enrichment or remedial purposes. A student with a disability who meets the criteria for a summer school program may attend that program without regard to a specific need for ESY. However, unless the student needs the regular summer school program to implement the IEP or for compensator education purposes, the parent must pay any fees that apply to all students enrolled in the program. ESY, on the other hand, must be provided at no cost to the student's parent. Related services shall be provided to the child during ESY when necessary to support the goals and objectives being implemented during the program. 7. Related Services Related Services are those services that are required to assist the student to benefit from the special education services needed by the student. Related services are to be provided as a part of a student's special education program as determined by the student's IEP committee. a. Audiology. Audiology is a related service that includes identification of children with hearing loss and determination of the range, natu re, and degree of the hearing loss. Audiology services also include referrals for medical or other professional attention relative to the habilitation of hearing. The Audiologist will provide information and guidance regarding hearing loss, determination of the student's need for group and individualized amplification, assistance in selecting and fitting of an appropriate aid, and evaluation of the effectiveness of amplification. Referrals are made to the school principal or Special Education Designee. b. Speech Therapy. Speech therapy includes the identification of children with speech or language impairments; diagnosis and appraisal of specific speech and language impairments; referrals for medical or other professional attention necessary for the habil itation or prevention of communicative impairments, and counseling and guidance of parents, children and teachers regarding speech and language impairments. A referral is made to the school principal or Special Education Designee. c. Physical Therapy. Physical Therapy is a related service that develops programs for the care of students whose ability to function is impaired. It focuses primarily on children with neurodevelopment problems in the school. The physical therapist's function in the educational setting is to prepare the student for meeting educational demands of educators. Referrals for evaluation and/or service are made through the school principal or Special Education Designee. d. Occupational Therapy. Occupational Therapy is a related servi ce designed to improve, develop, or restore functions that have been either impaired or lost through illness, injury, or deprivation. Occupational Therapy improves the student's ability to perform tasks for independent functioning if certain functions are impaired or lost; and helps prevent, through early intervention, initial or further impairment or loss of function. Referrals for evaluation and/or service are made through the b school principal or Special Education Designee. e. Counseling. Counseling Service are services that are provided by qualified psychologists, guidance counselors, or other qualified personnel. The IEP Committee will address the needed service or activities that apply therapeutic process to personal, family, or situational problem s in order to bring about positive resolution for the student. The IEP Committee will address the needed counseling on a case- by-case basis for these related services. f. Transportation. The school will ensure that transportation is not a barrier to FAP E for students with disabilities. In such case where transportation is not readily available, it is the policy of the school to provide transportation either in the form of actual transportation or the reimbursement to the parent of transportation costs in accordance with IRS(IR -2008- 82, June 23, 2008) when providing related services addressed in the IEP. Interim IEP Thirty -day interim IEP placement status is reserved for special education students who transfer to the school from another school 276Attachment\u0000 Nevada, or from out- of-state, but for whom no IEP is available. If an IEP is available, the procedures for providing comparable services are used as described in the \"Transfer Students\" provisions (see Referral section). The 30- day interim IEP allow s for immediate services in the special education services program while records from the previous district are requested and while any necessary additional assessments are conducted if eligibility must be determined for an out- of-state student. It is the responsibility of the school psychologist or other primary diagnostician to monitor progress so that determination of the student's eligibility in Nevada can be made by the ET team within the 30 day period. Note: If a student who was enrolled in a special education program in the school leaves the school, then re -enrolls with the school within a year, the student may again receive special education services with no additional assessment required. A new IEP is developed with the student's recent transfer and educational history taken into consideration. When developing an interim IEP, the case manager is responsible for the following steps dealing with prior special education eligibility: 1. The case manager should check with the school registrar, school principal, or Special Education Designee to gain accessibility to all pertinent records; 2. Verify prior eligibility for special education services; 3. Verify enrollment in a program of special education; 4. Confirm out-of-district placement from two sources (phone call to previous district, parent report, or special education records hand -carried by the parent from the previous district); and 5. Secure the parent/guardian signatures for the necessary IDEA paperwork, including the exchange of informatio n. The interim IEP is valid for only thirty (30) calendar days, during which time eligibility for services must be determined for an out-of-state student, and a complete a school IEP must be written (for in -state or out -of-state students). Interim IEPs cannot be extended for any reason, and the student cannot receive special education services without a current, valid IEP. 277Attachment\u0000 REVIEW MEETING Purpose A student's IEP must be reviewed at least annually. 1. Assess progress using individual achievem ent tests, as well as other measures of achievement. 2. Evaluate progress on annual goals and short -term objectives. 3. Develop the student's education plan for the upcoming year. Schedule Annual Review 1. Notify parent of annual review meeting using NOTIFICATION OF MEETING and PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE if specific proposals are planned for FAPE or placement. Send Parent Rights document with NOTIFICATION OF MEETING. 2. If a draft IEP is to be used, ensure that the parent receives a copy at leas t five days before the scheduled annual review meeting. 3. IEP annual review meeting must be on or before the anniversary date. For example, a child whose IEP was written on September 2, 2006, will have to have a new IEP in place on or before September 2, 2007. Eligibility team members need to be present if student's disability category is being changed or reviewed - follow Evaluation and Eligibility and IEP procedures. 4. All other procedures for IEP development must be followed as outlined in this doc ument. 5. Provide a copy of IEP to parent. IEP Revision If circumstances change relative to the program specifically designed for the student, the IEP must be revised through the IEP process. The following circumstances would necessitate a revision: 1. A change in the amount of time that the student is spending in special education. 2. A change in the type of program. 3. Achievement of the current goals and objectives that would necessitate writing new goals and objectives for the student. 4. Addition, change to, or deletion of a related service. 5. A change from one level to another, as from elementary school to middle school and middle school to high school that requires changes in the IEP. Revision of a student's IEP does not change the cu rrent date of review of the IEP. Only completion of a full IEP changes that date. Exit IEP When a student is ready to exit the special education program for any reason (e.g., no longer eligible, student reaches maximum age, graduation) an IEP meeting is scheduled with the parents and the student's current level of performance will be reviewed. Note that only an Eligibility Team reevaluation process can determine that a student is no longer eligible for special education \u2014 this is not an IEP Committee decis ion. Except for turning 22 or graduating with a regular diploma, other determinations that the student is no longer eligible require a reevaluation (see below). Parents must be given notice of the purpose for this IEP meeting and provided with an explanat ion of their rights. Careful attention should be paid to the following: 1. It is absolutely essential that parents are involved in decisions relative to cessation of special education services. 2. Include all information on the student for this reevaluation: parent observation, classroom work, assessments/observation, etc. 3. Parental rights. 4. Student progress toward annual goals and short -term objectives. 5. The effect upon the student if exited from the special education program. 278Attachment\u0000 OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES THROUGH TERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY 1. See reevaluation procedures outlined previously, paying particular attention to the requirements for prior written notice and review of existing data to determine whether additional data are needed. 2. Parent must be provided notice of eligibility team meeting ( PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE and NOTIFICATION OF MEETING\u2014 note that this PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE should provide notice of the proposal to determine the student's eligibili ty). 3. Eligibility team meeting must be held and include: a. Evaluation of progress toward annual goals. b. Review of recent evaluations and progress in general curriculum. c. Statements concerning levels of functioning and rationale for why student is either no longer has a disability and/or is no longer in need of special education (student must both have a disability and require special education in order to be eligible for services). 4. Evaluation Report and Eligibility Statement must be comple ted, stating that the student is no longer eligible for special education. Copies must be given to parent. 5. Parent must be provided notice of proposed change in eligibility after the student has been determined not to be eligible (PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTE N NOTICE ). This notice is required even if parents participated in and agreed with the decision that the student is no longer eligible. Check box \"proposing\" and \"other.\" Add a statement \"termination of special education services because student is no long er eligible.\" If parent disagrees, review the statement of parent rights with the parent. PLACEMENT Placement decisions in the school are made at the IEP meeting with parental involvement. Placement should be at the school unless special circumstances exist. Removal From Regular Education Environments The student may not be placed in a special class, in a different school, or otherwise removed from the regular educational environment unless the IEP otherwise provides. Justification for any removal from regular education environments must be explained in detail in students' IEPs. Procedure to Implement Placement Outside the School 1. Ensure school withdrawal procedures are followed. 2. Initiate necessary transportation. IEP IMPLEMENTATION 1. Implementation of the IEP must take place immediately after completion of the entire IEP process. In accordance with recent 2008 guidance from the U.S. Office of Special Education Programs, even when parents agree with the IEP provisions, PARENTAL PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE will be provided to parents as notice that the IEP and its specified provisions will be implemented. 2. CONSENT FOR INITIAL PROVISION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED SERVICES must be signed before services are provided for the first time. Thereafter, consent is not necessary unless the student experiences a lapse in eligibility. No student may be placed in special education or have changes made to his/her educational program or placement without going through the IEP process. DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES THE \"10 FREE DAYS\" RULE Under federal law, during the first 10 school days that a student is suspended in a school year, there are no requirements to 279Attachment\u0000 services, conduct a manifestation determination, develop a plan for or conduct a functional behavioral assessment (FBA), or develop or review a behavior intervention plan (BIP). This 10 -day period, whether consecutive or cumulative, is sometimes referred to as the \"10 free days\". However, during the \"10 free days\", the school must adhere to t he discipline requirements that apply to all students. Days that \"count\" toward the accumulation of 10 school days Any disciplinary removal of a student from school grounds \"counts\" toward the accumulation of 10 school days. Only in - school suspensions, un der certain circumstances, can be configured so as to avoid \"counting\" as disciplinary removals. See below. Under the federal regulations, \"school day\" means any day, including a partial day, that children are in attendance at school for instructional pur poses. The term \"school day\" has the same meaning for all children in school, including children with and without disabilities. \"Business day\" means Monday through Friday, except for federal and state holidays (unless holidays are specifically included in the designation of \"business day,\" as in federal regulations at \u00a7300.403(d)(1)(ii). Ordinary in -school disciplinary procedures do not \"count\" toward the accumulation of 10 school days The U.S. Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe (1988) stated that ordinary i n-school disciplinary measures are not considered disciplinary removals. These measures may include \"the use of study carrels, time -out, detention, or the restriction of privileges.\" School officials should avoid the excessive use of any of these measures, without considering the need to reconvene the student's IEP committee to review behavior needs. In-school suspensions, bus suspensions, or portions of a school day \"counted\" toward the accumulation of 10 school days Comments in the federal regulations ha ve provided the following guidance on whether in -school suspensions, bus suspensions, and portions of school days \"count\" toward the accumulation of 10 school days. In-School Suspensions In-school suspensions do not \"count\" toward the accumulation of 10 s chool days as long as the child is afforded the opportunity to continue to appropriately progress in the general curriculum, continue to receive the services specified on hi s or her IEP and continue to participate with nondisabled children to the extent th ey would have in their current placement. Portions of a School Day Portions of a school day do \"count\" toward the accumulation of 10 school days: Bus Suspensions Bus suspensions \"count\" when transportation is a related service in the student's IEP. Note that the U.S. Office for Civil Rights which administers Section 504 and other civil rights laws has taken the position that suspensions from the school bus are governed by the same disciplinary procedures as other suspensions. PROCEDURES FOR MAKING DISCIP LINARY CHANGE OF PLACEMENT A disciplinary change of placement occurs when a student is suspended for more than 10 consecutive days, OR when a student is subjected to a series of suspensions of 10 days or less, but a \"pattern\" of removals has occurred. Bef ore making a disciplinary change of placement under either of these two scenarios, the school must determine whether the student's behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability. Generally, the school will treat removals beyond 10 cumulative schoo l days as a disciplinary change of placement. General Rules 1. School personnel may consider any unique circumstances on a case- by-case basis when determining whether a removal is appropriate for a child with a disability. 2. Services must be provided to a student who has been removed from his/her placement on the 11 th and any subsequent day of removal in a school year. 280Attachment\u0000 School policy is to consider any removal beyond the first ten days as constituting a disciplinary change of placement, which triggers procedural requirements for notice and a manifestation determination. 4. Special rules apply for behavior involving illegal drugs/controlled substances, weapons, infliction of serious bodily injury. 5. IDEA requires that in the case of a student whose b ehavior impedes the student's learning or the learning of others, the IEP committee must consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior. 6. If a parent requests a due process hearing to c hallenge disciplinary decisions (including the outcome of the manifestation determination, the placement, and the services provided in the removal setting), the student remains in the disciplinary setting until the hearing officer reaches a decision, or until the disciplinary removal expires, whichever occurs first. Parents and the school may agree otherwise. A hearing under this circumstance is \"expedited\" \u2014which means that no extensions beyond the 45 -day timeline are permitted. Services must be provided to the student on the 11th and each day of suspension thereafter in any school year. So even if the school is permitted to make a disciplinary change of placement (because the behavior is NOT a manifestation of the student's disability or because federal permits removal regardless of manifestation for students who have conduct involving weapons/drugs/controlled substances/infliction of serious bodily injury) the resulting suspension and/or expulsion cannot occur without providing services BEFORE IMPLEMENTING A REMOVAL THAT WILL TAKE THE STUDENT BEYOND THE FIRST TEN DAYS IN A SCHOOL YEAR: 1. School personnel make decision to seek removal of student that will take the student beyond the first ten days in a school year. 2. On the day a decision is made to make a removal that constitutes a change of placement (generally in the school, a removal that will take the student beyond the first ten days in a school year), the school must provide \"parental prior notice\" of the proposed disciplinary removal (and proposed manifestation determination and proposed IEP meeting if there is a need to determine the removal setting and services to be provided) and provide parents a copy of the Rights document. 3. School personnel give student notice of the charges against h im/her, an explanation of the evidence, and an opportunity for a \"hearing\" (in this context, an opportunity for the student to present his/her side of the story). 4. Before implementing a removal that will take the student beyond the first ten days in a school year, a manifestation determination must be conducted. 5. If the conduct IS a manifestation of the student's disability: the student must be returned to the placement from which the student was removed, unless the parent and the school agree to a change of placement via IEP process (EXCEPT when student is removed to IAES for illegal drugs/controlled substances, weapons, or infliction of serious bodily injury) an FBA must be conducted, unless one had been conducted before the behavior that resul ted in the proposed change of placement a BIP must be implemented (if one already exists, it must be reviewed and modified as necessary) 6. If the conduct IS NOT a manifestation of the student's disability: the school may take the disciplinary action that was planned and impose disciplinary sanctions that it would otherwise apply to a student without disabilities, in the same manner, for the same duration services must be provided on the 11 th and any subsequent day of removal during the school year ; the school conducts an IEP meeting, and the IEP committee determines the removal setting and the extent of the services that must be provided: to enable the student to continue to participate in the general education curriculum to progress toward meeting the goals in the student's IEP If appropriate, the student must receive an FBA and BIP services designed to address the behavior so it does not recur 7. Present information to an authorized entity for final determination and review for compliance w ith IDEA for any removal beyond 10 school days (state law requirement). 8. Once a student has been removed for more than 10 days in a school year, these steps are repeated for proposed removal. Manifestation determinations must be conducted as soon as po ssible and prior to implementing the proposed -school suspension may be used pending completion of the manifestation 282Attachment\u0000 DETERMINATION 1. Before implementing a removal that will constitute a disciplinary change of placement (in the school, before implementing a removal beyond the first 10 days of removal in a school year), a manifestation determination must be conducted. 2. The manifestation determination is conducted by a representative of the school, the parent , and relevant members of the student's IEP committee. 3. Relevant members are determined by the parent and the school, so there must be contact with the parent to discuss \"relevant\" members of the IEP committee. 4. The group must: review all releva nt information in the student's file review the student's IEP review any teacher observations review any relevant information provided by the parents 5. The group must determine: if the conduct in question was caused by, or had a direct and subst antial relationship to, the student's disability OR if the conduct in question was the direct result of the school's failure to implement the IEP (if so, the school must take immediate steps to remedy failure to implement the IEP) \"REMOVAL\" RULES \u2014STATE LAW Habitual Discipline Problem Removals as described in NRS 392.4655 for a student deemed a \"Habitual Discipline Problem\" must be made in compliance with IDEA procedures. In Nevada (NRS 392.4655), a student is deemed a \"habitual discipline problem\" if i n one school year: (a) the student has threatened or extorted, or attempted to threaten or extort, another student or a teacher or other personnel employed by the school; (b) the student has been suspended for initiating at least two fights on school prop erty, at an activity sponsored by a public school, on a school bus or, if the fight occurs within one hour of the beginning or end of a school day, on his or her way to or from school; or (c) the student has a record of five suspensions from the school for any reason. For purposes of interpreting paragraph (c) of this \"habitual discipline problem\" statute, a student has been \"suspended\" if the school prohibits the student from attending school for three or more consecutive days, and requires a conference o r some other form of communication with the parent or guardian of the student before he/she is allowed to return to school. If a student is suspended for initiating his/her first fight of the school year, or if the student receives the first suspension of the school year, the school must provide written notice to the parent or guardian. The notice must contain descriptions and dates of acts committed, an explanation of when the student will be deemed a habitual discipline problem and that once deemed a hab itual disciplinary problem the student must be suspended/expelled for at least one semester, an explanation that a student with disabilities can be suspended if his/her behavior is not a manifestation of his/her disability, and an explanation about the opportunity to develop a behavior plan. Additionally, if a student commits an act which qualifies the student to be deemed a habitual disciplinary problem, at least seven days before the student is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem written notice must b e provided to the parent or guardian. The notice must contain a description and dates of qualifying acts, an explanation that the student must be suspended/expelled, an explanation that a student with disabilities can be suspended if his/her behavior is not a manifestation of his/her disability, and an explanation about the opportunity to develop a behavior plan. The statute says that a student may enter into one behavior plan per school year to avoid the designation of habitual discipl inary problem. For a student with a disability, behavioral intervention plans are developed based upon the student's unique needs and no arbitrary decision should be made limiting the development of behavioral intervention plans. Suspension and Expulsion Procedures Nevada law (NRS 392.466- 4675) requires a semester -long suspension/expulsion for first-time battery on an employee (causing bodily injury), sale or distribution of drugs, or possession of dangerous weapons, although the student may be placed in another 283Attachment\u0000 schoo l. Second occurrences require permanent expulsion, but the student must receive equivalent instruction or enroll in a program of independent study or a program of distance education outside the school. Nevada law requires a one -year suspension for first -time possession of a firearm or a dangerous weapon, although the student may be placed in another kind of school. For a second occurrence, the student must be permanently expelled from school, but the student must receive equivalent instruction or enroll in a program of independent study or a program of distance education outside the school. If a student is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem, the student must be suspended or expelled for at least one semester, during which time the student must receive equivalent instruction or enroll in a program of independent study or a program of distance education outside the school. Students are not to be suspended or expelled until they have been given notice of the charges, an explanation of the evidence , and an opportunity for a hearing. However, students who engage in the following behavior may be removed immediately after being given an explanation for the reasons for the removal and the pending proceedings for suspension/expulsion: a student who poses a c ontinuing danger to persons or property a student who poses an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process a student who is selling or distributing any controlled substances a student found in possession of a dangerous weapon The necessary proceedings must be conducted as soon as practicable after the student's removal. Board of Trustees Review Nevada law requires that the Board of Trustees review all permanent expulsions or suspension of students with disabilities fo r longer than 10 school days (NRS 392.467). Board of Trustees may grant authority to another person or entity to expel or suspend pupils (e.g., committee composed of trustees numbering less than the full board, or an appointed hearing panel composed of school administrators AGO, 97-21 (7-2- 1997)). Except for students found in possession of a firearm, any student in grades 1 -6 may be suspended or permanently expelled only after the Board of Trustees has reviewed the circumstances and approved this action. DEFINITIONS Controlled substance: means a drug or other substance identified under schedules I, II, III, IV, or V in section 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 USC 812(c)). Illegal drug: means a controlled substance, but does not include a controlled substance that is legally possessed or used under the supervision of a licensed health -care professional or that is legally possessed or used. Serious bodily injury: means bodily injury that involves a substantial risk of death extreme physical pain protracted and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty Weapon: means a weapon, device, instrument, material, or substance, animate or inanimate, that is used for, or is readily capable of, causing death or serious bodily injury, except that such term does not include a pocket knife with a blade of less than 2 inches in length. 284Attachment 22 Attachment A.8.12 GT Continuum of Service Flowchart Consultation Individualized Support Extracurricular Enrichment Differentiation of Instruction Cluster Grouping, Enrichment Currirulum Compacting, Accelerated /AP and Honors Courses 285Attachment 23 Attachment A.9.2 Pupil Record Retention Policy If a student is new to the Clark County School District, a cumulative record file folder is to be established for students in accordance with specifications detailed in the CCSD Student Accounting Manual.

Walker, Esq. Request for Information from Prospective Charter school Board Members and Members of Committee to For the Charter School (CFS) Governing a public charter school requires a commitment and responsibility. The governing board will be ultimately responsible for the sound education of all the children in the school and the use of public funds that the school receives. Your desire to serve on a charter school board or CFS indicates belief in and commitment to the quality public sc hools for all children. One of the components of the charter school application is to provide the s ponsor a sense of the board's capacity to govern. With that purpose in mind, each prospective board and CFS member should respond to this request for information. I. Background: 1.If true, please affirm that you will be at leas t eighteen years old by January 1 of the year in which the proposed char ter school would open. I am over the age of 18. 2.How did you become aware of the proposed ch arter school and the opp ortunity to serve as a member of its board? I am friends with Matthew Durham, one of the other board members. Matthew stated that the B oard was looking for a member with an accounting background. I have a Master's degree in accounting and I am a tax and estate attorney. I have also organized and advised other nonprofit organizations, such as private foundations. 3.Explain why you would like to serve on the board. I was excited to learn about this school and the opportunity that it may provid e to students. I am currently on several other nonprofit boards and this one sounded different and I like that I may be able to contribute both my legal and accountin g background to this organization. 4.Have your previously served on a board of a school district or a non-profit corporation (including the board of a paro chial or independent private school)? If so, describe any relevant experience. If you have not had a ny previous service, discuss why you wish to serve in this capacity. I have never served on the board of a school district, but I have been and am currently a board member for financial/professional organizations. I currently serve on the board of the Las Vegas Chapter of the Society for FinancialService Professionals (www.financialpro.org) and Gift Planning Advisors (www.gpa- nv.org). 5.What is your understanding of the appropriate role of a public charter school boardmember? My understanding of the role of a B oard Member is to oversee and govern the charter school and help ensure that it operates within the char ter that is granted and to help the school set and achieve goals, all with the end-goal of helping students learn and grow to their best potential. As the initia l board member charged with overseeing finance, I understand that my role on the board will be to help manage the intial financing of the school, setting up an initial budget to include locating aJason Walker Attachment 28 Attachment B.2.2 Committee members response to questionnaire 314Request for Information - Jason C. Walker, Esq. premises, furnishing and equipping the school , and making sure tha the school has the appropriate budget to be able to hire and main tain top-quality educators for the students of the school. 6.What relevant knowledge and experience will you bring to the board? My professional background as a tax and estate lawyer has allowed me to assist several clients with the formation of non-profit organizations ranging from private family foundations to private operating foundations with their ow n charitable purposes. My educational background (Master's of Accounting) combined with my legal background should help the board with financial decisions, setting an operating budget, and reviewing financial contracts. 7.Assuming the school is succe ssful, what is your image of how the school will look toward the end of its first year? Wh at will it be like after four years? I hope that the school is successful and that at the end of the first year we will be looking for additional teachers to offer additional courses and take in additional students with the goal of preparing for opening the \"high-school .\" After four years my hope is that the school will have its first graduating class of senior high school students and a strong reputation in the community for providin g a fun and challenging alternative to traditional middle and high school. II. Educational Philosophy 8.What is your understanding of the school's mission and/or philosophy? To prepare graduating students for college and after that, careers related to spor ts, such as sports medicine, media production, and sports marketing, entertainment, and sports management. The school will follow the well-respected philosophy of the three R's:Rigor, Relevance, and Relationships. 9.Are you familiar with the school's proposed educational program? How would you describe it? I am still learning more about the details of the educational program, but I understand that the sports theme will carry through as many facets of the experience as possible and even the curriculum may tie into sports when possible - for example, mathematics studies could use problems that relate to sp orts such as: determin ing the surface area of a baseball diamond; the circumference of a basketball; the speed of a race car; the angle of approach for a golf drive. I think for students that enjoy sports, this can help capture and keep their attention . 10.What are the characteristics of a successful school? What specific steps do you think the board will need to take in the first year or two to ensure the school is successful? I think we will measure success by the interest we can generate within the community which should translate to demand for students. Success will also be defined by whether we are improving students and we can compare student improvement to local standards. The first two years will be critical and we w ill need to generate community excitement and involvement.

I f more pupils apply for enrollment than the number of spaces which are available t he school shall use a lottery to determine who will be enrolled. SLAM NV will adopt the following lottery preferences (NRS 386.580): o A child of a person who is: employed by the school; or a member of the committee to form the school or the governing body. o Sibling of a pupil who is currently enrolled in the school; As a public school, we will not close, cap, delay, postpone or otherwise limit enrollment except as allowed by NAC 386.353. As stated in the Cover Sheet for our charter school application and in B.3 .8 of the application, we will not limit enrollment to a certain number of pupils or ratio of teachers to pupils, pursuant to NAC 386.353. For the situations identified below, only, our school will establish and advertise pre-enrollment window from February 1 to February 15 during which it will accept applications. The pre -enrollment process identifies pupils who are assured enrollment beginning 120 days before the date on which the charter school will open; approaching our first year of operation; when adding a new grade; and or annual enrollment in our school's lowest grade. We will announce and advertise these opening and closing dates of the pre-enrollment window to the community in which we plan to operate. The following are key points regarding how we will manage an enrollment window and select and enroll pupils from our school's enrollment waiting list: 1. If the number of applications received during an enrollment window does not exceed the number of spaces available, including by grade, all pupils who applied shall be enrolled in our school. 2. If the number of applications received during the window exceeds the number of spaces available, including by grade, all enrollment applications received during the window will be subject to the lottery. The lottery will be conducted immediately after the close of the enrollment window. 3. Pupils whose applications are not selected by the lottery, if they wish, will be placed on an enrollment waiting list in the order determined by the lottery . 335Attachment 31 Attachment B. 3.7 Lottery Description 4. Pupils who seek enrollment after the lottery in 2 and 3, above, is conducted (after the window closes) will be added to the enrollment waiting list, but are not immediately assigned an enrollment order number; instead, another lottery will be conducted only when all the pupils assigned enrollment order numbers by the first lottery have been enrolled in the school. 5. An enrolled pupil will not be required to re -enroll. That is, once a pupil has been enrolled, they will be able continue their schooling at the school. Our school may ask for some sort of assurance from a pupil that the pupil intends to return to the school for the next grade, but pupils will not be denied the opportunity to return to our school for the next grade level, once enrolled in the school. 6. Any pupil seeking enrollment but denied enrollment due to lack of space will be offered the opportunity to be added to an enrollment waiting list. 7. As space becomes available, pupils from the waiting list will be enrolled in the school. 8. The waiting list enrollment order will be determined by lottery. 9. A pupil seeking enrollment in a grade that is not full shall be enrolled immediately; the pupil's enrollment will not be delayed until some future time, including until a semester break or the next scho ol year. 10. A pupil who is the first on a waiting list shall be enrolled immediately upon the creation of space in the pupil's grade; the pupil's enrollment may not be delayed until some future time, including until a semester break or the next school year. 11. Our school will not \"close enrollment\" except as described in NAC 383.353. Enrollment is always \"open\" in that our school will always accept enrollment applications. Applications received after an enrollment window closes are placed on an enrollment waiting list if the school or grade is \"full\" per NAC 386.353. Pupils will be chosen for enrollment from the waiting list as described above. 12. The Committee to Form our Charter School includes a person who intends to enroll their child in the school; the same applies to our school's first governing body (board) which will be formed before the school's first enrollment will be determined. If/when we add new, higher grades, the pupils in our school's formerly highest grade will automatically be enrolled in the school's new next grade. 336M I L E I D Y S A N C H E Z 445 SW Eleven Street Miami, FL 331 30 (305) 970- 2659 miamiliysanchez@yahoo.com PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE Academica Corporation, Miami, Florida 06 /06 -Present Director of Community Relations Cooperating with local business partners and communities to promote awareness and involvement in creating successful public educational programs for over 100 charter s chool s Working in staff capacity with principals and personnel in schools supervising all aspects of charter school management and community relations including student activities and fundraising.

Throughout his tenure, Mr. T amargo worked as a sixth grade classroom teacher, a high school English teacher, a baseball coach, and a charter school principal. Mr. Tamargo began his teaching career in 1997, shortly after earning a Bachelor Degree in English Literature and a Minor in Secondary Education from the University of Miami University. A year later, he pursued graduate studies and earned his Master's Degree in Educational Leadership in 2001. In 2005, he was selected to be the principal of Academy of Arts and Minds, a charter high school in downtown Miami. Mr. Tamargo opened the school with 70 students its first year and rapidly grew it to 375 students. Under his direction, the school also increased in academic rigor and financial stability within its first three years of operation. In 2009, Mr. Tamargo accepted a position as Principal o f Mater Academy East Charter Middle- High School. He opened the new facility in Little Havana, a poverty -stricken urban community. The school's population has steadily grown by 100 students each year and it's expected to reach capacity in 2013 -14 with a current waiting list of 500 students. Under Mr. Tamargo's leadership, Mater Academy East moved from a \"C\" to an \"A\" rating under Florida's School Accountability Grading System. The school has raised the bar academically by offering Advanced Placement and Dual enrollment courses for students who lacked access to these options in neighboring schools. As a result, this Title I school graduated 88% of \"At Risk\" students in 2012, despite serving a population (79% Minority and 90% economically disadvantaged) statistically expected to underperform. The school was the National Silver Medalist for College Readiness by News Week and World Report and was also the first charter school in the nation to be acclaimed an Academy of Finance from the National Academy Foundation. Currently, 97% of Mater graduates are attending a college or university, while Mater's academic programs continue to provide students an opportunity for success at a collegiate level. Over the past four years, Mr. Tamargo has been instrumental in the planning, inception, and implementation of Mater's sister school, Sports Leadership and Management Academy (SLAM) Academy. This middle high career academy, opening in 2013 -14 in a new state -of- the-art facility, will provide even more opportunities for at risk students from the nearby low-income urban neighborhoods in Downtown Miami. As the principal of SLAM, through his experience, passion and commitment, Mr. Tamargo will continue the work of decreasing the achievement gap for minority and disadvantaged students in his community.

SLAM , Inc. - Contact is Rene Ruiz 604 NW 12 Ave Miami, FL 33136 Phone (305)326 -0003 ii. The decision to contract with an EMO The Committee to form SLAM NV believed that it would be in the best interest of the Committee to hire an experienced and successful management company to assist in the planning and creation of a new charter school. The Committee chose Academica because they have managed the creation of several successful Charter School models, including replication models already operating here in Nevada. In addition, the Committee feels that Academica's services in assisting the Board with financial management, financial oversight, board meeting management and statutory compliance will complete tasks that otherwise require the Board to hire additional staff. The Board has also elected to affiliate with SLAM , Inc. SLAM , Inc. is a school that serve s student populations with economically disadvantaged and limited English proficient learners . By replica ting their best practices and procedures, the school expects to attain improved educational results for these student populations . Additional information on SLAM , Inc. can be found in A.2.3. 355Attachment 3 4 Attachment B.3.1.2 Selection of EMO/model iii. Selection of the EMO Model The committee to form SLAM NV learned of Academica Nevada by speaking to other members of the charter school community in Nevada. Specifically, Rodger Fairless' wife, Renee Fairless , is now a principal at Mater Academy . Mater Academy currently contracts with Academica Nevada for mana gement services and M rs. Fairless was well acquainted with the personnel and service provided by Academica Nevada. The Committee to form then learned of the SLAM family of schools through Academica Nevada representatives. Upon learning of the Committee's goal to serve a student population at-risk of not graduating (A.7.1 and A.7.3), Academica Nevada recommended a partnership with SLAM to enable the new proposed school to draw from SLAM 's experience and knowledge in serving student populations with a high percentage of English language learners. The Committee then independently examined the SLAM student populations, academic performance, programs, and success and elected to partner with SLAM Academy, Inc. iv.

Reference Checks Matt Durham, the acting Chair of the Committee to Form SLAM of Nevada, was able to speak with two references in the process of examining Academica Nevada. Mr. Durham spo ke with Joani Williams, who is the Chairman of the Board of Doral Academy of Nevada. Mrs. Williams was on the Committee to Form Doral Academy, she worked with Academica through the charter process, and she has now worked with Academica for approximately f ive years. Ms. Williams said she is very impressed with Academica. She says they have been very supportive of the Board and they are very prompt in addressing the Board's needs and concerns. She said she would recommend Academica without hesitation. Mr. D urham also spoke with Gail Jefferson, who is the Principal of Summerset Sky Point Elementary School. Ms. Jefferson said she has been very pleased with Academica and the services it has provided. She pointed out that Academica has lots of resources and said its team in Las Vegas has grown a lot in the three years she has worked with them (which has resulted in even better services). Ms. Jefferson stated that she would definitely recommend Academica. Mr. Durham has attempted to contact others who have experience working with Academica and will continue to do so during the application process, and before any contract is signed . 357 L.L.

Management is responsible for the prep aration and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this in cludes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation a nd fair presentation of financia l statements that are free from material misstatement, whet her due to fraud or error. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of Amer ica and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit ev idence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial pos ition of the School as of June 30, 2013, and the results of its activ ities for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report October 29, 2013, on our consideration of the School's internal control over financ ial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grants. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be read in conjunction with this report in considering the results of our audit. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 360 Management's Discussion and Analysis is not a required part of the basic financial statements but is supplementary information required by the Governmental Accounting Standa rds Board. We have applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of management re garding the methods of measurement and presentation of the required and not required supplementary information. However, we did not audit th e information and express no opinion on it. L.L.

Overview of the Financial Statements This discussion and analysis ar e intended to serve as an intr oduction to the School's basic financial statements. The School's financial st atements for the year ended June 30, 2013 are presented in according with GASB Codifications Section 2200. The financial statements have three components, as defined and explained below. Government-Wide Financial Statements The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the School's finances, in a manner si milar to a private- sector business. The Statement of Net Assets presents information on all of th e School's assets and liabilities. The difference between the two is reports as net assets . Over time increases or decreases in net assets may serve as an indicator of whether th e financial position of th e School is improving or deteriorating. The Statement of Activities presents information on how the School's net assets changed during the fiscal year. All changes in net assets are reported when the underlyi ng event occurs without regard to the timing of related cash flows. Acco rdingly, revenues and expe nses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods. The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 8-9 of the attached Financial Statements. Fund Financial Statements A \"fund\" is a collection of related accounts grouped to maintain c ontrol over resources that have been segregated for specific activities, project or objectives. The School, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and report compliance with finance- related legal requirements. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 3624 All of the funds of the School are government funds. Governmental Funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statement. Governmental Fund fina ncial statements, however, focus on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources, as well as on the ba lances of spendable resources which are available at the end of the fiscal year . Such information may be used to evaluate a government's requirements for near-term financing. The Board of the School adopts an annual approp riated budget for its general fund. A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for the ge neral fund to demonstrat e compliance with the School's budget. The basic governmental fund financial statem ent can be found on page 11 of the attached Financial Statements. Notes to Financial Statements The notes to the financial statement provide add itional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the gove rnment-wide and fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 12-17 of this report. GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS As noted earlier, net assets may serve over tim e as a useful indicator of a charter school's financial position. In the case of the School , assets exceeded liabilities by $1,359,772 at the close of the fiscal year . A summary of the School's net a ssets as of June 30, 2013 is found on page 8 of the attached financial statements. At the end of the fiscal year, the School is able to report positive balances in total net assets. A summary and analysis of the School's revenues and expenses for the years ended June 30, 2013 is found on page 9 of the attached financial statements.

Accomplishments In 2012-2013, Somerset Academy of Las Vegas expanded to a total of 3 campuses, and expanded operations to a tota l enrollment of more than 1,700 students.

Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 3646 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT FUND As noted earlier, the School uses fund accountin g to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. Governmental Funds The focus of the School's governmental funds is to provide informa tion on near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the School's financing requirements. In particul ar, the unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government's net resources av ailable for spending at the end of the fiscal year. Most of the School's operations are funded in the General Fund. The ma jority of the General Fund revenues are distributed to the School by the Nevada Depart ment of Education through the Distributive School Account (DSA), which uses formulas to distribute state funds and an amount of local property taxes as estab lished by the Nevada Legislature. At the end of the fiscal year, the School's governmental general fund reported an ending fund balance of $1,359,772. These funds will be availa ble for the School's future ongoing operations. Capital Assets Pursuant to the Nevada Department of Edu cation, the capitalization threshold for assets purchased by the School is established at a value of $5,000.00. At this time, the School maintains no capital assets, as all facilities, ma terials, furniture, fixtur es and equipment were obtained through lease agreements and/or do not exceed the $5,000.00 capita lization threshold. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 3657 Governmental Fund Budget Analysis and Highlights Prior to the start of the School's fiscal year, the Board of the School adopted an annual budget.

Summary of significant accounting policies The financial statements of the Somerset Academy of Las Vegas (the \"School\") have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accep ted in the United States (GAAP) applicable to government units. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard-setting body for establishing governme ntal accounting and financ ial reporting principles. Reporting entity - Somerset Academy of Las Vegas is a \"ch arter school\", established in 2011 under Nevada Revised Statute 386.500. The School had three campus' during the year ended June 30, 2013, North Las Vegas and Emerson. The School's major operation is to offer an educational environment where learning is maximized through individual instru ction, interdisciplin ary projects and access to a full spectrum of technological resources for kindergarten th rough eighth grade in Southern Nevada. The School receives funding from state and government sources and must co mply with the requirements of these funding sources. However, the School is not incl uded in any other government al \"reporting entity,\" as defined in GASB pronouncements, since its Governing Body has decision-making authority, the power to designate management, the ability to significantly infl uence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters. Government-wide and fund financial statements - the government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net assets and the statement of activities) report in formation on all the nonfiduciary activities of the School. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these statements. The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segments are offset by program revenues. Direct expens es are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function. Program revenues include grants and contributi ons that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function. The major individual governmental funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements. Measurement focus and basis of accounting - The term, \"basis of accounting,\" refers to the method used for revenues and expenditure recognition in the accounts and repor ting in the financial statements and relates to the timing of the measurements made, regardless of the measurement focus applied. Under GAAP, all governmental funds are accounted us ing a modified accrual basis of accounting under which revenues are recognized when they become measurable and availabl e as net current assets. Expenditures are recognized generally under the modified accrual ba sis of accounting in use when the related fund liability is incurred. Government-wide Financial Statements . The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus. The government-wide financial statements are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded wh en earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred, regardless of when the related cash flows take pl ace. Non-exchange transactions, in which the School gives (or receives) value without directly receiving (or giving) equa l value in exchange, include grants and donations. Revenue from grants and donati ons are recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied. Governmental Fund Financial Statements . Governmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recognized when measurable and available. The School considers all revenues reported in the governmental funds to be available if the revenues are collected within sixty days after year-end. These could include federal, State, and county grants, and some charges for servi ces. Expenditures are recorded when the related fund liability is incurred, except for principal and interest on general long-term debt, claims and judgments, and compensated absences, which are recognized as expenditure s to the extent they have matured. General capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Proceeds of general long-term debt and acquisitions under capital leases are re ported as other financing sources. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 371SOMERSET ACADEMY OF LAS VEGAS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 13 1. Summary of significant accounting policies Measurement focus and basis of accounting (continued) The School has the following fund categories (furt her divided by fund ty pe) and account groups: General Fund - The General Fund is the general operating fund fo r the School. It is used to account for all financial resources not accounted in other funds. Special Education Fund - The special education fund is used to account for revenues received and expenditures made to fund special education program . Financing is provided through the Clark County School District funded by the U.S. Department of Education. Student Activities Fund - The Student Activities Fund is used to account for student fundraising activities. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the School's policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricte d resources as they are needed. Under the terms of grant agreements, the School funds certain programs by a combination of specific cost-reimbursement grants and general revenues. Thus, when program expenses are incurred, there are both restricted and unrestricted net assets available to fina nce the program. It is the School's policy to first apply cost-reimbursement grant resources to such programs, and then general revenues. All governmental and business-type activities and enterpri se funds of the School follow FASB Statements and Interpretations issued on or before November 30, 1989, Accounting Principles Board Opinions, and Accounting Research Bulletins, unless those pronouncements conflict with GASB pronouncements. Cash -- The School considers cash equivalent s to be those securities with an original maturity of three months or less. Capital assets - The School's capital assets are recorded at hist orical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated assets are listed at their estimated fair value at the date of donation. The total of these estimates is not considered large enough that any errors would be material when capital assets are considered as a whole. It is the policy of the School to capitalize all capital assets costing more than $5,000 with an estimated useful life of three or more years. This policy is also in line with the Nevada Department of Education mandated threshold for capitalization. Improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related capital assets. All depreciable assets are depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation over the assets' useful lives. The cost of normal mainte nance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend asset lives are not capitalized.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Receivables and payables - Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements outstanding at the end of the fiscal year are referred to as either \"due to /from other funds\" (i.e., the non-current portion of interfund loans). All other outstanding balan ces between funds are reported as \"due to/from other funds.\" Compensated Absences - It is the School's policy to permit empl oyees to accumulate an unlimited number of sick days; however, accumulated sick days do not vest under the School's policy, therefore, a liability for unused sick days is not recorded in the financial statements. Use of Estimates - The School has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent a ssets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principl es generally accepted in the United Stat es of America. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Net assets/ Fund balances - In March 2009, the GASB issued Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund-type defi nitions. The objective of this statement is to enhance the usefulness of fund balance information by providing clearer fund balance classi fications that can be more consistently applied and by clarifying the existing government al fund-type definitions. This st atement establishes fund balance classifications that comprise a hierarchy based primarily on the extent to which a government is bound to observe constraints imposed on the use of the resources reported in governmental funds. Under this standard, the fund balance classifications of reserved, designated, and unreserved/ undesignated were replaced with five new classifications - nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned. Nonspendable fund balance represents amounts that are not in a spendable form. The nonspendable fund balance represents inventories and prepaid items. Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are legally restricted by outside parties for a specific purpose (such as debt covenants, grant requirements, donor requirements, or other governments) or are restricted by law (constitutionally or by enabling legislation). Committed fund balance represents funds formally set aside by the governing body for a particular purpose. The use of committed funds woul d be approved by resolution. Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are constr ained by the expressed intent to use resources for specific purposes that do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed. Intent can be stipulated by the governing body or by an official to whom that authority has been given by the governing body. Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification of the General Fund. Only the General Fund may report a positive unassigned fund balance. Other governmental f unds would report any negative residual fund balance as unassigned. The School has no restricted fund balances at year ended June 30, 2013. 2. Stewardship, compliance and accountability Budgetary information - The School is required by the State of Nevada Department of Education (Department) to adopt a final budget no later than J une 8 of each year under NAC 386.370.

The agreement between the School and Academica Corporation calls for a fee of $450 per full time equivalent (FTE) student per year. The agreement is with Somerset Academy of Las Vegas for a period of two years, through July 1, 2013, and unless terminated by the board shall be renewed along with any renewals to the charter agreement. The agreement with Academica Corporation was assigned to Academica Nevada, LLC. During the year ended June 30, 2013, the School incurred $754,110 in management fees. The School also has a note payable due to Academica totaling $18,286, which accrues inte rest at 5% maturing in December 2013. 6. Net asset and Fund balance restatement Subsequent to issuance of the School 's June 30, 2012 financial statements, information was received by the School's management, which would allow for the reclassification of a capital lease for a long-term property lease for the North Las Vegas campus to an operating l ease (see Note 4). The restatement resulted in removal of the capital lease asset and liability balances of $4,099,196 and $4,298,160, respectively. June 30, 2012 year ended amortization expense of $215, 747 was removed and lease expense was increased by $7,780 to account for the reclassification of the lease. This resulted in a June 30, 2012 change in Net asset and Fund balance of $207,967. 7. Defined benefit pension plan The School is a public employer participating in the Public Employees Retirement System of the State of Nevada (PERS), a defined benefit cost-sharing multiple-employer progr am, and all full-time teachers are covered under the system. The School has no liability for unfunded obligations of the system as provided by NRS 286.110. Benefits, as required by statute, ar e determined by the number of years of accredited service at the time of retirement and the member's highest average compensation in any 36 consecutive months. Benefit payments to which participants may be entitled unde r the plan include pension benef its, disability benefits, and death benefits. Monthly benefit allowances for regular members are com puted at 2.5% for each year of service earned before July 1, 2001 and 2.67% for each year of service earned after July 1, 2001 of average compensation (36 consecutive months of highest compensation) with a ceiling of not more than 75% of the average compensation. PERS offers several alternatives to the unmodified service retirement allowance which, in general, allows the retired employ ee to accept a reduced service retiremen t allowance payable monthly during the employee's life and various optional monthly payments to a named beneficiary after the employee's death. Regular members are eligible for retirement benefits at age 65 with 5 years of servi ce, at age 60 with 10 years of service, or at any age with 30 years of service. A member who retires on or after July 1, 1977, or is an active member whose effective date of membership is before July 1, 1977, or is an active member whose effective date of membership is before July 1, 1985, and who has 36 years of service is entitled to a benefit of up to 90% of his/her average compensation. When members are eligible for the earlier retirement due to the increased services years, the ceiling limitation on monthly benefit allowances increases from the normal 75% to a maximum of 90% of average compensation. Regular members become fully vested as to benefits upon completion of 5 years of service. Benefits are estab lished by state statute and provisions may only be amended through legislation.

We conducted our audit in accordance with ge nerally accepted auditing sta ndards and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the School's financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grants, noncompliance with which could have a dir ect and material effect on the determin ation of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . In planning and performing our audit, we considered the Sc hool's internal control over financial reporting in order to determine our auditing procedures to express our opinion on th e financial statements and not to provide assurance on the internal control over financial reporting. Our considerati on of the internal control over financial reporting would not necessarily disclose all matters in the internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses. A material weakness is a condition in which the design or operati on of one or more of the internal control components does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions. We noted no matters involving internal control over financial reporting and its operation that we consider to be a material weakness. This report is intended for the information of management a nd state and federal awarding agencies and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. L.L.

Management is responsible for the prep aration and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this in cludes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation a nd fair presentation of financia l statements that are free from material misstatement, whet her due to fraud or error. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of Amer ica and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit ev idence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial pos ition of the School as of June 30, 2013, and the results of its activ ities for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report October 29, 2013, on our consideration of the School's internal control over financ ial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grants. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be read in conjunction with this report in considering the results of our audit.

Financial Highlights 1. The assets of the Charter School exceed ed its liabilities at June 30, 2013 by $737,776. 2. At year-end, the School had current assets on hand of $1,114,206. 3. The School's current assets less current lia bilities of $376,430 resulted in a working capital balance of $737,776. Overview of the Financial Statements This discussion and analysis ar e intended to serve as an intr oduction to the School's basic financial statements. The School's financial st atements for the year ended June 30, 2013 are presented in according with GASB Codifications Section 2200. The financial statements have three components, as defined and explained below. Government-Wide Financial Statements The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the School's finances, in a manner si milar to a private- sector business. The Statement of Net Assets presents information on all of th e School's assets and liabilities. The difference between the two is reports as net assets . Over time increases or decreases in net assets may serve as an indicator of whether th e financial position of th e School is improving or deteriorating. The Statement of Activities presents information on how the School's net assets changed during the fiscal year. All changes in net assets are reported when the underlyi ng event occurs without regard to the timing of related cash flows. Acco rdingly, revenues and expe nses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods. The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 8-9 of the attached Financial Statements. Fund Financial Statements A \"fund\" is a collection of related accounts grouped to maintain c ontrol over resources that have been segregated for specific activities, project or objectives. The School, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and report compliance with finance- related legal requirements. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 3824 All of the funds of the School are government funds. Governmental Funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statement. Governmental Fund fina ncial statements, however, focus on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources, as well as on the ba lances of spendable resources which are available at the end of the fiscal year . Such information may be used to evaluate a government's requirements for near-term financing. The Board of the School adopts an annual approp riated budget for its general fund. A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for the ge neral fund to demonstrat e compliance with the School's budget. The basic governmental fund financial statem ent can be found on page 11 of the attached Financial Statements. Notes to Financial Statements The notes to the financial statement provide add itional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the gove rnment-wide and fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 12-16 of this report. GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS As noted earlier, net assets may serve over tim e as a useful indicator of a charter school's financial position. In the case of the School, assets exceeded liabilities by $737,776 at the close of the fiscal year. A summary of the School's net assets as of June 30, 2013 is found on page 8 of the attached financial statements. At the end of the fiscal year, the School is able to report positive balances in total net assets. A summary and analysis of the School's revenues and expenses for the years ended June 30, 2013 is found on page 9 of the attached financial statements. State Funding Levels Pinecrest Academy's State appropriated revenu es are based on a per student funding amount of $6,296.00 per student for the 2012-2013 school year. Additional funding for students receiving Special Education services was received totaling $76,620. School Location and Lease of Facilities Pinecrest Academy leases one facility for sc hool operations located at 1360 S. Boulder Hwy. Henderson, NV 89015. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 3835 Capital Improvement Requirements The School maintains a continuous capital impr ovements program to enhance facilities and update fixtures and equipment as required. Accomplishments In 2012-2013, Pinecrest Academy of Nevada bega n operations as a bran d new charter school with a strong opening enrollment of more than 700 students in grades Kindergarten through Seven. Pinecrest Academy quickly developed into a close-knit and supportive school community. Pinecrest Academy participated in various commun ity service projects, be nefiting charities such as victims of Hurricane Sandy and Four Square Community Food bank. The School partnered with Nellis Air Force Base to participate in and learn about the Missing Man Ceremony held to honor fallen soldiers. In addition, the School community organized nu merous school fundraisers including the Fall Festival/Trunk or Treat, Parent Break fasts, and Scholastic Book Fairs. Pinecrest Academy faculty were recognized by local media, including founding Board Member Leroy Chase being specially rec ognized by one local news agency. Pinecrest Academy students participated in vari ous clubs and activities, including Elementary Honor Society, Junior Honor Society, Art Club, Elementary and Middle School Choirs, Middle School Semi-Formal Dance at Lake Las Vegas, Recycling Club, Basketball, and a school-wide Talent Show. Through these activities, Pinecr est Academy students participated in various performances and competitions, including the UNLV Science Fair, Green Valley Choir Invitational, Destination Imagination, Math Counts and the Boys and Girls Club Basketball tournament. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 3846 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT FUND As noted earlier, the School uses fund accountin g to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. Governmental Funds The focus of the School's governmental funds is to provide informa tion on near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the School's financing requirements. In particul ar, the unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government's net resources av ailable for spending at the end of the fiscal year. Most of the School's operations are funded in the General Fund. The ma jority of the General Fund revenues are distributed to the School by the Nevada Depart ment of Education through the Distributive School Account (DSA), which uses formulas to distribute state funds and an amount of local property taxes as estab lished by the Nevada Legislature. At the end of the fiscal year, the School's governmental general fund reported an ending fund balance of $737,776. These funds will be available for the School's future ongoing operations. Capital Assets Pursuant to the Nevada Department of Edu cation, the capitalization threshold for assets purchased by the School is established at a value of $5,000.00. At this time, the School maintains no capital assets, as all facilities, ma terials, furniture, fixtur es and equipment were obtained through lease agreements and/or do not exceed the $5,000.00 capita lization threshold. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 3857 Governmental Fund Budget Analysis and Highlights Prior to the start of the School's fiscal year, the Board of the School adopted an annual budget. A budgetary comparison statement has been provid ed for the governmental funds to demonstrate compliance with the School's budget.

Summary of significant accounting policies The financial statements of the Pinecrest Academy of Neva da (the \"School\") have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the Un ited States (GAAP) applicable to government units. The Governmental Accounting Standa rds Board (GASB) is the accepted st andard-setting body for establishing governmental accounti ng and financial re porting principles. Reporting entity - Pinecrest Academy of Nevada is a \"charter school\", established in 2012 under Nevada Revised Statute 386.500. The School's major operation is to offer an educational environment where learning is maximized through individual inst ruction, interdiscip linary projects and access to a full spectrum of technological resources for kindergarten th rough eighth grade in Southern Nevada. The School receives funding from state and government sources and must co mply with the requirements of these funding sources. However, the School is not incl uded in any other government al \"reporting entity,\" as defined in GASB pronouncements, since its Governing Body has decision-making authority, the power to designate management, the ability to significantly infl uence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters. Government-wide and fund financial statements - the government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net assets and the statement of activities) report in formation on all the nonfiduciary activities of the School. For the most part, the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these statements. The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segments are offset by program revenues. Direct expens es are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function. Program revenues include grants and contributi ons that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function. The major individual governmental funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements. Measurement focus and basis of accounting - The term, \"basis of accounting,\" refers to the method used for revenues and expenditure recognition in the accounts and repor ting in the financial statements and relates to the timing of the measurements made, regardless of the measurement focus applied. Under GAAP, all governmental funds are accounted us ing a modified accrual basis of accounting under which revenues are recognized when they become measurable and availabl e as net current assets. Expenditures are recognized generally under the modified accrual ba sis of accounting in use when the related fund liability is incurred. Government-wide Financial Statements . The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus. The government-wide financial statements are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded wh en earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred, regardless of when the related cash flows take pl ace. Non-exchange transactions, in which the School gives (or receives) value without directly receiving (or giving) equa l value in exchange, include grants and donations. Revenue from grants and donati ons are recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied. Governmental Fund Financial Statements . Governmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recognized when measurable and available. The School considers all revenues reported in the governmental funds to be available if the revenues are collected within sixty days after year-end. These could include federal, State, and county grants, and some charges for servi ces. Expenditures are recorded when the related fund liability is incurred, except for principal and interest on general long-term debt, claims and judgments, and compensated absences, which are recognized as expenditure s to the extent they have matured. General capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Proceeds of general long-term debt and acquisitions under capital leases are re ported as other financing sources. Attachment 36 Attachment B.3.1.4 Financial performance of EMO/model 391PINECREST ACADEMY OF NEVADA NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 13 1. Summary of significant accounting policies Measurement focus and basis of accounting (continued) The School has the following fund categories (furt her divided by fund ty pe) and account groups: General Fund - The General Fund is the general operating fund fo r the School. It is used to account for all financial resources not accounted in other funds. Special Education Fund - The special education fund is used to account for revenues received and expenditures made to fund special education program . Financing is provided through the Clark County School District funded by the U.S. Department of Education. Student Activities Fund - The Student Activities Fund is used to account for student fundraising activities. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the School's policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricte d resources as they are needed. Under the terms of grant agreements, the School funds certain programs by a combination of specific cost-reimbursement grants and general revenues. Thus, when program expenses are incurred, there are both restricted and unrestricted net assets available to fina nce the program. It is the School's policy to first apply cost-reimbursement grant resources to such programs, and then general revenues. All governmental and business-type activities and enterpri se funds of the School follow FASB Statements and Interpretations issued on or before November 30, 1989, Accounting Principles Board Opinions, and Accounting Research Bulletins, unless those pronouncements conflict with GASB pronouncements. Cash -- The School considers cash equivalent s to be those securities with an original maturity of three months or less. Capital assets - The School's capital assets are recorded at hist orical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated assets are listed at their estimated fair value at the date of donation. The total of these estimates is not considered large enough that any errors would be material when capital assets are considered as a whole. It is the policy of the School to capitalize all capital assets costing more than $5,000 with an estimated useful life of three or more years. This policy is also in line with the Nevada Department of Education mandated threshold for capitalization. Improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related capital assets. All depreciable assets are depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation over the assets' useful lives. The cost of normal mainte nance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend asset lives are not capitalized.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Receivables and payables - Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing arrangements outstanding at the end of the fiscal year are referred to as either \"due to /from other funds\" (i.e., the non-current portion of interfund loans). All other outstanding balan ces between funds are reported as \"due to/from other funds.\" Compensated Absences - It is the School's policy to permit empl oyees to accumulate an unlimited number of sick days; however, accumulated sick days do not vest under the School's policy, therefore, a liability for unused sick days is not recorded in the financial statements. Use of Estimates - The School has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent a ssets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principl es generally accepted in the United Stat es of America. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Net assets/ Fund balances - In March 2009, the GASB issued Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund-type defi nitions. The objective of this statement is to enhance the usefulness of fund balance information by providing clearer fund balance classi fications that can be more consistently applied and by clarifying the existing government al fund-type definitions. This st atement establishes fund balance classifications that comprise a hierarchy based primarily on the extent to which a government is bound to observe constraints imposed on the use of the resources reported in governmental funds. Under this standard, the fund balance classifications of reserved, designated, and unreserved/ undesignated were replaced with five new classifications - nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned. Nonspendable fund balance represents amounts that are not in a spendable form. The nonspendable fund balance represents inventories and prepaid items. Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are legally restricted by outside parties for a specific purpose (such as debt covenants, grant requirements, donor requirements, or other governments) or are restricted by law (constitutionally or by enabling legislation). Committed fund balance represents funds formally set aside by the governing body for a particular purpose. The use of committed funds woul d be approved by resolution. Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are constr ained by the expressed intent to use resources for specific purposes that do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed. Intent can be stipulated by the governing body or by an official to whom that authority has been given by the governing body. Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification of the General Fund. Only the General Fund may report a positive unassigned fund balance. Other governmental f unds would report any negative residual fund balance as unassigned. The School has no restricted fund balances at year ended June 30, 2013. 2. Stewardship, compliance and accountability Budgetary information - The School is required by the State of Nevada Department of Education (Department) to adopt a final budget no later than J une 8 of each year under NAC 386.370.

Cash The Company maintains cash balances at a financial institution with accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. As of June 30, 2013, the Company's uninsured cash balance totaled $691,615. 4. Operating leases In May 2012, the School entered into a lease for the use of the buildings and related property with School Development South Boulder, LLC to lease space for a period of 20 y ears, expiring on July 31, 2032. Monthly payments were $57,990 for the year ended June 30, 2013, which was net of a monthly discount $9,665. Monthly payments increase to $61,856 for the year ended June 30, 2014, which is net of a discount of $5,799. Monthly payments then increase to $67,655 in the third lease year ended June 30, 2015. Every year thereafter the monthly payment increases by the Consumer Price Index or 3% whichever is greater. In December 2012, the School entered into a lease agr eement with a financial in stitution for the use of furniture, equipment, textbooks, software and computers. The lease is payable in 47 monthly payments of $11,845 and in December 2016 a balloon payment of $39,056. The School has entered into various equipment leases with varying monthly payments ranging from $96 to $1,425 monthly having various matu rities through June 2017. Lease expense totaled $546,671 for the year ended June 30, 2013. Future minimum lease payments are as follows: Years Ending June 30, Amount 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter $ 888,516 958,104 LLC (\"Academica\"), a professi onal charter school management company, provides management and administrative servi ces to the School including, but not limited to, facility design, staffing recommendations, human resource coordination, regulatory compliance, legal and corporate upkeep, maintenance of the books and records, bookkeeping, budgeting and financial reporting. The agreement between the School and Academica Corporation calls for a fee of $450 per full time equivalent (FTE) student per year. The agreement is with Pinecrest Academy of Nevada for a period of two years, through July 31, 2014, and unless terminated by the board shall be renewed along with any renewals to the charter agreement.

Defined benefit pension plan The School is a public employer participating in the Public Employees Retirement System of the State of Nevada (PERS), a defined benefit cost-sharing multiple-employer progr am, and all full-time teachers are covered under the system. The School has no liability for unfunded obligations of the system as provided by NRS 286.110. Benefits, as required by statute, ar e determined by the number of years of accredited service at the time of retirement and the member's highest average compensation in any 36 consecutive months. Benefit payments to which participants may be entitled unde r the plan include pension benef its, disability benefits, and death benefits. Monthly benefit allowances for regular members are com puted at 2.5% for each year of service earned before July 1, 2001 and 2.67% for each year of service earned after July 1, 2001 of average compensation (36 consecutive months of highest compensation) with a ceiling of not more than 75% of the average compensation. PERS offers several alternatives to the unmodified service retirement allowance which, in general, allows the retired employ ee to accept a reduced service retiremen t allowance payable monthly during the employee's life and various optional monthly payments to a named beneficiary after the employee's death. Regular members are eligible for retirement benefits at age 65 with 5 years of servi ce, at age 60 with 10 years of service, or at any age with 30 years of service. A member who retires on or after July 1, 1977, or is an active member whose effective date of membership is before July 1, 1977, or is an active member whose effective date of membership is before July 1, 1985, and who has 36 years of service is entitled to a benefit of up to 90% of his/her average compensation. When members are eligible for the earlier retirement due to the increased services years, the ceiling limitation on monthly benefit allowances increases from the normal 75% to a maximum of 90% of average compensation. Regular members become fully vested as to benefits upon completion of 5 years of service. Benefits are estab lished by state statute and provisions may only be amended through legislation. Member contribution rates, which are actuarially determined, are established by NRS 286.421 for public employees enrolled in the contribution plan. Two contribution plans are offered to eligible employees, the employee/employer contribution plan and the employer-pay contribution plan. The employee/employer plan increases the employee's salary by 13.1097%. A contribution of 12.25% is deducted from the employee and a matching contribution of 12.25% is paid by the employer. The employer-pay contribution plan requires an employer paid contribution rate of 23.75% on a lower sala ry schedule. The School's contributions to the plan for the year ended June 30, 2013 was $240,057. PERS issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information. The report may be obtained by calling 775-687-4200. 7. Compliance with Nevada revised st atutes and Nevada Administrative code The School conformed to all significant statutory constraints on the financial administration during the fiscal year.

We conducted our audit in accordance with gene rally accepted aud iting standards and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the School's financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grants, noncompliance with which could have a dir ect and material effect on the determin ation of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . In planning and performing our audit, we considered the Sc hool's internal control over financial reporting in order to determine our auditing procedures to express our opinion on th e financial statements and not to provide assurance on the internal control over financial reporting. Our considerati on of the internal control over financial reporting would not necessarily disclose all matters in the internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses. A material weakness is a condition in which the design or operati on of one or more of the internal control components does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions. We noted no matters involving internal control over financial reporting and its operation that we consider to be a material weakness. This report is intended for the information of management a nd state and federal awarding agencies and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties. L.L.

The school will affilia te with SLAM , Inc. to provide the following servic es: On site pri ncipal training and prof essional development; On site teacher training and prof essio nal development , including professional development on: 1) SLAM Resource Manual for Thematic Lessons , 2) professional development on creation of Them atic Lessons, 3) Positive Behavioral Support, 4) professional development on the Three R's Classroom critique and assessment ; Technology training ; and Help attain a ccreditatio n. None of the servi ces provid ed by SLAM , Inc. will overlap those provided by Academica Nevada. iii. Oversight and Evaluation of the EMO The board expects Academica Nevada to perform each of the specific duties of the contract. Academica 399Attachment 3 8 Attachment B.3.1.6 Organizational Structure Nevada is expect ed to work in such a manner that school's annual financial audits do not have any material deficiencies. The board further expect s Academica Nevada to guide the school to a surplus of not less than 5% of revenues. All state reports must be responded to in a timely manner and to the expectations of the specific state agencies. They should work in a manner that is supportive and allows the principals to focus on educational goals. The principals shoul d be able to discuss and get immediate advice on day to day operational issues. The board expects SLAM , Inc. to provide regular and effective professional development resources which result in improved instruction and academic performance, as measured by the administrator's teacher evaluations and the student assessments set forth in Part A of this application. We expect SLAM , Inc. to successfully assist in completing the accreditation process. We expect SLAM , Inc. to work closely with the principal and instructors in developing open and ongoing communication which includes assistance in problem solving, su ccessful planning strategies, and shared technology programs and training. iv. Compensation Structure and Payment Schedule The fee that Aca demica Neva da charges is per pupil bas ed. As the nu mber of students enrolled increases, Academic a's serv ices necessar ily increase as well. For exam ple, a larger stud ent body requir es a larger facility and a consequential increase in facilities m anagement servic es. A large r student body requir es more staff and an increase in Hum an Resources rela ted servi ces. A lar ger student body r equires more equi pment and fixtures w hich create s an increase in pro curement, budg et mana geme nt and bookkee ping servi ces. As a result, bas ing a fee on a fixe d per pupil charge is \"attr ibutable to the actu al service s provid ed\" and compli ant w ith State law. Furthermore, since the fee is n ot a percentage of income, the fe e does not increase wi th any increase in school funding w hich may be pass ed by th e state legislature. Finally, the Aca demica cont ract co ntains a provision that allows the fee to be ad justed if the school is facing f inancial hardship. SLAM , Inc., charges a fee 1% of annual revenues in exchange for the support services detailed above and the us e of the SLAM name and logo. The SLAM fees will support the staff travel and materials necessary to provide the professional development services and accreditation support provided for in the services agreement. v. Financial Responsibilities of Governing Board and EMO 400Attachment 3 8 Attachment B.3.1.6 Organizational Structure It is the responsibility o f Academica Nevada to provide accurate financial projections, qualified and experienced financial staff to maintain school books and records, work with the school administrator to propose school budgets, and assist the board in the completion of the annual financial audit.

Response and Follow -Up to a Traumatic Crisis 30 514Each crisis in the life of a child offers learning opportunities that may never come again. Instead of viewing crisis intervention as an extra school duty, it can be viewed as a special opportunity for teaching. Crisis situations, traumatic events and sudden death are but few of the situations that increasingly need to be dealt within our schools. As these traumatic losses and events become more frequent in our society, there is a need for a written plan and procedure to guide school personnel in responding immediately and effectively when these events occur. A traumatic event can overwhelm the resources of an individual school, yet an effective response demands the collective and coordinated services of both school personnel and community resources. Response to Traumatic Event - Day One Once a traumatic situation occurs there are certai n steps that need to be taken. The following items are important to think about during crisis situations : 1. Determine if additional assistance is needed (i.e. community agencies); the Crisis Response Team will ask for assistance from outside agencies . 2. Decide what the school actions and audience messages will be. 3. Provide information to teachers and let them know what is expected of them . 4. If needed, determine the location of a crisis center at the school; inform staff of the location of the center and how to refer students to the center. 5. Determine how students will be informed about a crisis situation, if it does n ot immediately affect the whole school (i.e. by school-wide announcement, courier hand deliver to classrooms, etc.). 6. Identify students and staff considered to be high risk, due to the nature of the crisis (siblings, boy or girl friends, close friends, othe r recent at -risk students, team members, etc.). Ask staff to assist in monitoring students . 7. Ask staff to continue monitoring all students. 8. Determine need for a parent and community meeting. 9. If appropriate, assign a school liaison to the family. 10. Determine whether counselors or Crisis Response Team members need to meet with any particular classes or groups . 11. Continue with school classes as scheduled with class procedures as normal as possible. 12. Determine if there is a need for a letter to go home informing parents of the situation . 13. Determine whether any other school may be impacted and establish contact with that school (consider siblings, boy or girl friends, those who recently attended another school, etc.). Response to Traumatic Event - Days Two through Fiv e 1. School administration and district Crisis Response Team continues to meet and monitor staff and students. 2. Review status of day one and determine the need for follow-up. 3. Consider allowing only staff to answer the phone for at least days one through five 31 5154. Remind staff to continue to help identify and monitor high-risk students and fellow staff members . 5. Determine whether staff or students need to be referred for professional assistance. Work with parents. 6. If step has not already been taken, re- evaluate need for evening meeting for parents and community. 7. Take requests for school assembly and/or memorials for lost students or staff members under consideration. Make no commitment. 8. Inquire about funeral arrangements or hospital visits and the family's desire for school/student involvement. 9. Inform staff that the Crisis Response Team members are available to provide consultation, direct assistance to class, and/or information and suggestions for working with students and class. 10. Continue follow-up and monitoring of student, school and community environment. Response to Traumatic Event - One to Six Weeks after the Event 1. Have counselors and/or nurses continue to monitor and/or see high-risk students. 2. Continue to ask staff for assistance in monitoring students and sta ff who were affected by the crisis. Determine need for developing individual student plans. 3. Maintain contact with family. Work with any outside therapists, and/or assist with outside referral . 4.
