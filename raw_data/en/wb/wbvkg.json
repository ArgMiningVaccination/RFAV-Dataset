Appointments are recommended. We accept walk-ins, but availability is not guaranteed. [Click the location](#locations)you would like to visit below (each location is open at different times). - Fill out the registration form. If registering at South Madison, East Washington, or the libraries, click on the vaccine you need and then select your appointment time. - Get vaccinated! I'm making an appointment for more than one person. If you are making appointments for your child, you should make an appointment for each recipient. For example, if you and your two kids are all getting vaccinated, make three separate appointments. You can use the same phone and email address for all appointments, but please use different names for each appointment. Vaccination Locations Note: all these sites are walk in clinics.
