While some progress has been made and strategiessuch as protected areas have been successful in preserving biodiversity in some places,new threats are arising. None of these threats is as great as global climate change andnone will have such large implications for the way natural resource managers plan andimplement conservation strategies. While global climate change is seemingly difficult to understand and plan for, planning is essential, as the conservation approaches of the past may not work in an ever-changingwarmer world. New strategies, led by deep cuts in the heat-trapping gases that causes climate change, predominately carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, may atleast buy some time for ecosystems to adapt in the years and decades ahead. However, ifCO 2emissions are not reduced quickly and deeply, some of those treasured ecosystems will not survive. Climate change is happening now and nature is experiencing its impacts first. Whether one looks at coral reefs, mangroves, arctic areas or montane regions, climate changeposes a complex and bewildering array of problems for ecosystems. The key question is,what can be done\u2014in addition to the rapid reduction of CO 2emissions now\u2014to in- crease the resiliency of these ecosystems to climate change? WWF compiled \"Buying Time: A User's Manual for Building Resistance and Re- silience to Climate Change in Natural Systems\" for natural resource managers who areready to confront the impacts of climate change. While far from comprehensive, thismanual brings together assessments and potential initial adaptation strategies for vari-ous biomes. Written by experts, the manual addresses all of the major biomes with practical ideas of how to begin increasing the resiliency of ecosystems and plan our protected areasin response to the threat of climate change. Some of these strategies are in line withthe conservation strategies we have been working on for years\u2014reducing fragmenta-tion, building corridors, reducing threats, and increasing resiliency in general. Natural FOREWORD BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUALresource managers in the field must begin planning to buy time for these biomes while the world works to switch from coal to clean power, a key strategy to reduce the causesof climate change. Looking at the models and gathering empirical evidence, WWF is recommending that natural resource managers start now to build climate change adaptation strategies intotheir preservation philosophies and plans. This manual is a first step to assist managersin doing so. While testing and implementing these new conservation strategies, managers should also communicate the threat that climate change poses to their biome to local, regionaland national authorities. Resource managers have an important role to play in the cli-mate change debate by using examples of changes seen in their regions as indicators ofthe need for rapid and deep cuts in CO 2emissions. Jennifer Morgan Director, WWF Climate Change ProgramWWF 8Building Resistance and Resilience to Climate Change Lara Hansen 1and Jennifer Biringer 2 1WWF Climate Change Program 2WWF Global Forest Program A VAST ARRAY OF SCIENTIFIC literature now makes it abundantly clear that the climate is changing and ecosystems are being affected by these changes. Much asawareness has been raised about invasive species, environmental contaminants, altered hydrology, and habitat fragmentation, conservation practitioners must now address cli-mate change. This manual aims to assist natural resource and protected area managersas they begin to consider how to respond to this growing threat. The need to respond couldn't be clearer; effects of climate change are now visible around the world. This year two large-scale studies demonstrated a global ecological fingerprintof climate change. To resolve differences between economists and biologists over thestrength of climate change effects in natural systems, Parmesan and Yohe (2003) ana-lyzed data on more than 1700 species to show with a \"very high confidence\" level (Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change definition) that climate change has already al-tered range boundaries and phenology. A separate study using data from 143 studiesfound that 80% of species studied showed trait changes consistent with climate change-driven predictions (Root et al., 2003). In each of the biomes discussed in this manual there are examples of specific climate-re- lated changes. The thickness and extent of arctic sea ice has reduced dramatically; in 2002ice coverage was the smallest it has been since satellite records began (Serreze et al.,2003). Coral bleaching has drastically changed some reef communities and while bleach-ing was once a rare and localized occurrence it is now a global phenomenon (Glynn, 1993;Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Montane glaciers are shrinking around the world, and rates of re-treat are generally accelerating (Haeberli et al., 1999). Increases in surface water tempera-tures in Lake Tanganyika, a deep tropical lake in East Africa, have reduced annual mixing,causing nutrient depletion in the upper layers of the lake and have reduced primary pro-ductivity by 70% since 1975 (Verburg et al., 2003). In the highland rainforests of Mon-teverde, Costa Rica, the lifting of the cloud base associated with increased ocean tempera-tures has been linked to the disappearance of 20 species of frogs (Pounds et al., 1999). Ona rocky shoreline in central California, where annual mean ocean temperature has in-creased 1\u00baC over the past 60 years, researchers have documented an increase in southernanimal species and a decrease in northern animal species (Sagarin et al., 1999). BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL OVERVIEWWWF 10 Current Trajectory & The Limits of Adaptation Over the past century the average global temperature has risen 0.7 \u00baC as atmospheric CO2concentrations have risen from ~280 ppm to 370 ppm. Emissions scenarios from the IPCC (2001) suggest that if humans do not act to reduce emissions, we will see CO2 levels of 550 ppm within the next 40 to 100 years, roughly a doubling of pre-industrialconcentrations. This range of scenarios implies an additional increase in temperature of1 to 5.8 \u00baC. Recent papers suggest that the upper end of this range is more likely and thateven higher temperatures are possible, especially if climate sensitivity has been under- estimated (Caldeira et al., 2003). This higher range of temperatures will also meangreater sea level rise and greater potential changes in precipitation and oceanic currents. Clearly most systems will be dramatically challenged and subsequently altered by changes of this magnitude. It is unlikely that any local strategies could provide adequateprotection for biodiversity under these conditions (Figure 1). Conserving biodiversitywill therefore require a two pronged approach. First, greenhouse gas emissions must bedramatically reduced in order to slow the rate and extent of global climate change.Under current emissions scenarios, all outcomes result in dramatic changes beyond thereach of adaptive measures. WWF proposes that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions tolimit change to less than a 2 \u00baC average temperature increase above pre-industrial levels.Second, assuming that we can limit the rate and extent of change, we will still need torespond to the change that is already inherent in the system and buy some time forecosystems as emissions are reduced. Because the effects of greenhouse gases in the at-mosphere have a substantial lag time we are locked into additional change from the con-centrations of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere today. This does not meanthat reducing emissions is futile; rather, it means that we must reduce emissions quicklyand deeply and take local action to protect biodiversity by increasing the resistance andresilience of natural systems so they can better survive the changes to come.

We think of this manual as a small first step in developing successful adaptation strategies for natural systems conservation. The chapters outline the significant features of eachbiome, what threats are already affecting these biomes, likely affects of climate change oneach biome, possible strategies for increasing resilience within the particular biome andfinally offer suggestions and examples of how these strategies might be implemented. Increasing the resilience of a natural system is a standard goal of conservation; intact ecosystems have more resources for withstanding stresses. Natural systems are alreadyaffected by an array of stresses, from fragmentation to pollution to invasive species.Climate change will add another layer of stress to this complex matrix of interactions.Increasing ecosystem resilience to climate change will require even greater vigilanceand longer term planning. Suggestions in these chapters fall into three broad categories. 1. PROTECTADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE SPACE Ecosystems with high biodiversity and those that maintain crucial structural compo-nents are thought to recover more easily from climatic disturbances. Traditionalconservation methods such as creating protected areas, whether in terrestrial or ma-rine areas, will thus have another justification in the next several decades. It will be-come increasingly important, however, to take into account projected impacts of cli-mate change when designing new protected area systems, and to expand spatialscales through buffer zones and corridors to aid species migration. In particular,planners should look for climate refugia-areas that experience less change than oth-ers. Planning reserves will now require an eye for potentially dramatic futurechanges in protected areas; thinking about not only current but future configurationsof habitats, communities, and ecosystems. Managers will need to be even morestrategic, creative and flexible in designing protection strategies to address tradi-tional land uses, existing threats, and also climate change stresses. Protecting notjust space but functional groups, keystone species, climatic refugia, and multiplemicrohabitats within a biome to provide adequate representation is essential. 2. LIMITALLNON-CLIMATE STRESSES Climate change is not occurring in a vacuum. There are myriad stresses affecting nat-ural systems, including habitat fragmentation, overharvest, invasive species, and pol-lution. A limited body of research on interactions between climate and non-climatestresses suggests synergistic responses (McLusky et al., 1986). For example, whenrainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) are exposed to the pesticide permethrin over a range of temperatures, the toxicity increases as temperature increases (Kumaraguru andBeamish, 1981). To support ecosystem resilience you must reduce the number of si-multaneous insults faced by that ecosystem. Fortunately many stressors are more lo-cally controllable than climate change. In a marine system this may mean establish-ing \"no-take zones\" to reduce fishing pressure and associated habitat destruction. Ina freshwater system this may require limiting the concentration of toxic substances inWWF 12 effluent from an upstream industry. It may mean protecting alpine watersheds by lim- iting extraction of water by downslope agriculture and cities, or limiting harmfulgrazing practices in grasslands. Forests could require limiting fragmentation fromroad construction and logging. None of these tasks are easy, but they are approach-able on a local level and they can increase the overall resilience of the system. 3. USE ACTIVE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENTAND STRATEGYTESTING Given uncertainty about the exact nature of ecosystem impacts of and responses toclimate change, effective management will require a responsive and flexible ap-proach. The success of various conservation approaches should be continually re-assessed, and approaches adjusted as new information becomes available. In in-stances where impacts are relatively clear, active intervention to increase adaptivecapacity coupled with monitoring is necessary. Such intervention may include as-sisted migration or reintroduction of species, non-chemical control of pest or dis-ease outbreaks, prescribed burning or other fire management strategies to lessen theimpact of increasingly severe and frequent wildfires, controlling invasive speciesand decreasing nutrient-enhanced run-off into marine and freshwater ecosystems.Where extinction in the wild is inevitable, ex situconservation of species via the collection of germplasm, seedbanks, gardens, aquaria or zoos can be used as an op-tion of last resort. Regardless of the management strategy, on-going monitoring is essential to assure that actions are truly of the \"do no harm\" variety. Monitoring with adaptive man-agement sets up an in situexperiment, providing data for modification of manage- ment strategies and allowing for exchange of results between protected areas forbetter strategy development world-wide. Methodologies for Evaluating Climate Change Impacts Chapters in this report evaluate existing and predicted effects of climate change on differentbiomes. Impacts that have already been seen are reported from case studies in the scientificliterature. Predicted impacts are approached in a number of ways. At a large scale, it is pos-sible to predict major shifts in biome types by combining biogeography models such as theHoldridge Life Zone Classification Model with general circulation models (GCMs) thatproject changes under a doubled CO 2scenario. Biogeochemistry models simulate the cy- cling of nutrients between both biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem for assess-ing the impacts of changes in temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and other climaticfactors that give clues to ecosystem productivity. Dynamic global vegetation models inte- grate biogeochemical processes with dynamic changes in vegetation composition and dis-tribution. Comparing present trends in species and communities with paleological data alsoprovides indications of how they will weather future climate change (Hansen et al., 2001). The Role of the U.N.in Developing National Adaptation Plans Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the KyotoProtocol, countries are required to develop National Adaptation Plans. These plans must13FOREWORD BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL include strategies for natural systems, but very little work has been done thus far to en- sure that these crucial natural resources are included in national adaptation strategies. It isWWF's hope that this manual will provide a tool to assist in completion of the biodiver-sity portion of National Adaptation Plans so that countries have strategies in place to buytime for biodiversity and natural resources. Numerous conversations are currently under-way around the world noting the need for further support, both financial and intellectual, for adaptation strategies. While adaptation plans cannot in any way replace mitigation,they are vitally important to ensure that all countries receive the support necessary to pro-tect their natural resources, especially those countries where such support is currently un-available. Thus far support has been inadequate, especially for developing countries. The Importance of Integrating Climate Change Threats Into Conservation Plans Conservation planning is the key to protection of biodiversity and ecosystem function. The majority of planning to date has focused on issues relating to space; designing re-serves to protect moderately \"pristine\" tracts of land or water. While we have protectedonly a fraction of the area needed to meet recommended spatial goals, we must also startaddressing threats that originate outside reserves and protected areas. Environmentalthreats like climate change require that we extend conservation planning beyond theboundaries of protected areas, and into a future in which ecosystems and biomes may bequite different than they are today. We must also realize that while it is incumbent on us to take action now to design, test and adopt conservation strategies that respond to climate change, these efforts are notthe long-term solution. Even the best-designed approaches to increasing resistance andresilience to climate change will work only for changes of a few degrees at most. Inessence, we are only buying ecosystems time, but time they desperately need while ef-forts are made to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and limit therate and extent of climate change.

Gelbard, Ph.D. Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF the world's grasslands makes them one of the most vulnerable to global climate change of any terrestrial ecosystem (Sala et al.,2000; IPCC, 2001a). The low-stature of vegetation confers high light availability, leav-ing many grasslands naturally vulnerable to invasive species (Wagner, 1989), especiallyfollowing disturbance (Hobbs and Huenneke, 1992). A critical role for fire in maintain-ing plant community structure in many grassland types leaves them vulnerable to vege-tation change should changes to temperatures and precipitation occur that are sufficientto alter biomass and fire frequency. Grasslands are also vulnerable due to human envi-ronmental impacts, including conversion to agriculture (both cropland and grazing land)(Dale et al., 2000; Ricketts and Dinerstein, 2001), the introductions and spread of inva-sive species (Mack et al., 2000; Mooney and Hobbs, 2000), the proliferation of roads(Forman and Alexander, 1998; Forman, 2000), alterations to fire regimes (D'Antonio,2000; Dale et al. 2000), and pollution that alters soil fertility and rates of plant growth(Schlesinger, 1997; Lejeune and Seastedt, 2001). Combine the above natural and an-thropogenic vulnerabilities, and it is apparent that when faced with human-inducedglobal climate change (Schlesinger, 1997; IPCC, 2001b), what remains of the world'sgrassland ecosystems as we know them are in trouble (Forseth, 1997). Fortunately, however, the fate of grassland ecosystems faced with climate change, which has the potential to favor different groups of species and alter ecosystem processes, is notyet sealed. Although in some regions, habitats are far more degraded and in need ofrestoration and recovery than others (see Ricketts and Dinerstein, 2001 and the WorldWildlife Fund's Ecoregions website, http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/index.htm, for an overview of the world's grassland types and assessment of their conservation sta-tus), scientists, land managers, and policymakers, with the help of private landowners,still have time to devise and implement adaptations that will be needed to protect andconserve grasslands from threats posed by global climate change. This chapter summa-rizes current scientific knowledge concerning potential steps that will be required toachieve this goal. CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 15WWF 16 It first outlines the components of grassland ecosystems that will prove crucial to their re- silience to climate change and describes human environmental impacts to them. Re-silience is defined as the ability to withstand not only possible episodic climate changes,but also possible long-term directional changes (Malcolm and Markham, 1996); it may vary depending on the ecosystem component in question (Lavorel, 1999). The chapter then outlines potential impacts of predicted climate changes on grasslands given theircurrent human-altered environmental condition. Finally, it proposes adaptations that mayprove useful for preventing or minimizing these effects, and discusses complex chal-lenges that could arise during translation of proposed strategies into the managementplans and policies that will be required to maintain and restore grassland resilience. Crucial Components of Grassland Ecosystems The condition of vegetation and soils will prove critical to grassland resilience to cli-mate change. Healthy, vigorous stands of native vegetation are likely to be more re-silient to warming temperatures and increasing frequency and duration of droughts thandegraded grasslands because their roots have access to deeper soil moisture and they arebetter able to compete with invasive species (Goodwin et al., 1999; Enloe et al., 2000;Stohlgren et al., 2001; Gelbard, 2003). Healthy plant cover is critical for interceptingrainfall, maximizing infiltration and soil water supply, reducing overland flow, and pre-venting nutrient losses due to erosion (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994). A healthy level of soil organic matter is important for soil aggregate formation, fertility, stability, watermovement and holding capacity, and aeration, and therefore influences plant growth.Plant growth and vigor is largely determined by physical, biotic, and disturbance factorsthat limit primary productivity, including water availability (Sala et al., 1988), nutrientcycling (West, 1983; Schlesinger, 1997; Evans and Belnap, 1999), the suite of compet- ing species (Grace and Tilman, 1990), healthy soil biota (Allen et al., 1992; Belnap andLange, 2001), and the native disturbance Mack andThompsen, 1982; Collins, 1992; D'Antonio, capacity andprecipitation patterns are the major determinants of water availability for plants (Jenny,1980), which in turn is the major determinant of plant growth (Schlesinger, 1997). Abundance and relative composition of plant species are increasingly recognized to de- pend on various ecological processes such as herbivory and fire (Soule and Terbourgh,1999; Ricketts and Dinerstein, 2001). Changes to the above ecosystem components dueto climate change, human environmental impacts, or synergisms therein have the poten-tial to influence grassland composition and/or function, and therefore resilience (Mack,1989; Forseth, 1997; Mooney and Hobbs, 2000). The status of compo-nents differs among grasslands (Carpenter, 2001; Dellafiore, 2001; Ricketts and Diner-stein, 2001; Seymour and Rowan, 2001), depending on such factors as the degree towhich their native species and soil biota are adapted to the current disturbance regime(Mack, 1989; Milchunas and Lauenroth, 1993). CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 17 Stresses and Vulnerabilities Due to Factors OtherThan Climate Change Numerous human disturbances and stresses are causing substantial degradation to the crucial components of grassland ecosystems outlined above (Walker, 1995). These in-clude habitat fragmentation and loss, the spread of invasive species, alteration of fireregimes, and pollution; and all may act alone or synnergistically, leaving grasslands par-ticularly vulnerable to climate change (Walker and Steffen, 1997; Dale et al., 2000). HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AND LOSS Throughout the world, grasslands have been degraded by livestock grazing, converted toagriculture and urban centers, and fragmented by roads (Dale et al., 2000). LIVESTOCK GRAZING: Livestock grazing is undoubtedly the major land use of the world's remaining grasslands (IPCC, 2001a), and it is listed as a threat to these systems on all continents except for Antarctica (Richardson et al., 2000; Its impacts are variable depending not only on the intensity, timing, duration,and type of grazing animal, but on environmental conditions and the ecosystem andplant life form in question (Mack, 1989; Noy-Meir et al., 1989; Milchunas and Lauen-roth, 1993; Harrison et al., 2003). Livestock grazing diminishes grassland resilience bycompacting soils, thus reducing infiltration and soil water capacity and drying out sur-face soils, which may increase vulnerability to drought and accelerate desertification (Schlesinger et al., 1990; Robertson, 1996, Fig. 1). It causes substantial degradation toriparian habitats (Belsky et al., 1999), which are hot spots of native biodiversity withingrasslands, and provide connectivity between grassland patches (Noss and Cooperrid-er, 1994; Stohlgren et al., 1998). Livestock cause erosion and topsoil loss and destroybiological soil crusts (living crusts composed of lichens, mosses, algae, and cyanobac-teria that cover the soil surface between individual grasses, shrubs, and trees in manysemi-arid grasslands, and that are critical for maintaining soil fertility and plant vigor;Belnap and Lange, 2001) that may result in considerable nutrient losses (Archer andSmeins, 1991; Evans and Belnap, 1999; Belnap and Lange, 2001). They also cause lo-calized increases in soil fertility where they concentrate, such as near water sourcesand under trees (Dalhgren et al., 1997; Belsky and Gelbard, 2000). Vegetation withinsuch nutrient hot spots tends to be dominated by invasive species, and these sites mayact as foci for further invasion (Belsky and Gelbard, 2000). The result of changes tosoil fertility and structure caused by livestock, combined with seed introductions of in-vasive species and selective grazing of palatable species over weedy ones frequently results in reductions in both the vigor and reproduction of native species and an accel-eration of the spread of invasives (Buffington and Herbel, 1964; IPCC, 2001a).These impacts leave grasslands highly vulnerable to climate changes that may favor in-vasive species (Baskin, 1998). WWF 18 Figure 1a. Figure 1b. CONVERSION TO AGRICULTURE: Vast expanses of grassland habitat have been converted to agriculture, whose spread has often left remaining patches surrounded within a sea ofcrop fields, irrigated pastures, vineyards, and orchards (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994,Dale et al., 2000, Ricketts and Dinerstein, 2001). Grasslands from the Argentine Pampas(Dellafiore, 2001), to the Kazakh steppe (Ponomarenko, 2001), to the American tall-grass and Palouse prairies (Ricketts and Dinerstein, 2001), have been almost entirelyconverted to agricultural production, leaving few intact habitats remaining. Such isola-tion leaves grassland species little room to migrate in response to climatic changes.Agricultural impacts to grasslands stretch beyond habitat fragmentation and loss. Forexample, due to changes in the level of surface water evaporation, irrigated agriculture may alter regional climate in such a way as to influence plant community composition(Baron et al., 1998). An impact to grasslands that often accompanies agricultural conversion is pesticide use. The application of toxic pesticides may poison soils, alter below-ground communities,weaken native plants, and lead to the loss of native species or invasions of differenttypes of exotics (Frenkel, 1970; Myers al., 1998; Dale et al.,2000). Even supposedly weed-specific herbicides such as to control yellow starthistle (Centaurea may lead to the loss tional groups such as asters and legumes (DiTomaso et al., 2000), potentially reducingnitrogen availability and destabilizing plant community composition.Fig. 1. Intensive sheep grazing favors exotic annuals such as Erodium cicutarium in Carrizo Plain National Monument (Fig. 1a; photo by J. Gelbard) and by causing terracing that compacts soils, reducing infil- tration and increasing overland flow and topsoil loss (Fig. 1b; photo by J. Gelbard). CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 19 PROLIFERATION OF ROADS: Roads are the entry points for virtually all human environ- mental impacts to grasslands, including conversion to agriculture and subdivisions, live-stock grazing, off-road vehicle (ORV) use, arson fires, and the spread of invasive species(Forman and Alexander, 1998). Of particular concern for grassland resilience, roads arethe pathways by which invasive plants are spread away from ports and other originalpoints of introduction and throughout a geographic region (Frenkel, 1970; Belsky andGelbard, 2000; Gelbard and Belnap, 2003). For example, seeds of 124 plant species, ahigh proportion of which were exotic, were collected from an automobile as it was driv-en more than 15,000 km throughout Central Europe (Schmidt, 1989). In Australia, re-searchers collecting seeds from vehicles in Kakadu National Park found 14 exoticspecies not known to be present in the area (Lonsdale and Lane, 1994). Whether inAfrica (Milton and Dean, 1998), the Middle East (Holzapfel and Schmidt, 1990), Eu-rope (Schmidt, 1989), the United States (Gelbard and Belnap, 2003), or Australia (Lons-dale and Lane, 1994), this typically results in roadsides being highly invaded habitats. InSerengeti National Park, for example, road shoulders contained ruderal species that didnot occur in naturally disturbed or climax communities (Belsky, 1987). In the westernUnited States, the noxious weed, yellow starthistle occurred in 73% of quadrats 10 me-ters from roads, but only 21% of quadrats greater than 1000 m from roads (Gelbard andHarrison, 2003). Roadsides in the Middle East were dominated by Mediterraneanspecies, while adjacent habitats were dominated by Saraho-Arabian species (Holzapfeland Schmidt, 1990). Figure 2.Off-road vehicle (ORV) damage to plants and soils in a rare serpentine grassland. Photo by J. Gelbard.WWF 20 The construction and improvement of roads can be considered an important agent of land cover change. Gelbard and Belnap (2003) estimated that construction of 10 kilometers ofpaved roads converts as much as 12 hectares of natural habitat to highly invaded roadsidehabitats that can act as conduits for the spread of invasive species. Conversely, roadlesshabitats are often refuges for native species (Soule and Terbourgh, 1999), but such habi-tats are typically rare at the landscape scale. In an area of northern California, for exam-ple, grasslands greater than 1000 meters from roads composed only 1.5% of the land-scape (Gelbard and Harrison, 2003). This study provided a striking illustration of how theexpansion of a road network fragments and degrades grasslands, leaving them highly vulnerable to additional vegetation changes induced by climatic shifts. An impact to grasslands that is directly related to roads is off-road vehicle (ORV) use, which damages vegetation and soils and spreads invasive plant seeds (Fig. 2; Webb andWilshire, 1983; Noss and Cooperrider, 1994). Inadequate attention in management plans and insufficient enforcement of existing regulations have resulted in hundreds ofthousands of kilometers of unauthorized ORV routes across grassland landscapes. URBANIZATION: Throughout many areas of the world, grasslands occupy valley bottoms and other habitats of low topographic position, which are the most accessible for devel-opment (West, 1983). As a result, they have been especially vulnerable to habitat lossdue to urbanization (Gerlach et al., 1998; Fig. 3). Figure 3.Untold extents of grassland habitat have been lost to urbanization. SPREAD OF INVASIVE SPECIES The introduction and spread of exotic and otherwise invasive plant species (exoticspecies are not native to an ecosystem, while invasivespecies are those that spread rapidly from original points of introduction) poses a considerable threat to many of the world's re-maining grasslands. Invasive species possess traits that make them highly adaptive to cli- Photo by J. Gelbard.mate change, including tolerance of a wide range of environmental conditions, resistance to human disturbances, and rapid rates of growth, seed production, and dispersal (Baskin,1998; Dukes and Mooney, 1999; IPCC, 2001a). They include not only plants, but alsopathogens such as barley yellow dwarf virus, which afflicts some native bunchgrassspecies and may act in conjunction with moisture stress caused by competition with ex-otic annuals to contribute to high bunchgrass seedling mortality (Malmstrom, 1998). Im-pacts of invasive species include species endangerment (Wilcove et al., 1998), reductionsin biodiversity (Rosentreter, 1994) and wildlife habitat (Bedunah, 1992), alterations toecosystem processes such as fire frequency (D'Antonio and Vitousek, 1992), and nutrientcycling and hydrology (Vitousek et al., 1997), increases in topsoil loss (Lacey et al., 1989), alterations to soil microclimate (Evans and Young, 1984), and reductions in landvalue and livestock forage capacity (Sheley and Petroff, 1999; Naylor, 2000). The most severe impacts of invasive species often occur where they alter the disturbance regime(D'Antonio, 2000; Levine et al., 2003). The invasive species problem can often be con-sidered a subset of many of the human impacts described in this section (Archer et al.,1995; Knops et al., 1995; Belsky and Gelbard, 2000). ALTERED FIRE REGIMES Humans have caused dramatic alterations to grassland fire regimes (D'Antonio, 2000),which are often important determinants of plant community composition (Collins, 1992;Ricketts and Dinerstein, 2001; Keeley, 2001). In some grassland types, such as the Inter-mountain West, USA, shortening of the fire return interval due to invasions has favoredfire-tolerant plant species, resulting in the loss of fire-intolerant bunchgrasses, shrubs, and associated and Rotenberry, 1997; D'Anto-nio, 2000). increased fire frequency include accelerated nutrient lossesthrough volatilization and mortality of biological crust organisms (Schlesinger, 1997; Bel-nap and Lange, 2001), and losses of rare species (Rosentreter, 1994). Fuel breaks createdto suppress fire may further alter grasslands by acting as conduits for the spread of invasivespecies into uninfested habitats (Keeley, 2001). The area impacted by increased fire fre-quency may expand with climate change, and thus this threat can also be considered a po-tential climate change impact (Current and Future Stress, pg.39). In other grasslands, human-caused decreases in fire frequency have negatively influ- enced ecosystem health, especially where dominant native species are more fire tolerantthan invaders (e.g., Collins, 1992; Heady, 1995; Dale et al., 2000). In California grass-lands, for example, low intensity fire can favor native bunchgrasses such as Nassella pulchra(Heady, 1995; DiTomaso et al., 1999; 2001), while fire suppression re- sults in the build-up of a thick layer of exotic annual grass thatch that hinders the estab-lishment and reproduction of many native species (Menke, 1989; Heady, 1995). POLLUTION INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC CO2:The rise in atmospheric CO2concentrations caused by human activities (Schlesinger, 1997) may have variable effects on grasslands, depend-ing on environmental conditions such as soil fertility, climate, and the species mix CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: effect of increased CO2 concentrations is increased water use efficiency of plants, because the amount of time that they need to leave stomata open for CO2uptake is reduced (Forseth, 1997; Schlesinger, 1997). Experiments have shown that as a result, heightened CO2levels in- crease soil moisture, which may negatively impact grasslands where such conditionsfavor invasive species (Hobbs and Mooney, 1989; Dukes and Dukes, 2000). The effect of increased CO 2on grasslands may also depend on the mix of C3 vs. C4 species in a community. Plants with the C3 photosynthetic pathway such as many bunch-grasses (e.g., Stipaspp.) and mesquite (Prosopis spp.) may increase photosynthetic rates up to concentrations of 1000 parts per million CO 2and beyond (Pearcy and Ehleringer, 1983), and therefore may show enhanced growth rates as CO2concentrations increase. In contrast, plants with the C4 photosynthetic pathway, such as many Bouteloua species of the Great Plains, USA, are already saturated by CO2at current atmospheric levels and are expected to show little if any increase in growth with rising CO2levels (Woodward et al., 1991; Forseth, 1997). The result may be to favor C3 over C4 species, though the like-lihood that this will occur remains uncertain (Walker and Steffen, 1997), and may de-pend on environmental conditions such as moisture availability (Forseth, 1997) and thecurrent disturbance regime (Mack and Thompsen, 1982; Milchunas and Lauenroth,1993). Since rising temperatures may increase terrestrial CO 2outputs into the atmos- phere by increasing decomposition rates, especially in northern latitudes where soilscontain substantial carbon stores (Schlesinger, 1997), effects of rising CO 2levels on grasslands may be augmented by climate change (Current and Future Stress, below). NITROGEN DEPOSITION: Doubling of nitrogen (N) inputs into the terrestrial N cycle as a result of human activities is leading to accelerated losses of biological diversity amongplants adapted to efficient use of N and animals and microorganisms that depend onthem (Vitousek et al., 1997). Increased N availability degrades grasslands by favoringweedy species and reducing native species richness (Huenneke et al., 1990; Wedin andTilman, 1996; Schlesinger, Scherer-Lorenzen et al., 2000; Lejeune and Seastedt, 2001), especially in habitats characterized by higher temperatures and pre-cipitation (Walker and Steffen, 1997). For example, Lejeune and Seastedt (2001) con-cluded that N deposition has been an important contributor to the spread of knapweeds(Centaurea species). Experimental studies have shown N addition to result in losses of species diversity in grasslands (Huenneke et al., 1990; Wedin and Tilman, 1996), espe-cially when combined with disturbance (Hobbs, 1989), including by resulting in lossesto mycorrhizal species that are important to native persistence (Egerton-Warburton andAllen, 2000). Effects of climate change on grassland community composition may beespecially pronounced in grasslands impacted by N deposition (Zavaleeta et al., 2003). CFCS AND STRATOSPHERIC OZONE DEPLETION: The loss of stratospheric ozone (O3) due to human activities has resulted in increased UV-B radiation at the Earth's surface(Schlesinger, 1997). Plant response to UV-B radiation spans from little effect to large re-WWF 22ductions in photosynthesis and growth, depending on environmental conditions (Forseth, 1997), but may result in changes in competitive balance in terrestrial plantcommunities (Barnes et al., 1988). OTHER POLLUTANTS: Pollutants such as tropospheric ozone (O3), which is phytotoxic, and sulfur and nitrogen oxides (SOx, NOx), which combine with rainwater to form acidrain, may weaken native species, reducing their ability to withstand some of the abovestresses (Schlesinger 1997, Walker and Steffen, 1997). In more mesic grasslands whereacid deposition results in losses of basic cations via leaching (Schlesinger, 1997), it mayresult in nutrient limitations that weaken native plants, increasing their vulnerability tostress induced by drought, disease, and competition with invasive species, and thereforeto climate change. Current and Future Stress and Vulnerability Due to Climate Change PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGES TO GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEMS General circulation models (GCMs) predict grassland ecosystems to experience climat-ic changes including higher maximum (daytime) and minimum (nighttime) tempera-tures, and more intense precipitation events (IPCC, 2001b). They predict precipitation toincrease over northern mid-high latitude grasslands with larger year-to-year variation,including increased frequency of droughts and floods associated with El Ni\u00f1o events,and project both regional increases and decreases for low latitudes (IPCC, 2001b). With-in each grassland type, the nature and degree of impacts caused by climate changes islikely to depend on both environmental conditions and individual species or plant lifeform, due to differences in competitive abilities, migration rates, and responses to dis-turbance (Forseth, al., 2001; Zavaleta et al., 2003). Location of sites within a grassland region mayalso be important, as ecotonal habitats are most likely to experience vegetation changes(Neilson, 1993). The degree to which human-caused disturbances and stresses (S tresses and vulnerabilities, pg.33)have already degraded resilience is also likely to prove critical to the future response (Forseth, 1997; Malcolm and Markham, 1996; Schlesinger,1997). Unlike past climatic changes, the current suite of species in most grasslandsoften includes species intentionally and accidentally introduced from all over the world,leaving considerably greater potential for climatic shifts to cause or accelerate large-scale vegetation change (Mack, 1989; Mooney and Hobbs, 2000). POTENTIALIMPACTS OF INCREASED PRECIPITATION In grasslands predicted to experience an increase in precipitation (IPPC, 2001b), such asthose of the western United States, this may alleviate moisture stress resulting from ris-ing temperatures. However, it may also accelerate nutrient cycling (e.g., N mineraliza-tion), increasing both productivity (Breymeyer et al., 1996) and the germination,seedling survival, and spread of many invasive species 1989;Baskin, 1998; Dukes grasslands (e.g.,within Australia, the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts of Mexico and the USA), GCMspredict an increase in the frequency of intense precipitation events and flash floods. This CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 23climatic prediction, combined with the likelihood that rising temperatures will increase oxidation of soil organic matter important to soil stability (Walker and Steffen, 1997), islikely to increase erosion and nutrient loss, especially in already-disturbed habitats. Ifsuch climatic changes are accompanied by a decrease in less-intense precipitationevents, grasslands may experience a net loss in water availability, since in more arid sys- tems, much of the water that falls in the form of intense events often runs through thesystem and is not absorbed. POTENTIALIMPACTS OF DECREASED PRECIPITATION Other grasslands, including continental interiors such as the Canadian Prairie, CentralAustralia, the African Serengeti, and the Great Plains, USA, are expected to experiencea decrease in precipitation (IPCC, 2001b). Possible consequences include decreased productivity and water availability and increased risk of wildfire (Baron et al., 1998;IPCC, 2001a), which may result in losses of rare species and soil biota, disruption of Ncycling, and associated impacts to grassland Rotenberry, 1997; biological soil crusts may actas a physical barrier to the establishment of some invasive species (Mack, 1989), large-scale reductions in crust cover due to increased frequency of drought and fire may ac-celerate the spread of exotic annuals such as (Stohlgren other grassland habitats, however, including innorthern Europe (Buckland, et al. 2001), South Africa (Richardson et al., 2000), andCalifornia (Hobbs and Mooney, 1989), an increase in the frequency and duration ofdrought may cause declines in the abundance of some exotic species, allowing for therecovery of some natives. POSSIBLE SYNERGISMS AMONG CLIMATE CHANGES AND HUMAN ENVIRONMENTALIMPACTS Synergisms among climate change and other human impacts, such as among grazing, ORV use and increased frequency of drought, may also negatively impact grasslands.For example, effects of drought on vegetation are likely to be more severe where tram- pling disturbances have reduced infiltration and soil water capacity (Schlesinger et al.,1990; Baron et al., 1998). As noted above, warming temperatures and higher precipita-tion may increase biomass and therefore fire frequency and intensity, especially wheregrasslands are dominated by summer-dry exotic annuals (D'Antonio, 2000). One resultmay be a feedback in which increased fire frequency results in the displacement of na-tive bunchgrasses and shrubs, opening still more habitat to invasion (D'Antonio and Vi-tousek, 1992). In other possible synergisms, the probability that increased precipitationand CO 2concentrations (which are likely to further increase with climatic warming due to oxidation of soil carbon stores, especially in northern latitudes; Schlesinger, 1997)will alter plant community composition is likely to be highest in areas subjected to highnitrogen deposition (Dukes and Mooney, 1999; Sala et al., 2000, Zavaleta et al., 2003),while an increase in the frequency of drought may have particularly severe conse-quences for rare species (Tilman and El-Haddi, 1992), especially in the presence ofhuman impacts to vegetation and soils described above. Of course, one never knowsWWF 24CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 25 what surprises Mother Nature may spring upon grasslands in the future (Malcolm and Markham, 1996; Schneider and Root, 1996; Broeker, 1997), as potential climatechanges and their consequences remain difficult, if not impossible, to predict with ahigh degree of certainty (Walker and Steffen, 1997). Adaptation Options Many possible strategies (adaptations) may prove useful for maintaining and restoringthe resilience of grassland ecosystems to climate change. Represent grassland types across environmental gradients in protected areas: Because we do not know precisely which grassland types will be most sensitive to climatechange, maintaining all types in replicated protected areas across environmental gradi-ents (to protect against the loss of individual reserves to catastrophic events), with man-agement appropriate to the native disturbance regime, will help to ensure that resilienttypes persist (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994; Soule and Terbourgh, 1999; Dale et al.,2000). Reserve systems should include heterogeneous topographic, soil, and manage-ment conditions to maintain full suites of native species (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994;Markham and Terbourgh, 1999, Fuhlendorfand Engle, 2001). They should also be designed to protect rare species and recognizewhere isolation may hinder their ability to migrate as the climate changes (Markhamand Malcom, 1996) Protect relict and native-dominated communities Mainte- Jeffries and Klopatek,1987; Ambos et al., 2000) is crucial because these communities both serve as models forhabitat restoration and help us to understand how grasslands altered versus unaltered byhuman activity are affected by climate change. Since many relict communities are iso-lated in remote sites surrounded by altered habitats, they could prove vulnerable to cli-matic shifts (Halpin, 1997). Isolation may also have beneficial effects, however, such asby protecting relict communities from the introduction of exotic plant seeds and dis-eases that afflict native species (Gelbard, 2003). Minimize fragmentation by land use changes and roads: The negative effects of ecosys- tem fragmentation are abundantly documented worldwide (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994;Soule and Terbourgh, 1999; Dale et al., 2000). Core grassland habitats distant fromroads and human disturbances are often refuges for native species, but roads are sowidespread that such habitats are typically rare at the landscape scale (Gelbard and Har-rison, 2003). Conversely, fragmentation of grassland ecosystems by roads and land usechanges contributes to reductions in native biodiversity, both by eliminating grasslandhabitats entirely and by facilitating the spread of invasive species (Forman and Alexan-der, 1998; Gerlach et al., 1998; Gelbard and Belnap, 2003). Activities that fragmentgrasslands should be minimized, while roadless and otherwise relatively intact corehabitats should receive some form of protection (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994; Dale etal., 2000).WWF 26 Connectivity is the antithesis of fragmentation. Corridors or stepping-stones of suitable habitat may facilitate the migration of species in response to climate change, and are im-portant for maintaining species migrations and gene flow (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994;Dale et al., 2000). However, connectivity can also be detrimental where it provides aconduit for the spread of invasive species and diseases that afflict native species(Markham and Malcolm, 1996). In grassland ecosystems, connectivity should be con-sidered where it is critical for maintaining gene flow among populations of rare speciesand in avoiding fragmentation (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994). Maintenance of intact ri-parian habitats\u2014often hotspots of biological diversity in grasslands\u2014is one approachfor retaining connectivity among grassland patches (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994). Practice low-intensity, sustainable grazing practices: Proper livestock management is critical for maintaining grassland components crucial to resilience. Grazing should bemaintained in grasslands where native species are adapted to it (Baker, 1978; Mack,1989), while land managers should consider reducing or removing grazing from mar-ginal lands (e.g., semi-desert and desert grasslands) and systems where the predominantnative species lack a long evolutionary history of grazing by large hooved herbivores(Mack, 1989; Milchunas and Lauenroth, 1993). Invaded or otherwise degraded grass-lands are likely to pose more complex management challenges (Billings, 1990; Archerand Smeins, 1991; Brenton and Klinger, 1994), and may require active restoration.Within grazed grasslands, it is important to maintain heterogeneity of management at the landscape-scale and mimic grazing patterns of native herbivores to maximize nativebiodiversity (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994; Fuhlendorf and Engel, 2001). Such measuresare likely to help promote the resilience of grasslands to climate change by helping toprotect native species from invasions and by maintaining favorable soil nutrient andmoisture conditions (Gelbard, 2003). Prevent and control the spread of invasive species, including pathogens: Since invasive species may be favored over natives under many climate change scenarios, and causesubstantial degradation to grasslands (Stresses and vulnerabilities, pg.33), preventingand controlling their spread is critical for maintaining grassland resilience (Baskin,1998; Mack et al., 2000; Mooney and Hobbs, 2000). Grassland restoration: Where possible, land managers should conduct grassland restoration, including reintroductions of native species, eradication or control of inva-sive species, inoculations with soil biota important to native plant vigor, nutrient cy-cling, and decomposition (e.g., mycorrhizae, biological soil crust organisms), andrestoration of native disturbance regimes (Soule and Terbourgh, 1999). Maintenance of natural fire regimes: Fire regimes exert a profound influence on the health and heterogeneity of grassland vegetation Dinerstein, 2001). Maintaining or restoring native fireregimes will be an important component of efforts to maintain and restore grassland re-silience (Collins, 1992; D'Antonio et al., 2001; Dale et al., 2000). CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 27 Provide buffer zones: The fixed boundaries of protected areas are not well-suited to a dynamic environment unless individual areas are extremely large (Noss and Cooperrid-er, 1994; Halpin, 1997; Soule and Terbourgh, 1999). With changing climate, bufferzones might provide suitable conditions for shifting of populations to lands borderingreserves as conditions inside reserves become unsuitable. Another function for bufferzones may be to act as barriers to the spread of new invaders away from roads. For ex-ample, establishing strips of dense, ungrazed perennial bunchgrasses, or rocky, infertilesubstrates may help prevent roadside verges from acting as conduits for the spread of arecently introduced exotic species into the adjacent plant community (Roche et al.,1994; Enloe et al., 2000; Gelbard and Belnap, 2003). Identify and protect functional groups and keystone species: Maintaining the natural di- versity of species and functional groups, and dominance (e.g., cover) of native species, is a sound overall strategy for enhancing resilience to climate change (Malcolm and Markham,1996; Dukes, 2002). Several recent studies have demonstrated increased tolerance to envi-ronmental extremes and recovery potential as native species richness or cover increases.For example, Dukes (2002a) found that yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis) grown in monoculture responded strongly to CO 2enrichment, increasing aboveground production by 70%, but when grown in competition with common grassland species, showed parallel,but non-significant increases. In some grasslands, native abundance may also increase re- sistance to invasion, especially at the neighborhood scale (Levine, 2000; Gelbard, 2003).For example, plots dominated by established monocultures of the native perennial grass, Nassella pulchra, along with the late Lessingia species, like starthistle, complete their life-cycles late in the growing season and utilize deep soilmoisture, suggesting that plant communities are most resistant to invasion where theycontain a high abundance of native species with similar life-history characteristics to in-troduced exotics (Roche et al., 1994; Dukes, 2001, 2002b). It follows that maintainingnot only native richness or cover, but also functional group richness, may increase thestability of grassland ecosystems, by increasing the likelihood of protecting nativespecies and life forms with similar life history characteristics to introduced invaders. Protect climatic refugia at multiple scales: It makes sense to identify past climatic refu- gia wherever possible and focus conservation efforts on these areas so they can againfunction as refugia during present and future periods of climate change (Noss, 2000). Strategies for Protecting and Managing Grasslands Faced with Climate Change The appropriateness and feasibility of implementing the above adaptations will vary considerably among grassland types, depending on the evolutionary history of their pre-dominant species and the current vulnerabilities of the system. Below, guidelines areprovided to help direct decisions concerning how to maximize grassland resilience toclimate change.LANDSCAPE LEVELLAND-USE PLANNING Implementation of many of the proposed adaptations for maintaining and restoring re- silience will require conservation-oriented planning that allows examination of local de-cisions in a regional context (Soule and Terbourgh, 1999; Dale et al., 2000). Optimally,counties, states, conservation organizations, and land trusts should work cooperativelyto develop large-scale land use plans that aim to achieve the complementary goals of de-termining which habitats should receive some form of protection, and which lands areless biologically important and thus suitable for development (Noss and Cooperrider,1994; Soule and Terbourgh, 1999; Dale et al., 2000). One objective of landscape planning should be to represent each grassland type, espe- cially its relict communities and sites that contain rare species, in replicated protectedareas across environmental gradients, with management appropriate to the native distur-bance regime (Current and Future Stress, pg.39). The degree to which this option is fea-sible will depend on the proportion of habitat that remains intact. Where few if any largepatches of native habitat remain, this option will not be feasible. However, where eitherintact habitats, or degraded, but undeveloped sites suitable for restoration are available,they can be prioritized to receive some form of protection (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994).Additional adaptations that can be considered during the landscape planning process aredescribed below. PREVENTAND SLOW THE PROLIFERATION OF INVASIVE SPECIES When it comes to buffering grasslands against global climate change, a significant chal-lenge will be to protect native communities from the threat of invasive species (Stressesand vulnerabilities, pg.33; Current and Future Stress, pg.39). By virtual consensus, inva-sion ecologists agree that strategies for achieving this goal should focus on the causes ofinvasions (such as seed sources and disturbances that increase vulnerability to invasion),not just the invasions themselves (Hobbs and Humphries, 1995; Sheley and Petroff, 1999;Mack et al., 2000). Just as individuals who pay attention to threats posed by an illness afterthey have become sick are more likely to suffer reduced personal health, resulting in theneed for potentially expensive medical treatments, grassland managers who pay attentionto threats posed by an invasive species only after their lands have become invaded aremore likely to suffer reduced ecosystem health, resulting in the need for expensive controltreatments. It is increasingly apparent, moreover, that when it comes to confronting the in-vasive species problem, an aggressive, prevention-oriented, and adaptive approach is fa- vorable not only ecologically, but also economically (Hobbs Ran- Naylor, 2000). A prevention-oriented approach requires stemming the influx of propagules via the nu- merous vectors that managers can control, such as vehicles, livestock, outdoor recre-ationalists, and those related to international trade and horticulture (Mack and Lonsdale,2001) (it would be virtually impossible to prevent seeds from being introduced via nat-ural vectors such as streams, wind, and native wildlife). This will require persistentmonitoring of grasslands adjacent to roads and trails, and in pastures and other hot-spotsWWF 28CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 29 of seed introduction, as well as rapid eradication of incipient infestations. In addition, it will require coordination with neighboring landowners to prevent adjacent lands fromproviding seed sources for recolonization. Preventative management also requires minimizing disturbances that increase grassland vulnerability to invasion, especially those caused by livestock, ORVs, road maintenanceoperations, and outdoor recreationalists (Sheley and Petroff, 1999). Although the influ-ence of any one of these factors may differ depending on such factors as soil fertility andmoisture (Gelbard and Harrison, 2003), and the ecosystem or plant community type(Stohlgren et al., 2001; Harrison et al., 2003) in question, all that are affecting the vul-nerability of a site to invasion should be addressed. Examples of possible measures arenoted in the paragraphs below. Attention to detail, as well as political willpower, will make or break invasive species management efforts. For example, both opportunities and restrictions posed by naturalclimatic variation need to be considered. \"Free\" years of control provided by climaticextremes such as drought (for some exotic species; e.g., yellow starthistle) and excep- tionally wet years Aegilops triuncialis) should be ag- gressively followed up with at least a second year of eradication treatments, while re-seeding of competitive native species may only succeed during exceptionally wet years.The responsiveness of adaptive management, especially the efficiency with which mon-itoring results are translated into on-the-ground changes, will prove critical to success asmanagers seek to prepare for the possibility that climate change will accelerate thespread of invasive species. PREVENTAND MINIMIZE ROAD IMPACTS RELATING TO INVASIVE SPECIES Roads are a major key to maintaining grassland resilience to climate change. One of themain reasons for their importance is that climate change is predicted to accelerate thespread of invasive species, and roads provide a major conduit for invasion (Stresses andvulnerabilities, pg.33; Current and Future Stress, pg.39;Strategies for protecting andmanaging grasslands, pg. 44). Measures that may prove useful for minimizing road im-pacts include: Avoiding road construction in roadless habitats and on vulnerable (i.e., more fertile) soil types (Gelbard and Belnap, 2003; Gelbard and Harrison, 2003) to minimize the in-troductions and spread of invasive species and avoid creating corridors for ORV useand (intentional or accidental) setting of fire; Carefully timing road maintenance to avoid favoring invasive species and spreading their seeds (Benefield et al., 1999); Using native species in soil stabilization and revegetation operations to avoid the likeli- hood of introducing species that could invade neighboring grasslands under chang-ing climatic conditions (Bugg et al., 1997); WWF 30 Ensuring that roadfill used in road maintenance operations is not contaminated with weed seeds; Conducting aggressive monitoring of roadside vegetation. This would allow for adap- tive management in which roadside maintenance activities can be experimentallymanipulated to work toward decreasing both the susceptibility of roadside habitatsto invasion and the likelihood that roadside invaders will spread into adjacent natu-ral ecosystems (Gelbard and Belnap, 2003). IMPLEMENT SCIENCE-BASED AND ADAPTIVE LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES Since livestock grazing is the predominant use of the world's remaining grasslands and can cause profound ecological impacts (Stresses and vulnerabilities, pg.33; Current andFuture Stress, pg.39), this measure will prove critical for maintaining resilience. Toooften, grazing practices fail to consider the best available scientific advice concerninghow to graze livestock in such a manner as to minimize negative ecological conse-quences (Archer and Smeins, 1991; Noss 2000; Hobbs, 2001). For example, numerous studies have demonstrat-ed the important role of timing when using grazing as a weed control tool (summarizedby Tu et al., 2001), but grazing on commercial ranches is typically continuous (Wagner,1989), with livestock rarely if ever removed or rotated during times known to favor in-vasive species. In many cases, this is likely due to a lack of flexibility on commercial ranches (Tu et al., 2001), but in others it may simply be due to lack of awareness of tim-ing effects. Appropriate grazing strategies will differ by ecosystem, and local environ-mental conditions (Harrison et al., 2003), but may include: Limit grazing to habitats where native species and soil biota are adapted to it (Baker, 1978; Mack, 1989), and to degraded habitats where invasions are likely to worsenfollowing livestock removal (e.g., Brenton and Klinger, 1994). Nurturing the recoveryof soils and native vegetation following livestock removal requires a long-term view,especially in more arid systems (e.g., Brejda, 1997; Anderson and Inouye, 2001; Val-one et al., 2002). Native recolonization may require not only a native seed source, butalso climatic conditions that occur only once every decade or longer. Recovery ofmany native species may also be more pronounced on sites characterized by favorablemoisture conditions (Billings, 1990; Belsky and Gelbard, 2000). For example, after 58years of protection from grazing in the western United States, native plant density andcover increased on northern exposures, although not on southern and western expo-sures (Monsen, 1994). The same holds true for declines in exotic species followinglivestock removal, as demonstrated in British Columbia, where cheatgrass began todecline only after 30 years of exclusion (McLean and Tisdale, 1972). Design management on a site-specific basis depending on soil and moisture conditions, the predominant native species, life forms, and exotics that pose a threat (Noss andCooperrider, 1994; Randall, 1996; Holecheck et al., 1998). Altering the timing, in-tensity, and duration of grazing as well as the type of grazing animal may all help to minimize negative impacts to native species and soils (Archer and Smeins, 1991;Holecheck et andSheley, 2001); Conduct intensive monitoring as part of adaptive management to minimize excessive disturbances to vegetation and soils (Noss and Cooperrider, 1994). By preventing and minimizing selective grazing of palatable native species, limiting the extent of trampling disturbances that reduce soil water capacity and injure native plants, maintaining nutrient cycles and biological soil crusts, minimizing the spread of invasivespecies, and maintaining native disturbances regimes, the above livestock managementmeasures will help to protect and enhance grassland resilience, including to climatechange. GRASSLAND RESTORATION The vast area of grassland habitats that are currently degraded undoubtedly makes thetask of restoration appear daunting. In grasslands where exotic annuals have overrunlarge expanses of habitat, such as those in Australia (Hobbs, 2001), Chile (Arroyo et al.,2000), California (Heady, 1995), and the Intermountain West, USA (Mack, 1989), along-term, multi-pronged strategy involving restoration of the native disturbance regime(including letting natural fires burn, conducting controlled burns, and, where necessary,removing livestock), re-introductions of native species and soil biota, and eradication orcontrol of invasive species will likely be needed (Soule and Terbourgh, 1999; U.S. Bu-reau of Land Management [BLM], 1999; Belnap and Lange, 2001). Of course, the appropriate tools may or may not be available, depending on the location of a site (Soule and Terbourgh, 1999). For example, controlled burning is not feasibleand may be illegal in more developed or air pollution-sensitive areas. It may also requiresome type of incentive if it is to be conducted on many private lands, where rancherslose that forage for a season. In addition, since natural fires sometimes hinder restora-tion and recovery (D'Antonio, 2000; Harrison et al., 2003), some degree of fire suppres-sion may still be required (Soule and Terbourgh, 1999). In grasslands that remain rela-tively intact, such as those of the Great Plains, USA (Ricketts and Dinerstein, 2001),management improvements combined with native reseeding and weed control are morelikely, in the short-term, to restore grassland components important to resilience. Sincethe science of grassland restoration remains in its early stages (Young, 1999), an adap-tive approach will almost certainly be needed to restore and maintain the compositionand structure of grasslands faced with climate change. Recommendations for Action and Policy Policy and management actions required to implement the above strategies include meas-ures that can be implemented at international, federal, state, county, community, and in-dividual levels. At the international level, for example, considerable changes to trade CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 31WWF 32 policies will be needed to help stem the introductions and spread of invasive species, and such policies will need to be vigorously defended in both biological and economic termsin World Trade Organization dispute panels (McNeely, 2000; Van Driesche and Van Dri-esche, 2001). At national, state, and local levels, appropriate measures will often differbetween public and private lands, and perhaps among cultures (Dale et al., 2000). Private landowners will need financial impetus and know-how to implement the sug- gested adaptations. It will be important for governmental agencies and non-governmen-tal organizations (NGOs) to use incentives to convey a sense that changing managementwill provide an opportunity to improve economic well-being and quality-of-life. Con-versely, incentives that accelerate habitat loss by encouraging suburbanization, such as tax deductions for home mortgage interest payments, and duties that discourage conser-vation, such as expensive estate taxes that landowners can sometimes only pay by sub- dividing grasslands, should be replaced with incentives for conservation (Myers andKent, 1998; Dale et al., 2000). The same holds true for subsidies for agriculture, water use, and roadbuilding throughout the world, without which many grassland habitatscould not affordably be converted to or maintained as agriculture, overgrazed, or roaded(Myers and Kent, 1998). It will also be important to educate the public about the availability of incentive pro- grams. Both NGOs and governmental agencies will prove key as grassland owners seekassurances that taking steps to increase resilience will not threaten their livelihoods. Fi-nancial and quality-of-life concerns must be addressed by providing both direct (e.g.,conservation easements, conservation rewards, safe harbor agreements, habitat conser-vation plans, grants, cost-share programs) and indirect (e.g., education, technical sup- port) benefits to make grassland conservation and restoration economically and sociallydesirable, and thus more politically feasible (McNeely, 2000; Dasgupta et al., 2000;Dale et al., 2000; Naylor, 2000). On public lands, implementing the recommended strategies for maintaining resilience will require changes\u2014some major and some minor\u2014to existing land use policies andmanagement plans (Dale et al., 2000). For example, subsidies, without which livestockgrazing on marginal habitats would not be economically feasible for many ranchers inthe western United States, should be eliminated to allow market forces to influence thedecision of whether grazing can continue (Myers and Kent, 1998). Similarly, cuts togovernment spending on the maintenance of existing, but non-essential roads could pro-vide an incentive to close seldom-used roads that may still be acting as corridors for thespread of invasive species. In addition, an incentive to change road maintenance sched-ules to avoid exacerbating invasions could be created by making eligibility for interna-tional or federal transportation grants contingent on implementing the proposed adapta-tions. This could help, for example, to stem the problem of roadside mowing to preventfire often resulting in the dominance of roadside grasslands by noxious weeds (Bene- field et al., 1999). CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 33 Implementing the proposed adaptations will undoubtedly pose considerable challenges. The most effective options for maximizing resilience may not always appear socioeco-nomically feasible, may not be legal, and may meet with considerable political resist-ance (Lee, 1993; Walker and Steffen, 1997; Soule and Terbourgh, 1999). Take for ex-ample the issue of restoring native fire regimes. From a scientific standpoint, a mixedstrategy in which managers let natural fires burn and conduct controlled burns in sys-tems where frequent fire is important for maintaining native vegetation, but suppress firein grasslands where it is naturally infrequent (e.g., Sagebrush/bunchgrass steppe; West,1983), might be appropriate. In the short-term, however, translating this scientific infor-mation into appropriate fire policy and management decisions is sure to prove con-tentious. While economic benefits of such an approach (e.g., reduced cover of invasivespecies, increased forage quality) could increase public support for this type of fire pol-icy in the long-term, such adaptations are unlikely to succeed without broad public sup-port from the beginning (Soule and Terbourgh, 1999). Thus, in addition to devisingmanagement strategies to maintain and restore resilience, ecologists and land managerswill need to work together with economists, sociologists, communication specialists,policymakers, and the public to devise economic and public relations strategies aimed atgaining the support of skeptical policymakers and landowners (Lee, 1993; McNeely,2000; Robertson and Hull, 2001; Dale et al., 2000). Communication and education strategies may include illustrations of how delaying man- agement improvements might prove more costly than taking immediate action (e.g., Walk-er and Steffen, 1997; Naylor, 2000; Ayres, 2001). Management guidance and educationmaterials can be made available via direct mailings, over the internet via public outreach,at local farmers'markets and community centers, and at meetings of involved stakeholderorganizations such as commerce, farming, ranching, and outdoor recreation associations. Funding for devising and implementing adaptations, typically a critical factor limiting the effectiveness of such functions as adaptive management, may come from interna-tional organizations such as the United Nations (e.g., UNEP), International Union forthe Conservation of Nature, the World Commission on Protected Areas, and the GlobalEnvironment Facility. National organizations such as the United States Invasive SpeciesCouncil, state-level agencies such as agriculture and transportation departments, andprivate foundations may also provide financial support. Technical expertise for imple-menting adaptations could be provided by groups such as NGOs, and university expertsand graduate students. Examples of Existing Adaptations Changes in grassland management that promote resilience are already being implement-ed on both public and private lands. In the southwestern United States, the Malpais Bor-derlands Group\u2014a coalition of ranchers, state and federal agencies, The Nature Conser-vancy, and private foundations\u2014have banded together to devise a grass-banking approach to conservation and restoration. Ranchers whose lands have suffered sufficientdeclines in productivity to limit their ability to graze livestock are now threatened withthe prospect of subdividing their lands to provide needed income. However, by joiningWWF 34 the group, they can gain access to a grass bank on which to graze livestock\u2014the 110,000 hectare Gray Ranch\u2014and receive restoration and recovery treatments such as native re-seeding and rest from grazing, as well as technical assistance and monitoring from grass-land management experts, in exchange for taking steps such as (1) donating a conserva-tion easement on their land to the group, which conserves grassland habitat bymaintaining their ranch as open space, while providing economic benefits such as re-duced estate taxes; and (2) allowing natural fires to burn, which helps beat back invasivewoody plants and stimulates the recovery of native grasses and wildflowers (Page, 1997). Of course, risks such as degradation of the grassbank, itself, will need to be avoided, andthis approach to grassland conservation and restoration remains an experiment inprogress. However, the Malpais Group has clearly devised an innovative approach forlandscape-scale conservation of privately owned grasslands, one that can certainly bemodified to serve as the basis for other large-scale private lands conservation efforts. An emerging approach with intriguing prospects for improving the health of publicly- owned grasslands is voluntary retirement of public lands grazing permits in the western United States (Salvo and Kerr, 2001). To encourage livestock removal from public landswhere soils and native species are vulnerable to or have been degraded by livestock im-pacts, NGOs are seeking to facilitate the purchase of grazing permits for above-marketvalue. This program would provide an opportunity for private land owners to cash in on the value of their public lands grazing permits, without the loss of their public grazingleases increasing pressure on them to subdivide and develop their privately-ownedparcels. Removing livestock from these public lands, in turn, would reduce the consid-erable deficits that the federal government incurs through its public lands grazing pro-gram (Myers and Kent, 1998), including by (1) maintaining livestock infrastructure onmarginal lands, (2) repairing livestock-caused degradation, and (3) controlling preda-tors. It would increase resilience to climate change by allowing for restoration of nativedisturbance regimes, plant communities, and soils on grasslands where livestock are anexotic ecological force. Finally, the practice of grassland restoration is accelerating (Harnett et al., 1996; DiTo- maso et al., 1999, 2001; US BLM, 1999). Due to the increasing realization that estab-lishment of native species will require restoration of native disturbance regimes, landmanagers are conducting controlled burns and reintroducing native herbivores (Menke,1992; Harnett et al., 1996; DiTomaso et al., 1999). Although many of these practices re-quire continued research, preliminary results are encouraging (e.g., D'Antonio et al.,2001). For example, three years of controlled burns almost entirely eliminated the coverand seed production of yellow starthistle and increased native bunchgrass cover by morethan five-fold (DiTomaso et al., 1999). In a tallgrass prairie, bison grazing and pre-scribed fire resulted in significant increases to plant species diversity and spatial hetero-geneity (Hartnett et al., 1996). By recognizing that land management should differ among grasslands depending on their natural disturbance regime, environmental conditions, and conservation status, byreigning in destructive land use practices, and, where possible, by restoring habitats, in-CHAPTER 1 GrasslandsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 35 cluding through the use of incentive-based conservation strategies, scientists, land man- agers, policymakers, and the public can work together to maintain and restore the re-silience of grassland ecosystems to climate change. Of course, this chapter has providedonly a general overview of potential adaptations, and the ability of the proposed strate-gies to confer resilience is not limitless in relation to climate change. For example, whilethese measures are most likely to be effective, in the short-term, in less degraded grass-lands, they may take decades to restore resilience in thoroughly degraded grasslands.Even then, if governments and corporations continue to resist the need for decisivemeasures to address the ultimate causes of climate change, such as the growing humanpopulation's greenhouse gas emissions and conversion of natural habitats to human uses(Schlesinger, 1997), there may be little that land managers can do to prevent continueddegradation, fragmentation, and loss of grasslands. At a time when humanity hasreached a crossroads, in one direction faced with a growing extinction crisis that is cer-tainly affecting grasslands (Sala et al., 2000), while in the other faced with the possibil-ity that environmental solutions abound with opportunities to improve economy andquality-of-life (Myers, 1996; Daily et al., 1997; Myers and Kent, 1998; Dasgupta et al.,2000), we owe it to ourselves and to future generations to protect and maintain theworld's grasslands from the potential consequences of global climate change.

Against this backdrop are forests and forest ecosys-tems, which have persisted for hundreds of millions of years. During this time majorfluctuations in the climate have caused vegetation to modify their composition, structureand function, or risk extinction. Forests as a biome have tolerated such climatic changesthrough their ability to migrate, relatively unencumbered, to suitable new habitat. Pastchanges have also occurred at a much slower pace than those seen today, allowingforests time to adapt. Many of today's forests, however, have undergone serious frag-mentation and degradation from roads, agriculture and development, and are thus im-peded in their ability to migrate as their local climate changes (Noss, 2000). It is in com-bination with these threats that the impacts of unprecedented rates of climate change cancompromise forest resilience, and distribution (IPCC, 2001). The following sections lay out the chief stresses to each of the different forest types from tropical regions to boreal forests, as well as the crucial components of each systemthat must be maintained for healthy ecosystem functioning. Then evidence of currentimpacts on each major forest type is reviewed, together with projections of likely futureimpacts determined from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and other scientific re-search. Analysis of these existing and future non-climate threats applied together withan overlay of climate change impacts for a particular forest type or ecoregion will helpconservationists understand what protection and other management options are avail-able to enhance forest resilience in the face of climate change. Stresses and Vulnerabilities Due to Factors Other Than Climate Change Forests cover almost a third of the Earth's landmass, representing the most substantial reservoir of terrestrial biological diversity. Scientists estimate that forests contain asmuch as two-thirds of all known terrestrial species (FAO, 2000). However, many forest-dwelling large mammals, half the large primates, and nearly 9% of all known treespecies are at some risk of extinction (WRI, 2000). CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 43WWF 44 About half of the world's original and intact \"frontier\" forest has been lost since the dawn of agriculture some 8,000 years ago (FAO, 2000). Just one fifth of originalforests exist in large and relatively natural ecosystems (Dirk et al., 1997). Most forestloss has occurred in the last three decades, largely due to human impacts. Deforestationhas been most absolute in the Temperate Zone, where only a fraction of the original in-tact forest still remains in scattered fragments (FAO, 2000). Close to 15 millionhectares of largely tropical natural forests are lost each year, equal to an area the size ofNepal (FAO, 2000). In addition, 1.5 million hectares are converted to forest plantationsevery year. The major cause of forest loss is conversion to other land uses as well as fragmentation from logging, agriculture, and settlement. Scientists assert that this hasalready resulted in the beginning of the 6th great extinction, and the first to be perpetu-ated by humans (Chapin et al., 2000). Although forest cover is stable in the boreal region, and slightly increasing in the tem- perate zone after prior deforestation, these trends hide the fact that the qualityof these forests has deteriorated drastically, impoverishing wildlife habitat for species dependentupon intact forest and unraveling ecosystem functions (FAO, 2000). An overview of existing and future non-climate threats to each of the major forest types is below, followed by a summary of possible or likely impacts from climate change it-self. A broad-brush analysis of these threats in combination with a discussion of the cru-cial components for each forest type provides a baseline for evaluating how resilienteach type will be in the future once an overlay of probable climate change impacts areapplied. Examples of threats to particular forest ecoregions are given in some instancesto illustrate a more detailed level of analysis of vulnerability to climate change. TROPICALAND SUBTROPICALMOIST BROADLEAF FORESTS Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests are extremely sensitive to disturbances such as plowing, overgrazing, and excessive burning due to limiting climatic and soil condi-tions. The dominant current threats to this forest type aside from climate change includeconversion to agricultural land as well as large-scale commercial logging. An area thesize of Ireland is lost due to conversion every few years within the tropical and subtrop-ical region (FAO, 2000). This forest loss, combined with the introduction of exotics onislands, is the primary driver behind a high rate of species extinction (WWF, 2003a). Looking at the immediate pressures to the health and functioning of a specific ecoregion is necessary before applying an overlay of climate change scenarios in order to helpidentify management options. The Eastern Arc Montane Forests of Kenya and Tanzaniaare among the oldest mountain ranges in Africa, and provide an illustrative example. Asis true with most mountainous regions in Africa, this forest system is isolated from othersimilar areas by great expanses of lowland habitats. Isolation has produced a high levelof endemism with many local species of plants and animals restricted to single moun-tain ranges. These microhabitats have experienced relatively moist conditions for longperiods of time, even during drying trends throughout much of the rest of Africa. Verylittle of the Eastern Arc Montane Forests is under protected status, though all of theCHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 45 mountains are under pressure from agricultural expansion on lower slopes, firewood collection, and grazing (WWF, 2003b). Careful analysis of these existing and futurenon-climate threats applied together with an analysis of climate change impacts willhelp conservationists understand what protection and other management options areavailable to augment migration possibilities for endemic species that may be challenged with excessive changes in temperature and precipitation regimes within this ecoregion. TROPICALAND SUBTROPICALDRY BROADLEAF FORESTS Tropical and subtropical dry forests require large natural areas in order to maintain large predators and other vertebrates, to buffer sensitive species from hunting pressure, and toabsorb occasional large fire events. Many dry forest species are reliant upon watersources and the persistence of riparian forests. In general, dry forests are extremely sen-sitive to excessive burning and deforestation, overgrazing and the introduction of exoticspecies. Restoration is possible though can be particularly challenging in intensely de-graded areas. (WWF, 2003c) In the Mexican Dry Forest, a growing urban population, increasing tourism and ex- ploitation of wildlife are extremely serious threats to the ecoregion. Changing land usesfor road construction, perennial plantations, and ranch farms are also a source of con-cern. (WWF, 2003d) A detailed layout of these threats, together with information on thedistribution of sensitive species would serve as a preliminary step to analyzing thisecoregion's vulnerability to climate change. TROPICALAND SUBTROPICALCONIFEROUS FORESTS Healthy tropical and subtropical coniferous forests are of sufficient size to withstanddisturbances such as fire, windthrow, and outbreaks of disease. Several species, as wellas successional processes are dependent on fire, however. Late-successional species,which are highly sensitive to logging and fragmentation due to slow regeneration rates,require special attention in management plans. Exotics also can have extensive impactson these forests. The Mesoamerican Pine-Oak Forests of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua contain among the world's most extensive subtropical coniferous forests,with many plant and animal species limited to particular locales. This ecoregion is alsounder pressure from fragmentation due to commerical logging, overgrazing by live-stock, and conversion to agriculture. TEMPERATE BROADLEAF AND MIXED FORESTS Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests have been degraded and deforested to a great ex- tent through habitat conversion, resource extraction, and through the introduction of ex-otic species (Wilcove et al., 1998). Carnivores inhabiting these forests have large homeranges, and forests must be of adequate size to maintain resilience to large-scale distur-bance events such as fire. Late-successional forests are vital for the survival of manyplants, lichen, fungi and invertebrates in this ecosystem. (WWF, 2003e) Some speciesinhabiting these forests show great sensitivity to fragmentation. This list includes breed-WWF 46 ing songbirds exposed to parasitism or elevated nest predation, as well as many forest understory species whose migration to other suitable forest is hindered by deforestedareas. The loss of large native predators has substantial cascading effects on forest struc-ture and ecology; and the introduction of exotic species can have large impacts on nativecommunities as well. However, restoration potential for this forest type is high. The Southwest China Temperate Forests, home to the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and many other rare species, contain some of the richest assemblages of temperate forest trees in the world and exhibit high endemism and unusal biogeograph-ic patterns. Conversion to agriculture and fragmentation and degradation for timber arethe principal threats to this ecoregion. (WWF, 2003f) A map of the distribution of wherefragmentation and degradation is occuring, together with an analysis of crucial habitatwill provide the baseline necessary to analyze climate change threats so that conserva-tion plans can be adjusted accordingly. TEMPERATE CONIFEROUS FORESTS Temperate coniferous forests likewise require sufficient patch sizes in order to maintain larger carnivores which are extremely wide-ranging, as well as species that track re-sources that may vary widely in time and space with disease outbreaks, fires, and coneproduction. Large carnivores are highly sensitive to encroachment upon their homeranges, and many species are sensitive to habitat fragmentation, particularly of late-suc-cessional species which may regenerate slowly. Fires are necessary in many temperateforests in order to maintain successional processes. (WWF, 2003g) The Altai-Sayan Montane Forests are experiencing a number of threats, including clear- ance of the forest, over-collection of plants and hunting along the banks of larger riversand in heavily populated areas such as the Kusnetsk Basin, Salair, Alatau Kuznetsk andsouthwestern Altai. Overgrazing is a problem in some alpine andsub-alpine areas, as is mining and the threat of extensive wildfires that have engulfedlarge areas within the ecoregion. (WWF, 2003h) BOREALFORESTS Boreal forests suffer from a variety of atmospheric threats unrelated to climate change,such as acid rain, UV-B radiation (from depletion of atmospheric ozone), and smog.There are also direct threats, including degradation from logging, mining and oil extrac-tion, pipelines, and roads. Extreme weather events, such as ice storms, are highly dam-aging to trees (and could become increasingly prevalent as climate patterns shift). At the same time, it is important to take into account those aspects of boreal forests that are crucial to its long-term viability. Natural disturbances such as fires, which cycle nu-trients, and pests and diseases, which allow the introduction of early successional speciesby killing off adult trees, are often carefully balanced. (Sekula, 2000). In the CanadianBoreal Forests, man-made activities threaten the extent of the forest. Mining activities inthe north, and logging in the southwest are constraints to healthy ecosystem function.MEDITERRANEAN FORESTS Mediterranean forests have largely been degraded through conversion to agriculture, pasture and to urban development. Fire, logging, the introduction of exotics, and inten-sive grazing are all present threats as well. Native mediterranean forests are very sensi-tive to habitat fragmentation, grazing, and alteration of fire regimes (through overburn-ing or fire suppression). The loss of natural groundwater in many Mediterranean regionsalso has large-scale impacts on biodiversity through the alteration of riverine and flood-plain systems. Protection of riparian areas, and blocks of native habitat large enough tosustain regular fire events by leaving sufficient unburned areas to retain genetic diversi-ty are crucial (WWF, 2003i). MANGROVES Mangroves play an integral role in the coastal ecosystem, and are of invaluable local andglobal ecological, economic and social importance. Mangroves live in estuarine set-tings, acting as a buffer between marine and freshwater systems. In this capacity theyare known to act as a filter of local water and can protect shorelines from eroding forces.Mangrove forests also protect seagrass beds and coral reefs from deposition of suspend-ed matter that is transported seaward by rivers. This forest type inhabits waterlogged,salty soils along coasts in the tropics and subtropics where they experience tidal flow.Mangroves are dependent upon a relatively stable hydrographic and salinity regime, andthey are susceptible to pollution and the alteration of salinity levels. Mangroves currently suffer from large-scale conversion and degradation (Ellison and Farnsworth, 1997). In some countries such as India, the Philippines and Vietnam, over 50% of mangrove ecosystems have been lost in the last hundred years. Mangrove treesare harvested for timber, fuel, or pulp, and are also cleared for aquaculture or other de-velopment. Deterioration of a mangal occurs when the mangrove is clearcut, when the water flow pattern is disrupted, or when the water level becomes too high so that the aer- ial roots are unable to obtain oxygen. Pollution, particularly oil, can also interfere withthe exchange of gas from mangal roots. The Gulf of Guinea contains Africa's most extensive mangroves, which help to stabilize a large part of the West African shoreline. Forming a dense barrier between sea and land, themangrove is a crucial food reservoir for coastal people who rely on its supply of shrimpand crabs, as well as its wood for fuel. It is also a vital host to a number of endangeredspecies, including the African manatee, pygmy hippopotamus, and clawless otter. The areais currently under high stress from urbanization, industrialization, and agriculture, and isexperiencing impacts from timber and petroleum exploitation around the Gulf coast. Assess Present and Future Stress and Vulnerability Due to Climate Change A warmer climate and changes in precipitation patterns will cause disparate effects on forest ecosystems, making some contract while others will expand. Increases in CO2 will compound this effect in some systems while dampening the impacts in other sys- CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 47WWF 48 tems. Together this indicates that many areas, especially those habitats along environ- mental gradients, will be subjected to change, and if the population cannot adapt ormove with changes in climate, they will face extinction. Globally, it has been estimated that at least one-third of the world's remaining forests may be adversely impacted by climate change over the next century (IPCC, 1995). Cli-mate change may force species to migrate or shift their ranges far faster than they areable to, thereby disrupting existing ecosystems (Kirilenko et al., 2000; Stewart et al.,1997). Forests may experience changes in fire intensity and frequency, increased sus-ceptibility to insect damage or diseases, and extreme weather events which they may notbe adapted to survive (IPCC, 2001). Predictions for the impacts climate change will continue to have on forests are gathered in a number of ways. At a large scale, it is possible to predict major shifts in biome typesby combining biogeography models such as the Holdridge Life Zone ClassificationModel with general circulation models (GCMs) that project changes under a doubledCO 2scenario. Biogeochemistry models simulate the gain, loss and internal cycling of carbon, nutrients, and water-impact of changes in temperature, precipitation, soil mois-ture, and other climatic factors that give clues to ecosystem productivity. Dynamic glob-al vegetation models integrate biogeochemical processes with dynamic changes in veg-etation composition and distribution. Studies on particular species comparing presenttrends with paleological data also provide indications for how species will weather oradapt to future climate change. (Hansen et al., 2001) Forests are both directly and indirectly impacted by climate change. The direct impacts of warming temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns or extreme weather events on forests are already evident in certain tree and animal species (IPCC, 2001). Even smallchanges in temperature and precipitation can have significant affects on forest growth andsurvival (e.g., for certain species of pine; Rehfeldt, 1999; and in tropical montane cloudforests; Hilbert et al., 2001; Pounds et al., 1999), particularly those in threshold areas or atthe margins of an ecosystem. Higher temperatures increase water loss through evapotran-spiration, which result in drier conditions, as well as decreasing a plant's efficiency ofwater use (NRC, 2002). Increases in temperature can also have dramatic implications for the timing of flowering and fruiting for plants (Beaubien and Freeland, 2000; Bazazz,1998), and can also directly affect growth rates and other physiological factors that willcause species to migrate or become extinct. Forests will also be directly threatened bychanges in the seasonality of precipitation and increases in extreme weather events such ashurricanes, flooding, lightning, and wind storms (Dale et al., 2001; Hansen et al., 2001;IPCC, 2001; NAST, 2001; Peterson, 2000). Forest characteristics and age-class structureplay a large role in determining how a forest will respond to changes in moisture condi-tions (NRC, 2002). Mature forests have well-established root systems, and are thereforebetter able to withstand drought-like conditions, whereas younger forests and post-distur-bance stands are more vulnerable to decreases in moisture (Gitay et al., 2001). Somespecies are also more tolerant to variable moisture conditions than others.CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 49 Disturbances are a natural part of the functioning of forest ecosystems, and are integral in bringing about succession. Most forests are in some state of reestablishment after dis-turbances, which themselves result in a change in ecosystem function as species compo-sition and the structure of the forest changes. However, an extreme change in foreststructure and function can take place when disturbances exceed their natural range ofvariation (Dale et al., 2000). Climate change affects forests both directly and indirectly through disturbances such as fire (Flannigan et al., 2000), drought (Howden et al.,2003), introduced species (Simberloff, 2000), insect (Ayres 2000), hurricanes (Loope and Giambelluca, 1998), wind storms (Peterson,2000) and ice storms (Irland, 2000) (Dale et al., 2000). Impacts can be seen across anarray of spatial scales, from the leaf to the forest landscape, and can include a reductionin leaf function, deformed tree structure, tree death, altered regeneration patternsthrough the destruction of seed banks, a disruption in the physical environment fromsoil erosion and nutrient loss, and increased patchiness of forest communities (Dale etal., 2000). Because trees survive for long periods of time and take many years to becomeestablished, many climate change impacts on forests will be expressed through alter-ations in disturbance regimes (Franklin et al., 1991; Dale et al., 2000; Dale et al., 2001). Other indirect effects of climate change on forests are often difficult to detect due to the complex and interdependent nature of ecosystem components. Yet, many indirect effectsare just as serious if not more so than some direct effects, due to the cascading nature ofthe relationships (Hansen et al., 2001). For example, an alteration of the timing of flow-ering and fruiting caused by temperature changes can have a relatively minor impactupon the plant species, but the cascading effects on animal species dependent upon thefruit could be substantial (Bazazz, 1998). Likewise, changes in precipitation patternscaused by climate change will likely cause greater conversion of intact forest areas assome agricultural lands experience drought and erosion. The impacts on forests from elevated levels of atmospheric CO 2have been studied, though the results are \"neither clear nor conclusive\" (NRC, 2002; Gitay et al., 2001).Higher concentrations of CO 2generally improve efficiency of water use as plants open their stomata less and thereby reduce water loss through transpiration, though disparateresults for overall plant growth have been shown, depending on the species, individualtree age, and length of study period (NRC, 2002). Moreover, plants have been shown toadjust to higher CO 2levels such that the higher absorption rates can decrease over time (Gitay et al., 2001). Difficulties of modeling the effects of elevated CO2concentrations are compounded when other anthropogenic emissions are considered. For example,ozone (O 3) offsets potential benefits of CO2on plant productivity (Karnosky et al., 1999; Isebrands et al., 2001); while nitrogen oxides may enhance forest growth in nitro-gen-limited systems (Robinson et al., 2002). Within the next 50-100 years, changes to ecosystem functions and plant demographic processes will be the imminent threats, though in the long term, large shifts in foresttypes are likely to occur (Hilbert et al., 2001). Looking broadly at forest types, borealWWF 50 forests are expected to be impacted severely through a reduction in extent since warm- ing will be greatest at the poles (IPCC, 2001). In the tropics, the impacts of sea-level riseare predicted to be significant for mangroves as they are inundated in many areas (IPCC,2001). In tropical forests more generally, the effects of drought and changes in season-ality will compound existing threats of fragmentation and degradation. Across all foresttypes, some of the most vulnerable will be island or relict forest communities, includinghighly fragmented forests surrounded by agricultural or urban development and forestsystems on remote islands whose migration opportunities are hindered either latitudi-nally or altitudinally, as in the case with tropical montane cloud forests (Dudley, 1998).Individual species especially vulnerable are those with limited geographical ranges withlow rates of germination or survival of seedlings and those with limited seed dispersal orother migration capabilities (IPCC, 2001). Those species inhabiting the boundaries ofheat or drought tolerant limits may be especially at risk. More detailed information onthe extent of impacts for each major forest type is outlined below. Dudley (1998) provides an overview of major categories of changes expected in forest ecosystems: DISTURBANCE: climate change will increase the degree of disturbance, through extreme weather events such as storms and as a result of smaller but ultimately more pervasive changes to seasonality, rainfall and tempera-ture. Climate change will thus add to those other forms of human disturbance, which are currently fragmentingand altering forest ecosystems. SIMPLIFICATION: the net effects of problems with tree reproduction and species' migration rates in areas experi- encing severe climate change will tend to cause problems for slower growing species and instead favour fastgrowing, short-lived weed and invasive species. The result will be an acceleration of a trend that is already oc-curring as a result of other forms of human interference, namely, the replacement of species-rich forests byspecies-poor forests. MOVEMENT:is likely both geographically and altitudinally, as growing conditions alter. The ability of trees to migrate fast enough to keep pace with climate change is still largely unknown and will depend upon many other factors.The extent to which ecological conditions change will depend on a complex mixture of factors: for example,warmer conditions could encourage trees to move up-slope while accompanying droughts might have the re-verse effect. AGE REDUCTION: disturbance, increased forest fires, changes in pest patterns and the transition of whole com- munities will encourage an existing trend towards the replacement of old-growth forests with younger stands.This has particularly important implications for biodiversity, as many of today's threatened species are thoseconfined to older habitats. EXTINCTION OR EXTIRPATION: some of the most vulnerable forest habitats, including relict species at the edge of their ecological niche and some particularly threatened systems, such as mangroves on low-lying islands,could disappear altogether. Species could also disappear from some forests that appear to be surviving thechanges relatively well.CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 51 CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON TROPICALMOIST FORESTS Although warming will be greatest at the poles, the impacts of climate change on tropical forests can still be substantial due to their relative sensitivity to climatic variables. Phenolog-ical processes are highly correlated with climatic signals. Any changes in climate can havesignificant impacts on a forest ecosystem. Changes in plant phenology are said to be themost immediate indicators of climate change (Corlett and LaFrankie, 1998). Related to thisare the coevolutionary relationships that are highly specialized and could become disruptedif a species is affected by a changed phenological event or physiologically (Bazzaz, 1998). Perhaps most importantly, high species diversity per unit area in tropical moist forestscreates narrow niches that may be severely impacted by a reduction in biodiversitythrough elimination of species when migration to other suitable habitats is not an option(Bazzaz, 1998). The sensitivity of hydrological regimes in tropical forests due to existing levels of de- forestation could be exacerbated through a change in structure and function, particular-ly in low-lying areas where floods may increase in frequency and intensity (Bonell,1998). The predicted decline in the rainfall in the Amazon Basin and the intensificationof the Indian monsoon will have large-scale effects on availability of water for tropicalforests (Bazzaz, 1998). The frequency and intensity of fire are likely to increase due to climate change in tropi- cal moist forests, where fire is naturally rare or nonexistent. The interrelationships offire, climate and forest ecology are complex, and will depend upon a particular forest type. However, in some places, an increase in drought could cause desiccation of forestthat could spur more fires. Alternatively, increased precipitation results in more biomasswhich provides a larger fuel load that in turn makes forests that are already vulnerable\u2014due to framentation and other human-induced threats\u2014more susceptible to large-scalefire events. Most tropical moist forests are not resistant to fires, which could cause a large-scale loss of biodiversity. These forests will experience a change in species com-position increasingly favoring xeromorphic, pyrophytic and generally species-poorplant communities that create a positive feedback as the new ecosystem will be increas-ingly liable to burn. Extreme cases would result in desertification. (Dudley, 1998;Goldammer and Price, 1998) At a course level, distributional shifts in forest types have been predicted for a number of tropical forest regions using Global Circulation Models that focus on temperature andprecipitation changes. A 1 \u00b0C rise in temperature would increase the productivity ofrainforests as a whole as long as all other factors are held constant. However, changes inrainfall patterns combined with warming can produce sizeable shifts in the distributionof forest types. Increased rainfall enhances growth of tropical moist forests (holdingfire, pests, and the effects of other factors constant), while decreased precipitation could shift existing tropical moist forests to favor woodlands and tropical dry forests. (Hilbert,in press). Several of the member countries to the United Nations Framework ConventionWWF 52 on Climate Change within the tropics have conducted an analysis of expected distribu- tional changes in forest types. For example, the composition of forest types in Thailandis estimated to change dramatically, with subtropical forests declining and tropicalforests in the southern region of the country increasing due to increases in precipitationcombined with an increase in temperature (OEPP, 2000). In general, many shifts in dis-tribution are expected to take place at the edges of forest types and in ecotonal areas be-tween rainforest and more open forest areas (Hilbert, 2001). TROPICALMONTANE CLOUD FORESTS Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TCMF) are an important subset of moist tropical forests from a climate change perspective. Even small-scale shifts in temperature andprecipitation are expected to have serious consequences for tropical forests in the highmountains; indeed, many of the impacts have already caused species extinctions.TCMFs are especially vulnerable because they reside in areas with steep gradients asso-ciated with their ecosystem boundaries where the climatic conditions are highly specif-ic and therefore catered to endemic biota. Atmospheric warming is raising the altitude ofcloud cover that provides TCMF species with moisture via predictable and prolongedimmersion in clouds (Pounds et al., 1999). The habitat for TCMF species will shift upthe slopes of mountains as they follow the retreating cloud base, forcing populations ofreptiles and other species into an increasingly smaller area. The extreme sensitivity of the microclimates of TCMFs to climate change make a good case for using these systems as a 'listening post'for detecting climate change (Loope etal., 1998). Several examples exist around the globe. In the highland rainforests of Mon-teverde, Costa Rica, the lifting of the cloud base associated with increased ocean tem-peratures has been linked to the disappearance of 20 species of frogs. (Pounds et al.,1999). The Wet Tropics World Heritage Area of northeastern Queensland in Australiaprovides another example of highland tropical habitat whose complex topography hasresulted in highly specialized 'cool islands' housing extremely rare fauna that will bethreatened by a warmer, drier local climate in the next few decades (Hilbert, 2001). Adoubled CO 2scenario will shift relative humidity up-slope by hundreds of meters dur- ing the winter dry season when forests are most reliant on moisture from clouds. Withonly one degree of warming, the highland rainforest habitat in this area could decreasethe amount of habitat by as much as half, causing one-third of endemics to decrease. Itis entirely probably that 30-50 species and most highland faunal species will disappearwith average temperature increases of 1-5 \u00b0C (Hilbert et al., 2001). Yet another exampleexists in East Maui, Hawaii, where the steep microclimatic gradients in montane tropi- cal forests, combined with increases in interannual variability in precipitation and hurri-canes are expected to produce a situation where endemic biota will likely be displacedby non-native plants and animals (Loope et al., 1998). CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON TROPICALDRY FORESTS The bulk of reported and predicted impacts of climate change on tropical dry forests con-cern the desiccation and related fire risk of this forest type. A simulation using theCHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 53 Holdridge Classification Model integrated with GCMs under a doubling of CO2in the next century for Tanzania shows that a decline in precipitation and increase in ambienttemperature will produce a shift from subtropical dry forest and subtropical moist forest totropical very dry forest, tropical dry forest, and small areas of tropical moist forests. Pre-dictions of increased disease and predation of seeds and seedlings are expected to cause achange in species composition and structure in the Kitulandgalo Forest Reserve as somespecies will fail to establish themselves. (Mwakifwamba and Mwakasonda, 2001) InThailand, subtropical dry forest that currently covers little over one percent of the coun-try's total forest area may disappear entirely as it is replaced by tropical dry forests andtropical very dry forest emerging in the north and northeast of the country (OEPP, 2000). A change in the precipitation, either through an annual increase or decrease is expected to make tropical dry forests subject to greater risk from forest fires in the immediateterm. For areas where precipitation is expected to decrease, thus prolonging the dry sea-sons, increased desiccation makes the forest system more likely to ignite. Reduction ofNet Primary Productivity (NPP) combined with the growing impacts of grazing andfarming, however, will lead to a landscape which is more sparse and unable to support the spread of fires. In areas that are predicted to experience enhanced precipitation, anincrease in plant biomass will lead to a more continuous source of fuel to support morefrequent and intense fires. However, a trend of increased fire occurrence tends to leadeventually to a general decrease of fires due to the reduction of fuelbeds over time. (Goldammer and Price, 1998) CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON TEMPERATE FORESTS The effects of climate change are already apparent in temperate forests such as in theUnited States and Canada, where a 1-2 \u00b0C increase in ambient air temperature andchanges in precipitation have been documented for the past century (Watson et al., 1998).Forest decline and dieback along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts are thought to be related to increased levels of CO 2(Mueller-Dombois, 1992). A further increase in ambient air temperature is expected to shift the range of suitable habitat for temperate forests north-ward - in the case of the United States, between 100 to 530 km during the next century (Iverson et al., 1999; Iverson and Prasad, 2001). Assuming a 2 \u00b0C warming over the sametime period, tree species will be forced to migrate at a rate of approximately 1-3 miles peryear, which is much too rapid for the bulk of temperate species, except for those whosemigration is aided by birds carrying their seeds. In general, a shift in species compositionto more heat-tolerant 'fast adapters', even grasslands, is likely (NAST, 2001). Indeed,species associated with human-dominated landscapes as well as exotics which are moretolerant to climatic extremes have already greatly expanded their ranges in the UnitedStates (Drake et al., 1989; Flather et al., 1999). Flora and fauna inhabiting temperate forests will be affected physiologically, as well as through a loss of habitat and an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts,floods, windstorms, and wildfires that could increase tree mortality. As forests shift,they will become increasingly vulnerable to additional disturbances, such as diseasesWWF 54 and other pests, as well as to fires as natural species regimes are altered (NAST, 2001). Warming can be particularly detrimental to many tree species when increased tempera- ture speeds up the development of insects and pathogens, and thereby increases rates ofinfestations (Hansen et al., 2001). Increased desiccation in fragmented temperateforests, such as those in the Bassit upland and the Jebel Saheiliyeh in Syria may be seri-ously threatened through an increase in wildfires (Dudley, 1998). Some models predict an overall increase in forest productivity with increased tempera- ture, though other climatic-induced disturbances may counteract this. In addition, in-creases in productivity of one system may have negative effects in linked systems. Forexample, increases in forest productivity in the Great Plains could decrease the avail- ability of water to aquatic ecosystems such as the Mississippi River intercoastal water-ways. (NAST, 2001) The National Assessment Synthesis Team (NAST) of the U.S. Global Change Research Program finds that a vast degree of biodiversity change is expected in the United States(NAST, 2001). The maple/beech/birch forests currently present in the AppalachianRange from New England and as far south as West Virginia and western Pennsylvaniacould disappear. The aspen and birch forests in the Upper Great Lakes region could belost, while patches of red spruce forest communities may become extinct in its presentrange. Assuming a gradual warming, these forests will likely be replaced by oak/pineand oak/hickory forests, though a significant total loss of forest cover may occur ifwarming is more extreme and coupled with increased droughts, wildfires and/or insect infestations. An increase in the total area of forests burned could be on the order of 25-50% as increases in productivity create larger fuel loads that spark fires when coupledwith more intense periodic droughts. (NAST, 2001; Howden et al., 2003). Some predictthat warming in cooler areas such as in the northern United States and western moun-tains near the Canadian border will increase tree richness (Currie, 2001) and benefit rep-tiles and amphibians; though a quarter overall decrease in bird and mammal richness isalso predicted, especially in the eastern U.S. (NAST, 2001; Hansen et al., 2001). Similar trends are predicted for temperate forests in Scandinavia, where Norway spruce and beech are expected to move north and possibly replace other forest communitiessuch as those with dwarf birch. Likewise, in China, cold temperate coniferous forestsand mixed temperate coniferous and boreal forests will likely be reduced (Dudley,1998). A comparative analysis of vegetation distribution in the Montseny mountains ofCatalonia in northeastern Spain over the last half century shows a replacement of cold-temperate forests with Mediterranean forests that is correlated with warming combinedwith the cessation of traditional land management. Beech (Fagus sylvatica) and heather (Calluna vulgaris) are (Quercus ilex) forest at mid-altitudes (800-1400 m), which has resulted in isolation and degradation of beech communitiesthrough its shift upwards in altitude. Within the isolated beech stands, the trees are moredefoliated (by 30%), recruitment is 41% lower, and holm oak recruitment is three timeshigher than in more stable and continuous beech stands. (Pe\u00f1uelas and Boada, 2003) CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON BOREALFORESTS Warming is being felt more at the poles, with an expected rise of 4-5 \u00b0C during winter that may go as high as 10 \u00b0C over the next century according to some models (Sekula,2000). The overall effect of this warming will affect the species composition and otherecological services of two-thirds of boreal forests (Kirschbaum and Fischlin, 1996), andcause a dramatic loss of between 25% and 40% of boreal forest area, as gains in thenorth are unable to keep up with replacement by temperate species in the south (Stone,1996). Boreal forests will be replaced at lower latitudes by temperate forest species,grasslands, and in Russia, forest-steppe. Boreal forest habitat is predicted to migratepoleward by 300-500 km in the next century (IPCC, 1996b). In Russia, a reduction inboreal forests on the order of 19% and loss of productivity is predicted through GeneralCirculation Models (Krankina et al. 1997). Plant hardiness zones have already shifted inaccordance with warming over the last century in Canada, most notably in the westernpart of the country (McKenney et al., 2001). Migration will be inhibited to a great extent, however, by inhospitable tundra soils and lack of biota that is necessary for colonization. The rate of colonization by tree speciesdiffers greatly, depending on the seed dispersal rate and range of tolerance, for examplewith white spruce rate of 25 km/century through seed dispersal andpropagule establishment (Solomon, 1992) will mean that the rate of warming is likely tobe approximately 10 times faster than that needed for successful species migration (Jar-dine, 1994). Moreover, tree species will be impeded from successful migration due tobarriers such as habitat fragmentation and competition from more hardy exotic species(Iverson and Prasad, 2001; James, 2001; Collingham and Huntley, 2000). Many tree species will also suffer physiological problems or changes in the timing and rate of seed production (Stewart et al., 1997) which will inhibit growth and reestablishmentrates and in the long term, successful migration. Plants with narrow temperature tolerances,slow growth characteristics (Kirschbaum and Fischlin, 1997) and limited dispersal mecha-nisms (e.g. heavy seeds) will be the most vulnerable (Thompson et al., 1998). A new com-position of species favoring early successional trees and shrubs over slow-growing woodyspecies will be the net result (which will also entail a total loss of stored carbon). Further, adrastic change in species composition and loss of overall habitat with even 2 \u00b0C warmingnear the poles will cause a loss of ecosystem functionality as species richness is diminished.A decrease in habitat through this scenario would result in the loss of animals inhabiting theboreal Great Basin mountain ranges on the order of 10-50% (IPCC, 1996b). An average rise in temperature of 1 \u00b0C over Canada in the last century has had an impact on plant physiology and phenology (NRC, 2002). At mid to high latitudes (45\u00b0N and70\u00b0N), warming has corresponded with increased plant growth and the length of thegrowing season (Myneni et al., 1997). Warming that was accompanied by a decrease inprecipitation has had a detrimental impact on plant growth in some tree species in west-ern Canada such as aspen poplar, where reduced tree ring growth has been associated CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 55WWF 56 with drought events (Hogg et al., 2001). Reproductive timing in tree species has also been recorded, for example the trembling aspen in Alberta has begun blooming 26 daysearlier over the last century (Beaubien and Freeland, 2000), and the bud break of whitespruce in Ontario is also taking place earlier (Colombo, 1998). Boreal forests are expected to become victims of increased insect infestations with the onset of warmer conditions. Many temperate pests such as the mountain pine beetle, nor-mally limited by cold in boreal ranges, will expand their range, and many boreal treespecies will be ill-equipped to deal with their infiltration, especially if ecosystem health isalready compromised. At the same time, local boreal pests will be given longer periods toflourish under warmer winters. (Stewart et al., 1997; Sekula, 2000) Fleming et al. (2001)document historical trends that show that spruce budworm outbreaks increase the frequen-cy of wildfires by increasing the amount of dead plant matter that serves as fuel for fires. Warmer and drier conditions will also lead to changes in hydrological regimes, and have large-scale impacts through more frequent, severe, and widespread forest fires. Climatewill be the underlying cause of ecosystem change via fire, which is the major distur-bance regime in the boreal ecosystem. Studies have shown that fire frequency as well asthe total area burned has increased in the last 20 to 40 years in accordance with warmertemperatures (Schindler, 1998; Kasischke et al., 1999; Stocks et al., 2000). A longer fireseason, drier conditions and an increase in lightning storms are projected to increase thefire season severity in accordance with climate change (Stocks et al., 1998; Goldammer and Price, 1998). An initial increase in fires will aid the migration of fire-adaptedspecies to germinate, as well as providing nutrients to the soil. However, over time, in-creased fragmentation due to fire will inhibit chances for migration. The result will be ashift of age class distributions toward younger forests (and a decrease in stored carbon). CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON MEDITERRANEAN FORESTS Hulme and Sheard (1999) provide an overview of the most notable effects of a warmingand drying trend in the Mediterranean region, including a decrease in water availabilityand a corresponding increase in fires, both of which will have significant impacts uponregional biodiversity. Increased dessication brought on by climate change will furthercompound a trend towards reductions in groundwater supplies due to intensification offarming and urbanization. In the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the annual mean temperature has risen by nearly 1.6 \u00b0C over the last century, where the warmestyears occurred in 1989, 1995 and 1997. Precipitation is expected to decrease by an av-erage of 5-15% annually. Winters are expected to get wetter while the other seasons areexpected to become drier, especially summer. Fires, while a natural component to the ecosystem, are becoming increasingly threatening, and an increase in occurrence andarea burned is strongly correlated with increasing daily maximum temperature and de-creasing humidity. In 1994, a fire burned almost half a million hectares of Spanish for-est and shrubland and killed 31 people. A loss of Mediterranean woodland habitat willhave a noted impact upon the endangered Iberian lynx due to a reduction in two of itsvital food sources\u2014rabbit and duck. CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 57 CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON MANGROVES The principal climate change-induced threat to mangroves comes from sea-level rise. Floods in the East African coastal region point to high vulnerability in this region(IPCC, 2001). In Bangladesh and India, the biodiversity of the Sunderbans is at greatrisk due to rising seas; a one meter rise in sea level will likely cause the Sunderbans andthe tiger with it to disappear (IPCC, 2001). Rising sea-levels bring about changes in sediment dynamics, erosion and changes in salinity, all of which could compromise the ability of a mangrove system to survive.Many communities will be inundated while others will suffer from changes to hydro-logical and salinity regimes. Inundation has been shown to bring about a decrease inphotosynthesis and increase salinity and salt stress during floods in the Everglades Na-tional Park in Florida (Dudley, 1998). Moreover, sea level rise is expected to take placeat about twice the rate at which sediment build-up\u2014necessary for the mangrove's sur-vival\u2014will occur and cause the sinking of many deltas. Lastly, \"erosion will reduce thesize of mangroves, by cliff erosion on the seaward edge that undercuts mangrove roots,through sheet erosion across the swamp surface and by cutting away of tidal creekbanks\" (Dudley, 1998). Canvass and Assess Adaptation Options After completing a vulnerability analysis to determine how a forest system may be im-pacted by changing climatic conditions, the next step is to look at the range of adapta-tion options available in order to promote resiliency. An effective vulnerability analysiswill determine which components of the system\u2014species or functions, for example\u2014will be most vulnerable to change, together with consideration of which parts of the sys-tem are crucial for ecosystem health. An array of options pertinent to adapting forests toclimate change are available, both to apply to forest communities at high risk from cli-mate change impacts as well as for those whose protection should be prioritized givenexisting resiliency. Long-term adaptation of species will be enabled where natural adap- tation processes such as migration, selection, and change in structure are allowed to takeplace due to sufficient connectivity and habitat size within the landscape. Forest adaptation options are not dissimilar from traditional forest conservation meth- ods; however great emphasis is placed upon increasing spatial and temporal scales, pro-tection of key forest communities, managing specifically for increased disturbances,and flexibility given uncertainties and surprises surrounding what climate change willbring. The menu of options below all seek to maintain the health of forest biodiversity asthe overarching vehicle for successful adaptation. Criteria for sustainable forest man-agement outlined in the Montreal Process of the United Nations Conference on Envi-ronment and Development include maintenance of forest ecosystem health, conserva-tion of biodiversity, maintenance of forest productivity, and conservation of soil andwater resources (MPWG, 1998). Sustainable forest management criteria provide a framework into which adaptation strategies can be incorporated (NRC, 2002). WWF 58 1. REDUCE PRESENTTHREATS The most apparent strategy for improving forest resilience to climate change is to promote overall ecosystem health. As discussed earlier, a variety of present non-cli-mate threats to forest systems exist, namely conversion, fragmentation, and degra-dation. Identifying and targeting for action the reduction of priority threats in a par-ticular forest system will go far in ensuring that forest structure, composition, andfunction that increase a forest's resilience are maintained. 2. AVOID FRAGMENTATION AND PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY Noss (2000) provides an overview of the negative effects of ecosystem fragmenta-tion which are abundantly documented worldwide. \"Edge effects\" threaten the mi-croclimate and stability of a forest as the ratio of edge to interior habitat increases.Eventually, the ability of a forest to withstand debilitating impacts is broken. Frag-mentation of forest ecosystems also contributes to a loss of biodiversity as exotic,weedy species with high dispersal capacities are favored and many native speciesare inhibited by isolation. The importance of minimizing road networks deserves special consideration. Roads exacerbate the effect of a warmer climate to increase the incidence and rate of inva- sions of forests by pest and disease by encouraging the dispersal of invasive exoticspecies. They also restrict the dispersal of less mobile native species. 3. MAXIMIZE SIZE OF MANAGEMENTUNITS\u2014DECISION-MAKING ON ALARGE, BIOGEOGRAPHIC SCALE The fossil record provides evidence that species have adapted to changing climates by shifting their ranges. Protected areas established to conserve a particular speciesmay not contain appropriate habitat in the next few decades. Overlaying a climatechange scenario upon existing protected areas and other management units will givemanagers an indication of where a given habitat will occur to enable revision ofmanagement boundaries. However, given the rather crude estimation of climatechange impacts within particular locales as well as the largely unknown change inecosystem dynamics that will occur, it is prudent to give forest systems the maxi-mum allowance of habitat in which to migrate (Noss, 2000). Attention should begiven in the design of protected area networks to the need for north-south as well asaltitudinal migration opportunities. The solution in this case does not rely solely ona reorientation of protected area boundaries, but also to a paradigm shift where de-cision-making regarding land uses takes place on a large, biogeographic scale to in-clude potential habitat outside reserves (Hilbert, In Press). 4. PROVIDE BUFFER ZONES AND FLEXIBILITYOF LAND USES The fixed boundaries of protected areas are not well suited to a dynamic environ-ment unless individual areas are extremely large. With changing climate, bufferzones might provide suitable conditions for shifting of populations to lands border-CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 59 ing reserves as conditions inside reserves become unsuitable (Noss, 2000). Buffer zones increase the patch size of the interior of the protected area and overlappingbuffers provide migratory possibilities for some species (Sekula, 2000). Buffer zones must be large, and managers of protected areas and surrounding lands mustdemonstrate considerable flexibility by adjusting land management activities acrossthe landscape in response to changing habitat suitability. A specific case for a bufferzone surrounding tropical montane cloud forests can be made based on research thatshows the upwind effects to deforestation of lowland forests causes a raising of thecloud base (Lawton et al., 2001). 5. REPRESENTFORESTTYPES ACROSS ENVIRONMENTALGRADIENTS Representing the full range of habitat types is a traditional conservation method, toset aside areas for scientific study, as a node of comparison against disturbed areas,and as a means of conserving species that may be too difficult to manage separately.The uncertainty about the precise type and distribution of impacts necessitatesmaintaining a full spectrum of forest types within protected areas to enable some re-sistant and resilient types to persist. (Noss 2000) 6. PROTECTMATURE FORESTSTANDS Primary forests have been shown to be particularly resilient to climate change(Franklin et al., 1991). Mature trees are better able to weather large-scale distur-bances than recently established forests (Brubaker, 1986), thereby providing arefuge for species reproduction once favorable climatic conditions return (Noss,2000). While shifts in composition along environmental gradients are still expectedin established forests (Franklin et al., 1991), the effects are expected to be muchslower, thereby giving species more time to adapt. 7. PROTECTFUNCTIONALGROUPS AND KEYSTONE SPECIES Maintaining the natural diversity of species and functional groups in forests is asound overall strategy for enhancing both resistance and resilience to climatechange. Several recent studies have demonstrated increased tolerance to environ-mental extremes and recovery potential as species richness increases. Species di-versity in turn promotes the \"redundancy\" or number of species present in critical functional groups. Functional groups include various kinds of producers, pollina-tors, seed dispersers, predators, parasites, decomposers, and so on. Thus, it is notjust species diversity that matters, but also species composition. Both may enhancethe stability of a forest ecosystem. Efforts to identify keystone species and function-al groups will help forest managers maintain natural patterns of abundance and dis-tribution. (Noss, 2000) 8. PROTECTCLIMATIC REFUGIA \"Across continents, at both temperate and tropical latitudes, topographically diverse areas allowed habitats and lineages to persist through altitudinal shifts and, in manycases, to diverge during periods of climate change\" (Noss, 2000). Climatic refugia are important for maintaining assemblages of species typical of past climates. Iden-tifying and protecting areas will decrease the non-climate stresses species in theseplaces may be under to enhance their chances for survival so that they may functionas refugia during future climate change. In North America, such areas include thesouthern Appalachians, the valleys of major rivers in the southeastern coastal plainof North America, and the Klamath-Siskiyou region of northwestern California andsouthwestern Oregon. Major refugia in Europe include Iberia, Italy, the Balkans,and the Caucasus. In Central America, riparian habitats have been important refu-gia, especially along the Caribbean coast. (Noss, 2000) 9. MAINTAIN NATURALFIRE REGIMES The frequency and intensity of fires are known to correlate with changing climaticconditions. However, the relationships of fire to a particular forest ecosystem, andthe different management decisions that are required vary greatly for different sys-tems. Fire suppression has actually been shown to bring about a decrease in biodi-versity in some areas where fire is a natural component of the ecosystem (Noss et al., 1995; Noss and Peters, 1995), while in other areas, particularly in the tropics,human-set fires have had catastrophic consequences for biodiversity (Trapnell,1959; Van Schaik and Kramer, 1997; Dudley, 1998). Noss (2000) provides anoverview of the complexity of fire management for different forest ecosystems, and provides some general guidelines. \"Regional differences in fire ecology imply thatfire policies established in response to concerns about climate change should not be uniform; rather, they should be established based on what is known of the fire ecol-ogy of each region and forest type...A mixed strategy in which managers let manynatural fires burn, protect old growth from stand-replacing fires, and manage otherstands through prescribed burning and understory thinning, is probably the optimalapproach\" (Noss, 2000). Some high value smaller areas may require protectionfrom fire (Stocks et al., 1998). For example, Hirsch et al. (2001) promote the inte-gration of 'fire-smart landscapes' that reduce the intensity and spread of wildfireand its impacts through harvesting, regeneration and stand tending. 10. ACTIVELYMANAGE PESTS Climate change has been associated with increased infestations of insects, disease,and exotic species (Williams and Liebhold, 1995). This has been abundantly docu-mented in cooler climates, where increases in temperature and decreases in precipi-tation have led to increases in attacks by spruce budworm in boreal forests, for ex-ample (Fleming et al., 2001). In ecosystems where pests are predicted to have asignificant impact on the system, an active management program to reduce the neg-ative effects of the pest could be devised (Howden et al., 2003). Prescribed burningis an option for reducing vulnerability to pest outbreaks in some temperate and bo-real regions (Wheaton, 2001). Nonchemical pesticides have been proposed asmeans to reduce leaf mortality from insects (Johnson, 2001). Other nonchemical op-tions such as baculoviruses are being investigated for their potential use in attackingWWF 60CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 61 pest species such as spruce budworm while leaving other species and the environ- ment relatively unharmed (NRC, 2001). 11.SILVICULTURALTECHNIQUES TO PROMOTE FORESTPRODUCTIVITY Because climate change will likely have differential impacts upon different species and age classes of trees, a straightforward, 'no regrets'strategy is to apply silvicul-tural techniques that maintain a diversity of age stands and mix of species (Kranki-na et al., 1997). These measures will contribute to maintaining the productivity ofthe forest system as climate changes. Other silvicultural activities, such as collect-ing salvage cuttings from ice storms, may reduce the amount of long-term damagearising from future storms (Irland, 2000). 12. PREVENTCONVERSION TO PLANTATIONS AND PRACTICE LOW-INTENSITYFORESTRY Forestry operations that minimize soil disturbance and utilize less clearcutting and chemical pollutants help reduce the invasion of exotic species, loss of carbon fromsoil, and the potential loss of mycorrhizae. The size of canopy openings and re-moval of biomass from sites should both be reduced. These methods are more like-ly to promote the resistance and resilience of forests to climate change than inten-sive forestry operations. (Noss, 2000) 13. MAINTAIN GENETIC DIVERSITYAND PROMOTE ECOSYSTEM HEALTH VIARESTORATION Adaptation to climate change via selection of resilient species depends upon genetic variation. Efforts to maintain genetic diversity should be applied, particularly in de- graded landscapes or within populations of commercially important trees (where ge-netic diversity is often low due to selective harvesting). In such places where geneticdiversity has been reduced, restoration, especially using seed sources from lower ele-vations or latitudes, can play a vital role in maintaining ecosystem resilience (Noss, 2000). Hogg and Schwarz (1997) suggest that assisted regeneration could be used insouthern boreal forests in Canada where drier conditions may decrease natural regen-eration of conifer species. Similarly, genotypes of beach pine forests in British Co-lumbia may need assistance in redistributing across the landscape in order to maintainlong-term productivity (Rehfeldt et al., 1999). In addition, species can be specificallyselected for replanting that are known to be more resilient to impacts in a given land-scape. For example, trees with thick bark can be planted in areas prone to fire to in-crease tree survival during increased frequency and severity of fires (Dale et al., 2000). 14. ASSISTMIGRATION WITH SPECIES INTRODUCTIONS TO NEW AREAS Management programs specially designed for tree species that will be especiallyimpacted by climate change may be necessary in some areas. The primary methodof ensuring the species'survival will be to consider introducing the species that are'climatologically trapped'to more suitable or safe habitats (Sekula, 2000). This maytake placed outside the species'present range, though new areas may become moreWWF 62 appropriate for the species under new climatic conditions. Dore et al. (2000) suggest that careful introduction of selected tree species in the Boreal Transition Ecozonemay prove more ecologically and economically viable than current forms of agri-culture. In all cases, special attention should be given to the species'history and po-tential effects of its introduction (PSRS, 2003), and the reintroduction should bewell planned and coordinated with other management programs (Sekula, 2000). 15. PROTECTMOSTHIGHLYTHREATENED SPECIES EX SITU For some forest ecosystems, such as the cloud forests of tropical mountains, climate change is already (or will soon become) the dominant threat to an extent that miti-gation efforts will not prevent some loss of species. In these situations, ex situ preservation of species in zoos and botanical gardens may be the only way to avoidextinction. Collections should include sufficient genetic diversity to allow adapta- tion to uncertain conditions in reintroduction sites. (Noss, 2000) For the Great Plains island forests in North America, Henderson et al. (in press) recom- mend a \"discovery, provenance and breeding program, encompassing both extant treespecies within island forest and possible new species introductions, with the objective ofestablishing which varieties and species are best adapted to the range of probable futureclimates in island forests\" (Henderson et al., in press). Specific measures could include:\"collection of seed from dry microsites within and outside island forests, determination ofrelated tree species to those now extant which might add resiliency, use of plantation trialsites within or adjacent to island forests or outside where such sites might serve as ana-logues for future moisture conditions at island forest sites\" (Henderson et al., in press). Identify and Select Adaptation Strategies The selection of adaptation strategies will depend largely upon the existing and eminentnon-climate stresses to the forest system, that is, the baseline upon which climatechange will exert additional pressure. The overlay of climate-induced threats pointing toparticular species or system vulnerabilities will aid in the choice of strategies. For ex-ample, in areas where forests are degraded due to species extraction, such as withinmany mangroves, reforestation of mangal species in accordance with knowledge of fu-ture changes to the hydrological system are likely to be the most obvious preventativemeasure to increase the chances for survival during the onset of sea-level rise. Once managers are armed with knowledge of non-climate and climate threats to a sys- tem, it will be important to develop a vision for what the management plan is trying toachieve. As Millar notes (PSRS, 2003), the goal should not be to stop change or preservea species, population or landscape in its current or former condition. Especially for high-ly vulnerable systems, \"change may be inevitable, and resisting it could lead to abruptand undesired consequences in the future\" (PSRS, 2003). Forest composition and distri-bution that occurred before large-scale settlement (the 1800s) developed in response to the harshest period of the Little Ice Age which ended in the late 19th century, and areprobably not good models for climate change in the present and future (PSRS, 2003). CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 63 As noted above, making forests more resilient to climate change necessitates a multi- pronged approach targeting both forests at high risk as well as prioritizing protection forthose that contribute significant genetic potential through their existing resiliency. De-termining which category a particular forest community fits within will help managerschoose from the suite of adaptation options. The first basic strategy for all forests should be preventative measures, such as protec- tion through the creation of national parks, reserves, or buffer zones. There are 44,000protected areas worldwide, covering an area equivalent to China and India combined.However, this constitutes only about 12% of the world's forests having legal protectionof one sort or another since the dawn of the modern conservation movement in the late1800s. WWF's Forests for Life campaign estimated that in 1996 only about 6% of theworld's forests were formally set aside for strict protection purposes. Moreover, many of the existing protected areas are protected in name only, and are seriously degraded orunder pressure from illegal logging, poaching, mining and other threats. Where some category of protection\u2014strict or otherwise\u2014does not appear likely, avoid- ing fragmentation through the minimization of road networks, and practicing low-inten-sity forestry are sound options. Preventing damage that will compromise a system's re-silience to climate change is usually much less costly than actions to restore it. For forests at high risk to climate change, a range of strategies to deal with known dis- turbances are possible. As a prevention measure, one approach is to manage for the dis-turbance, for example by decreasing the density of tree planting to reduce susceptibilityto drought, or removing trees vulnerable to ice or wind storms. Other disturbances, in-cluding fires, and pests can also be managed through preventive measures and therebymanipulate the intensity or frequency of the disturbance. Another approach is to miti-gate the forest disturbance itself. This can be done, for example, by limiting the intro-duction of non-native species or by using prescribed burns. Forests can also be manipu-lated with the aim of reducing vulnerability after the disturbance has occurred.Recovery efforts can be employed after the disturbance or managed in an ongoingprocess, for example for adding structural elements that create shade for the reestablish-ment of vegetation, or through the planting of late successional species to speed up suc-cession. Short-term mitigation efforts will be necessary in some instances in order tosupport certain gene pools until a stable habitat is identified. (NAST, 2001) When choosing among adaptation strategies, managers will be increasingly challenged to view the role that climate change plays in perpetuating human-related changing conditionswithin forests. This realization will necessitate a fresh examination of threats such as over-grazing, invasive species, or fires in light of the role that climate change plays. (PSRS, 2003). Lastly, the importance of decision-making for ecological change on a large biogeo- graphical scale that incorporates socio-economic and development priorities can not bestressed enough. Adaptation strategies that may be deemed necessary within a small for-est community could change once placed upon a larger ecological landscape. Consider- ation of competing priorities\u2014both among conservationists and through the largerhuman and development landscape\u2014will create a more realistic management plan withbetter chances for success. Implement or Recommend Actions and/or Policies Once a vulnerability analysis has been conducted, and adaptation strategies chosen, it isnecessary to decide how the actions will be implemented. Forest managers for a given sys-tem will likely be aware of existing management plans, and it is important to take stock ofhow the adaptation strategy would fit with these plans. If no clear management plans exist,it is conceivable to produce one focusing specifically on increasing resilience to climatechange. Ideally, adaptation management strategies in response to climate change willserve as another layer in a comprehensive forest management plan that has as its objectivethe overall health of the forest ecosystem. For example, many WWF ecoregional visionsare adding vulnerability to climate change as another component that will drive conserva-tion decisions. Such anticipatory adaptation plans take climate change into account duringthe planning process (NRC, 2002), and will better ensure synergies with other manage-ment priorities. It is also usually much less costly to adjust management practices in ad-vance of future changes rather than to wait for evidence of large-scale damage. A number of scientific, governmental and NGO institutions are acquiring expertise in the area of climate change impacts and adaptation. It will be fruitful to seek partnershipswith these institutions at the beginning of any project to analyze climate impacts and op-tions to increase resilience. The United Nations Environment Program is implementinga new program which is being jointly executed by the System for Analysis Research andTraining (START) and the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), with funding from the U.N. Global Environment Facility called \"Assessments of Impacts and Adapta-tions to Climate Change (AIACC)\". The aim of this project is to \"enhance the scientificcapacity of developing countries to assess climate change vulnerabilities and adaptation,and generate and communicate information useful for adaptation planning and action\"(AIACC website, 2003). For boreal systems, Environment Canada, the federal environ-mental agency, founded in 1999 the Science, Impacts and Adaptation Project with $15million in funding to better understand risks from climate change and formulate re-sponses (Environment Canada, 2003). The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Re-search in Germany includes in its mission to contain human-induced climate change toa tolerable level, and provide suitable measures to adapt to the unavoidable warming ofthe planet, particularly in the poorest developing countries (Potsdam Institute website,2003). Likewise, a number of research institutes within universities have sprung up inthe last several years to study forest vulnerability to climate change and adaptation. Partner institutions and other stakeholders\u2014especially those that will be impacted by any management decisions\u2014can assist in the implementation of adaptation plans. Acritical component of any adaptation project will be to devise a rigorous and goal-ori-ented monitoring system for the given management area and surrounding landscape toWWF 64CHAPTER 2 ForestsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 65 the extent possible in order to detect whether management techniques are having the de- sired effect. Monitoring is also important given the relative uncertainty with which cli-mate change will change forest systems, especially via the complex relationships be-tween species structure, composition, and functioning. Many monitoring programs existfor fire, insects or pathogens, but few exist to monitor reserve areas or for other distur-bance events such as landslides or ice storms (NAST, 2001). The results of monitoringwill also enable lessons to be drawn from adaptation management efforts, and to com-pare these with similar 'control'landscapes or other adaptation projects in different re-gions with similar habitat type. These lessons could be disseminated through reports,websites, and other educational materials. Examples of Existing Adaptation Strategies The United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre(WCMC) has begun a project called \"Forests in Flux\" with the goal to define priorityareas for networks of forest protected areas across the globe. A crucial component of theproject is \"review[ing] and assess[ing] predicted responses of forest ecosystems to cli-mate change, focusing specifically on key issues for conservation, particularly ecosys-tem tolerance and loss of biodiversity\" (WCMC, 2003). An 'ecosystem response(forests and climate change) database\" has been established through the project in orderto assess current knowledge of predicted responses of forest ecosystems through sum-maries of model specifications, parameters, nature of predictions, references and a list-ing of collaborators. Ecosystems identified as highly vulnerable have been flagged formore detailed analysis. The AIACC initiative mentioned above includes a number of on-going adaptation proj- ects relevant to the forest sector in developing countries. For example: A project in Southern Africa is \"developing more realistic ways of predicting the re- sponse of plant, animal, bird and reptile species to a changing climate in the pres-ence of a changing and fragmented landscape. The project will analyze a range ofadaptation options to determine which are the most effective, cost-efficient, and ro-bust\" (AIACC South Africa project website, 2003). In Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique, a project is being carried out to \"as- sess vulnerability and explore adaptation options to climate variability and extremeevents in the Miombo region...that lie within the drainage basin of the Zambezi River\" (AIACC Miombo project website, 2003). The project is developing datasetsand scenarios of land use change, a regional integrated model, and tools for analyz-ing regional impacts and adaptation, including a case study documenting climate\u2014land use\u2014people\u2014ecosystem linkages in order to guide adaptation plans. A project in Southeast Asia is analyzing \"the impacts of climate change and associated land use and cover change on water resources, forest ecosystems, and social systemsof watersheds...\" (AIACC Southeast Asia project website, 2003). In China, climate change impacts and possible adaptation strategies for key sectors are being determined through an integrated approach, including workshops, surveys,multi-stakeholder consultations, ecological modeling, GIS and remote sensing, andmulti-criteria decision-making. (AIACC China project website, 2003). The adaptation strategies suggested above will be key measures in the short and medium term to maximizing the resilience of forest systems impacted by climate change. Even ifemissions were drastically reduced today, human-induced changes in temperature andprecipiation will cause wide-ranging disturbances upon ecosystems within the next cen-tury, due to the long lifespan of emissions in the atmosphere. Therefore, the only long-term option to ensuring healthy forest ecosystems is to reduce emissions of greenhousegases now so that we will not leave a legacy of forests fraught with problems far worsethan those reviewed here.

Price and Graham R. Neville Centre for Mountain Studies, Perth College, UK MOUNTAIN REGIONS HAVE HIGH levels of biodiversity, due particularly to the compression of life zones into a small horizontal distance (Jen\u00edk, 1997; K\u00f6rner, 2002).Many factors combine to create these high levels of biodiversity at the regional scale.One is the combination of steep altitudinal gradient, topographic variation and range ofaspects, providing a rich variety of habitats at all scales. A second set of factors extendsover geological time. As mountain ranges have developed, species have been able to mi- grate along new pathways, exploiting ecological niches as they have opened up. Yet in-terruptions in mountain-building phases, subsequent erosion, and changes in climate\u2014especially ice ages\u2014have also isolated species, so that they have evolved in differentways, a major reason for high levels of endemism in mountain areas. A third set of fac- tors relates to human activities. Some mountain ecosystems have remained relativelyunmodified by humans, while others have been heavily cultivated or otherwise alteredfor centuries or millennia. Regardless of degree of modification, montane regions oftenhave higher levels of biodiversity than adjacent lowlands. Although alpine terrain makes up only 3% of Earth's continents, it houses 10,000 species of higher plants, or 4% of the global total (Gough et al., 1994). Alpine plants are small insize, allowing a large number of individuals to live in the available microhabitats, leadingto high levels of alpha diversity, which may be further increased by the isolation of indi-viduals at the patch scale and frequent disturbance. Levels of genetic diversity are alsohigh, due to polyploidy and a high degree of self-incompatibility (K\u00f6rner, 2002). Despitethis wealth of biodiversity, mountain ecosystems often have low resilience to anthro-pogenic impacts, taking longer to recover than many lowland ecosystems. Mountains also play key roles in global climate processes, especially through interactions with convection and air mass systems, causing precipitation through the orographic effect,and by condensing and storing freshwater in the form of snow and ice (Bandyopadhyay etal., 1997). This function is important to billions of people who rely on mountains as 'watertowers'for drinking and other domestic use, fisheries and agricultural irrigation, hydro-electric power, industrial use and transport or recreation (Mountain Agenda, 1998).In addition to the variety of ecosystem services listed above, montane and alpine ecosys- tems also have a high intrinsic value in many of the world's mountain protected areas(Notaro and Signorello, 2001) and provide the 'capital'of tourism (Krippendorf, 1984).Consequently, changes in landscapes can have major effects on tourism markets, notonly causing severe economic and social impacts for mountain people, but also affectingthe budgets of mountain protected areas. Finally, the fact that many alpine and montane ecosystems are situated on the bound- aries between countries\u2014and also the administrative areas of individual states\u2014canlead to particular challenges in defining management strategies at the level of theecosystem or mountain range. Thus, the alpine/montane biome is poorly placed to re-spond to conservation efforts in general, and climate change in particular. Stresses and Vulnerabilities Due to Factors Other Than Climate Change POLLUTION Pollution from airborne contaminants affects all mountain areas, particularly thosedownwind of urban/industrial areas. Aerosols, which enter the snowpack and hydrolog-ical system via precipitation often far from their source, can have a detrimental impacton the freshwater environment, reducing the quality of water in alpine lakes and there-fore having negative impacts on biodiversity (Koinig et al., 1998). Over the past centu-ry, there has been a global increase in nitrogen deposition (Vitousek et al., 1997), as wellas increases in the deposition of nitrates and sulfates at high-altitude sites (D\u00f6scher etal., 1995). Acidification of rainfall can kill or seriously damage trees and smaller floraand reduce feeding quality for wildlife (Hamilton et al., 1997). High levels of tropos-pheric ozone can reduce the growth of plants and mosses and may affect the relativecompetitiveness of species (NEGTAP, 2001). Conversely, stratospheric ozone depletiondue to anthropogenic emissions allows higher and more biologically damaging levels ofultraviolet radiation to reach Earth's surface, with negative effects on both flora andfauna (Bjorn et al., 1998; Blaustein et al., 1995; Kiffney et al., 1997). AGRICULTURE Agricultural activities often extend up mountainsides and have important effects on mountain environments, including poisoning of groundwater by agricultural chemicalsor slurry and numerous physical impacts such as the construction of vehicular tracks orthe installation of more agri-industrial forms of processing. High-altitude soils are thinand are therefore much more sensitive to disturbance, and take much longer to recover.Grazing and burning in many of the world's upland areas have reduced the biodiversityof mountain pastures (K\u00f6rner, 2002), and in these sensitive areas much of the naturalland cover has been significantly altered. The changes associated with agricultural aban-donment often have a role in increasing the vulnerability of alpine/montane areas, par-ticularly where the balance of the water supply is altered, or the stability of steep or ter-raced terrain is not maintained (MacDonald et al., 2000). Conversely, some alpine plantshave extended locally into grasslands opened up by burning and grazing by introducedherbivores in New Zealand (Halloy and Mark, 2003) and other parts of the world. Thus,WWF 74through a series of complex processes, agriculture has both reduced the extent of natural alpine and montane communities and allowed their extension into previously unavail-able terrain. FORESTRY Forest plantations, often composed of alien species, are common in alpine and montane regions. Many aspects of forestry alter runoff and drainage patterns; forest road con-struction, planting, thinning, and harvesting can lead to the contamination of water-courses with sediments, machine oils, and other contaminants. (Hamilton and Brui-jnzeel, 1997). Forestry also affects natural successional patterns, decreasing habitat areafor species that depend on more established, old-growth forests. As with agriculture,forestry activities have also increased the extent of many alpine and montane habitats,allowing a downslope expansion into areas from which forests have been removed bycutting, burning, and/or grazing (Wielgolaski, 1997). FRESHWATER ABSTRACTION People whose supply of freshwater depends on mountain areas are often far removedfrom those areas, and thus relatively unaware of negative impacts of their water use onmountain ecosystems. Vulnerabilities associated with freshwater abstraction frommountain systems relate to the alteration of river channels; the construction of dams;and over-abstraction for water-thirsty cities and agriculture, often far downstream(Bandyopadhyay et al., 1997). All of these factors can influence aquatic and riparianhabitat and the species dependent on them; as well as groundwater resources, sometimesover large areas. TOURISM AND RECREATION Tourism-related development affects diverse mountain environments, although it must be recognised that this phenomenon is distributed very unevenly at vary spatial scalesacross the world's mountain ranges (Price et al., 1997). Erosion, fires, trampling or otherloss of flora by people, horses, and off-road vehicles, hunting and fishing, disturbance offauna (the presence of people in and flying above habitats), and pollution (litter and human waste) are all serious problems related to human recreational use of mountainecosystems (Buckley, 2000). Soil and biological systems in alpine/montane environ-ments take far longer to recover from such impacts than in the lowlands (Gordon et al.,1998), and are therefore more vulnerable to such disturbances. Some high-impactmountain tourist industries, such as skiing and snowboarding resorts, may experiencestrong declines in days of operation due to climate change. INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT Communications facilities (towers and masts for radio, TV, mobile phones, militarycommunications, etc.) have been installed on many mountains. In most cases, this in-volves the construction of a road, which removes and damages habitat and may lead to long-term soil erosion. The road is then often used for access not only for the mainte-nance of the communications facilities, but also for hunting and other recreational activ-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 75 CHAPTER 3 Montaneities. All of these activities may endanger populations of animals and plants, especially endemic species restricted to summits. ALIEN SPECIES Particularly because of their isolation, mountain species are often not able to compete with alien species, especially when their introduction is linked to habitat destruction.This is a problem in many mountain areas, but particularly those on isolated islandssuch as those of Hawaii (Loope and Giambelluca, 1998) and New Zealand (Halloy etal., 2001). Present and Future Stress and Vulnerability Due to Climate Change Increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2, the primary cause of climate change, are likely to affect the physiology of alpine and montane plants. The exact outcomes are un-clear, and will vary from species to species and be affected by factors such as inter-spe-cific competition, grazing, physical site conditions, and levels of nitrogen deposition(K\u00f6rner, 1999). As mountain climates are generally characterised by great variabilityand cycles at both diurnal and seasonal scales, some mountain biota are alreadystressed, which will influence their response not just to CO 2, but to all aspects of climate change (Price and Haslett, 1995). ECOLOGY A likely impact of climate change on mountain environments is upslope altitudinal mi-gration of vegetation climatic belts, generally\u2014but not always\u2014leading to a decrease intheir area, and the loss of the coldest climatic zones at the summits (Halpin, 1994). Thusall affected zones will experience increased vulnerability (Parry, 2000). Migration of veg-etation zones around mountains to a different aspect is also possible, with implicationsfor certain floral assemblages such as lichens, which depend greatly on living on a certainaspect for maximum insolation. Migration is typically severely restricted as a spatial re-sponse in mountain areas, however, because of their topography (Huntley and Baxter,2002) and, often, the availability of suitable soils (Theurillat et al., 1998). Thus upslopemigration will probably result in the contraction and fragmentation of populations ofplants and associated fauna in the present montane, alpine, and nival belts. A key factor inthe survival of plant populations will therefore be their dispersal capabilities, which tendto be low in alpine species; for instance, only 35% of alpine specialist plants in NewZealand were capable of long distance dispersal, as compared to 65% of non-specialists(McGlone et al., 2001). This is one of a range of key characteristics that make manyalpine and montane species particularly sensitive to changes in climate\u2014other character-istics are that they are: at the edge of their range; geographically localised; geneticallyimpoverished; slow reproducers; or highly specialised (McNeely, 1990). Changes in season length, and particularly earlier snowmelt dates and higher soil tem- peratures, could affect flowering and other aspects of plant phenology (Dunne et al.,2003; Th\u00f3rhallsd\u00f3ttir, 1998), as well as the annual cycles of pollinators, disease-causinginsects, and other organisms. Equally, alien and invasive plant species may benefit moreWWF 76from climate change than native species, to the detriment of the latter (Dukes and Mooney, 1999). All of these trends will cause changes in inter-specific competition:some species will do better, but others will die. Thus, plant community composition willchange, and some species that are now relatively uncommon, existing in isolated patch-es, will increase in abundance. Thus, while some species will benefit from climatechange, others\u2014particularly rare and endemic species\u2014are likely to gradually becomeextinct, beginning with those found only at the highest altitude (Halloy and Mark, 2003). The impact on montane and alpine floral diversity could therefore be significant,especially in isolated mountain ranges (K\u00f6rner and Spehn, 2002). As current habitats change and are lost, fauna will also have to adapt or be forced to mi- grate upwards and polewards, following the altitudinal and latitudinal shifts of climateand vegetation belts, in order to survive. For insectivorous and carnivorous animals, thecombination of climate and land-use change may lead to the loss of key elements oftheir diet, for both year-round residents and migrants that arrive earlier because of cli-mate change, as shown for robins migrating to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado (In-ouye et al., 2000). Also, as mentioned earlier, migration is a restricted strategy for iso-lated mountain areas or those at the continental margins (e.g., the Scandinavianmountains, the New Zealand mountain ranges, or the northern Rocky Mountains inAlaska). Thus, predicting rates of change in populations of both flora and fauna is high-ly complex, depending not only on changes in climate but on changes in biotic interac-tions as has been shown, for instance, for amphibians at Monteverde, Costa Rica(Pounds et al., 1999). CRYOSPHERE The shrinkage of glaciers is a global phenomenon, and rates of retreat are generally ac-celerating (Haeberli et al., 1999). Tropical glaciers are particularly sensitive because ofthe lack of seasonality and the fact that ablation is year-round (Arnell and Liu, 2001). Ina number of mountain areas, the rapid melting of glaciers is leading to an increased riskof glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which cause total destruction of habitats alongaffected watercourses, as well as loss of life and severe damage to infrastructure(Richardson and Reynolds, 2000). The melting of permafrost will lead to slope instabil-ity, loss of foundation stability for structures, and increased damage from freeze-thawcycles (Haeberli, 1995). For every \u00b0C increase in temperature, the snowline rises in altitude about 150 m (Parry, 2000). As a result, less snow will accumulate at lower elevations than at present. Howev-er, there could be more snow accumulation above the freezing level as both precipitationand temperatures increase. This may cause more frequent avalanches (Extrem e events, pg. 94)and hinder the movement of large ungulates and skiers, but at the same time pro-vide added protection to small plants and mammals (Scott and Suffling, 2000). In gener-al, the trend will be for the snowpack to become unstable, snowpack duration to be re-duced, and the profile of permanent snowpatches to change. These phenomena alreadyappear to be resulting in changes in the emergence dates of marmots in the Rocky Moun-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 77 CHAPTER 3 Montanetains of Colorado (Inouye et al., 2000) and decreases in the area and occurrence of plant communities and endemic mammals in the Australian Alps (Green and Pickering, 2002). Secondary effects of cryospheric dynamics are mainly with regard to hydrology. In alpine lakes in Norway, increased winter snowfall negatively correlates with the growthof brown trout (Salmo trutta) (Borgstrom, 2001). More generally, increased melt from receding glaciers and icefields will also increase water flows initially, although this ef-fect will subside as the glaciers disappear. This will occur relatively quickly in the tem-perate mountain regions, and even faster in the tropics. Changing storage and releaserates for precipitation will alter the timing of peak flows downstream; populations ofaquatic species relying on late summer and early autumn melt may go extinct (Murray,pers. comm.). At the same time, a longer snow-free season, leading to a longer dry peri-od, may lead to increased fire frequency. HYDROLOGY Hydrological stresses derive from the dependence of terrestrial, riparian, and aquaticecosystems on freshwater from mountain sources. Changing precipitation patterns havebeen recorded world-wide (Folland and Karl, 2001) and inevitably affect runoff patterns,as will the changes in cryospheric dynamics noted above. As a greater proportion of totalprecipitation falls as rain rather than snow, the lag time due to snow precipitation andstorage until meltwater enters the river system is reduced; in addition, melting glacierswill add a further volume of water into the systems until they too are gone. Then overallflow will decrease dramatically and become more variable (Arnell and Liu, 2001). Increases in flows tend to increase sediment transport, turbidity, and bank erosion. Con- versely, decreases in flows can increase pollution loads. Droughts, or decreased and earlier runoff from snow and ice melt may have important impacts on fish populations, especiallythose that rely on adequate late summer and early autumn flows for spawning (Levy, 1994).Changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation may have other effects; for instance,anincrease in summer precipitation could affect seed formation in species which haveevolved to set seed during a dry summer period (Murray, pers. comm.). Given the impor- tance of mountain water to downstream populations and economies, decreased and less re-liable runoff may lead to increased demands for water storage in alpine and montane areas. EXTREME EVENTS In addition to more variable precipitation, it is predicted that the incidence of severestorms, floods, droughts and\u2014in tropical and subtropical areas\u2014tropical storms andhurricanes will increase (Arnell and Liu, 2001). Increases in flooding frequency are per-haps among the most feared physical impacts of climate change (Arnell, 1996), withcritical impacts for ecosystems, human populations, and infrastructure in mountainareas and downstream. However, there have been few studies of this problem, mainlydue to the difficulties involved with identifying credible scenarios for changes in flood-producing climatic events. Furthermore, many floods have multiple causes; they may bepurely a product of rainfall or snowmelt or a combination of the two (Arnell and Liu,WWF 782001). Impacts of floods can include greatly increased sediment loads and bedload transport and river channel scour, with losses in riparian ecosystems and negative im-pacts on aquatic flora and fauna (Wohl, 2000). Conversely, low summer flows anddroughts also have negative impacts on riparian and aquatic ecosystems, and cause re-ductions in water storage, which could lead to demands for new storage infrastructure. Rockfalls, landslides, and debris flows are likely to increase as a result of increases in precipitation or porewater, or by increased mechanical weathering, with release zones athigher altitudes (Rebetez et al., 1997). As mentioned earlier, more frequent and/or larg-er avalanches will result from changes in weather patterns, including more frequenthigh-intensity winter storms, and other changes in the cryosphere or permafrost layers(Evans and Clague, 1997). For both landslides and avalanches, there would be changesin runout zones, which would be likely to increase in area; the vegetation would be keptat earlier successional stages. This could be beneficial for species adapted to these habi-tats (Suffling, 1993). Increased avalanche management could scare wildlife and affectpatterns of visitor use, as they might not wish to visit areas where active avalanche con-trol is being practiced (Murray, pers. comm.). OTHER CURRENT OR FUTURE STRESSES There are a host of additional stresses that may affect montane systems as climatechange progresses. These include: soil changes, with influences on the growth of plants (Kundzewicz and Parry, 2001; Theurillat et al., 1998); changes in fire frequencies, with effects on heathlands, grasslands and forest eco- tones (Gitay et al., 2001); changes in cloudiness, humidity, and precipitation in areas covered by tropical mon- tane cloud forests, and resultant changes in these ecosystems and associated hydro-logical regimes (Foster, 2001); increasing wind velocities, especially associated with intensified tropical cyclones (Giorgi and Hewitson, 2001) affecting evapotranspiration rates, fire probabilities,wind erosion, etc.; changes in populations of insects and diseases and their impacts on host plant or wildlife populations (Scurrah, pers. comm.), and the effect of the spread of malaria,leishmaniasis, dengue fever and other diseases on tourism and travel markets inmountain areas currently free of these diseases (McMichael and Githeko, 2001). Potential Adaptation Options Adaptation is a potentially useful tool to alleviate some of the negative impacts of climate change, or to take advantage of the positive effects. Adaptation will not halt climateBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 79 CHAPTER 3 Montanechange; rather, it is a strategic tool to manage vulnerability and alleviate impacts to ecosystems. Adaptations can be either in response to observed climate changes or antic-ipatory. Anticipatory adaptation is more difficult as it relies on sound scientific predic-tions of the likely impacts of climate change in specific areas, but there is often great un-certainty about these effects, particularly in mountain areas (Smith, 1997). However it isvery unlikely that adaptation after the fact could prove successful. Mountain areas are characterized by a great diversity of situations: ecological, econom- ic, cultural, administrative, political, etc. There is also great diversity in the number andextent of protected areas in particular mountain ranges. Many mountain ranges have no protected areas (e.g., the Atlas, Papua New Guinea, mountains of Myanmar), and exist-ing reserves often protect only the summits with no provisions for connectivity amongreserves or the maintenance of entire ecosystems (Hamilton, 2002). Climate changeprovides an added impetus to the need to address the conservation of alpine and mon-tane biodiversity at regional and global scales, recognizing that, as many mountains arethe frontiers between protected areas, administrative areas or states, transboundary co-operation is often necessary. IDENTIFYING FUTURE CHANGE General Circulation Models (GCMs) have been widely used to try to predict climatechange. When coupled with atmosphere-ocean circulation theories (Atmosphere-OceanGeneral Circulation Models or AOGCMs), these are the most powerful tools currentlyavailable for climate change prediction (Giorgi and Francisco, 2001) (although see Han- nah 2003, this volume regarding Regional Circulation Models). They are most useful atthe regional scale: e.g., sizeable portions of continents, such as northern Europe, orwestern North America. However, as mountain terrain and microclimates are complexsystems with many interlinkages and autovariations, prediction models may become in-sufficient, a problem exacerbated by the fact that few mountain ranges have adequatedata for validation (Beniston et al., 1997; see discussion by Hannah, this volume, onstrengths and weaknesses of models). While different climate models are generally inagreement on certain issues, such as an intensified summer monsoon (Cusbasch andMeehl, 2001), they also predict quite different futures for the same region not only interms of temperature and precipitation (Hay et al., 2000; Whetton et al., 2001), but alsothe frequency of El Ni\u00f1o events (Cusbasch and Meehl, 2001), which are key drivers forthe climates of sub-tropical and tropical mountain regions. Nevertheless, such modelshave been used to predict environmental changes and species distribution under futureclimates in mountain areas, e.g., in Canada (Scott and Suffling, 2000), Mexico(Townsend Peterson et al., 2002) and Tibet (Ni, 2000). Other approaches for defining possible future climates include scenario techniques (e.g., Parry et al., 1988), which may be more appropriate in mountain regions as climatic data are generally temporally and spatially limited (especially at higher altitudes), yet muchlocal expert knowledge is often available. Scenario modeling approaches have beenused to evaluate the potential distribution of mammals on isolated mountains in theWWF 80southwest USA (McDonald and Brown, 1992); alpine plants in New Zealand (Halloy and Mark, 2003), South Africa (McDonald et al., 2002), Norway (S\u00e6tersdal and Birks,1997), and the Alps (Gottfried et al., 1999; Lischke et al., 1998); and plant species andvegetation types in western North America (Fagre and Peterson, 2002). STRATEGY DESIGN It is vital to identify what is to be protected: which species, species assemblage(s), habi- tat(s), or landscape(s) should take priority? In alpine and montane zones, there is likely tobe competition between several ecosystem types which could become established underaltered climate regimes, and these often require very different management strategies(Price and Haslett, 1995). For those concerned with conservation, it is also important torecognize the need for the continued availability of key resources, including personnel andinfrastructure, and the need to operate within a regional cultural and economic context.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Gitay et al., 2001),adaptation options are limited in mountain areas because these biomes are the most vul-nerable and will respond most strongly to changes in climate. To understand likely vulnerabilities of natural and cultural resources to climate change, it may be appropriate to conduct an integrated assessment (e.g., Yin and Cohen, 1994) orclimate sensitivity analysis (Peine and Berish, 1999), including the following stages: identify ecosystems, ecotones, species, and ecosystem processes that are particular- ly sensitive to climate change; evaluate protected area and forest resource monitoring programs as to their capabil- ity to detect ecosystem dynamics associated with climate change; utilise results of the analysis for education materials and services; devise a regional research and monitoring agenda; identify all significant non-climate related threats and plans to minimize them. While quantitative approaches will be essential at all of these stages, they should be complemented with approaches drawing on traditional ecological knowledge (Thomsonet al., 2000). Knowledge derived from long-term experience is important for addressingan issue as long-term and complex as climate change. Possible adaptation options are grouped into eight sets below: protected areas, conser- vation networks, bioregional approaches, participation and active management, moni- toring, infrastructure, supporting policies and minimizing non-climate-related stresses.In all cases, the key principle is to maintain the maximum variety of possible options,recognizing that they will not necessarily help species and ecosystems at the highest el-evations. In addition, means to minimize non-climate stresses (Stresses and vulnerabili-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 81 CHAPTER 3 Montaneties, pg. 90)\u2014for instance, minimizing pollution and pressures from land-use practices and change, appropriate and controlled tourism and infrastructure development, limitingwater use, control of alien species\u2014should always be implemented as integral compo- nents of adaptation strategies. PROTECTING ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE SPACE Given the prospect of upslope shift of habitat space, one key element of adaptation is toensure that each mountain protected area\u2014and especially its core zone(s) if zoning ispractised\u2014has as great a range of elevations, slope aspects, and habitat mosaics as pos-sible, and is as large as possible. The principle of maximizing diversity also applies toprotected area systems, which should include several replicates of different ecosystemtypes, to permit adjustment to rapid climate shifts and survive major events (e.g., hurri-canes and tropical storms) (Barborak, pers. comm.). Consideration may be given to de-signing mountain protected areas to be climatic refugia, in particular where this has oc-curred in the past, so that these areas can act as potential habitat for climatic migrantspecies. This requires, however, adequate connectivity within the landscape (Markhamand Malcolm, 1996), as discussed below. CONSERVATION NETWORKS A conservation network is a further strategy towards the protection of landscapes, habi-tats, or species threatened by climate change (Bennett, 1999; Bridgewater, 1996; Han-nah, 2001). Adaptation is allowed in such a network through species migration viabuffer zones, protected corridors (especially along watercourses), matrices or landscape connections, 'stepping stones' through anthropogenically altered terrain (e.g., agricul-tural land, planted forests, urban areas). Such networks need to be designed carefully\u2014in mountain areas this is particularly important where spatial variability and migrationroutes for range-shifts are limited. Protected area systems should be designed to max-imise connections, corridors or landscape units. These must be able to cross politicalboundaries, especially in mountains, which often form such boundaries. Such a systemmust be both dynamic and large-scale (regional to global), requiring regional co-ordina-tion, a focus on biodiversity hotspots, and a proactive adaptation strategy (Hannah,2001). Such networks are under development in a number of mountain regions, includ-ing the Albertine Rift, the Andes, the Apennines, the Australian Alps, the Rocky Moun-tains, and the Western Ghats (Hamilton, 2002). At the global scale, one key initiative is UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Re- serves (WNBR). There are currently 408 sites in 94 countries; nearly half of these are inmountain areas (Price, 2001). They differ from national protected areas in that they aredesignated internationally, forming a global network; have transitional zones ('zones ofcooperation') with flexible boundaries; and can straddle international boundaries. Inte-grated monitoring of biosphere reserves is being undertaken at the global scale throughthe Biosphere Reserve Integrated Monitoring Program (BRIM), which includes floral,faunal, and socio-economic data. While not all biosphere reserves are currently man- aged according to the principles laid down in the Statutory Framework of the WNBRWWF 82(Price, 2002), they do represent a unique structure for addressing many of the adaptation options listed previously, and for global exchange of experience and best practice. Anew program involving mountain biosphere reserves within the Mountain Research Ini-tiative is currently under development (www.mri.unibe.ch). BIOREGIONALAPPROACHES From the Convention on Biological Diversity to the EU Natura 2000 and other regionalnetworks to smaller-scale action plans, biodiversity strategies now acknowledge thatbioregional approaches are necessary (Johnson et al., 2001). They can be used as a toolfor adapting to global climate change in the following ways: large regions accommodate full ecosystem functions and habitats, fostering ecolog- ical viability over the long term; different zones can be used to experiment on and study the impacts of climate change; monitoring can happen in a more controlled manner in protected core areas; adaptive management responses can be tried in both buffer zones and more widely within the bioregion, especially in areas adjacent to protected areas; effective partnerships involving many stakeholders take account of the multiple needs of the strategic approach, including economic sustainability and social ac-ceptance; strategic models can be developed to work within limits imposed by increasing fragmentation. Bioregional strategies allow managers to establish and maintain protected area bound- aries which are flexibly designed to adjust to changing climatic regimes, and if neces-sary, to move upslope with protected habitat(s), providing buffer zones and refugia.Such approaches also take into consideration resource uses at the regional scale, recog-nising that climate changes will result in changed pressures from local people as condi-tions for cultivation and settlement change (Price and Barry, 1997).; Particularly because alpine and montane ecosystems do not usually cover large contigu- ous areas, their conservation has to be considered within the context of the managementof surrounding forest ecosystems (whether or not within protected areas) and other re-gional land uses, using conservation networks and bioregional approaches. Again, thegreat variety of land ownership and use patterns in mountain regions around the worldmakes it difficult to be prescriptive. Nevertheless, one relatively common feature ofmountain regions is communal ownership and/or management, particularly at higher al-titudes, especially for grazing. Even where these institutions have lapsed or been removedBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 83 CHAPTER 3 MontaneWWF 84 by government action, the cultural roots often remain and can be built on. This is a crit- ical link to modern approaches to conservation, which recognise the need to involvelocal people in the management of projected areas (e.g., Stevens, 1997; Stolton andDudley, 1999), whether as park staff or involved in economic activities based on eitherthe utilisation of resources within protected areas (e.g., grazing, collecting plants andmushrooms, hunting) or providing services to tourists. In Hawaii, the value of the tradi-tional ahupua`a system, involving experts and diverse stakeholders, has been specifical-ly recognized as appropriate for adapting to climate change (Shea et al., 2001). PARTICIPATION AND ACTIVE MANAGEMENT All of the spatial approaches mentioned above require the explicit consideration of land uses within and adjacent to mountain protected areas, and therefore the active involvementof local people as partners in the conservation of biodiversity. The involvement of localpeople in conservation is particularly important in mountain areas, where spatial networksare essential to minimise the risk of loss of small isolated populations and to allow moremobile species to move along altitudinal and ecological gradients. Equally, people whosefamilies have been established in a mountain area for many generations will have exten- sive traditional ecological knowledge with regard to issues such as responses to past peri-ods of environmental change (Glantz, 1988) and the existence of key resources, such asthe last streams to dry up in periods of drought. Especially, but not only, in developingcountries, achieving conservation goals in mountain areas\u2014whose people are oftenamong the poorest at national scales (Huddleston et al., 2003)\u2014may require the coordina-tion of a number of approaches aimed at improving local people's livelihoods in order todecrease their dependence on natural resources. This can include supporting local peoplein the management and conservation of natural resources, providing academic and skillenhancement training or financial support, or investing in small businesses or infrastruc-ture, such as micro-hydro schemes (Sherpa, pers. comm.). NGOs often have key roles toplay in such initiatives. They, the protected area, and other conservation-oriented person-nel may be involved in specific management strategies such as: prioritizing actions to protect key threatened species, particularly 'keystone species', such as important pollinators or seeders. This is of particular value inmountain areas where altitudinal range may be utilised to maintain high levels ofbiodiversity in the face of greater biological redundancy; protecting valuable species in situ and avoiding or reducing additional stress on their habitats, for instance through the control of grazing or recreational pressures; constructing snow barriers to 'catch'snow potentially increasing the likelihood that snow is available for plants and animals that depend on it during the winter months(Good, pers. comm.); modifying site conditions to ensure that decreasing plant communities are replaced by other naturally occurring communities of lesser extent, e.g., snowpatch commu-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 85 CHAPTER 3 Montanenities by others that occur naturally in areas with little or no snow\u2014an approach comparable to that implemented successfully in highly eroded areas followingmany years of domestic stock grazing in the Australian Alps (Good, pers. comm.); propagating endangered species ex situand, possibly, transplanting them to sites where they have a reasonable chance of survival (Good, pers. comm.; Halloy andMark, 2003); management of invasive/alien species according to the strategy: 1) prevent any new introductions of invasives; 2) ensure early detection and eradication of new infesta-tions; 3) contain any established populations that are too large to eradicate; 4) pre-vent the largest infestations from spreading (Wittenberg and Cock, 2001); releases of water from dams to allow the survival of riparian and aquatic populations and the continuity of key annual activities (e.g., fish spawning) (Parkstrom, pers. comm.). MONITORING A key element of every adaptation strategy must be to monitor both its implementationand the changes in the physical and biological environment (e.g., with long-term mete-orological stations and regular biological surveys). Monitoring should be interdiscipli-nary and integrated, and is also necessary to assess model-based predictions (Fagre andPeterson, 2002). While specific monitoring approaches must be developed and imple-mented for individual protected areas and/or mountain ranges, it is also worth consider-ing involvement in one or more of the relevant international programs that have been, orare being, developed for mountain areas. The Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) aims to establish an effective long-term observation network for detecting the effects of climatechange on mountain biota on a global scale. The GLORIA Multi-Summit approach (Pauliet al., 2001) provides such a method, and is designed to compare biodiversity patternsalong fundamental climatic gradients, vertically as well as horizontally. GLORIA is a con-tribution to Activity 1 of the global Mountain Research Initiative (Becker and Bugmann,2001), developed within the context of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme(IGBP), International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change(IHDP) and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS). It includes four activities: 1) Long-term monitoring and analysis of indicators of environmental change in moun- tain regions; 3) Integrated model-based studies of environmental changes in different mountain regions;4) Process studies along altitudinal gradients and in associated headwater basins;5) Sustainable land use and natural resource managementAll of these activities, as well as those considered in the previous paragraphs, require suitably-trained on-the-ground, research, and management personnel. The knowledge oflocal people ('traditional ecological knowledge') may also be valuable both for moni-toring and for developing testable hypotheses for research (Danby et al., 2003). INFRASTRUCTURE To facilitate adaptation measures, physical infrastructure is essential, particularly in the many mountain areas where accessibility is a challenge. Management for the survival ofspecific species and habitats\u2014as well as travel, both seasonally or year-round\u2014may re-quire the stabilisation of slopes, especially after damage resulting from extreme events.Given the limited availability of resources, mapping of risks may be necessary to assistin prioritising actions (Rossi, pers. comm.). POLICIES The essential underpinning to all adaptation options comprises appropriate plans andpolicies, both for specific areas (e.g., protected areas and administrative regions) and forsectors and agencies (Kumaran, pers. comm.). These need to identify problems and pri-orities, and include appropriate legal provisions and economic instruments to ensuretheir application. Again, given the fact that many alpine and montane ecosystems strad-dle state or administrative frontiers, transboundary instruments (Sandwith et al., 2001;Villeneuve et al., 2002) may often be necessary. MINIMIZING NON-CLIMATE-RELATED STRESSORS Interactive effects between climate-related and non-climate-related stressors are com- mon, and organisms and communities that are already stressed may be less resistant andresilient to the challenges posed by a changing climate. Thus any attempts to mitigateeffects of climate change must consider ways to reduce the influence of other anthro-pogenic stressors. Siting reserves in remote locations relatively unaffected by human ac-tivities is one way to do this; when creating reserves in less pristine environments, everyeffort should be made to control human impacts. Even human activities that have beensustainable in the past may cease to be so as climate change alters mountain ecosystemswhich, as discussed earlier, tend to be less resilient than other terrestrial ecosystemseven under the best of conditions. It may be necessary to revisit extractive and develop- ment uses of montane regions, and increase our efforts to further limit them. Issues suchas water abstraction may require particular attention as human uses compete with biodi-versity needs as water becomes scarcer in mountain regions. Implementation of actions and/or policies As noted in Policies section, above, adequate information and appropriate plans and policies, including economic instruments, are essential for adaptation. Individual pro-tected areas require effective management plans which are implemented, but it is criticalthat these are embedded in, and supported by, government policies that recognise thatthe conservation of biodiversity requires appropriate information and has to be under-taken at the landscape scale, within the context of regional economies\u2014and that manyWWF 86environmental services and other benefits derive from the wise management of moun- tain resources, particularly those of protected areas (Phillips, 1998). This means that re-gional and national planning and land-use plans and policies should incorporate guide-lines and indicators that ensure that biodiversity conservation targets are met\u2014asrequired under the Convention on Biological Diversity to which most governments aresignatories. ECONOMIC AND LEGALINCENTIVES To assure the implementation of such plans and policies, new economic approaches are being developed. Examples include schemes in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Ecuadorunder which downstream irrigators and hydro-electricity companies pay upstreamlandowners to ensure reliable flows (Koch-Weser and Kahlenborn, 2004); and otherschemes in Latin America through which landowners are paid to maintain biodiversitythrough national funds deriving from energy taxes, debt swaps, and carbon offsets(Barborak, pers. comm.). While the funds deriving from these schemes have mainlybeen provided to people owning forests (Pagiola et al., 2002), the same people oftenown or manage land higher in watersheds; and grazing regimes often have important consequences on runoff patterns, as well as biodiversity. Key points are that: economic incentives are generally needed to ensure the stewardship of private land and water resources within wider conservation networks, and must be supported byappropriate legal mechanisms; compensation payments must be based on recognition by the 'downstream'benefi- ciaries of the (increasing) scarcity of resources for which they are willing to paycompensation; these payments should be high enough to serve as an incentive to upstream land owners/managers to change their practices; often payments should be linked to the provision of other services and facilities, e.g., for education, health, and access; the long-term success of conservation strategies, especially outside protected areas, requires understanding and acceptance\u2014thus existing laws, customs, and institu-tions must be taken into account, and targeted education is often essential; some key areas of land need to be managed for specific conservation goals; this may require purchase, which implies the availability of appropriate funds (Barborak,pers. comm.); funding has to be consistent; there 'boom-and-bust'large proj- ects (Kumaran, pers. comm.). FINANCIALRESOURCES In many mountain areas around the world, tourism is a major element of regionalBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 87 CHAPTER 3 Montaneeconomies (Godde et al., 2000). Revenues from tourism are both of importance for de- velopment, and also current or potential sources of income for biodiversity conserva- tion, whether in protected areas or in wider networks. The need to link biodiversity con-servation and development is evident in the many projects of the Global EnvironmentalFacility (GEF) in mountain ecosystems, which are the topic of one of the 10 operational programs with regard to biological diversity within the GEF Operational Strategy. In2002 this program was funding 107 mountain projects\u2014including initiatives in Centraland South America and the Caribbean, East and Southern Africa, and Central Asia(Global Environment Facility, 2002). Also of note, given the likelihood of the expansionof invasive species into montane and alpine zones, is the Secretariat of the Global Inva-sive Species Program, supported by the World Bank, with projects in areas such as themountain fynbos of South Africa (World Bank, 2002). As well as multilateral funding, bilateral and NGO funding can be directed towards ac- tivities that contribute to adaptation in relation to climate change, again stressing thelinks between development (including tourism) and biodiversity conservation. Such ac-tivities may be within one country or at regional scales, though transboundary projectscan run into funding difficulties where mountain ranges fall within more than one of theadministratively-defined regions of a funding agency, e.g., the Albertine Rift whichstraddles both the East and Central African regions (Plumptre, pers. comm.). Funding,for instance through trust funds, may also be essential for the purchase of key parcels ofland, e.g., adjacent to the core areas of existing protected areas, or to create corridors orbuffer zones (Barborak, pers. comm.). National-level funding, from government agen- cies and/or NGOs, is essential for all aspects of adaptation, from research and monitor-ing through planning and land acquisition to active management activities. Conclusion Even if the resources can be found to implement many of the actions discussed above,with support from local people, governments, and the private sector, there are likely tobe significant losses of many alpine and montane species in coming decades\u2014though itshould also be recognised that certain species will benefit from climate change. Climatechange is a new factor of change affecting montane and alpine ecosystems and species,adding to the existing stresses described in Stresses and vulnerabilities section, pg. 90,deriving from local pollution, agriculture, forestry, freshwater abstraction, tourism andrecreation, infrastructure development, and the introduction of alien species. Reductionsin these direct stresses are an essential prerequisite to all adaptation strategies; to be en-sured through actions at all levels from individual behavior to the effective implementa-tion of national and international legal instruments. Yet the key focus for adaptation is not in the mountains, but among the people, govern- ments, and businesses of an increasingly urbanized planet whose people are ever moredependent both on the fossil fuels whose combustion causes climate change and onwater deriving from mountain areas. To make these links, those responsible for moun- tain protected areas should take the lead in promoting the development of, and utilising,WWF 88state-of-the-art technologies in alternative energy sources and energy conservation. These are often particularly appropriate in mountain areas because of their high solar ra-diation, steep watercourses, and windiness, and because costs of connection to regionalor national grids and of transmission are high (Schweizer and Preiser, 1997). Similarly,state-of-the art methods of water use and management should be implemented in moun-tain protected areas. The implementation of such technologies locally will have minimaldirect effect on alpine and montane ecosystems. However, well-illustrated, clear inter-pretative materials and programs addressed to the millions of people who visit mountainprotected areas could have an important impact in raising awareness of the vital heritagethey protect\u2014and the ways in which it is endangered by climate change.

Ogden 2 1WWF International Arctic Programme 2Northern Climate ExChange IN THE ARCTIC,CLIMATE CHANGE is expected to be among the most rapid and ex- tensive of any region on Earth. Warmer temperatures and melting ice dramatically alteringthe structure and function of arctic ecosystems over the next century. However, the impactsof climate change cannot be considered in isolation from other forces of change affectingthe region. For example, while arctic habitats are relatively unmodified by human activities,economic development in the region depends on the exploitation of both living and non-liv-ing resources. As a consequence, there is added potential for impacts on biodiversity. The challenge this chapter faces is to provide suggestions for action that can be taken in response to cummulative impacts, the details of which are poorly understood, while theeffects are likely to be widespread and substantial. Crucial Aspects of Arctic Ecosystems While various definitions exist to describe the geographical extent of the Arctic, we use theboundary defined by the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) working groupin this discussion (Figure 1). It encompasses the ecosystems found from the forest-tundratransition zone northward on land, and in adjacent marine areas north to the arctic basin. Figure 1:The CAFF boundary is used in this discussion to delimit the Arctic. Source:CAFF.Since the Arctic is a vast geographical area distinguished by a variety of landforms and complex interactions between land, water and the atmosphere, the characteristics of bio-diversity in arctic ecosystems are unique (Hansell et al., 1998). Arctic ecosystems con-tribute significantly to the diversity of life on Earth since they contain many species,habitats, ecological processes and biological adaptations not found elsewhere on theplanet. Relative to other ecosystems, the Arctic is species-poor. On an evolutionary time scale, the terrestrial ecosystems are very young and rapidly evolving (Jonasson et al., 2000).Many species in the Arctic live within marginal habitats at the edge of their ranges. Aspecies at the edge of its range tends to be highly sensitive to environmental conditions,so the abundance and distribution of its population can undergo wide swings as condi-tions change. While few endemic genera and species are found in the Arctic, there arerelatively more endemic subspecies, and the genetic diversity within a species can behigh (Jonasson et al., 2000). The few endemic species that are found in the Arctic areadapted to a range of habitats and food resources that otherwise would be occupied bycompeting species if they were present. The dominant feature of the marine environment is sea ice. Pack ice is present at the North Pole year round permitting limited light penetration into the water column and re-sulting in low primary production. Around the periphery of the Arctic Ocean and in themarginal shelf seas, ice forms and melts annually. Seasonal ice cover varies from year toyear. The annual release of freshwater during the spring melt creates a highly productiveenvironment. Large numbers of organisms from all trophic levels can be found along iceedges, leads and polynyas where the interaction of ice, sunlight and water currents isgreatest (Stirling, 1997). These highly productive waters sustain important fishery resources. Fisheries in north- ern waters account for about 47% of total global production (FAO, 2002). The westernBering Sea has the largest fish biomass for Pacific cod and cod-like fishes, the world'slargest pollock fishery is in the eastern Bering Sea, and the Barents'capelin stock is po-tentially the largest in the world (Duda and Sherman, 2002; NOAA et al., 2003). Othercommercially valuable species found in northern waters include herring, halibut,salmon, and shrimp. The Arctic has been home to indigenous peoples for millennia. Their historical patterns of resource use reflected the environmental conditions of the day. These conditionsoften varied from season to season and year to year, and settlement patterns correspond-ingly adapted to resource availability. Today, the traditional use of living resources forhunting, trapping, fishing and reindeer husbandry remains an important part of the cul-ture of many arctic indigenous peoples. The importance of this special relationship toland and resources in the Arctic is reflected in the growing number of political and insti-tutional arrangements at the local, national and international levels. Home rule in Green-land, land claims in Alaska and parts of northern Canada, and the continuing discussionsWWF 96of such matters in Scandinavia and Russia, has led to varying degrees of self-govern- ment, land ownership, and influence over ecosystem and resource management deci-sions by indigenous peoples in the Arctic. As part of their natural function, arctic ecosystems provide goods and services that are crucial both locally and globally. To maintain the flow of ecosystem goods and servicesit is critical to maintain ecosystem function including the cycling of water, the cycling ofnutrients, the flow of energy, and biodiversity (Pimm, 1986). In the Arctic, local goodsand services include the resource base that provides food, supports cultural traditions,opportunities for recreation, research and education, economic activity and energy re-sources. The Arctic is also intimately linked by air masses, ocean currents, river systemsand migratory species to other ecosystems around the globe, thereby providing globalgoods and services. Some examples of these include: the storage of 40% of the world'sreactive soil carbon, global heat transport through ocean currents and energy exchangeswith the atmosphere, freshwater input into the Arctic Ocean which may influence thethermohaline circulation of the global oceans, and fisheries contributions to the globalfood supply (IPCC, 2001a). The Arctic is a source of potentially large feedbacks to theglobal climate system. The net effect or time scale of these feedbacks is poorly under-stood; nevertheless, the impacts of ecosystem changes on the ability of arctic ecosys-tems to provide these various goods and services will be felt across the world. Stresses Due to Factors Other Than Climate Change The influence of human activity can now be detected in even the remotest regions of theArctic. Climate change is only one of the many factors affecting the future of arcticecosystems. Industry, infrastructure development, and large-scale resource exploitationare advancing in arctic ecosystems. Major economic and community development ben-efits are expected in connection with these activities. At the same time serious threats tothe cultural, spiritual and environmental heritage of the Arctic are also likely. Forces of change in arctic ecosystems include overfishing, shipping, the exploitation of natural resources, pollution and the long-range transport of contaminants, and increasedultraviolet (UV) radiation due to the depletion of stratospheric ozone (AMAP, 2002;CAFF, 2001; IPCC, 2001b). These non-climate stresses may impede the ability of arcticecosystems to respond to climate change. OVERFISHING Today, global production from capture fisheries and aquaculture is currently the highest on record and is very important for global food security. While recent increases in cap-ture fisheries production have come mainly from the southeast Pacific, fleets based inthe eight arctic countries are among the top producers and account for more than 14% ofglobal fish landings (FAO, 2002). Unfortunately, the number of populations that are overfished, as well as the indirect ef- fects of fisheries on marine ecosystems through bycatch and habitat destruction, indi-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 97 CHAPTER 4 ArcticWWF 98 cate that management has failed to achieve its principal goal of sustainability (Botsford et al., 1997). Since 1975, several stocks in the Barents Sea have suffered from overfish-ing leading to substantially reduced yields in the 1970s and 1980s. While strong fish-eries management measures have since been put into place, actual catches of fish havefrequently exceeded the advised limits (Nakken, 1998). In addition, certain harvesting methods pose a serious threat to non-target species. Ex- tensive bottom trawling for cod and prawns, as well as sea-floor dredging for scallops,takes place throughout the Arctic. Such fishing techniques can alter the structure and di-versity of complex benthic communities by leveling the seafloor, removing slow-grow- ing sedentary organisms, and increasing suspended sediment loads. SHIPPING Shipping has a significant impact on the marine environment through atmospheric emis-sions, noise, leakage of antifouling agents, and operational discharges of sewage,garbage, sludge, bilge, solid oil and waste oil (Table 1). Discharges resulting from acci-dental events such as collisions, groundings, and fires have major environmental im-pacts. Among wildlife, the biophysical conditions of the Arctic have resulted in special-ists that are long-lived, slow to mature, and have conservative reproductive strategies.The loss of mature adults has a disproportionate impact on the ability of the populationto renew its numbers (Musick, 1999). Large oil spills and similar accidents can be dev-astating because mature adults are the most impacted, leaving behind a younger popula-tion that is slow or unable to recover. Table 1:Maritime operations and their impact on the marine environment. Source:after PAME (2000).

Moreover, exotic organisms and pathogens carried in ships'ballast water have devastat-ed native flora and fauna all over the globe, and in the Arctic where most organisms arelikely to be at the margins of their thermal tolerances, warming may give exotic speciesincreased opportunities to survive, spread, and form problem populations. RESOURCE EXPLOITATION If not properly managed, commercial exploitation of the Arctic's natural resources\u2014in-cluding fisheries, wildlife, oil and gas, and minerals\u2014can seriously threaten biodiversity,ecosystem function, and traditional cultural practices. Cumulative environmental effects as-sessment recognizes that the effects on the environment from individual human activitiescan combine and interact with each other to cause effects that may be different in nature orextent from the effects of the individual activities themselves (Hegmann et al., 1999). The National Research Council in the United States (2003) undertook a study of the cu- mulative environmental effects of oil and gas activities on Alaska's North Slope since1965. The NRC's findings indicate that Alaska's environment and culture have been sig-nificantly affected by oil infrastructure and activities. Effects have accumulated fromroad building, damage from off-road travel, interference with subsistence activities, andsocial changes in local communities\u2014although these are noted to be both positive andnegative. Animal populations have been affected in a number of ways. Bowhead whale migra- tions seem to have been displaced by the noise of seismic exploration. In addition,garbage and food produced in oil field operations have resulted in higher than normaldensities of predators (e.g. polar bears, arctic foxes, and glaucous gulls) which prey onthe eggs, nestlings and fledglings of birds. As a result, the reproduction rates of somebird species in industrial areas, including various geese, eiders and shorebirds, are insome years insufficient to balance death rates (NRC, 2003). In the Arctic there is a significant degree of overlap between biologically important areas and the continental shelf where considerable reserves of hydrocarbons exist (Stir-ling, 1997). Threats associated with the operation of offshore facilities include the riskof blowout, discharges of produced water, chemicals and drilling muds, leaks frompipelines, sea floor disruption, and increased shipping to and from installations and pro-cessing facilities. A large oil spill in marine waters would likely have substantial effectson animal populations because current cleanup methods can remove only a small frac-tion of spilled oil under conditions of broken ice. At present there is just one truly off-shore facility operating in the Arctic, the Northstar facility in Alaska, however planningfor a number of new facilities is currently underway. CONTAMINATION AND POLLUTION Environmental contaminants occur at relatively high levels in some arctic species and,in many cases, the long-term biological and ecological effects are not yet known. LocalBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 99 CHAPTER 4 ArcticWWF 100 pollution from industrial activities, such as mining and oil and gas development, can negatively affect the environments surrounding these developments. However, in themid-1980s, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were discovered to be accumulating inarctic food webs (Downie and Fenge, 2003). These include PCBs, pesticides like DDT,dioxins, furans, and brominated flame retardants which are transported to the Arcticthrough air, river and ocean currents from points of origin further south. POPs accumu-late in the body fat of animals, so marine mammals and scavengers at higher trophic lev-els are most susceptible. Mammals such as the polar bear, arctic fox, killer whale, north-ern fur seal, and birds such as the glaucous gull, all tend to carry high contaminant loads(CAFF, 2001). Mercury, lead and cadmium are all present in the Arctic. According to the most recent assessment of arctic pollution, there is a trend of increasing mercury levels in marinebirds and mammals in the Canadian Arctic and possibly also western Greenland; cadmi-um levels in some seabirds are high enough to cause kidney damage; and while levels ofanthropogenic radionuclides in the Arctic are declining, releases from reprocessingplants have resulted in increases in levels of technetium-99 and iodine-129 in the Euro-pean Arctic (AMAP, 2002). OZONE DEPLETION The release of the synthetic chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) into the at-mosphere, through various industrial processes and other human activities, causes ozonedepletion in the stratosphere. The problem is most pronounced over polar regions duringspring because of cold temperatures and lack of sunlight. For each 1% decrease instratospheric ozone, the amount of UV-B radiation reaching the Earth's surface increas-es by 1.5% to 2%. Enhanced UV-B radiation can have subtle but long term impacts onecosystem processes that reduce nutrient cycling and indirectly decrease productivity(Fergusson and Warlde, 1998). Since the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which banned the use of CFCs, the rate of ozone destruction has slowed to around 3-5% per decade. There is preliminaryevidence of a reversal in the Earth's ozone decline (Newchurch et al., in press), howev- er, global warming may interfere with ozone recovery by altering the way in which airmixes in the lower stratosphere. Model simulations suggest that warming over NorthernHemisphere continents could delay arctic ozone recovery (Shindell, 2003), thus posinga longer term threat of ecosystem damage due to increased UV radiation. Present and Future Stress Due to Climate Change The Arctic is already demonstrating clear evidence of change consistent with what is ex-pected to result from warming temperatures, and matches trends that have been project-ed by general circulation models. According to the most recent assessment carried outby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), extensive land areas in theArctic show a 20th century warming trend in air temperature by as much as 5\u00b0C accom-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 101 CHAPTER 4 Arcticpanied by an increase in precipitation (IPCC, 2001b). As a result, regional studies have been undertaken to assess the impacts of climate change in the Mackenzie Valley(Cohen, 1997), Bering Sea (Weller and Anderson, 1999), and Barents Sea (Lange,2002). Recognizing the general vulnerability of arctic ecosystems, the Arctic Council 3 has commissioned the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA). The goal of ACIA isto gather knowledge on climate change and ultraviolet radiation in order to provide reli-able information to governments and people; environmental, human health, social, andeconomic impacts will be included in the assessment (ACIA, 2000). A peer-reviewedvolume synthesizing the current science of arctic climate change will be published late in 2004. Early results from ACIA show that while the greatest warming is expected over the Arc- tic Ocean, by 2070 temperatures will on average increase by 3.4\u00b0C for the area north of60\u00b0latitude; this is double the projected global average. Changes of this magnitude willirrevocably alter arctic ecosystems, leaving behind a natural world that will be nearlyunrecognizable to today's arctic residents. Patterns of climate change within the Arctic are complicated, as they vary in rate and magnitude by region and by season. Some anticipated impacts of climate change in ter-restrial and marine ecosystems are summarized below, as are vulnerabilities. TERRESTRIALECOSYSTEMS Arctic landscapes have already begun to reveal the impacts of climate change. Regions un-derlain by permafrost have decreased in extent. A general warming of ground tempera-tures and the thickening of the active soil layer has been observed in many areas, particu-larly at the southern margins of the Arctic close to and south of the treeline (IPCC, 2001b). Important ecological changes that appear to have been triggered by warming are also being documented in terrestrial ecosystems across the circumpolar north. Reduced nu-tritional value of caribou and moose browse, decreased water availability, and increasedforest fire tendencies have been detected (Weller and Lange, 1999). The Arctic Transi-tions in the Land-Atmosphere System (ATLAS) program has recorded an advance andinfilling of trees at the treeline, as well as an expansion of shrubs in the northern portionof the Arctic (Chapin, 2002). These vegetation changes may also explain some of thesummer warming that has recently been recorded in northern Alaska and the other re-gions of the Arctic. The effects of climatic warming on local environmental conditions have not gone unno- ticed by the indigenous communities living in the Arctic. Krupnik and Jolly (2002) doc-umented observations of change from the perspective of twenty-three indigenous com-munities. Elders report that they are seeing species of birds and animals farther norththan previously recalled, and new species are appearing that have never been seen be-fore. Elders also note that the weather is more unpredictable than it used to be (Jolly etal., 2002). 3The Arctic Council (www.arctic- council.org) is a high-level forum by thecountries whose borders cross theArctic Circle: Canada, Denmark,Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russ-ian Federation, Sweden, and theUnited States. Decisions and priori-ties are set with active participationand full consultation of arctic in-digenous representatives.Changes in arctic climate are expected to continue throughout the 21st century and per- sist for many centuries to come, bringing with them major physical, ecological, socio-logical and economic transformations (IPCC, 2001b). The greatest changes in tempera-ture are projected to take place during the winter months; extreme cold temperatures areexpected to be less severe and occur less often. Precipitation in terrestrial ecosystems will increase by 10-20% in summer months, and by 5-80% in winter months (IPCC,2001b). In almost all regions, these projections are well beyond the range of variabilityof the current climate patterns. As warming occurs, there will be changes in species compositions with a tendency for poleward and elevational shifts in species assemblages, the establishment of new assem-blages of species, and the loss of some polar species (IPCC, 2001b). Vast areas of theArctic may develop entirely different ecosystems from those that exist currently (Everettand Fitzharris, 1998). Ecosystem models project that the area of tundra will decrease bytwo-thirds from its present size, due to an expansion of the boreal forest (Everett andFitzharris, 1998). Vegetation changes that result from warming are expected to furtherenhance regional temperature increases in the Arctic. Chapin (2002) has found that al-tering the vegetation of the tundra from its current state of no shrubs to one of beingshrub-dominated would increase mean July temperatures by 1.5 to 3.5 \u00b0C. Modifications to wildlife populations are also projected to result from warmer tempera- tures in the Arctic, including changes in population size, structure, and migration routes.A consensus has not been reached on the probable impacts of climate change on ungu-lates. On the one hand, changes in the timing and location of food sources, an increasein parasites and insect-borne disease, and more insect harassment may lead to declinesin animal populations such as caribou and muskox (Gunn, 1995). On the other hand,caribou appear to be highly resilient to changing environmental conditions because theyare generalist feeders (Callaghan et al., 1998). Insects will benefit from a warmer Arctic,since many insects are constrained from expanding north due to cold winter tempera-tures (Parmesan, 1998). Permafrost melting may substantially alter ecosystems in situa-tions where the melted permafrost results in landslides, leading to poor water qualitythat is detrimental to fish and other wildlife. Small increases in temperature will amplify the melting of snow and ice, the hydrology of the North is particularly susceptible to warming since snow and ice drive virtually allof the major hydrological processes and related aquatic ecosystems in the Arctic (IPCC,2001b). The runoff regime is expected to be driven increasingly by rainfall, with lessseasonal variation in runoff. Because the ice cover on lakes and rivers will be thinner,freeze up later, and breakup earlier, the rates of primary productivity in aquatic ecosys-tems will be affected (Rouse et al., 1997). Also related to hydrology is the ability of arc-tic wetlands to act as a source or sink for carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane. Peatlands may dry out because of increased evaporation and plant transpiration, thus becoming asource of greenhouse gases. With a doubling of atmospheric CO 2concentrations, the southern boundary of peatlands in Canada is projected to move northward 200-300 kmWWF 102(Gignac and Vitt, 1994). It is still uncertain as to whether the current status of northern peatlands as a global sink for CO2will change to a source. MARINE ECOSYSTEMS Arctic sea ice is both an indicator of climate change (through changes in extent andthickness) as well as a factor capable of influencing global climate through ice-albedofeedbacks and thermohaline circulation. Sea ice is sensitive to temperature changes in the air above as well as in the ocean below. Winter maximum ice extent decreased by approximately 3% per decade through the 1980s and 1990s (Parkinson et al., 1999) while summer minimum extent has shrunk by9% per decade over the same period (Comiso, 2002). New period-of-record minimahave been reached several times over the past ten years (Serreze et al., 2003). Ice thick-ness, as observed from submarine transects, is estimated to have decreased by 40% be-tween 1958 and 1997 (Rothrock et al., 1999), however, models have shown that theseobservations may not necessarily be true for the whole of the Arctic Ocean (Holloway &Sou, 2001). Global warming, as forced by observed greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosols, has been shown to cause reductions in the area covered by sea ice (Vinnikov etal., 1999). Probable changes in sea ice over the next century will alter the albedo of thesurface, creating a feedback to the global climate system. Sea ice is important because itreflects more incoming solar radiation than the sea surface (i.e., it has a higher albedo).Therefore, a reduction in sea ice gives a positive feedback on climate warming. Signifi-cant changes in albedo over large areas also have the potential to produce a nonlinear,accelerated change (IPCC, 2001b). The Arctic Ocean plays a significant role in the thermohaline circulation of the world's oceans. Most coupled ocean-atmospheric models show a weakening of thermohalinecirculation from the North Atlantic by 2100 due to increased freshwater input from largearctic rivers and melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Although there remains consider-able uncertainty as to the likelihood of an irreversible collapse of global thermohalinecirculation, perturbations caused by increased freshwater inputs resulting in a reorgani-zation of global ocean circulation can lead to abrupt climate change (IPCC, 2001b;Manabe and Stouffer, 1994). The most recent assessment of circumpolar climate change indicates that primary pro- duction in marine environments will likely increase, species assemblages will shiftnorthward, and ice-associated species will decline (IPCC, 2001b). It is important to rec-ognize, however, that changes in water temperature, ocean currents and sea ice regimeswill be non-uniform across arctic marine ecosystems and our understanding of marinebiodiversity is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions about the probable effects.While impacts on individual species and species groups can be generalized by changesin physical habitats, food availability, and predator-prey relationships we should expectBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 103 CHAPTER 4 Arcticsurprises along the way! Arctic marine food webs can be very complex but with only a few key species connecting the different levels, so changes in one trophic level can eas-ily propagate to others. CHANGES TO PHYSICAL HABITATS The changes in physical habitats likely to result from different water temperatures andsea ice regimes will produce both winners and losers. Warmer temperatures will favormany fish species while the reduction of sea ice will have substantial impacts on marinemammals (IPCC, 2001b). Temperature appears to be a major determinant in several as-pects of fish ecology and recruitment seems to be significantly better in warm years thanin cold years; the same is true for growth (Loeng, 1989). Distributions of fish stocks thatare determined by water temperature are likely to retract north while new species intro-ductions will arrive from southern waters. There will be negative consequences for marine mammals and seabirds dependent on ice for breeding and foraging (Tynan and DeMaster, 1997). Changes in the extent andtype of ice cover will reduce the ability of polar bears to access prey, forcing them tomove north or to stay on land for longer periods, thus increasing nutritional stress andlowering reproductive success (Stirling and Derocher, 1993). Polar bears in Wapusk Na-tional Park in western Hudson Bay are expected to be extirpated from the park (Scottand Suffling, 2000), although population numbers there are currently stable (Lunn et al.,2002). Ice-associated seals, especially ringed seals, are particularly vulnerable tochanges in the extent and character of sea ice because they depend on ice for so manyaspects of their life cycle (Tynan and DeMaster, 1997). True arctic cetaceans\u2014bow-head, beluga and narwhal\u2014spend much of their time in areas with significant amount ofice cover, having specialized in foraging for ice-associated species, and will likely seeincreased competition from migratory whale species (Kovacs, 2003). CHANGES TO FOOD AVAILABILITY Thinner ice cover will increase the solar radiation penetrating to the underlying waterthereby increasing photosynthetic production. Earlier melting of the ice in spring willalso extend the growing season, although this is dependent on local changes in up-welling, vertical mixing, and freshwater inputs (IPCC, 2001b). Of increasing interestare the effects that the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) haveon ecological processes (Stenseth et al., 2002). This atmospheric pattern accounts formajor variations in weather and climate around the world and may affect the relativetiming of food requirement and food availability known as the \"match-mismatch hy-pothesis\" (Cushing, 1990). The concept of match and mismatch is essential in food-webenergy transfers: a match implies that the predators are located in the same space and atthe same time as their prey, while mismatch implies that they are not. Match and mismatch are important for primary production in terms of grazing (which drives food webs) and sedimentation (which controls nutrients) (Sakshaug, 2003; Sak-shaug et al., 1992), however it can also be applied to the foraging success of many seabirdsWWF 104(Kovacs, 2003). Seabirds are vulnerable to changes in prey availability particularly during the breeding season where a major constraint on breeding distribution is the distance be-tween suitable nesting sites on shore and feeding zones at sea. If the temporal distributionof macrozooplankton shifts outside of the reproductive season, or their spatial distributionmoves away from nesting proximity, then a mismatch occurs which can result in repro-ductive failure. Matches and mismatches are both likely to occur and suggests that the im-pacts of climate change on sea birds will vary geographically (Kovacs, 2003). CHANGES IN PREDATOR-PREY RELATIONSHIPS As individual species adjust to climate change, interactions among species will alsochange, especially in predator-prey relationships. If ice-inhabiting seals or walrus, forexample, are forced to haul out on land to complete their molt or maintain proximity to food sources, they could be more exposed to new predators such as grizzly bears andwolves (Lowry, 2000). At the same time, studies of fish species in the Barents Sea show that changes in sea temperature may increase metabolic rates of cod and result in an in-crease in consumption of capelin by 100,000 tons per degree Celsius (Bogstad andGj\u00f8s\u00e6ter, 1994). Some of the changes in predator-prey relationships may actually represent the natural adaptive capacity of the species themselves. In western Hudson Bay, for example, wheredirect impacts to polar bears have been observed due to a reduced feeding period in thelate spring and early summer when seals\u2014especially young ringed seals\u2014are mostavailable (Stirling et al., 1999), studies of alternative prey species are underway. These include assessments of species which may change in their relative and absolute abun-dance in relation to changes in sea ice and winter availability of open water. It is possi-ble that populations of bearded and harbour seals may increase in western Hudson Bayas the amount of open water during winter increases. If so, these alternate prey specieswill become more important in the diet of polar bears there, potentially prolonging thesurvival of the western Hudson Bay population, at least in the short term while there isstill enough annual ice present in the bay (Stirling pers. comm.). VULNERABILITIES Arctic ecosystems are often considered to be fragile. However, some arctic scientists areskeptical of this assessment since many arctic species are generalists that can surviveover a wide range of conditions, making them highly disturbance adapted. The high ge- netic diversity and the vast numbers of sub-species within arctic populations are a re-flection of how arctic species have adapted to local conditions over time. This naturaladaptive capacity is an important characteristic that can help protect arctic species fromthe impacts of environmental changes. Endemic species, however, are vulnerable toboth competition by species invading from the south and habitat loss; this is especiallytrue for ice-associated species such as the walrus, ringed polar bear. In addition,the Arctic's low-diversity, ecosystems have limited functional redundancy(CAFF, 2001). In such ecosystems, certain ecological roles may depend on relativelyfew species. As a consequence, while an individual species may be resilient to environ-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 105 CHAPTER 4 Arcticmental alteration, the system as a whole may be vulnerable to the inability of a single species to adapt, especially if that species performs a key ecosystem function. Climate change has the potential to have significant effects on commercial and industri- al activity in the Arctic, resulting in both positive and negative economic impacts (IPCC,2001b; Maxwell, 1997; Weller and Lange, 1999). Longer, warmer summers could in-crease tourism and the number of visitors to the region. Increases in precipitation couldrequire costly upgrades and redesign of tailing dams and water diversion structures inthe mining industry. In addition, an increase in the length of the annual frost-free periodcould affect access to many oil and gas exploration sites, currently reached via winterroads built on frozen ground. In areas where permafrost is susceptible to climate change,melting may cause the foundations of buildings to shift unevenly, the rupture and buck-ling of pipelines and storage tanks, and the structural integrity of older buildings, watersupplies and waste disposal infrastructure to be threatened. Failure to retrofit old struc-tures as conditions change will pose a risk of serious polluting events. Due to the potential implications of global warming for traditional ways of life, resource development and conservation, the projected impacts of climate change are of consider-able concern to residents of the North. Northern indigenous peoples have demonstratedtheir resilience to change over time; however, the cumulative effects of climate changeand human development may result in unexpected challenges to cultural sustainability.Shifts in the habitat and diversity of food species due to climate change could impact thecultural and religious lives of some indigenous peoples (Gitay et al., 2002). Changes totraditional diets have already resulted in an increased incidence of diabetes, heart dis-ease and obesity in some indigenous populations, and any additional dietary changesmay be detrimental to the health of northern residents. Langdon (1995) concluded thatthe combination of alternative cultural lifestyles and altered subsistence opportunitiesresulting from global warming may pose the greatest threat of all to the continuity of in-digenous cultures. Assessment of Adaptation Options If ecosystems are to adapt successfully to climate change, effective management mustsupport and build on species'and ecosystems'natural resilience while reducing vulner-abilities. In an environmental context, resilience is the ability of ecosystems, habitat types and species to maintain a relatively constant state in the face of disturbance and stress, andto recover quickly after a temporary disturbance (Noss, 2001). Some arctic species aremore resilient to climate change than others, for example by being better able to migrateto more favorable habitat; thus, in the marine environment pelagic communities are gen-erally more resilient than benthic communities. Vulnerability is the susceptibility of ecosystems, habitat types and species to the adverse impacts of change. As defined by the IPCC, vulnerability is a function of the character,WWF 106BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 107 CHAPTER 4 Arcticmagnitude, and rate of change of climatic variation to which a system is exposed, as well as its sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Some arctic species\u2014for example, those that de-pend on sea ice\u2014are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than others. Because global warming is expected to change many of the defining characteristics of the Arctic, there are few options for adapting to climate change. In fact, the best chancearctic ecosystems have for long-term biodiversity conservation is to slow, and eventual-ly stop, anthropogenic climate change. However, two traditional conservation approach-es can be applied to support the resilience of species and ecosystems: habitat protectionand the reduction of non-climate stresses. HABITAT PROTECTION The establishment of protected areas is the conventional way to protect landscapes,ecosystems, and habitats. Identifying and protecting key areas prior to development is aluxury in many areas of the Arctic that is no longer possible in some of the more devel-oped parts of the world. However, industrial development and commercial activity in theArctic are increasing pace, and experience from other regions shows that once major de-velopment begins, options for large-scale habitat protection are foreclosed. While the establishment of protected areas is important for conservation, it is highly unlikely thatthe more traditional approach to designating protected areas in the Arctic will be ade-quate in the long-term to protect biodiversity, given the magnitude of ecosystem impactsthat are projected to arise from climate change. New and creative approaches to protect-ing habitats will be required. The vast majority of arctic ecosystems remain unprotected, especially in the marine en- vironment. Yet arctic governments have committed to protecting a circumpolar net-work of protected areas under CPAN 4. Establishing a representative network linking terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems must be a top priority. Special emphasisshould be on representing habitat types across environmental gradients following theexpected path of climate change and shifting habitats, and protecting heterogeneous ecosystems and habitats with high species diversity. Protected area design should beguided by the following. PROTECT RESILIENT AND VULNERABLE ENVIRONMENTS An urgent priority for scientists and managers is to identify and protect particularly re-silient and vulnerable habitat types, species, and populations/stocks. This analysisshould include resilience and vulnerability to the effects of climate change, as well asthe cumulative effects of non-climate stresses. Many sources of knowledge can con-tribute to such an analysis, including traditional knowledge, field studies and modeling. Protect keystone species Certain species are so essential to ecosystem function that their disappearance, or a sharp reduction in their numbers, can result in the disappearance or reduction of otherspecies. These so-called keystone species thus play a key role in the maintenance ofhealthy ecosystems. Resource managers should identify keystone species for theirecosystems and implement conservation strategies for them, such as precautionary har- vesting targets. PROTECT ALONG CLIMATIC GRADIENTS While protected areas can be established to either shelter keystone species or to con- serve representative ecosystem types, perhaps the most significant influence on the abil-ity of ecosystems in the Arctic to adapt to climate change is the ability of arctic flora andfauna to move northwards with rising temperatures. Protected area strategies will need to ensure the continuity of habitat areas along environmental gradients. PROMOTE CONNECTIVITY The degree of connectivity between protected areas, along with the uses adjacent tothem, influence the resilience of flora and fauna to climate change (Feenstra et al.,1998). Removing impediments to migration and preventing the creation of new impedi-ments will be critical to facilitate the northward movement of species with climatechange. This can be achieved by linking protected areas through the establishment ofmigration corridors. PROTECT CLIMATE REFUGIA Due to localized climatic conditions, some habitats are more resistant to the effects ofclimate change than others. These areas are known as climate refugia. A priority for sci-entists and managers should be to identify potential climate refugia for arctic species; anexample might be the high Canadian archipelago where polar bears have easy access to both feeding areas on the ice and denning areas on land. A conservation priority shouldbe to protect climate refugia from non-climate stresses and include them in reserve sys-tems that link climate-vulnerable habitat to refugia. AVOID FRAGMENTATION Many arctic species require non-fragmented habitats to maintain healthy populations. Similarly, indigenous peoples require large stretches of undisturbed landscapes in orderto maintain their traditional practices (CAFF, 2001). Although the Arctic still boasts ofsome of the largest stretches of undisturbed habitats on the planet, shifting ecosystemscaused by climate change, and habitat disturbance and fragmentation caused by devel-opment activities, are increasing threats and may become barriers to the northward mi-gration of species. One of the best methods available to avoid habitat fragmentation isfor land-use planning processes to incorporate this issue at the pre-development stage. PROTECT AT MULTIPLE SCALES Biodiversity conservation strategies need to be implemented at the local, regional and cir-cumpolar scales. Such strategies are essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems and con-serving arctic biodiversity. It is important to network protected areas on a circumpolarbasis because no single country can ensure habitat protection for migratory species, andbecause critical areas that must be protected to maintain the biodiversity and productivityof the entire arctic ecosystem will often fall under multiple jurisdictions. WWF 108 4The Circumpolar Protected Areas Network (CPAN) was establishedin 1998 and is a subgroup ofCAFF, the Arctic Council's work-ing group for the Conservation ofarctic Flora and Fauna. BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 109 CHAPTER 4 ArcticA strategic plan to establish a circumpolar network of protected areas has been completed by CAFF and endorsed by the eight arctic countries (CAFF, 1997). The plan specifies na-tional and circumpolar actions to fill gaps in habitat protection. While CPAN was not es-tablished exclusively to combat climate change, this network will help to maintain ecosys-tem function and the flow of goods and services from and within arctic ecosystems, goalsthat are consistent with facilitating the natural response of ecosystems to climate change. The initial burst of creating new protected areas, particularly in the Russian Arctic, has since come to a standstill. While protected areas currently cover approximately 15% ofthe terrestrial Arctic area, they are unevenly distributed across ecosystems and habitats;over 35% of arctic glaciers are protected, but less than 5% of the forest tundra (CAFF, 2001). In the coming years, CPAN will need to re-establish the momentum for creatingprotected areas and increase both protection of marine areas as well as productive ter-restrial habitats. REDUCTION OF NON-CLIMATE STRESSES There is growing evidence that healthy species and ecosystems are more resilient to en-vironmental change, including climate change (Burton, 2001). In general, the stresscaused by climate change will lessen resilience to non-climate stresses such as pollutionand vice versa, meaning that currently acceptable contaminant thresholds may eventual-ly be too high. Therefore, another key adaptation strategy for arctic ecosystems is thedramatic reduction of non-climate stresses. HARVESTING REGIMES Harvesting wild species is perhaps the most common form of natural resource use acrossall regions and peoples of the Arctic (Freese, 2000). Since the distribution of flora andfauna in the Arctic is likely to change with the changing climate, changing the location or intensity of harvesting activities may become necessary. In those situations where popu-lations of harvested species are showing serious declines, substituting store bought foodsfor traditional foods may need to be considered. However, this option would likely proveto be problematic for many indigenous communities, particularly in remote areas wherefood costs are high and where traditional foods are an important way of life. Since hunting and fishing are of such importance to the health and well-being of arctic peoples, a better option is to manage habitats and harvesting activities to ensure an eco-logically sustainable supply of wild species into the future. Freese (2000) conducted areview of what must be done to ensure that the use of wild species in the Arctic does notcompromise the biodiversity and ecological integrity of the region over the long term.This review provides fifteen guidelines 5that concern the consumptive use of wild species. If implemented, the cumulative impacts of climate change and harvesting activ-ities on populations of wild species could be avoided. In addition, stricter fishing quotas and the establishment of no-take zones are necessary to address the problem of overfishing. Nakken (1998) advises that management authoritiestake a more precautionary approach when setting total allowable catch limits due to the dis- crepancies that exist between recommended limits and actual catches. His research indi-cates that setting limits at or below estimates for total allowable catch could lower the rateof exploitation and stabilize or even increase the yields of most commercial fish stocks. SHIPPING STANDARDS Climate change will likely result in an expansion of shipping due to year-round accessalong the whole of the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage, as well as new oiland gas developments throughout the Arctic. This implies a significantly increased riskof accidents. While shipping will always entail some level of environmental risk, muchcan be done to reduce this risk, inter alia: The quality standards of ships operating in arctic waters must be high. Compliance with quality standards must be ensured by strict port controls of the vessels. Discharge regulations in the Arctic must be very strict, for example by granting high-latitude waters special area status under various annexes of the InternationalConvention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Compliancewith the regulations must be ensured through surveillance and monitoring, coupledwith effective sanctions toward violations. Ship traffic must be steered away from the most sensitive locations, for example by the use of mandatory shipping routes and \"no-go\" areas. Close surveillance and monitoring of shipping activity is needed to prevent colli- sions and for early detection of ships in distress. The whole,or parts,of theBarentsSea should begranted status asaParticularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) by the International Maritime Organization. Within a PSSA, a wide range of protective measures can be applied to reduce the risks involved in shipping. ARCTIC POLLUTION Local sources of pollution are regulated by legislation within each arctic nation. How-ever, because many contaminants originate from outside the Arctic, the mitigation of arctic pollution requires international action. Indigenous peoples were instrumental indrawing international attention to the issue of long-range transport of POPs (Downieand Fenge, 2003). Subsequently, international negotiations led to the signing of theStockholm Convention, a global treaty signed by 151 countries that regulates the dis-posal, use and release of some of the worst offenders in this category of pollutants; how-ever, about 20 nations still need to ratify the convention before it enters into force. Unfortunately, ongoing monitoring of pollutants in the Arctic shows that other chemi- cals are increasing in volume, especially brominated flame retardants and organic mer-cury which both cause effects similar to those chemicals already banned by the Stock-WWF 110 5Available at http://www.wwf- canada.org/NewsAndFacts/Sup-plemental/ConsumptiveUse-OfWildSpecies.pdfBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 111 CHAPTER 4 Arcticholm Convention (AMAP, 2002). Regional and global agreements on these and other dangerous contaminants are necessary, as is sufficient testing and regulation of bothcommonly used and new chemicals. Support must also be given to the EuropeanUnion's proposed regulatory system called REACH\u2014Registration, Evaluation and Au-thorization of CHemicals\u2014which will bring much needed scrutiny to the health and en-vironmental hazards of chemicals in current use. INVASIVE SPECIES Invasive species are any species\u2014including its seeds, eggs, spores, or other biologicalmaterial capable of propagating that species\u2014that are not native to an ecosystem andwhose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm. Whilenot all invasive species cause ecological stress, some can displace or eliminate nativespecies, disrupt interactions between native species, reduce biological and genetic di-versity by hybridizing with native species, introduce parasites or diseases, and cause socio-economic and recreational impacts (CAFF, 2001). Some studies have shown thatecosystems with high biodiversity have higher resistance to exotic invasions. Thereforethe Arctic, with its low biodiversity, might be more vulnerable to exotic invasions thanother regions in the world. Presently, the magnitude of the threat of invasive species onarctic environments is unclear; however, the potential impacts of this threat warrant fur-ther investigation and precautionary action on species introductions, especially sinceclimate change is expected to result in the migration of new species into the region. TOURISM IMPACTS The Arctic has seen considerable growth in tourism over the last decade. CAFF esti- mates that more than 1.5 million tourists visited the region in the year 2000, but whenthe entire state of Alaska is included in this estimate, the count approximately doubles.Nature and culture are the primary attractions in the Arctic. There is evidence thattourism can benefit conservation efforts by helping to provide an economic value for na-ture and wildlife, and creating support for protected areas (UNEP, 1995). While manyvisitors to the region come to see pristine wilderness, they are also more likely to beaware of environmental issues, and through their experience can become advocates for Arctic conservation in their home countries. However, tourism is also a potential threat to the environment (CBD, 2002). Common concerns are increased fragmentation through permanent infrastructure, damage to soilsand vegetation, wildlife disturbance, and increased waste and pollution. Ship-basedtourism accounts for a large portion of the total tourism numbers in the Arctic, as it pro-vides tourists with comfortable access to the remotest areas; in some arctic destinations,cruise tourism is the primary means of travel to and within the area. In this context,questions of waste water management, ballast water and exotic species introductions,and preparedness in case of accidents must be raised. In cooperation with the tourism industry and other stakeholders, WWF has developed guidelines 6for reducing impacts and increasing benefits of tourism for nature and localpeople in the Arctic. Following these guidelines will help to reduce the potential stress- es that tourism can have on Arctic ecosystems. Guidelines for Selecting Strategies The pace at which change is occurring requires that comprehensive adaptation strategies bedeveloped by arctic nations in the near-term. Under the conditions of a changing climate,the challenge is to adjust human activities in such a way as to protect ecosystem function,maintain the flow of goods and services, and enhance the resilience of arctic ecosystems.The best defenses against biodiversity impacts in the face of climate change will requirecomprehensive strategies that involve local residents and ecosystem-based management. INDIGENOUS PARTICIPATION Human habitats in the region are diverse with settlements ranging from small, remotecommunities to modern, industrial cities. Arctic communities have both formal (e.g. basedon resource extraction) and informal (e.g. based on hunting and herding) economies thatare dependent on the living and non-living resources throughout the region. Out of a total population of around 2 million, there are about 500,000 indigenous people living in the Arctic. Their historical presence in the Arctic demonstrates the incredibleresilience of indigenous cultures through time, nonetheless, indigenous peoples aremore sensitive to climate change than non-indigenous groups because climate changewill directly affect their traditional hunting habitats and subsistence species. Certainforms of hunting are delayed or abandoned under poor ice conditions and traditionallyimportant species such as salmon, herring, walrus, seals, whales, and various birds arelikely to undergo shifts in range and abundance (IPCC, 2001b). The importance of involving indigenous peoples in selecting adaptation options and de- veloping comprehensive management strategies cannot be over-emphasized. One of the clear challenges to understanding past and current climate change in the Arctic is thatour scientific understanding is based on records that are often short-term, fragmentary,or both (Huntington, 2002). For generations, arctic residents have made first-hand ob-servations of climate and environmental variability. This intimate knowledge of the landprovides specific and detailed insights into changing local and regional conditions. Tra-ditional ecological knowledge adds an important dimension to the understanding of cli-mate change impacts that cannot be achieved through models or other scientific meth-ods. Because the combined perspectives of science and traditional knowledge generate abroader understanding of environmental change than either knowledge system can ac-complish on its own (Kofinas, 2002), understanding and addressing climate change inthe Arctic cannot be done adequately without incorporating the views of indigenouspeoples (Huntington, 2002). Residents of the Arctic are best positioned to identify local vulnerabilities and develop lo- cally-appropriate adaptation responses, especially since vulnerabilities to climate changevary across the region. In addition, involving indigenous peoples in adaptation decision-WWF 112 6Available at http://www.ngo.grida.no/wwfap/core/about/guidelines.htmlBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 113 CHAPTER 4 Arcticmaking respects the magnitude of the impacts of climate change on their traditional ways of life, and the patterns of existing and emerging self-governance and land ownership. ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT Resource managers must take into account long-term and cumulative impacts of humanactivities and environmental change. Through a broad and transparent process, man-agers should set 30-year regional or ecosystem-wide management goals that focus onconserving ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystem-based management frame-works offer an inclusive process to assess ecosystem health and the shared goals among stakeholders, and will typically yield large-scale spatial management plans regulatingvarious types of use (e.g. through zoning, access, protection, quotas, etc.). Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is based on the precautionary principle, which seeks to minimize the risk of damage, in particular when knowledge is scarce or non-ex-istent. The following overview is derived from Policy Proposals and Operational Guid- ance for Ecosystem-Based Management of Marine Capture Fisheries (Ward et al., 2002) and is offered here as a means by which to approach managing the multiplestresses and competing opportunities within arctic ecosystems. The concept of EBM has evolved over the past few decades in response to two charac- teristics of managed natural systems: 1. That exploited natural resources are highly connected to their surrounding ecosys- tems and this connectivity can have major effects on their productivity; and 2. The exploitation of natural resources can have effects on other resources and on other (non-utilized) species as well as aspects of the ecosystems where the resourcesoccur, and these direct and indirect effects can have very major consequences for re-lated or dependent species. These two properties can be summarized as (1) the effect of the environment on the re- source being exploited, and (2) the effect of resource exploitation on the environment.EBM attempt to address both of these environmental and ecosystem interactions. Some approaches to EBM advocate a strictly ecological focus to maintain the capacity of an ecosystem to deliver desired goods and services. Other approaches extend the EBMconcept to include human goals and aspirations for ecosystems. These latter approachesrecognize the highly managed nature of terrestrial systems in particular, and that the no-tion of sustainability is driven by the socio-economic and cultural context within which resource management must reside (Pirot et al., 2000). It is this approach that needs to beapplied to our use of resources and activities in all arctic environments. Despite the diversity of views and experience with EBM in various jurisdictions, reason- able consensus is emerging across a broad range of different resource sectors (forestry,civil society, marine) about basic principles of EBM (Harwell et al., 1996; NOAA, 1999; Pirot et al., 2000; Ward et al., 1997). These principles can be summarized as: 1. Maintaining the natural structure and function of ecosystems, including the biodi- versity and productivity of natural systems and identified important species, is the focus of management. 2. Human use and values of ecosystems are central to establishing objectives for use and management of natural resources. 3. Ecosystems are dynamic; their attributes and boundaries are constantly changing and consequently interactions with human uses also are dynamic. 4. Natural resources are best managed within a management system based on a shared vision and set of objectives developed among stakeholders. 5. Successful management is adaptive and based on scientific knowledge, continual learning and embedded monitoring processes. Integrated approaches propose managing ecosystems on a regional basis and considering all uses in the context of their impacts on biodiversity. These approaches to resource use andbiodiversity conservation entail agreements from all users to reduce activities that may de-grade specific areas or values of conservation importance, but permit activities to occur inareas where they do not threaten regional biodiversity objectives. The regional managementapproach identifies specific uses that are acceptable, and identifies complementary protectedareas to ensure that biodiversity is maintained. Within this context, ecosystem-based man-agement is consistent with building ecosystem resilience to the impacts of climate change. Recommendations Biologically speaking, the term adaptation is used to describe the evolution of organismsor species through time; in this chapter, adaptation is defined as human-driven initiativesto support the natural resilience of arctic ecosystems and reduce their vulnerability to theadverse consequences of climate change. In this sense, adaptations are conscious, planneddecisions by human beings that may result in an autonomous response by ecosystems. The threats to arctic ecosystems are not limited to small areas or single species. In the long term, the resilience of arctic flora, fauna and peoples depends heavily on both glob-al and local actions to preserve the integrity of arctic ecosystems. The only response tothe magnitude and diversity of pressures facing the Arctic is to manage the human ac-tivities that adversely impact biodiversity. STABILIZE LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE The best chance arctic ecosystems have for long-term conservation is to slow, and even-tually stop, anthropogenic climate change. This requires broad scale global action on re-WWF 114BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 115 CHAPTER 4 Arcticducing greenhouse gas emissions. Resource managers have an important role to play here by engaging on climate policy and using examples of change seen in their systemsas indicators of the need for action. The goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to stabilize levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to levels that prevent dangerousanthropogenic interference with the climate system. While mitigation is generally not con-sidered an adaptation option per se,in the long term, this strategy will have the greatest benefit in terms of reducing the vulnerability of arctic ecosystems to climate change, andsupporting the natural adaptive capacity of arctic ecosystems to adjust to a new climate.Since the dominant response of arctic species to climate change is believed to be reloca-tion rather than evolutionary adaptation, immediate action to reduce atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will give arctic ecosystems more time to adapt to a changing climate. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Overall, there will be increased human activity in the Arctic as a result of climatechange, especially as improved sea access will enhance opportunities for expanded fish-eries, new transportation routes, and development of the vast offshore oil and gas re-serves. If managed wisely, the resources can bring long-term wealth and development tothe region. This, however, demands that renewable resources, which can continue tosupport local economies and cultures long after non-renewable resources have been de-pleted, are not sacrificed for short-term economic gains. WWF promotes the Conservation First principle, which was designed to balance nature conservation and industrial development. Conservation First means there should be no newor expanded large-scale industrial development in the Arctic until areas of high conserva-tion value are identified and protected. This will safeguard important cultural and wildlifeareas from industrial development for the long term. It also provides planning certainty andpredictability for communities, investors, developers, government, and other stakeholders. Conservation First is an important part of a broader ecosystem approach to the manage- ment of arctic regions. What is new about Conservation First is its focus on timing: thatarea protection must take place before industrial development begins and forecloses op-tions for proactive conservation. Successful programs will: 1. Operate within a supportive policy framework.2. Recognize economic, social and cultural interests as factors that may affect resource management. 3. Recognize ecological values and incorporate them into management.4. Provide adequate information on exploited species and habitats to ensure that devel- opment is low risk.WWF 116 5. Ensure that the resource management system is comprehensive and inclusive, based on reliable data and knowledge, and that it uses an adaptive approach. 6.Consider environmental externalities within the resource management system (Ward et al., 2002). The Convention on Biological Diversity acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity. It also points out that, in return, conservationwill bring significant environmental, economic and social benefits. Implementing theConservation First principle in the Arctic has three major advantages: FOR COMMUNITIES: It conserves renewable natural resources and ecosystems that have been the basis for human survival in the Arctic for thousands of years and will be thebasis for long-term, sustainable development in the future. FOR CONSERVATION: It secures the survival of key species, ecosystem components, and processes that are important to and representative of the region. Some areas also haveecosystem functions far beyond the region itself, for example as havens for migratoryspecies, ground-water preservation, or moderators for larger-scale climate processes. FOR BUSINESS: The process allows conflicts to be identified and resolved before major investments are made, providing certainty and predictability for investors, developers,governments, conservationists, and other stakeholders. Large-scale exploitation of non-renewable resources, with the accompanying growth of infrastructure and industry, provides local economic and community benefits, but indus-trial development also poses serious threats to the cultural, spiritual, and environmentalheritage of the Arctic. Conservation First ensures that these threats are minimized. Itprovides a way to maintain the integrity of arctic ecosystems as an integral part of plan-ning for development. Conclusion The uncertainties concerning climate change projections are large. They stem from thegaps in knowledge of ocean and atmospheric processes, from our assumptions about thefuture, from the models themselves, and from inherent limitations in our ability to proj-ect the climate. Uncertainties pose a significant challenge to any effort to develop robustmanagement strategies but the lack of complete understanding does not preclude effec-tive ecosystem management. While we know relatively little about the nature of changesto biodiversity, enough is known to justify immediate conservation action (Costanza etal., 1998; Ludwig et al., 1993). Projected climate change will have sweeping impacts on arctic ecosystems and careful management of natural resources will be required to secure healthy ecosystems for thefuture. Management efforts must be based on what is known about ecosystem compo-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 117 CHAPTER 4 Arcticnents and their interrelationships, as well as the likely effects of and on human activities. As our understanding of the changes to biodiversity improves, management responsesmust also adapt. In many cases, adapting to climate change will not involve adopting en-tirely new courses of action; rather, the strengthening and the expansion of existing con-servation practices may be adequate (Burton, 2001). Discussions and development of adaptation responses in the Arctic are currently only in their very early stages. Because of the vulnerability of the region, the expected rate andmagnitude of change, and some of the uncertainties related to what is known aboutecosystems in general and how they will be impacted, there are few concrete manage-ment prescriptions that can be recommended and none that are being tested or imple-mented at the present time. Nevertheless, in order to lay the groundwork for future re-sponses to climate change it is extremely important for resource managers to beginincluding climate considerations in their management plans. Although some important groundwork has been laid, much more work remains in order to ensure the resilience of arctic communities, ecosystems and the traditions of indige-nous peoples. Some guiding principles are as follows: Resource managers should inventory the ecosystems in their regions and the interrela- tionships among them, and then assess the probable impacts that climate change willhave on them, along with specific adaptation options to ameliorate those impacts. Resource managers should only implement adaptation options that are suitable to the local circumstances in their regions, and then monitor their effectiveness inbuilding resilience. Resource managers need to work closely with arctic residents (particularly indige- nous peoples) in adaptation research, planning, decision-making, implementation,and monitoring of arctic habitats. Resource managers need to encourage mechanisms to enhance information flow among researchers and policy-makers on climate change policy and adaptations inpractice. Resource managers need to document the changes that are taking place in the Arctic and communicate these changes broadly as arguments for international action onemissions reductions. To support the work of resource managers, arctic nations need to develop cooperatively a vision that guides the allocation of efforts and resources towards adaptation activities. To provide resource managers with more time to develop strategies to facilitate nat- ural systems' adaptation, arctic nations need to be vigilant to ensure that interna-WWF 118 tional emission reduction targets beyond the Kyoto Protocol are negotiated in order to achieve the stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at levels that pre-vent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. It is important to recognize that adaptation will not be enough to completely protect arc- tic ecosystems from the forces of climate change. If there is to be any chance of con-serving arctic ecosystems in the long term, international efforts toward mitigating thecauses of climate change must be put into place. Effective management of natural re-sources will only buy ecosystems additional time to adjust to a changing climate untilbroad global action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions takes effect.

To cover the details of conservation and climate change ineach habitat type would turn this chapter into a lengthy book. Instead, I will highlightthose aspects of the marine realm in general that set it apart from terrestrial ecosystemsand discuss their implications for both reserve design and responses to climate change.Because of their relative accessibility, coastal habitats have received the most attentionfrom marine conservation biologists and the public alike, and information presented inthis chapter reflects this bias. Still, we should remember that we are only just beginningto understand the rich diversity of life in the deep and open seas, and the ways in whichapparently distinct marine ecosystems interact with each other. While designing conser-vation strategies with only partial information about the ecosystems in questions is dif- ficult, we ignore unfamiliar habitats in our conservation planning at our peril. Temperate seas are rich in life, and have played a central role in human history. Both coastal and open seas are critical sources of food for humans, and traditionally suppliedother resources as well. People turn to oceans and coasts for recreation, employment,and spiritual fulfillment. Population, development, and economic activity are often con-centrated in coastal areas, both providing incentive to keep coasts attractive and healthy,and threatening their health and beauty. Despite this, marine ecosystems and organismsare often poorly understood. The first part of this chapter, then, addresses key differ-ences between marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Although the science of marine reserves is relatively young, reserves have demonstrated success as a conservation tool. The establishment of a reserve will, on average, doublethe density, triple the biomass, and increase the size and diversity of organisms presentby 20-30% (Halpern, 2003). To ensure the long-term success of reserves, we need ad-dress their strengths and weaknesses in responding to climate change, which is now aninevitability. West and Salm (2003) have suggested designing reserves to enhance theability of communities within reserves to be \"resistant and resilient\" in the face of cli-mate change. What aspects of marine ecosystems and reserves will best serve this purpose? What aspects are most vulnerable to climate change? Parts two and three of this chapter examine current and predicted threats to and changes in marine ecosystems,both as a result of climate change and other factors. There are already several excellent guides on marine reserve design (e.g. Kelleher 1999; Salm et al 2000). Parts four and five of this chapter provide a brief review of what'sknown about reserve design and success, discuss it in the context of global climatechange, and suggest approaches to reserve design that might be particularly relevant inthe face of global climate change. The Strategies for implementation section, pg. 163,offers suggestions for reserve planners wishing to incorporate these suggestions intotheir own planning. Finally, the Existing adaption programs section, pg. 164, reviewsexisting approaches to adaptation in temperate marine reserve planning and suggests a few areas where more information would be particularly helpful. Unique Aspects of the Marine Environment/marine Conservation Like terrestrial ecosystems, marine ecosystems are diverse mosaics of interacting phys-ical and biological elements. In many other regards, however, marine ecosystems arequite distinct, and any approach to marine conservation must be based on a solid under-standing of the unique physical, biological, and sociopolitical aspects of the marine en-vironment. Several key differences are reviewed below; further reading on differencesbetween marine and terrestrial habitats and their implications can be found in e.g. Carret al. (2003), Day and Roff (2000), or Strathmann (1990). The overriding point is to re-alize that ecological knowledge gained from terrestrial systems may not be directly ap-plicable to marine systems. PHYSICALDIFFERENCES THREE-DIMENSIONALITY Compared to air, water is relatively dense, viscous, nutrient-rich, and wet. Thus buoyan-cy is relatively easy, desiccation isn't a problem, and there is less need for elaborate sup- port structures. As a result, the marine world is strikingly three-dimensional. While ter-restrial life exists by and large within 100 m of the Earth's surface, marine communitiesexist from the ocean's edges to its abyssal planes thousands of meters below the surface. Many organisms spend all or significant parts of their lives in the water column. Thus, inaddition to covering about 70% of Earth's surface, the oceans make up about 99% ofEarth's biosphere. TEMPERATURE The thermal regimes of intertidal and open ocean habitats are distinct both from eachother and from those in most terrestrial habitats. Intertidal organisms experience ex-tremes of temperature and desiccation, in some cases experiencing temperature swingsof 20 \u00b0C between immersion and emersion. Differences in the timing of low tides (mid-day vs. early morning) can override latitude in determining degree of thermal stress(Helmuth et al., 2002); cyclic changes in the timing of low tides due to lunar oscillationscan have significant effects on intertidal zonation (Denny and Paine, 1998). Some inter-WWF 124tidal organisms are living close to their thermal tolerance limit (e.g. Stillman and Somero, 1996), in which case even small changes in temperature could lead to dramaticchanges in community structure (Bertness et al., 1999). Conversely, because of water'shigh heat capacity, open ocean and subtidal organisms are generally spared any rapidtemperature shifts akin to the day-night or seasonal shifts in terrestrial ecosystems(Harley et al. in press). The buffering capacity of oceans may cause ocean temperaturesto rise more gradually than air temperatures as climate change progresses. PHYSICAL CONNECTIVITY Waves and currents cause nutrients, sediment, and pollution to mix and travel much more freely in the marine environment than in most terrestrial environments. Thus ma-rine communities may depend on nutrients coming from remote sources, and likewisemay be negatively affected by pollutants from distant locales. Nutrient pollution fromthe Mississippi River has rendered thousands of square kilometers of the Gulf of Mexi-co uninhabitable creating an area referred to as \"the dead zone\" (National Science andTechnology Council, 2000). On a more positive note, connectivity means that marine populations are less sensitive to habitat fragmentation than terrestrial systems. ECOLOGICALDIFFERENCES THE BENTHOS AND THE PLANKTON On a very basic level, the marine realm can be divided into two categories: the benthosand the plankton. Benthic organisms are those that live in or on the sea floor. While themost diverse benthic communities are in the photic zone, there is also substantial diver-sity in the deep sea, beyond the reach of sunlight. Vibrant hydrothermal vent communi-ties thrive in an ecosystem based on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis. Theavailability of water-borne food allows marine ecosystems to support an array of filter feeders, animals that take bacteria, algae, other animals, and debris from the water pass-ing overhead (or overfoot, in the case of barnacles). There are no terrestrial equivalentsto filter-feeders (unless one considers spiders). The oceans also contain an ecosystem for which there is no terrestrial equivalent: the pelagic realm. The most obvious inhabitants of the pelagic world are nektonic organism,strong swimmers like whales and fish who can move independently of oceanographiccurrents. Less visible but equally important are planktonic organisms, those with weakor absent motility who exert relatively little control over their large-scale movement. LIFE HISTORIES Most marine animals have complex life histories wherein adult and larval stages arephysically, ecologically, and physiologically distinct. Adults are often relatively sessile,while larvae may travel for tens or thousands of kilometers through the water column.Thus larval supply, dispersal, and recruitment are critical in determining the persistenceof adult populations, or the ability of populations to recover from disturbances. Under-standing these phenomena will also be critical in designing reserves that can succeed inthe long term, particularly as climate change alters current patterns and other elementsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 125 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marineof marine ecosystems that determine where and when larvae recruit to adult popula- tions. Despite their importance, our understanding of many aspects of larval transportand recruitment, particularly as they affect reserves, is still fairly rough. Many modelstreat larval dispersal as a spatially symmetrical process, ignoring the existence of unidi-rectional transport by currents, and model settlement as evenly distributed in space, de-spite the common existence of regions of high and low settlement (Gaines et al., 2003).The concept of source and sink populations suggests that certain populations may de-pend mostly or entirely on larvae supplied by distant populations to persist. Protectionof adult populations and habitat may thus be insufficient for population persistence. In addition to having planktonic larvae, many marine invertebrates release gametes di- rectly into the water column, where sperm may become limiting. Since individuals ofmany sessile or sedentary species cannot or do not move long distances in search ofmates, declining population density may lead to significant decreases in fertilizationsuccess. This phenomenon is suspected to play a role in the decline of at least one com-mercially important species, the white abalone (Hobday et al., 2000). The fecundity of marine animals\u2014producing thousands of eggs per season is quite common\u2014led many to think that marine populations could not be overfished. However,mortality rates for larvae and juveniles are also extremely high, and current rates of pop-ulation decline show that high fecundity is no panacea. POPULATION CONNECTIVITY Because of the abundance of life in the water column and the movement of water overvast distances by currents, marine populations are thought to be much more intercon- nected than terrestrial ones. Numerous studies of population genetics bear this out, atleast for species with planktonic larvae (reviewed in Grosberg and Cunningham, 2001).Adult rafting may add to the connectivity of distant populations. As would be expected,marine species tend to have greater genetic polymorphism and less spatial or geograph-ic structure than terrestrial ones (Carr et al., 2003). This may ignore the existence ofcryptic species, however. The depth of the ocean, the scale of movement of marine organisms, and, for planktonic organisms, their small size makes tracking movement difficult. Thus our knowledge ofthe extent of movement by marine organisms is fairly limited. One approach to determin-ing movement of planktonic organisms is to assume that they track oceanographic cur-rent patterns, and recent models indicate that currents patterns rather than other environ-mental variables may be responsible for some marine biogeographic boundaries (e.g.Gaylord and Gaines, 2000). Nonetheless, it is clear that even weak swimmers are able toaffect their horizontal distribution by altering their vertical position (reviewed in Forwardand Tankersley, 2001; Hill, 1998). This has been particularly well demonstrated for lar-vae of estuarine crab species (e.g. Garrison, 1999), and recent evidence suggests that fish larvae also have mechanisms that allow them to recruit back to natal populations (Warn-er et al., 2000). Analysis of genetic structure can provide some clues as to the extent ofWWF 126BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 127 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marinegenetic intermixing of populations across a wide geographic range, although it doesn't give information about who moves where. More recently, investigators have used chemi-cal signals preserved in calcium carbonate structures (e.g. bones, statoliths) to infer geo-graphic movement of fish and invertebrate larvae (Thorrold et al., 2002). FOOD WEB STRUCTURE AND COMPLEXITY In general, marine food webs are more complex than terrestrial food webs. While ter-restrial ecosystems exhibit relatively little lateral transfer of energy or materials, the di-verse array of planktonic organisms and planktivores in marine systems allows for sig- nificant lateral transfer. Unlike terrestrial carnivores, which actively seek out their prey,many planktivores generally depend on currents to bring their meals to them. In addi-tion, the turnover rate of marine autotrophs is rapid relative to terrestrial ones; phyto-plankton divide approximately daily, depending on location, and the majority ofmacroalgae are annual or short-lived. NATURAL VARIABILITY AND RATE OF RESPONSE TO CHANGE Marine ecosystems, by and large, exhibit a more rapid response to environmental changesin climate than do terrestrial systems, probably because of the relatively short lifespan ofmany key marine organisms (Carr et al., 2003). Such rapid ecosystem changes have beenobserved in response to cyclic environmental shifts such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscilla-tion (e.g. Lubchenco et al., 1993) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Hollowed et al.,2001). Many marine planktonic dispersal, also exhibitlarge interannual variability in population size (Eckert 2003), making it more difficult toidentify long-term trends in response to changes in climate. The rate of response to change, in particular to temperature shifts, may also be related to the relatively large proportion of thermoconformers in marine as compared to terrestrialecosystems. The vast majority of marine animals are cold-blooded; although many havesome techniques for altering their body temperature, they track environmental tempera-tures more closely than warm-blooded animals. SOCIOPOLITICALDIFFERENCES VISIBILITY AND FAMILIARITY Aside from intertidal areas, the marine world is largely invisible to humans, except withrespect to commercial fishery productivity. Also, the structure of marine communities isconceptually foreign to most people. Because there are no terrestrial equivalents tomany marine life histories and community structures, it is difficult for people to appre-ciate what matters. Also, much of the devastation of marine life occurs beyond the reachof the human eye: destructive bottom trawling is invisible to most, but has a profoundeffect not just on the previous communities of those areas of the seabed, but on popula-tions of commercially important species. It is this invisibility that allows people to seedestructive programs like carbon sequestration in the deep sea as relatively benign. Be-cause we have not explored the deep sea in any great detail, there is a false impressionthat it is a barren wasteland.OWNERSHIP AND USE Currently, less than 1% of oceans are included in reserves, compared to approximately 6% of the terrestrial world (Carr et al., 2003). Marine resources in most regions havebeen managed as common-pool resources w here open access is the rule. While somecoastal cultures have ownership rights for marine resources, in the global market theoceans and their resources are by and large expected to be available to anyone. This haslead to a \"tragedy of the commons,\" wherein there is more incentive for over-extractionthan for protection. Unlike terrestrial food industries, in which both plants and animalsare harvested extensively and are mostly domestically raised, marine harvest is primari-ly wild-caught animals. Given the environmental problems associated with marineaquaculture, however, whether or not switching to farmed marine fish would ease thepressure on wild populations is unclear. Perhaps related to this general lack of owner-ship, marine ecosystems are rarely the result of positive human intervention; in otherwords, there are few marine equivalents to setting fires to maintain open grasslands, ir- rigating land to create rice paddies, or the like. While the idea of active intervention toshape terrestrial ecosystems reflects attitudes common in human societies, our approachto marine ecosystems and perhaps conservation as well seems more guided by a desirefor an absence of human activity. Current Stresses on Temperate Marine Ecosystems,Other Than Climate Change Marine ecosystems face myriad stresses, of which climate change is only one. To ade- quately address climate change, we must do so in the context of other known stressors.An adaptation strategy for climate change that increases the risk from other stressorswould serve little use. PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIALFISHERIES OVERHARVEST AND TROPHIC CASCADES It is estimated that 90% of the world's large fish, both open ocean and groundfish species, have been lost; once an industrial fishery opens, it takes only 10-15 years toachieve this level of reduction (Myers and Worm, 2003). Although overexploitation ofmarine stocks is not a new phenomenon, the advent of industrial fishing technology hasallowed unprecedented rates and levels of depletion (reviewed in Pitcher, 2001). It is not simply the loss of fish that matters; the loss of apex predators or keystone species can have profound and long-lasting ecological effects (reviewed in Coleman andWilliams, 2002). A classic example is the overharvest of sea urchin predators (or poten- tially of the predators of urchins'predators) leading to increases in urchin populationsand thus decreases in kelp abundance (Estes and Palmisano 1974). Loss of kelp forestscan lead to declines in many fish species relying on kelp forests as nursery grounds, andto increases in other populations (Lubchenco et al., 1993). The loss of large pelagic fishmay lead to increases in jellyfish(Mills, MANUAL 129 CHAPTER 5 Temperate MarineFISHERIES-ASSOCIATED HABITAT DESTRUCTION Many fisheries use mobile gear that drags along the sea floor, such as trawls and dredges. Such practices lead to long-term decreases in numbers of individuals, speciesdiversity, and biomass, as well as changes in the physical and chemical nature of thehabitat (Veale et al., 2000; Kaiser et al., 2000). Areas that have been subjected to long-standing dredging or trawling tend to be dominated by small-bodied organisms that areless likely to get captured by bottom trawls, although whether overall changes in com-munity structure are due to selective species removal or decreased habitat complexity isunclear (National Research Council, 2002). A different sort of habitat destruction occurs when driftnets are accidentally lost or pur- posefully discarded when they wear out or are damaged. They then drift through theocean, entangling animals from fish to mammals. DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH AQUACULTURE FACILITIES When animals are transported around the globe for aquaculture, unwanted organismsinevitably accompany them (Bower et al., 1994). In addition, aquaculture facilities areoften overcrowded and stressful, providing a perfect incubator for diseases (e.g. Wagneret al., 2002; Avnimelech and Ritvo, 2003). Diseases are transmitted between farmed andwild animals through escapees and outfall. NON-NATIVE SPECIES Most invasions by non-native species occur accidentally as a result of shipping (Ruiz etal., 2000), although even estuaries with no international shipping may have numerousnon-native species (Wasson et al., 2001). Invasions also occur due to purposeful intro-duction of non-natives for aquaculture, primarily fish, bivalves, and crustaceans; thesepurposeful introductions are often accompanied by the accidental introduction of preda-tors, parasites, or other hangers-on accompanying the species of interest. A well-charac-terized example of this is the introduction of several predatory oyster drills along withPacific oyster to the northwest coast of North America. Non-native species have also been introduced by scientific researchers: witness \"Freeman's blight,\" a species of tuni-cate introduced to New England by a visiting researcher at the Marine Biological Labo-ratories, and now a major pest up and down the coast. Private and commercial aquariaare the likely sources of the \"killer alga\" Caulerpa taxifolia in both California and the Mediterranean. C. taxifolia is an aggressive competitor, which outcompetes native sea- grasses and algae, thereby radically altering community structure. In most cases, someeffort is made to contain the non-native species, but rarely are such efforts entirely suc-cessful. Indeed, attempts at biocontrol of both invasive and native pests are yet anothersource of exotic species (reviewed in Secord, 2003). Non-native species can have numerous impacts on their new ecosystems, including alter- ing physical structure, changing decomposition rates, out-competing natives for resourcesor shifting competitive hierarchies, and, of course, eating native species (reviewed inGrosholz, 2002). Invasive snails have been implicated in the decline and local extinction of native mud snails in California as a result of more efficient feeding and production ofoffspring (Byers, 2000), and invasive mussels have changed an unstructured mud flat intoa mussel reef (Crooks, 1998). The latter invasion completely transformed both the physi-cal and bi ological structure, resulting in a community assemblage completely distinct from that in the surrounding unaltered mud flats. Invasive species play key roles instructuring rocky intertidal zonation as well (e.g. Leonard et al., 1999). In addition tospecies- and community-level effects, introduced species can alter trophic transfer with-in entire ecosystems. A non-native clam in San Francisco Bay (perhaps the most invad-ed estuary in the world) is such an efficient filter feeder that it has shut down the usualspring phytoplankton bloom, shifting primary production from planktonic to benthicecosystems (Alpine and Cloern, 1992). For a review of both some effects of and prob-lems associated with assessing the ecological impact of invaders, see Parker et al. (1999)and Grosholz (2002). PHYSICALDISTURBANCE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT Human populations have always been concentrated in coastal areas, and it is no differenttoday. As the human population continues its exponential growth and lifestyles in manycases become increasingly resource-intensive, coastal marine communities around theworld are showing signs of strain. Around 60% of the world's population lives within 100 kilometers of the coast (Vitousek et al., 1997), although this area encompasses only 20% ofEarth's landmass. Thirty percent of all land within 100 kilometers of the coast has been atleast moderately altered by human use (World Resources Institute, 2000). For many impor-tant types of coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass beds, there simply aren't sufficient data toknow the extent of loss, although in some highly developed areas loss approaches 90%(Burke et al., 2001). Destruction of wetlands reduces nursery grounds for commercially im-portant species such as oysters and salmon, decreases filtration of input from terrestrialsources, and increases coastal erosion and flooding. Levees starve beaches and wetlands. TOURISM While people who spend time in particular habitats are more likely to be invested in pre- serving those habitats, even the most environmentally-conscious visitors are not withouteffect. For instance, a coralline alga-dominated intertidal community in New Zealandshowed a 50% decline in meiofaunal biomass after only five days of trampling (Brownand Taylor, 1999). Negative affects of trampling have also been documented on rockyshores in Europe (e.g. Fletcher and Frid, 1996) and North America (e.g. Brosnan andCrumrine, 1994), as well as in salt marshes (Chandrasekara and Frid, 1996), although astudy in South Africa found no long-term effects of trampling (Bally and Griffiths,1989). Although snorkeling and scuba diving are not as common in temperate marinesystems as they are in tropical systems, they do occur, and can cause noticeable effects. Tourism has numerous effects on the physical environment as well. Increased use of a coastal area generally increases nutrient input, particularly when high-level sewageWWF 130BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 131 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marinetreatment is not available. In some cases, beaches are created artificially to encourage tourism, and beachfront areas are altered to become more \"attractive\" to tourists. Sun-screens, bug repellants, and other topically applied chemicals may wash off into the sea-water, accumulating to noticeable levels in highly-used areas. NOISE AND LIGHT POLLUTION Although probably less important than many other anthropogenic influences, both in- creases in noise and light can have negative effects on many marine animals. The pres-ence of strong light from shore has been implicated in the migration of sea turtle hatch-lings away from rather than towards the ocean (Witherington and Martin, 1996), andlight pollution may also cause disturbed vertical or horizontal migration by squid andzooplankters. For whales that depend on sonar for migration and communication, noise pollution, par- ticularly sonar, may cause a number of effects, including death, deafness, stranding, andaltered behavior (National Research Council, 2003). Excess noise may also make it hardfor juvenile fish to find their natal reef (Graydon, 2003). Although the use of sound as alocation cue has not been documented for temperate marine organisms other thancetaceans, it may have an effect. CHEMICALPOLLUTION Ideally, marine reserves can be located so as to reduce the possibility of chemical pollu-tion. If a pollutant is fairly non-dispersive and has a known source, it is possible to de-sign reserves to avoid the source, or to contain the pollutant in case of an unanticipatedspill. In contrast, highly dispersive pollutants are difficult to contain, and pollutantscoming from multiple small or mobile sources are difficult to avoid. OIL SPILLS One of the best-studied oil spills was the 1989 Exxon Valdez Spill in Prince WilliamSound, Alaska, USA. Monitoring of long-term affects of this spill shows not only thatspills have long-lasting effects, but that recovery rates vary tremendously among habi-tats. Although most kelp forest taxa recovered within two years, over 80% of subtidaleelgrass taxa had not recovered even six years after the spill, despite a relatively rapidrecovery of the eelgrass itself (Dean and Jewitt, 2001). Similarly, Driskell et al. (2001)found that even seven years after the spill, rocky intertidal community structure had stillnot returned to normal. Two studies of recovery in soft-sediment communities foundonly incomplete recovery ten years after the spill. Invertebrate taxa also vary strongly in their sensitivity to oil spills. A fine-sand amphipod community took over ten years to recover from the Amoco Cadiz oil spill off the coast ofBrittany, France (Dauvin, 1998), while polychaetes in the same region seemed to be rel-atively unaffected (Gesteira and Dauvin, 2000). Such differential sensitivity would likelylead to shifts in population structure following oil spills, as was indeed seen in waters offCape Cod, Massachusetts, USA following a 1969 oil spill (Sanders, 1977).WWF 132 The decreased mixing of marine waters predicted to accompany global warming in many regions may alter the effects of oil spills, increasing residence time on the surfaceand slowing biological degradation. While higher temperatures, which could increasebiodegradation rates, may counteract this effect, the overall effect of increased tempera-tures on ecological effects of oil spills is unclear. For enzymatic repair processes, in-creased temperature may speed recovery, up to a point (e.g. Hoffman et al., 2003); con-versely, increased temperature may be a stressor, and combine synergistically with other stressors (e.g. coral bleaching, Fitt and Warner, 1995). POINT SOURCE POLLUTION Point source pollution is pollution coming from an identifiable source such as a factoryoutfall or a stream running through a heavily used agricultural area. While point sourcesoften produce large quantities of pollutants, they are relatively easy to pinpoint and inmany countries are regulated at regional or national levels. Traditional point sourceshave been industrial, dumping large quantities of heavy metals and polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (PAHs) into marine waters. More recently, coastal aquaculture facilitieshave become a more wide-spread problem, draining excess antibiotics and fertilizer intonearby waters. Another fairly recent type of point-source pollution is desalinationplants. As fresh water becomes an increasingly valuable commodity, it is likely thatmore and more desalination plants will be built to serve the needs of coastal cities. Theenvironmental effects of the hypersaline outflow from such facilities are as yet poorlyunderstood. NON-POINT SOURCE POLLUTION In heavily populated areas, non-point sources can be as or more important than pointsources in polluting marine ecosystems. Antifouling paint and oil and gas leaks fromprivate boats can be problematic, as can the combined pesticides and fertilizers used byindividuals on their lawns and gardens. Reducing non-point source pollution is difficult,and requires a concerted community education effort, as well as regulations governingthe sale and use of toxic chemicals. NUTRIENT POLLUTION Excess nutrients entering the water due to fertilizer runoff, untreated human and animalwaste, or sewage outfalls leads to eutrophication, oxygen depletion and the creation of \"dead zones\" as has been documented in a number of locations worldwide. The Gulf ofMexico is perhaps the most famous, with fertilizer from the Mississippi Basin leading tothe annual formation of an anoxic area encompassing thousands of square kilometers(Malakoff, 1998). Nutrient over-enrichment can also cause harmful algal blooms, whichinjure or kill marine animals including fish, birds, and mammals (Conley et al., 2002;Anderson, 1997). Increased water temperatures and the resultant stratification that mayaccompany climate change make the occurrence of anoxic zones more likely, and mayworsen existing zones. Ironically, it has also been suggested that increases in nutrients from agricultural runoff and sewage have allowed the recovery of fisheries that had beenBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 133 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marinestarved of nutrients. This has been studied off the coast of Egypt, where the Aswan Dam virtually stopped the input of terrestrial nutrients from the Nile (Nixon, 2003). SEDIMENTATION Both increases and decreases in terrestrial sediment input have been documented asproblems in marine ecosystems. The construction of bulkheads and seawalls actually in-creases shoreline erosion and results in \"starved\" beaches, where a decline in theamount of incoming sediment causes an increase in substrate coarseness as well as in-creasing erosion rates. Damming major rivers also radically reduces sediment as well aswater input into coastal areas. Conversely, poor land use practices and the clearing of soil-stabilizing vegetation in river catchments have lead to increases in sedimentation inother areas. Increased sedimentation can be particularly problematic for seagrass beds. THERMALPOLLUTION The use of seawater to cool power plants may cause significant alterations in local ther-mal regimes. In Florida (USA), some manatees now congregate around thermal effluentrather than natural heat sources such as thermal vents and artesian springs (Packard etal., 1989). Warm water outflow has also caused alteration in benthic communities inCalifornia (USA) near the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant (Tissot et al., 1991).These later studies are particularly interesting in that community-level changes did notreflect predictions based on individual-level thermal sensitivities. Observed and Predicted Effects of Climate Change on Temperate Marine Ecosystems The all-pervasive nature of climate change\u2014its effects are likely to be felt globally and throughout the depths of the ocean\u2014demands that its effects be considered in reservedesign and planning. Changes in climate are not a new phenomenon. Paleoecologicalrecords provide insight into effects of past cycles of global warming and cooling, andcyclical changes in climate regime in certain regions have allowed us to look at short- term (year-long to decades-long) changes in ecosystems. This information, combinedwith experimental work on individual organisms and communities and mathematicalmodels, provides the basis for most predictions about future effects of global climatechange. In making such extrapolations, however, there are several caveats. The causes ofglobal climate change are not the same as the causes of regional regime shifts, and weshould not assume that the effects will be the same either. Also, small-scale experimentsor observations don't capture the complex interactions characteristics of marine ecosys-tems. Trophic cascades such as those described by Estes and Palmisano (1974) are oneexample of unanticipated chains of events; there are likely many other such unrecog- nized connections that will determine the ultimate effects of climate change. PHYSICALCHANGES Seascapes generally classified based on factors such as temperature regime, hours ofsunlight, extent of ice cover, etc. While some of these factors (hours of sunlight) will notbe significantly affected by climate change, others will, creating new combination of physical variables and thus new seascapes. TEMPERATURE CHANGES While the global mean temperature will rise as a result of climate change, it is possiblethat in certain areas, average sea temperature may drop as a result of changing currentand upwelling regimes. Also, it is unclear for many organisms what aspects of tempera-ture change matter most: maximum, minimum, or mean temperature, or rate of changeand thermal history, measured daily, seasonally, or annually. RISING SEA LEVEL As global temperatures increase, sea level is expected to rise both as a result of thermalexpansion of sea water, and as a result of melting glaciers and ice caps. In some areas, temperature-related sea level increase is exacerbated by decreased rates of soil-buildingin wetlands due to decreased sediment input either because of drought or shoreline mod-ification. Some salt marshes won't be able to keep up with sea level rise (Moorhead &Brinson 1995). Even if they can, landward shoreline armoring may interrupt their natu-ral advance upshore. Some coastal areas are sinking because of decreases in sedimentinput without any reduction in erosion. Areas such as the Rh\u00f4ne, Po, and Ebro deltas inthe Mediterranean that are subsiding are further threatened by sediment starvation. Changes in sea level may also affect the type of coastal system present in any given re- gion. Recent research suggests that sea level rise over the 18,500 years has changed theSouthern California Bight from a productive, diverse rocky coastline to a less produc-tive, less diverse sandy coastline (Graham et al., 2003). Changes in sea level have also been implicated in paleontological patterns of diversifi- cation and extinction in a number of marine taxa (e.g. House, 1989). In general, shallowseas are the most productive marine areas; increasing sea level increases the extent ofshallow seas, and may increase overall marine productivity. Falling sea level, which re-duces the area available for shallow-seas organisms, is associated with several mass ex-tinction events. INCREASING ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION In marine organisms, UV causes death and deformity, alters behavior, sex ratio, and de-velopment, and can change community composition (reviewed in Hansen and Hoffman, 2001; H\u00e4der et al., 1998). Despite the common misconception that ultraviolet (UV) doesnot penetrate deeply enough into marine waters to play a significant role in marineecosystems, both UVA and UVB cause measurable effects to down to several metersdepth (e.g. Karentz and Lutze, 1990). In the clearest tropical waters, levels of UVA de-tectable by deep-sea shrimp can penetrate to 500-600 m (Frank and Widder, 1996). UV levels in marine ecosystems are changing due to stratospheric ozone depletion, al- terations in solar luminosity, and changes in water clarity due to a number of influences.WWF 134There is still only a rudimentary understanding of how elements of global change such as altered precipitation will affect UV levels in marine ecosystems, although thechanges in sedimentation rates and primary productivity discussed above will certainlyinfluence the depth to which UV penetrates. While progress is being made in reducingthe production of ozone-depleting chemicals, the same cannot be said for other factorsinfluencing UV levels in marine environments. Additionally, changes in vertical watercirculation will affect the length of time planktonic organisms spend in the high-UV sur-face waters. ALTERED NUMBERS/INTENSITY OF STORM EVENTS Although increased severity and frequency of storm events has been predicted to result from global climate change (Houghton et al., 2001), data at this point are inconclusive.Wave heights have increased globally over the past 30 years , and higher sea levels will increase the height of storm waves and surges, increasing the frequency of extremeevents. Storms may also have increased precipitation intensity; this would increase both erosion and salinity stress for coastal marine ecosystems. Interannual climate fluctuations such as the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, which strongly influence number and intensity ofstorms, may themselves be affected by global climate change (Timmermann et al.,1999). Although it is clear that such periodic climate oscillations have varied in fre-quency and intensity in the past, the causes of such variation is uncertain (Tudhope etal., 2001; Urban et al., 2000) WATER CHEMISTRY The decreased freshwater input and increased evaporation expected to accompany global warming trends may lead to increased salinity in small or shallow semi-enclosed bodies of water such as tide-pools and estuaries. The implications of such changes are unclear,as many tide-pool and estuarine organisms are adapted to alterations in salinity. This doesnot mean, however, that they will be able to compensate for any future changes. Increased CO 2concentrations may lead to a gradual decrease in the ocean's pH and cal- cium carbonate concentration. Studies have shown that calcification rates of many ma-rine organisms, including corals, coralline algae, and coccolithophorids, are decreasedby increases in CO 2(reviewed in Gattuso and Buddemeier, 2000). Additionally, there will likely be alterations in seasonal levels of freshwater input: more rain rather than snow in winter may lead to more runoff in winter and less in summer.For animals such as herring that respond to drops in salinity as a spawning cue, altered timing and amount of freshwater influx could have profound effects. UPWELLING AND CURRENTS Numerous changes in water movement are expected to occur as a result of increasedtemperature. These include increased stratification and stability of the water column dueBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 135 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marineto surface water warming, and consequently reduced upwelling, both near-shore and open-ocean (summarized in Soto, 2002; Field et al., 2001). Decreased upwelling in turndecreases nutrient input to surface waters, leading to a decline in primary productivity.Effects of decreased phytoplankton reverberate through the food web, leading to reduc-tion in density of zooplankton and likely secondary consumers as well. Such changeshave been documented off the coast of Southern California following an abrupt and sus-tained increase in water temperature in the 1970s (reviewed in Field et al., 1999). Conversely, climate change may alter wind patterns in ways that increase offshore winds and thus upwelling (Bakun, 1990). Accurately predicting local changes in up-welling regimes, then, requires understanding the relative strength of changes in off-shore winds vs. surface warming. There may also be altered current regimes, such as reduction in area and a coastward mi- gration of shelf-tidal fronts, a reduction in strength of the Gulf Stream, and an increasein strength of the Labrador Current (Soto, 2002). Such large-scale changes in currentswould result in changes in larval transport, affecting both how many larvae recruit to adult populations, and where the larvae end up. ALTERED RATES OF SEDIMENT INPUT Changes in amount and timing of rainfall will affect input of sediment as well as of freshwater. Winter rainstorms have the potential to wash greater amounts of sediment into rivers, since in many regions there is less vegetation to hold soil in place in winter than insummer. Increases in sedimentation will also occur in regions experiencing decreasing seaice cover, as land is exposed to the erosional forces of waves for longer parts of the year. On the other hand, sediment input may decrease for a number of reasons. Increasing coastal development is leading to increasing hardening of coastlines. Seawalls, bulk-heads, and riprap all decrease the amount of sediment reaching adjacent coastal areas,resulting in sediment-starved beaches. Reduced sediment input resulting from thedamming of rivers will be exacerbated by the drier conditions expected in much of theworld. Changes in grain size and character of sediment-starved beaches can lead to dra- matic changes in community composition and structure. Climate change may increase the problem of human alteration of shorelines. Coastal home- owners wary of increased numbers or intensity of storms and rising sea level may build more and bigger bulkheads, further starving shorelines in developed areas. This negativefeedback cycle can already be seen in highly erosional coastlines like the Wadden Sea. BIOLOGICALCHANGES EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUALS Temperature can affect individual organisms both behaviorally and physiologically, with effects ranging from mild to lethal. Not surprising, then, is the range of adaptationsand sensitivities organisms display to both absolute temperature and to changes in tem-WWF 136perature (Hochachka and Somero, 2002). Animal species inhabiting the high intertidal, for instance, can generally survive significantly higher temperatures than their low in-tertidal congeners, and susceptibility to thermal stress can occur on multiple levels (re-viewed in Somero, 2002). Temperature also affects growth rate and development, potentially affecting generation times or juvenile size. In over 90% of aquatic ectotherms studied, increased rearingtemperature resulted in decreased organismal size (Atkinson, 1995). While average in-dividual size does decrease with latitude in many invertebrate species, it is unclearwhether changes in ocean temperature directly affect individual size. POPULATION-LEVEL EFFECTS For many species, temperature serves as a cue for reproduction (Olive, 1995). If species synchronize their reproduction with such environmental factors as food availabilityusing cues sensitive to global climate change, such as temperature, climate change maydisrupt this synchrony and thus alter developmental success (Olive, 1995). Bhaud et al.(1995) describe the disruptive effects of even short-term temperature fluctuations on thereproduction of some marine polychaetes. Temperature can also affect reproduction by altering sex ratios. Temperature-dependent determination of sex occurs in all sea turtles (Davenport, 1997) as well as some cope-pods (Voordouw and Anholt, 2002) and fish (Pavlidis et al., 2000; Goto et al., 1999;Conover, 1984). Changing climate cycles will potentially skew sex ratios to the extentthat population growth is threatened. EFFECTS ON COMMUNITIES Within any community, it is likely that different members of the community will respond dif- ferently to various elements of global climate change depending on their sensitivity to andtolerance for various aspects of environmental change. Changes in temperature, sedimenta-tion rate, ultraviolet radiation, and disturbance regime can shift competitive interactions, fa-voring some species over others. Species with high genetic diversity and short generation times may be able to undergo evolutionary adaptation, while genetically depauperate speciesare less likely to do so. Mobile species may track preferred temperatures, while less mobilespecies must either adapt or disappear locally. For instance, northward range expansions fol-lowing warming trends have been documented for sardine populations off the coast of Cali-fornia (Lluch-Belda et al., 1992). On a rocky shoreline in central California, where annualmean ocean temperature has increased 1 \u00b0C over the past 60 years, researchers have docu-mented an increase in southern animal species and a decrease in northern animal species(Sagarin et al., 1999). Likewise, a study of kelp forest fish in Southern California found thatsince the 1970s there had been a 50% drop in cold-water, northern species, and a 150% in-crease in warm-water, southern species (Holbrook et al., 1997). Predicting changes in communities in response to climate change may not be as simple as understanding species thermal biology, however. Fox and Morin (2001), for instance,BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 137 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marinefound protist populations with density-dependent regulation were relatively im- mune to effects of temperature change, while Davis et al. (1998) found that interspecif-ic interactions made effects of temperature changes difficult to predict for three speciesof fruit fly. For intertidal barnacles, interspecific interactions shifted from competitive tofacilitative as environmental conditions became harsher (Bertness et al., 1999). Global warming could also alter the strength of interaction between keystone predators and their prey, potentially causing strong shifts in intertidal communities by affectingfeeding by a keystone species (Sanford, 1999). On the coast of Oregon, decreasing tem-perature slowed the feeding of two key rocky intertidal predators by around 30% (San-ford, 2002). Thus the timing and number of upwelling events determined the reproduc-tive output of some intertidal prey species. BIOGEOGRAPHIC EFFECTS The role of temperature and desiccation in determining zonation patterns in rocky inter-tidal habitats is well established. In general, biotic interactions such as competition andpredation set a species' lower boundary, and physical stress sets the upper boundary.Species thus exist at tidal heights where predators are scarce or absent, but abiotic con-ditions fall within survivable ranges. A study in Washington State found that intertidalbands of mussels and barnacles were broader on exposed than sheltered coastlines; inless wave-exposed locations, temperature stress lowered the upper limit for thesespecies, but predation by a sea star, which sets their lower limit, remained unchanged(C. Harley, pers. comm.). If climate change lowers the upper limit of barnacles and mus-sels in all locations, it will likely lead to an overall decrease in the populations of theseanimals, since expanding downward will not be an option where predatory sea stars arepresent. A similar interaction between thermal stress and predation was found to ex-clude one species of alga from south-facing slopes, where high temperatures duringemersion pushed their upper limit down into the zone of high predation (Harley, 2003).The lesson for climate change is that this alga may go locally extinct because its upperlimit will shift down while its lower limit remains stationary. On a larger scale, species ranges may shift poleward in response to global warming. Such a shift may be dictated by a species'need to stay within a particular water temper-ature range, or, in the case of intertidal organisms, to stay within an acceptable range ofair temperatures (Lubchenco et al., 1993). Such range shifts appear to be occurring insome marine environments (Sagarin et al., 1999). NON-NATIVE SPECIES Climate change is likely to affect the relative success of biological invaders. Stachowiczet al. (2002), for instance, found that warmer temperatures favored non-native over nativeascidians. In some cases, marine animals have been imported to new environments withthe understanding that colder temperatures in the new location would limit the exotic'sability to reproduce (e.g. Pacific oysters). As temperatures increase and limits to repro-duction decline, such species will spread more readily throughout their new home. Alter-WWF 138ations in currents may bring larvae from populations of introduced species to new loca- tions, and disruption of native, natural ecosystems by climate change may render themmore vulnerable to successful invasion by non-natives. If stocks of native marine organ-isms become too unstable or depleted, there may be an increase in aquaculture of non-na-tives species, and a consequent increased risk of invasion/dominance by these species. DISEASES Climate change has been linked with increases in marine disease outbreaks (Harvell etal., 1999; Hofmann et al., 1999) and range extensions in marine parasites (Ford, 1996).Warming trends associated with ENSO cycles correlate with shellfish diseases on the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts (McLean and Tsyban, 2001). Increased outbreaks may bedue to increased pathogen transmission or decreased host resistance. Decreased resist-ance may result from behavioral or physiological changes in marine populations, andmay also be affected by interactive effects with pollutants. Many new diseases arecaused by host shifts rather than the appearance of previously unknown organisms(Harvell et al., 1999); as mentioned previously, increased in aquaculture may also in-crease the global transmission of diseases. Indeed, transfer of infected stocks may havebeen responsible for some of the most devastating disease outbreaks in farmed bivalves(discussed in Harvell et al., 1999) Considerations and Suggestions for Marine Reserve Design With a Focus on Possible Adaptation Options A number of criteria have been proposed for evaluating potential marine reserve sites, including ecological, social, and economic considerations (see Roberts et al., 2003 forecological criteria, and refs therein for other approaches). Although it is clear that thebiophysical characteristics of temperate marine ecosystems will change, uncertaintyabout the nature and rate of change is compounded by our lack of knowledge about howcomplex ecological interactions will respond to change. The UNFCCC suggests thepossibility of natural ecosystem adaptation to climate change, if we limit the rate ofchange sufficiently. Also key to successful adaptation is looking at interactions betweenclimate change and other anthropogenic stressors on marine systems: which factors willbe exacerbated by climate change and which will be ameliorated? SPATIALCONSIDERATIONS CREATE NETWORKS OF RESERVES It has been suggested that fewer large reserve might be better for protecting biodiversitywhile numerous smaller reserves might be more effective for fisheries enhancement;given the range of dispersal distances of marine larvae, however, many biologists nowbelieve that networks of marine reserves will be more effective than single large re-serves (e.g. Hastings and Botsford, 2003). Networks allow a greater diversity of habitatsto be covered over a greater geographical range for the same amount of total area pro-tected. Increasing the geographical range included in a network will become increasing-ly important if the anticipated latitudinal species migrations occur in response to climatechange. Although there are few empirical data on size and spacing of reserves withinBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 139 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marinenetworks, these issues have been the focus of recent theoretical work. Based on a review of published dispersal distances, Shanks et al. (2003) suggested that reserves of 4-6 km2would be sufficient to retain short-distance dispersers. Roberts et al. (2001) noted that even reserves as small as 5 km 2have been shown to be effective in increasing densities of commercially valuable species. Spacing between reserves and location of reserveswithin the network area is less clear. Long-distance dispersers may travel between 20and 4400 km, and remain in the plankton for almost 300 days (Shanks et al., 2003).Their exact route is unknown. As discussed previously, the common assumption hasbeen that planktonic marine larvae by and large follow ocean currents, but at least somelarvae have behavioral mechanisms to aid in local retention. DESIGN RESERVES TO PROVIDE TEMPERATURE REFUGIA One \"natural adaptation\" to climate change is for species ranges to shift to higher latitudes.Such latitudinal changes have been demonstrated for numerous terrestrial species (Parme-san and Yohe, 2003), and for marine species on the west coast of North America during arecent warming trend there (reviewed in Field et al., 1999). To the extent that this migra-tion allows the preservation of species that would otherwise go extinct, marine reservesshould attempt to provide robust corridors for such poleward movement. Designing latitu-dinally extensive networks serves this purpose. Many species may not be able to migratefast enough to keep pace with climate change, however (Malcolm and Markham, 2000). It may also be possible for some populations to shift their habitat into deeper, cooler water as global warming progresses. As mentioned previously, however, downward range expansions may be prohibited for some species by the presence of competitivedominants or predators, and photosynthetic organisms are limited by the depth of thephotic zone. Also, in a study of rocky intertidal community response to warming,Sagarin et al. (1999) found no overall downward shift in tidal range, although there wasevidence of a latitudinal shift. While shifting habitats to greater depth and higher latitudes is one way of finding cool- er temperatures, most regions have identifiable \"hot spots\" and \"cold spots\" (see, e.g.,Helmuth et al. 2002) due to factors such as upwelling, shade, subhabitats, timing oftides, and freshwater input. Designing reserves to include \"cold spots\" may reduce ther-mal stress from climate change. Areas with a high degree of vertical mixing or rapidwater movement, for instance, have lower average temperatures than stratified areas. Such areas may also be higher in nutrients and thus provide a more stable food supplyfor zooplankton and planktivores. Areas of shoreline with ample shading and cooler mi-crohabitats (cracks, crevices, etc.) can also provide temperature refugia and increasesurvivorship (Moran and Emlet, 2001). ESTABLISH RESERVES IN TRANSITIONAL ZONES BETWEEN BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AS WELL AS IN CORE AREAS Species are often assumed to be more successful and stable in the core region of their ge- ographic distribution, and conditions are assumed to become increasingly stressful to-WWF 140BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 141 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marinewards the edges of the species'range. Thus, in the absence of climate change, it has been assumed that to preserve a species, it may be preferable to locate reserves away fromrange edges. As climate changes, however, the \"best\" area for a species may shift awayfrom what had been the core of its range. Thus creating reserves throughout a species'range, or at least including locations near its poleward boundaries, is a safer approach. Additionally, this \"abundant center\" concept of species distribution has recently been challenged. In nine of 12 temperate marine invertebrate species studied by Sagarin andGaines (2002), areas of peak density occurred in sites near the edges of the species'range as well as in the center. These findings underline the importance of designing spa-tially heterogeneous networks of reserves. ADD AN \"INSURANCE FACTOR\"TO RESERVE SIZE CALCULATIONS To buffer against periodic severe disturbances such as hurricanes or oil spills, re- searchers have suggested adding an \"insurance factor\" when calculating the necessarysize of a reserve (Allison et al., 2003). The insurance factor is simply extra area added tothe reserve, and should assure that a reserve's function goals are met despite catastro-phes. The amount of extra area needed as insurance can be calculated based on the an-ticipated frequency of and vulnerability to disturbances in the region covered by the re-serve or reserve network. Such an approach could also be effective in buffering againstpossible effects of climate change, and would work well in conjunction with other bet-hedging approaches. This approach may be ineffective in protecting many spatially re-stricted habitats and ecosystems, however. INCLUDE A DIVERSITY OF HABITATS AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS Traditional reserve planning has been focused on single-species conservation, and as such has focused on the selection of critical habitat areas for the species of interest. Whilesuch considerations should continue to be included in planning, particularly for reserveswhose aim is increased yield of commercially valuable species, there is a growing recog-nition that to be successful in the long term, reserves must be designed more broadly.Rare or vulnerable habitats should be included in reserves even if they have no knownconnection to species of interest; such habitats may play ecological roles we are unawareof, and would be hard to restore/replace. Also, such habitats contribute to the overallhabitat heterogeneity, another key element of reserve design. Habitat heterogeneity, orthe presence of multiple habitat types, has at least two potential benefits. First, habitat di-versity generally corresponds with overall biodiversity, since a heterogeneous habitat provides more microhabitats and opportunities for specialization. Second, preservingmultiple habitat types within a reserve or a network of reserves may benefit species thatlive in different habitats during different stages of their life. From the climate change per-spective, protecting multiple habitat types increases the odds that at least some of the pro-tected habitats will be resistant or resilient to the effects of climate change. Including a diversity of habitats in marine reserve networks is also important for species that use different habitats at different times of year or during different life stages. WWF 142 On a somewhat larger scale, reserve design should also maximize biogeographic repre- sentation. Although there is as yet no universally accepted set of biogeographic classifi-cations for marine ecosystems, several such classifications have been proposed. Roff etal. (2003) present a table of possible factors to consider in designating marine biogeo-graphic regions, and discuss local variation in the relative importance of these factors. DESIGN RESERVES BASED ON FEATURES OF THE ENVIRONMENT UNLIKELY TO CHANGE While which organisms will inhabit any stretch of shoreline decades in the future may beunpredictable, there are some elements of existing ecosystems whose persistence is morelikely. Day and Roff (2000) termed these \"enduring and recurrent features.\" Physio-graphic features such as topography will persist regardless of climate change, and can in-fluence the biological communities that develop in any given area. Areas of high relief,for instance, are usually associated with greater species diversity and richness than areasof low relief. This may be in part because high relief provides a greater diversity of habi-tat, and in part because high relief also creates upwelling, which increases the supply ofnutrients and oxygen, and thus productivity. Currents, waves and mixing related to fetchand tidal forces are also unlikely to change; as mentioned above, areas with strong cur-rents and stronger wave action may experience less warming than calmer waters. Certain oceanographic features are also enduring or recurrent. Convergence and diver- gence zones occurring in the open ocean, for instance, have fairly predictable locationsin temperate waters of the southern hemisphere, although their location is not pre-dictable in northern temperate waters. Oceanographic features may be more affected byclimate change than physiographic features, however. For instance, upwelling is a fairlyregular occurrence on the Pacific coast of the Americas, but increased frequency orstrength of ENSOs might decrease the amount of upwelling significantly. The potentialdecrease of climate-driven upwelling underscores the importance of including topogra-phy-driven upwelling zones in reserves. Local topography and current patterns may alsodetermine areas of higher or lower larval settlement (Shanks and Wright, 1987). DESIGN RESERVES AROUND AREAS THAT SHOW RESISTANCE AND RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE Researchers and planners concerned with coral reef conservation have begun to identify locations that are resistant to bleaching, and factors that allow for more rapid recoveryfrom bleaching (resilience) (West and Salm, 2003). If temperate events equivalent tobleaching in terms of sensitivity to climate change can be identified, they may assist indeveloping a similar approach for temperate marine ecosystems. For instance, if particu-lar species are found to be most sensitive to the effects of climate change, areas wherethose species continue to thrive may be areas with natural resistance to climate change,either because of cooler conditions or some other combination of factors. Similarly, habi-tats or locations that recover quickly from more short-term changes in climate such as thePacific Decadal Oscillation may be best able to cope with longer-term climate change. By identifying local areas with increased resistance or resilience, reserve planners canenhance the capacity of particular communities to persist (West and Salm, 2003).SOCIOPOLITICALCONSIDERATIONS USE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES Because we have relatively little hard data on how well marine reserves work, and be- cause the factors influencing reserve success may change over time, many scientists andpractitioners are recommending the use of adaptive management strategies (e.g. Salaf-sky et al., 2002; Botsford et al., 2003; Parma et al., 1998). This approach requires prac-titioners to monitor the success of reserves and the on-going effects of design and man-agement choices, and to adjust management practices in response to this information.This will allow the evolution of the most appropriate management practices for each re-serve or network of reserves, and begin to provide much-needed information to aide inthe design of future reserves. Such an adaptive, iterative approach is particularly impor-tant in creating reserves that will be most robust or resilient relative to climate change:there is so much uncertainty in our knowledge of the physical and ecological effects ofclimate change that future flexibility is essential. Adaptive management is also important, as it allows reserve managers to respond to changes not only in the ecology of reserves, but in the sociopolitical context of reserves.It is likely that climate change will affect the relationship of local communities to themarine environment; such changes could significantly affect the effectiveness of re-serves. For instance, the size needed for reserve effectiveness depends on fishing pres-sure outside the reserve; if climate change alters fishing pressure, the effectiveness ofthe reserve would likewise change. ESTABLISH A TEMPORALLY RESPONSIVE APPROACH THAT ALLOWS YOU TO TRACK COMMUNITIES/SPECIES OF INTEREST AS CLIMATE CHANGES Setting up a successful reserve in the first place is challenging; the idea of adjusting the boundaries of and restrictions in reserves over time may seem like it simply prolongs thestruggle. However, the potential usefulness of such temporally-responsive reserve man-agement is such that the idea is worth at least considering. In conversations with stake-holders and other planners, bring up the idea that to fulfill the management goals identi-fied by the group, reserve boundaries may have to change in the future, just as many ranchers rotate their animals among different fields. If members of the community un-derstand the importance and potential benefits of reserves they may be willing to dowhat it takes to ensure reserve success in the long term. Also, the periodic reassessmentsof reserve locations and activities required by this approach provide an opportunity toreengage community members and strengthen their commitment to the reserve. INVOLVE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE BEGINNING While most discussions of reserve design focus on where to site reserves and what ac-tivities to allow, there is increasing awareness that committed and invested communitystakeholders can be as essential to the long-term success of a reserve as appropriate se-lection of location and ecological characteristics (Salm and Clark, 2000; Kelleher,1999). Given the degree of uncertainty involved in planning reserves in the face of cli-mate change, the commitment of local communities to the ongoing success and effectiveBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 143 CHAPTER 5 Temperate MarineWWF 144 management of reserves gains even greater importance. If people living and working near reserves feel responsible for the reserve, they are less likely to engage in destructiveactivities, more likely to police themselves and other community members, and morelikely to support changes in reserve location or restrictions as necessitated by climatechange or other factors. To maximize community investment in a reserve, community involvement and empow- erment must be part of even early planning. If people feel that they have been excludedat any stage of planning, reserve managers may start to look like adversaries rather thancolleagues. Also important is taking the time to understand how local communities re-late to marine resources, which community members use or control various aspects ofthe marine environment. This requires sensitivity to both culture and gender issues. IDENTIFY CLEAR GOALS AND CRITERIA FOR MEASURING SUCCESS In the past, reserve and conservation efforts have often focused on \"species of interest,\"either culturally or commercially important or endangered species. It has been suggest-ed (e.g. Simberloff, 1997; Franklin, 1993) that a single-species focus leads to a myopicapproach in which overall ecosystem stability and function may be sacrificed; addition-ally, cryptic or unknown species will remain unprotected. An ecosystem approach, incontrast, may be more likely to support the species of interest. LIFE HISTORY CONSIDERATIONS Because marine populations are much more open than terrestrial ones, and marine or-ganisms often have complex life cycles with two or more ecologically distinct life histo-ry phases, the appropriate size and location of reserves is tricky to determine. The de-gree of larval and juvenile dispersal can radically affect both the ideal size of a reserveand its ability to fulfill different goals (i.e. preserving biodiversity vs. enhancing fish-eries; Botsford et al., 2003), and adult, larval, and juvenile stages must be considered forreserves to succeed. For species with distinct feeding and spawning grounds, both typesof habitat must be preserved. Unfortunately, the full life history is understood for rela-tively few species, and may be quite different even for closely related species (Granthamet al., 2003; Strathmann, 1987). While larvae of some species recruit locally, in othercases adult populations may depend largely on larvae arriving from upcurrent locations.A decline in a particular adult population may reflect local problems for those adults,problems in the larval habitat, or problems with an upcurrent adult population that is asignificant source of recruits. Because knowledge of larval dispersal is spotty but dispersal distance seems critical to reserve sustainability (Botsford et al., 2003), the best approach may be to design reservenetworks using a \"bet-hedging\" strategy. As mentioned earlier, Shanks et al. (2003) sug-gest making reserves large enough to sustain locally-recruiting populations (4-6 km indiameter), and spacing reserves such that larvae with longer dispersal distances can re-cruit to adjacent reserves (10-20 km spacing). Reserve placement also needs to reflectBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 145 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marineboth major ocean currents and smaller currents and eddies, since the extent to which larger- and smaller-scale currents matter for larval dispersal and recruitment is unclear.Different habitats seem to have different frequencies of dispersing vs. non-dispersinglarvae; a recent study on the west coast of the United States found that over 60% ofsandy intertidal species had non-planktonic larvae, as compared to less than 22% ofspecies in rocky intertidal and sandy subtidal habitats (Grantham et al., 2003). Despite the ability of planktonic larvae to travel hundreds of kilometers, it appears that larvae of at least some species have mechanisms to enhance larval retention. These mayreflect a complex balance of larval behavior, currents, salinity, and even sound. By as-sessing the existence of such mechanisms for populations of interest, reserves can be de-signed to give the best chance of larval retention. For instance, some larval fish usesound to locate appropriate adult habitats (Leis and Carson-Ewart, 2003, and refs there-in). In this case, restricting use of motorized craft or other sources of extraneous noisemight help increase or maintain larval recruitment. In designing reserves to benefit particular species, it is essential to first identify the most vulnerable life stages of that species. Often the stage that is most visible, well under-stood, or accessible receives the most attention, with no consideration of which lifestage is most in need of protection, or whose protection would do the most to boost adultpopulations. CONTROLLING NON-CLIMATOLOGICALSTRESSES Coastal ecosystems are intricately linked with the land they adjoin. Reserves should belocated away from major sources of terrestrial pollution such as agricultural runoff,sewage outfall, or industrial outfall. While point sources of pollution are relatively easyto identify, non-point sources may be harder to avoid. In general, locating reserves awayfrom heavily populated areas or areas that receive a lot of human use will help to reducethe negative impacts of non-point pollution. Locating reserves away from human useareas also reduces the risk of coastline alterations leading to sediment starvation ofbeaches, or conversely excessive sediment input due to poor land use practices and ero-sion. Ideally, marine reserves can be linked with terrestrial reserves, so that the majorsources of terrestrial input (sediment, nutrients, fresh water) are preserved along withthe marine ecosystem they serve. Limiting anthropogenic stresses in marine reserves becomes even more critical when considering mitigation of climate change effects. Anthropogenic stressors can act syner-gistically with increasing temperature and other elements of climate change; minimiz-ing non-climate stressors thus mitigates the negative effects of climate change as well.For instance, the recent increase in number and extent of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is thought to result from both warming and increased nutrient pollution (Mudie et al.,2002). Limiting excess nutrient input in areas near reserves would decrease the likeli-hood of devastating HABs affecting the reserve.WWF 146 Identifying and Selecting Strategies for Your Particular Location Given the variability of biophysical and social systems in and affecting marine ecosys- tems, there can be no single \"right\" way to create a reserve. Each reserve must be de-signed to best meet the needs and attitudes of local ecosystems and inhabitants. WWFhas identified this location-based approach as a key to reserve success, along with theexistence of stakeholder involvement, community enforcement, a clear management plan, legal protection, monitoring, financial sustainability, and sufficient numbers ofwell-trained personnel. SOCIOPOLITICALISSUES OF RESERVE DESIGN It is essential to identify the stakeholders in your region, their background knowledgeand economic options, and what restrictions on use they would be willing to accept. Asmentioned above, stakeholder input and support is a significant predictor of reserve suc-cess. Locally based, sustainability-driven resource users may have a different degree ofcommitment than profit-driven users, and the percent of users who are local and perma-nent (ostensibly having a more long-term view) vs. transient (tourists, big business) willhave a significant impact on what strategy works best. Ideally all users may be con-vinced that the long-term sustainability of their enterprise, be it commercial or suste-nance-oriented, is intricately linked with the long-term health of the marine ecosystem.Achieving stakeholder buy-in allows for a greater reliance on voluntary compliance andself-monitoring rather enforcement, which is often both more expensive and less effec-tive. Given the financial uncertainty inherent in conservation planning, the more self-sustaining reserves can be, the better. BIOPHYSICALASPECTS OF RESERVE DESIGN Given the limited time and money available to planners, along with our still uncertainunderstanding of ecosystem response to climate change, most reserve planning willoccur without what would be considered the ideal amount of information. Nonetheless,taking the time to inventory certain key aspects of the marine ecosystems in your regionis essential. First, map habitat types in your region, including location and area covered. The map should cover both structural elements of habitat (sand, kelp forests, seagrass beds, boul-ders, etc.) and functional elements of habitat (e.g. spawning grounds for particularspecies, nursery grounds, etc.). Identify key biotic and abiotic variables controllingspecies distribution in your area, and how they'll be affected by climate change. For in-stance, what types of catastrophes does your region experience (how extreme, how fre-quent, how prolonged, rate of onset), and how will climate change likely change those? Isyour region likely to experience sea temperature increases or decreases? Remember,there's a great degree of local variability in the effects of climate change: just becausewarming will be the norm, doesn't mean your area will warm up. What major current regimes in your area, if any, will likely be affected by climate change (e.g. ENSOs, NAO,PDO, NO)? Consider the tidal regime in your region. Areas in which low tides occur inBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 147 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marinethe middle of the day will have more temperature stress on intertidal organisms (Helmuth et al. 2002), and will thus need different planning strategies than less-stressed areas. Strategies for Implementation \"Best practice\" approaches for planning reserves that will provide the best chance ofsuccess in the face of global climate change are not wildly different from \"best practice\"approaches for reserve planning as they exist now. Certain elements of reserve planningmay gain increased importance, however, and are emphasized below. REGIONALAND TRANSBOUNDARY COOPERATION Transboundary agreements and treaties, already important because of the open nature of marine ecosystems, may be essential to meet new spatial refugia or larval transportneeds, or to reduce stressors other than climate change to acceptable levels. Also, givenuncertainty about how communities and ecosystems may rearrange themselves as cli-mate change progresses, the possible inclusion of temporally-sensitive management op-tions may become increasingly important. MONITORING The science and practice of marine reserves are fairly young. There are not yet any time-tested design tools or best management practices, although there is wide-spread recog-nition that they must rapidly be developed if marine reserves are to fulfill their promiseas conservation tools. Systematic monitoring, evaluation, and information-sharing willenable us to understand the factors essential for reserve success, and the particular chal-lenges faced in variety of situations. The adaptive management approach suggested pre-viously requires on-going input of information so that effectiveness can be iterativelyevaluated and reserve management appropriately adapted as the environment changes and as more information becomes available. This approach enhances the probability thata reserve will achieve its long-term goals. Enlisting the help of volunteers can be a good way to encourage community involve- ment and investment in the reserve. It also familiarizes you with the nature of your re-serve, its cycles and processes. Also, monitoring lets you know whether or not your re-serve is working. If your reserve isn't working, you need to redesign the reserve, alterrestrictions on use, or establish another reserve. Which option you choose will dependon your best assessment of why the reserve isn't working. Further, more data are need-ed to help us design effective reserves in the future and assess the extent to which re-serves can solve our conservation problems. What to monitor depends on reserve goals, size, and budget. Some basic variables of in- terest are number, size, density and biomass of species inside, adjacent to, and far fromthe reserve; ideally, data should be collected before as well as after establishing the re-serve to provide a baseline. Replicate counts inside the reserve are essential to ensureadequate and accurate sampling. Monitoring often focuses on vertebrates (Halpern2003), but should be focused on overall biodiversity. This would provide more informa- tion for understanding ecosystem function and stability. Existing Adaptation Programs and Some Needed Information EXISTING PROGRAMS There are few if any marine reserves that have been designed and monitored specifical-ly with climate change adaptation in mind. Nonetheless, the need to incorporate poten-tial effects of climate change in reserve design is gaining attention (e.g. Soto, 2002;MPA News, 2001), and suggestions for doing so are beginning to appear. Parks Canada,for instance, surveyed all national parks in Canada to identify sites and species most atrisk from climate change, and predicting probable effects of climate change on eachpark (David Suzuki Foundation, 2000). Australia has recently created the world's largest marine reserve, the Heard Island and McDonald Islands Marine Reserve in the Southern Ocean (Australian Antarctic Divi-sion, 2003). In addition to maintaining these subantarctic islands in a relatively pristinestate, this reserve will be specifically monitored for possible effects of climate change ina region that has seen little direct anthropogenic impact. INDICATOR SPECIES, COMMUNITIES, AND PROCESSES As we head into an uncertain climate future, it would be useful to know which species,communities, or processes might serves as harbingers of changes to come. Identifyingspecies most sensitive to climate change (\"indicator species\") would give us early warn-ing signs of ecosystems on the brink of collapse, or early indications of successful con-servation approaches. Identifying the most sensitive elements of ecosystems may alsohelp us anticipate unexpected or indirect effects of climate change on ecosystems. Species that live in variable environments (e.g. seasonal, intertidal) tend to have broader latitudinal ranges and occupy more biogeographic provinces than species from morestable environments. Species with broad geographic ranges also tend to be more long-lived on a geological scale than species with restricted ranges. Thus it might be expect-ed that species naturally occurring in stable habitats or with geographically restrictedranges would be more susceptible to some aspects of climate change, and might make agood first guess as indicator species (Harley et al., in press). Another broad-brush approach to predicting potential sensitivity of species to climate change centers on the prediction that mobile organisms, which can escape stressful situ-ations behaviorally, should have a narrower tolerance range for a variety of stressorsthan sessile organisms, which must deal with whatever stressors come their way (Hueyet al., 2002). Thus mobile organisms may prove more sensitive indicators of environ-mental change that sessile ones. Since species do not live in a vacuum, it may also be useful to know which biological communities are most sensitive to climate change. Roberts et al. (2003) suggest thatWWF 148BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 149 CHAPTER 5 Temperate Marinecommunities that depend on biological rather than physical matrices, such as eelgrass beds or mangrove swamps, are often the least resistant or resilient. Such communitiesmay require particular attention in reserve design and sustainability. LONG-TERM, LARGE-SCALE DATASETS While numerous models exist to predict the future of climate change and its effects onecosystems, there is a strong need for real-world data to complement these models.Studies documenting effects of short-term climate changes such as ENSOs are an excel-lent first step, as are studies of the effects of thermal effluents on marine communities;both approaches should be expanded to include more geographic regions. Because suchphenomena are much more short-lived and smaller-scale than global climate change,however, we must also accumulate data on community structure over broad geographicand long temporal scales. Conclusions When it comes to marine reserves and climate change, our level of knowledge is inade-quate, and will remain so for the foreseeable future (see the excellent discussion of un-certainty in climate change modeling in Hannah, this volume). We cannot wait for cer-tainty before taking action, however; we must make the best decisions we can based onour current understanding of marine ecosystems and climate change, and incorporatebet-hedging and flexibility into our planning.The suggestions in this chapter are not in any way meant to undercut the importance ofglobal efforts to halt global climate change, or to imply that immediate global reductionof greenhouse gas emissions is not critical. Since global climate is not under local con-trol, however, and since some level of global climate change is now inevitable, local andregional planners need to take what actions they can to mitigate the effects of climatechange. Also, reserves are a critical element of conservation planning, and failure toconsider climate change when designing reserves may decrease the effectiveness of re-serves dramatically.

They include coral reefs, mangrove forests, seagrass beds and vast pelagic systems,and support local subsistence fishing as well as international commercial fisheries. Notonly do coral reefs support biodiversity and provide sustenance for communities, but theyalso support extensive tourism activities around the world. Coral reefs and mangrovesoffer protection from coastal erosion, while seagrasses and mangroves both trap sedimentfrom terrestrial run-off. Mangroves act as a filtration system for estuarine and fresh water.These habitats also serve as nurseries for many invertebrates and fish. The complex ecolo-gy of these systems is well appreciated but not fully understood. Efforts toward greaterunderstanding are being constantly challenged as theses systems are altered by local an-thropogenic stresses (fishing, development, extraction) and global climate change. The resistance (ability to withstand change) and resilience (ability to recover from change) of an ecosystem determine how well it can deal with this barrage of challenges(Noss, 2001). Conservation efforts can enhance resistance and resilience to climatechange by alleviating the overall pressures on the system, giving it more flexibility tomobilize its natural defenses. For example, coral reefs that experienced greater distur-bance prior to a bleaching event tend to have a poor ability to recover (Brown, 1997a).The following chapter offers an introduction to the effects of climate change on tropicalmarine systems, as well as an overview of the types of strategies that might be adoptedto increase the resistance and resilience of tropical marine protected areas. This chapterfocuses mostly on coastal systems, touching on pelagic where information exists. What Stresses Threaten Tropical Marine Systems Other Than Climate Change? DEVELOPMENT Tropical marine ecosystems are currently threatened by an array of local stresses asso- ciated with human activities. Although coastal regions encompass only 20% of Earth'slandmass, almost 60% of the world's population lives within 100 kilometers of theBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 157 CHAPTER 6 Tropical Marinecoast (Vitousek et al., 1997). Growing human populations and the desirability of coastal property increases coastal development, resulting in the loss or degradation ofcoral reefs, mangroves and sea grasses. Conversion of reef habitat to land for develop-ment has a \"complete and irreversible\" effect on reefs, effectively destroying them.Such development is extensive in Egypt, the Seychelles, the Maldives, Singapore andsome south Pacific atolls (Spalding et al., 2001; Bryant et al., 1998). Historically, 75%of all tropical coasts where inhabited by mangroves, but this is no longer the case(Farnsworth and Ellison, 1997). Accurate estimates of global mangrove loss are notavailable, but a recent survey characterized 55% of sites as \"threatened\" due to clear- cutting and reclamation (Farnsworth and Ellison, 1997). Seagrass loss is also poorlyquantified, but at least 90,000 hectares were lost in the decade prior to 1996, with45,000 hectares of that in Australia and 25,220 ha in the United States (Short and Wyl-lie-Echeverria, 1996). Losses were primarily due to dredge and fill activities and relat-ed changes in water quality. These numbers almost certainly underestimate global sea-grass losses, which some researchers put at nearly 90% (Burke et al., 2001). POLLUTION Pollution is ubiquitous in marine waters and the tropics are no exception. Run-off fromindustry, cities and agriculture contain pesticides, metals and nutrients; oil and chemi-cal spills are other pollutant sources, along with deposition of atmospherically trans-ported compounds such as persistent organic compounds and mercury. Even in remotepelagic systems, many high level predators such as tuna have high tissue concentra-tions of these compounds and there is evidence that levels have been increasing overthe past 20 years (Nakagawa et al., 1997). All of these pollutants disturb the olig-otrophic waters that characterize most tropical marine systems; since many tropicalmarine environments have limited populations of biodegrading microbial fauna, theymay be more sensitive to pollution than other systems. For example, on Laysan Islandin the northwest Hawaiian Islands, there was a carbamate pesticide spill, likely due toa container washed off a passing ship (David et al., 2001). While the container was notfound, its existence was inferred from an area referred to as \"The Dead Zone\", whichwas identified in 1988. Surveys of the beach have found dead insects, ghost shrimp, Laysan albatross (Diomedea immutabilis) and, most significantly, Laysan finches (Telespiza cantans), an endemic and endangered species (Woodward et al., 1998). Under normal terrestrial soil conditions, such pesticides are readily biodegraded. How-ever tropical and subtropical sand beaches seem to have slower degredation of xenobi- otics (Siegrist et al., 1994, Campbell et al., In Prep). As a result, mitigation of this sitein 2002 required the removal of all of the contaminated sand for treatment. This raisessubstantial concern regarding the fate and effects of all contaminant spills in olig-otrophic regions. Corals in particular are affected by local nutrient run-off from land. Run-off changes the chemistry of the near-shore waters to favor algae over corals, and is often associatedwith greater siltation, decreasing coral growth rates 2000; Pittock, 1999; Mangrove sys-WWF 158BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 159 CHAPTER 6 Tropical Marinetems have not escaped the impacts of pollution either. Following oil spills, mangroves suffer defoliation, loss of associated species and death, with recovery times on the orderof 15 to 20 years (Burns et al., 1993; Ellison and Farnsworth, 1996). There are fewerstudies on the effects of pollution on seagrasses. Some seagrass communities have beenadversely affected by oil spills (Zieman et al., 1984) and they are known to accumulateheavy metals, although no detrimental responses have been noted (Nienhuis, 1986).Herbicides, not surprisingly, have been found to adversely affect seagrasses. Photosyn-thetic activity was depressed in three serrulata, Halophila ovalis and Zostera capricorni) when exposed concentrations of diuron that were found in marine sediments off the coast of Australia (Haynes et al., 2000). TOURISM Tourism is a powerful tool for increasing public awareness of biodiversity and support for conservation efforts and funding, but it can create additional stress as well. Over-vis-itation and poorly managed visits cause severe degradation of tropical ecosystems.Poorly trained divers and snorkelers, as well as ill-placed boat anchorages damage coralreefs and seagrass beds. Tourism increases coastal development, pollution and extrac-tion due to the increased number of people at a given location each year (Spalding et al.,2001). In some cases, seagrasses have even been removed from hotel beaches to createa more \"aesthetically pleasant swimming zone\" (Daby, 2003). Mangroves are also re-moved for development, and are trampled by other human activities. OVERHARVEST OF FISHERIES Fisheries are being depleted globally (Myers and Worm, 2003) and there is exceptionalpressure on the tropics (Jackson et al., 2001). This includes large commercial fishing op-erations, such as tuna and other pelagic species, as well as small-scale efforts such asdynamite and cyanide fishing that damage not only fish populations but the entire com-munity and reef-structure as well. In Tanzania, for example, dynamite fishing has beenpracticed for at least 30 years, resulting in substantial degradation of coral reef commu-nities with loss of fish, invertebrates and coral (Guard and Masaiganah, 1997). Cyanidefishing was developed for the live fish trade and is now common on coral reefs in much of Southeast Asia. Sodium cyanide is \"squirted\" onto target fish, stunning them and al-lowing for easy collection. Although application of the poison is somewhat local, itspreads to cause lethal or sub-lethal impact on other organisms in the surrounding envi-ronment. In the Philippines, it has been in practice since the early 1960s (Halim, 2002). OTHER EXTRACTIVE USES While some coral rock is collected for the aquarium trade, coral reefs are also \"mined\"for building materials, especially in regions where there is little terrestrial rock. In theMaldives, for example, over a 13-year period, 93,450 m 3of coral was extracted from a single atoll (Brown and Dunne, 1988). Such a large coral removal has reduced local fishand invertebrate populations, and compromised the physical protection that the reef of-fered to the island. Coral remnants left after mining seem to have very limited and slowrecovery (Brown and Dunne, 1988).Mangroves are extensively harvested for wood and wood-products. In the past their bark was collected for tannin production, but the dominant use of mangroves now is fuel and building materials (Ellison and Farnsworth, 1996). INVASIVE SPECIES Tropical marine systems are also affected by the spread of non-native species. The ma- jority of these species are introduced accidentally (Carlton and Geller, 1993), althoughthere are some cases of intentional introduction, especially for aquaculture (Randall,1987). In Hawaii, for example, a recent survey of the archipelago determined that of the23,150 species identified, 5,047 were nonindigenous (Eldredge, 2000); of these 343 aremarine or estuarine and most were introduced through hull fouling or ballast release (El-dredge and Carlton, 2002). Mangrove ecosystems are relatively protected from invasive species because of the unique environment in which they live. There are very few plants that are halophytes(salt tolerant), making the pool of potential invaders quite limited (Lugo, 1997). How-ever, there are examples following hurricanes where disturbance opens up an opportuni- ty for an introduced species (Loope et al., 1994). Additionally, mangroves themselvescan be invasive. Red mangroves were introduced to Hawaii in 1902 from Florida in aneffort to support coastlines. There are now on-going efforts to remove this species fromthe islands. While seagrass communities are almost certainly affected by invasivespecies, there is little literature on the effects. What is the Effect of Climate Change on Tropical Marine Systems,Now and In the Future? While it is clear from the previous section that there are already myriad threats to tropi- cal marine ecosystems, it should be noted that at least some of these threats are begin-ning to be addressed through conservation efforts, especially in the case of coral reefs.However, Wilkinson (2002) noted that, \"These improvements could be largely negatedif the predicted threat posed by Global Climate Change of increasing sea surface tem-peratures and concentrations of CO 2in seawater cause catastrophic bleaching and result in major reductions in the capacity of corals to calcify and grow.\" This sort of dire as-sessment indicates how crucial it is that the impacts of climate change be considered andplanned for in any contemporary conservation efforts. A variety of emergent stressorsassociated with climate variability and change, reviewed below, are of increasing con-cern to scientists and mangers. INCREASING SEATEMPERATURES While water has a high heat capacity, it is not immune to changes in atmospheric temper-ature; as air temperatures rise, so will water temperatures. Ocean temperature changesactually lag behind air temperature changes to such a degree that even if atmosphericCO 2concentration were stabilized today, the oceans would continue to warm for another century (Albritton et al., 2001). This may be a particular challenge to marine species thathave relied on the thermal buffering capacity of the world's oceans to maintain a relative-WWF 160ly consistent environment. The response of these species to rising sea temperatures will depend on their thermal tolerances and the thermal tolerances of their competitors. Mostspecies have an optimal physiological temperature range for respiration and growth (andphotosynthesis in the case of primary producers). Outside that range, individuals are en-ergetically challenged. In the case of some seagrasses, such as the eelgrass Zostera mari- na,increasing temperature favors respiration over photosynthesis, decreasing the season- al growth optimum (Marsh et al., 1986; Short and Neckles, 1999). Other seagrasses inother parts of the world, however, increase photosynthesis with increasing temperature(Perez and Romero, 1992). For regions where seagrasses are living near their thermalmaximum, such as shallow lagoons and near warm effluent from power plants, a 2 \u00baC in-crease in sea temperature will be detrimental as these populations are already living clos-er to their thermal limit, and a 4-5 \u00baC increase would result in extensive mortality (Ed-wards, 1995). Increasing water temperatures can also result in seagrasses being outcompeted by algal species, including epiphytic algae (Neckles et al., 1993). The most dramatic effect of increasing temperature in tropical marine ecosystems is coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is defined by the loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates(zooxanthellae) or their pigments by the host coral animal (Glynn, 1993; Brown,1997a). Normally, the symbiotic dinoflagellates provide the coral host with additionalenergy through photosynthetic activity. Long-term loss of the dinoflagellates can resultin death of the affected coral (Harriott, 1985). Bleaching is considered to be a stress re-sponse caused primarily by increased water temperature (Glynn, 1993) and synergisti-cally enhanced by increased solar irradiance levels (Jokiel and Coles, 1990; Lesser etal., 1990; Fitt and Warner, 1995). The water temperature need only increase by 1 to 2 \u00baCover the average annual thermal maxima for days to weeks to result in a bleaching event (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). These conditions have led some to rank climate change as po-tentially \"the single greatest threat to reefs worldwide\" (West and Salm, 2003). SEALEVELRISE Sea level is predicted to rise between 20 and 80 cm over the next century (IPCC, 2001a).This is due to both the thermal expansion of water and the melting of terrestrial icemasses (glaciers and ice sheets). Sea level rise will affect intertidal and coastal ecosys-tems by inundating them with water and affecting the availability of light, as well as al-tering patterns of water movement both intertidally and subtidally. For seagrasses, dis-tribution and abundance are determined by salinity, light, depth and currents (Short andNeckles, 1999); rising sea levels could therefore dramatically alter seagrass communi-ties and their composition. Stable mangrove forests require stable sea level; prior to sea-level stabilization 6,000 years before present, large mangrove communities did not exist (Ellison and Stoddart,1991). Thus, rapid sea level rise will likely be the greatest climate change challenge tomangrove ecosystems (Field, 1995). During past changes in sea level (8-9 mm/year)mangroves have migrated landward or seaward as necessary (Parkinson et al., 1994);with coastal development the ability of mangroves to migrate may be severely limitedBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 161 CHAPTER 6 Tropical Marine(Ellison and Farnsworth, 1996). Reduced rates of sediment input due to coastal armor- ing and the damming of rivers will further limit the ability of mangrove forests to keepup with sea level rise (Field, 1995). The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change(IPCC) has recognized the severity of the threat of sea level rise to mangroves, and pastfloods in east Africa's coastal regions demonstrate the high vulnerability of this region(IPCC, 2001b). In Bangladesh and India, the mangroves of the Sunderbans are at greatrisk due to rising seas; a one meter rise in sea level will likely cause the Sunderbans andthe tigers living there to disappear (IPCC, 2001b). Under ideal conditions coral reef growth would likely be able to keep up with sea level rise predicted over the next century, but coral condition is not ideal and will become less so asthe climate continues to change (Buddemeier and Smith, 1988). Bioerosion can erode reefsat rates up to 6 mm/year (Eakins, 1992), and changes in ocean chemistry will slow coralgrowth and may decrease the strength of coral skeletons (see further discussion of thisunder section on effects of Increasing Atmospheric CO 2). If bioerosion rates exceed calcifi- cation rates, then corals will not be able to keep up with sea level rise and may \"drown\". EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS (HURRICANES, CYCLONES, ENSO PATTERNS) The role of climate change in increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weatheris not well established (IPCC, 2001a). However if such effects do occur, this increases theimportance of mangroves and coral reefs, which buffer coastlines against storm surge andhigh winds (Edwards, 1995). Increased frequency and intensity of storms would alsothreaten these critical ecosystems. Storm damage to corals, especially from hurricanes, iswell documented throughout the tropics (Woodley, 1992; Harmelin-Vivien and Laboute,1986; Done, 1992). Between December 1982 and April 1983, six hurricanes hit FrenchPolynesia, and reef surveys following these events showed 50 to 100% damage depend-ing on depth (Harmelin-Vivien and Laboute, 1986). Done (1992) points out that in somehigh-energy regions, like the Great Barrier Reef, damage from cyclone-generated wavesis already dramatic with reef commonly lost to such events. Hurricane Gilbert \"dis-turbed\" the Cayman Islands in 1988 to the extent that reef surveys eight years later re-quired no quantitative transects for reefs of less than 8 m depth (Riegl, 2001). Addition-ally, historic Acropora palmata zones were no longer present. Seagrasses also suffer significant damage from current levels of tropical storms (Short and Wyllie-Echeverria, 1996) and are often slow to recover (Williams, 1990). Non-cli-matic pressures further exacerbate this slow recovery. Should storm frequency increase,some seagrass beds may not be able to recover sufficiently between storms. In HerveyBay, on the coast of Queensland, Australia, a 100,000-hectare community was lost aftertwo flood events and a cyclone in 1992, coupled with pressures from terrestrial nutrientand sediment run-off and shrimp trawling (Preen et al., 1995). The damage of hurricanes to mangroves, through high winds and flooding, is less well studied. Of the reports that do is exist is one from Belize where large hurricanes have afrequency of about one every 30 years (Murray et al., 2003). Hurricane Hattie in 1961WWF 162had such force that it altered the coastline, elevating former mangrove habitat above saline influence and allowing it to become a pine forest (Murray et al., 2003). The predicted increase in major climatic events, such as El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillations (ENSO) (Timmermann et al., 1999; IPCC, 2001b), may have drastic effects on fishstocks, especially when combined with stressors such as overfishing. Reduced survivaland growth rate, and altered migratory routes can all be caused by ENSO events, exac-erbating the effects of intensive harvesting (Miller and Fluharty, 1992). Both 1972-73and 1997-98 ENSO events significantly reduced Peruvian populations(Caviedes and Fik, 1992; Pfaff et al., 1999). ENSO events cause temporary range shifts,as well as introducing changes in reproductive physiology, egg and larvae survival, re-cruit and adult biomass, and fish schooling behavior (Jord\u00e1n, 1991). The ENSO event of 1982-83 marked the first contemporary broad scale coral bleaching and mortality event (Glynn, 1984). Since then, there have been subsequent bleachingevents including the 1997-98 ENSO event. The rate of occurrence (annually in some cases) and almost global scale since the early 1980's is in stark contrast to the trend of thefirst half of the century in which bleaching events were localized and linked to local events (D'Elia, 1991; Glynn, 1993). From 1876-1979, only three bleaching events were record-ed, whereas 60 are on record from 1980-1993 (Glynn, 1993). The increase in bleachingsuggests that anthropogenic alterations of the environment are responsible, such as in-creases in annual sea surface temperature and occurrence of ENSO events (Hoegh-Guld-berg, 1999; Pittock, 1999). The future for corals in regard to bleaching is grim. It has beensuggested that by 2020 bleaching events like that caused by the 1997-98 ENSO will be-come \"commonplace\" (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). There has also been some correlation be-tween ENSO events and disease outbreaks in coral and oysters (Harvell et al., 2002). Op-portunistic pathogens can exacerbate the impact of bleaching events. For example, thegorgonian coral Briareum asbestinum suffered extensive mortality when affected simulta- neously by bleaching and a suspected cyanobacterial pathogen (Harvell et al., 2001). Clearly hurricanes, tropical cyclones and ENSO events have substantial effects on trop- ical marine systems even now. For the most part species in this region have evolved withthese pressures and have clear cycles of recovery. However, this recovery is markedlyslow even at historic frequencies of disturbance. If climate change does indeed increasethe frequency and severity of these weather types, it could alter the tropical marineseascape, with more rapidly growing and less disturbable species becoming dominant. INCREASING ATMOSPHERIC CO2 Besides acting as a greenhouse gas, increasing atmospheric CO2will result in increased dissolved CO2in the water column, which in turn will cause a reduction in the pH of the oceans. As a result, less carbon will be biologically available to calcium-carbonate-forming organisms. To date pH-related changes in aragonite saturation levels have re-sulted in and calcite precipitation rates; a dou-bling of CO 2is expected to result in another 8 to 17% reduction (Kleypas et al., 1999).BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 163 CHAPTER 6 Tropical MarineWWF 164 This would weaken shells and other calcium carbonate structures, as well as slow growth rates of marine invertebrates with calcium carbonate skeletons; these effectswould be particularly pronounced in coral communities (Kleypas et al., 1999). Hoegh- Guldberg (1999) estimates that by 2050 calcification rates could be reduced by 14-30%. Changes in available carbon may also affect seagrasses, as there is variability among species in how well they compete for available carbon (Short and Neckles, 1999). Also,as epiphytic algal growth is enhanced due to increased temperature and CO 2, in addition to local eutrophication, seagrasses will have to grow faster to keep pace with their epi-phytes (Short and Neckles, 1999). Mangroves have been shown over the course of a sin-gle year to increase growth and reach reproductive maturity faster under enhanced CO 2 conditions (Farnsworth et al., 1996), however ecological ramifications are not clear.Field (1995) suggests that the real effect of enhanced CO 2cannot be ascertained without a \"long-term\" experiment in which CO2, water stress and nutrient stress are all moni- tored. For example, studies on marshes under elevated CO2conditions have shown changes in response over time, such as increased release of methane and other green-house gases, following initial increases in primary productivity (Dacey et al., 1994). ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION Ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases are generally equated with stratospheric ozone de-pletion. While there is some ozone thinning in the tropics (Madronich et al., 1995) andultraviolet radiation is already naturally highest in the tropics, climate change inducedtropical warming may also result in increased UV-penetrance into the water column.Warming results in doldrum conditions, causing increased stratification of the water col- umn and decreased dissolved organic matter [including chromophoric dissolved organ-ic matter (CDOM)], leading to higher levels of UV deeper in the water column (Vo-dacek et al., 1997; Siegel and Michaels, 1996). This means that as thermal stressincreases, so does the stress of UV radiation. The negative synergistic effects of temper-ature and UV radiation on coral are well established (Lesser et al., 1990; Dunne andBrown, 2001). UV is also expected to affect seagrass photosynthetic ability (Larkumand Wood, 1993), although they may have some ability to protect themselves from slowchanges through increased production of UV-blocking pigments (Dawson and Denni-son, 1996). Mangroves and seagrasses are both sources of CDOM and other UV-blocking com- pounds that can be transferred to the marine water column when plants die or leaves arelost (Lovelock et al., 1992; Stabenau et al., In Prep). Therefore, as mangroves and sea-grass systems suffer degradation and losses due to various stresses, a result may be con-tinued exacerbation of UV stress to all systems. EFFECTS ON SPECIES OF CONCERN Seagrasses provide a primary food source for dugongs, manatees and green turtles(Lanyon et al., 1989), all species of conservation concern, and loss of seagrass beds orshifts in species composition could have significant impacts on these species. In addi-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 165 CHAPTER 6 Tropical Marinetion to the potential loss of food source and habitat (seagrasses, coral reefs), turtles face an additional threat from climate change: skewed sex ratios. Sex determination in turtlesis temperature dependent (Davenport, 1997). Higher temperatures lead to more femaleturtles with only 1.5 \u00baC separating the sexes (Morreale et al., 1982). A two-\u00baC increasein temperature is expected to dramatically skew the sex ratio and a four-\u00baC increasewould virtually eliminate male offspring (Janzen, 1994). What are Possible Options for Increasing the Resilience and Resistance of Tropical Marine Systems to Climate Change? The basic premise of increasing resistance and resilience of ecosystems in responses to a changing climate is very similar to that used in designing conservation strategies toprotect biodiversity from any threat. Given the scope and multi-faceted effects of cli-mate change, the challenge is to broaden our thinking on both spatial and temporalscales, employ greater rigor in setting limits and enforcement, and make sure that a fewnew facets are considered. Here the strategies are divided up into three categories: 1)create sufficient space for change, 2) reduce all non-climate stresses and 3) identify re-sistant and resilient populations for special protection. While most of the effort to dateon these approaches has focused on coral reefs, and the examples following reflect that,it should be noted that they are also applicable to other coastal, tropical marine systems. CREATING SUFFICIENTAND APPROPRIATE SPACE 1. CREATE RESERVES THAT CONTAIN REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM TYPES (CORAL REEF, MANGROVE, SEAGRASS) ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS Human development is unlikely to cease anytime soon. It is thereby crucial that areas be protected from human encroachment as a first step in biodiversity protection. There area few things to keep in mind when designing reserves in response to climate change.While many of these overlap with standard conservation requirements, climate changemay require additional diligence in meeting these requirements. a) It is not enough simply to have space: it must be ecologically significant space. Done (2001) describes \"the perfect regional configuration\" of a marine protectedarea (MPA) as one which contains a \"full suite\" of regional biodiversity. He alsosuggests the need for MPAs to encompass large areas, depth gradients and a high di-versity of species. Maximazing the heterogeneity of the reserve is crucial (see #4 below) b) Reserves also require effective management and enforcement. The absence of these activities leads to \"paper parks\" with no real functionality (Westmacott et al., 2000). c) Although the effects of climate change will not stop at the borders of reserves, they can provide an area in which non-climate stresses can be more effectively limited. Ifthis does in fact confer resilience, decrease adverse effects, or increase recovery po-tential, then reserves may act as the seed populations for numerous sites beyond re-serves that were not experiencing the same benefits. WWF 166 d) One reserve of each habitat type is also insufficient. \"Replication\" of habitats in multiple protected areas is necessary so that loss of a single reserve would not meanloss of the only remaining examples of habitats protected by the reserve. Designing protected areas in response to climate change will require additional care for some tropical marine systems. For example, communities dependent on biologicalrather than physical matrices, such as seagrass beds or mangroves, are often the least re-sistant or resilient to environmental perturbations (Roberts et al., 2003). 2.CREATE NETWORKS OF RESERVES The \"single large or several small\" debate regarding reserve size has a long history inboth terrestrial and marine conservation circles, but reserve networks are increasinglyrecognized as a powerful tool for the protection of marine ecosystems. Such networksconfer a number of advantages. First, they allow coverage across a gradient of biogeo-graphic and oceanographic conditions without the social, political and economic com-plexity of establishing a single large reserve. This is especially important where suchgradients and the communities dependent on them cross political boundaries. The East-ern Africa Marine Ecoregion (Olson and Dinerstein, 1998), for example, is a network ofmarine protected areas that includes 4600 km of shoreline covering an extensive latitu-dinal and thermal gradient along the coasts of five countries (Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania,Mozambique and South Africa) (Figure 1). Networks are also more effective than singlereserves at supporting organisms with a diversity of dispersal distances, which in marineflora and fauna may range from centimeters to thousands of kilometers (Shanks et al.,2003). By protecting large total areas while keeping individual protected areas some-what smaller, networks are better able to provide source populations for recolonizationof damage areas in other reserves in the network, as well as areas outside the network(Done, 2001; Westmacott, 2000). Finally, they have the added advantage of creatingreplicate reserves, spreading the risk while increasing the probability that representativebiodiversity will avoid complete loss with a single damaging event. 3.PROTECT CLIMATIC REFUGIA Identifying locations that are more stable during periods of global climate change can bevery useful for conservation. These sites may have strong currents, upwelling or other oceanographic features that make them less prone to thermal fluxes. For example, at thesouth end of the island of Sulawesi, and along the Makassar Strait (between Borneo andSulawesi), there is a region for which a 17-year analysis (1985-2001) showed no ther-mal anomalies greater than 1\u00b0C in many parts of the region. It is hypothesized that thisis due to high current flow in this region, or other oceanographic features. (Kassem etal., 2002). Such areas may offer at least temporary refuge from warming waters result-ing from climate change, and should be considered as sites or extensions of sites forconservation efforts (Done, 2001; West and Salm, 2003). Other local physical featuresthat may create thermal refugia include proximity to deep water, shade, high wave ener-gy and turbidity (West and Salm, 2003). Some of these have the added benefit of reduc-ing exposure to light, including UV radiation.BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 167 CHAPTER 6 Tropical MarineFigure 1 Creating networks of reserves such as the String of MPAs along the East coast of Africa,is one approach to increasing resilience. 4.PROTECT PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL HETEROGENEITY It will not always be clear what aspects of a system confer resistance or resilience. This requires adoption of a bet-hedging strategy in which heterogeneous areas are selectedfor protection, providing as many options as possible. There has been limited researchon this approach; however, a nice example exists involving two populations of check-erspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis), with strong climatic influences on popu- lation extinction rates (McLaughlin, 2002). The population living in the more homoge-neous habitat went extinct first, and prior to its extinction had more dramaticfluctuations in response to climatic changes than the population from the more hetero-geneous site. This indicates that in addition to reserve size, it is important the protectedarea also encompass a variety of habitat types, including small-scale variability. Evenfor species for which we believe we know the ideal habitat type, it is possible that as theclimate changes their habitat requirements will also change. 5.RESTORATION OF DEGRADED HABITATS Some ecosystems have been dramatically degraded, but retain sufficient importancefrom an ecological or global biodiversity standpoint that it is worth trying to resurrectHighest priority areas for conservationProtected areas Eastern Africa Marine EcoregionWWF 168 them. Mangrove forests, for example, have been substantially degraded globally yet serve an important ecosystem function when intact. In Vietnam (see details below underCase Studies) and east Africa, efforts are being made to restore mangrove forests to im-prove coastal protection and estuarine condition. They may also convey some advantagefor nearshore coral reef systems, releasing protective CDOM (Lovelock et al., 1992;Stabenau et al., In Prep). Thus restoration of mangroves is advantageous not only for themangrove trees themselves, but the adjacent biodiversity as well. Restoration of seagrass beds is also recognized as environmentally and economically important, and a number of techniques for conservation and restoration have been de-veloped (Fonseca et al., 1998). Some restoration techniques harness the natural behavior of wild animals: workers in the southern United States have installed bird roosts to pro-vide natural fertilization for troubled seagrass beds (NOAA, 2003). REDUCE OR ELIMINATE NON-CLIMATE STRESSES 6.ELIMINATE DESTRUCTIVE FISHING PRACTICES AND OVERFISHING Reducing the damaging effects of destructive fishing will require creating regulations tolimit these practices, as well as creation of no fishing zones to ease recovery and en-forcement (Westmacott et al., 2000). To alleviate the root cause of the pressure it will benecessary to develop alternative livelihoods (Westmacott et al., 2000) or alternativetechniques for fishing communities (Bryant et al., 1998). For example, in the Philip-pines where cyanide fishing has been a problem for decades, a government and NGO(International MarineLife Alliance) partnership has created the Cyanide Fishing ReformProgram. This program trains fishermen in alternative fishing practices while the gov-ernment is increasing enforcement of anti-cyanide fishing regulations. Efforts are beingmade to export the program to Indonesia where cyanide fishing is also a widespreadconcern. 7.REDUCE POLLUTION, INCLUDING TERRESTRIAL OF NUTRIENTS AND PESTICIDES Limited research on interactions between climate and non-climate-related stresses, indi-cates synergistic responses (McLusky et al., 1986). For example, when rainbow trout(Salmo gairdneri ) are exposed to the pesticide permethrin over a range of temperatures the toxicity increases as temperature increase (Kumaraguru and Beamish, 1981). Addi-tionally, adverse effects of nutrient run-off on coastal ecosystems are well established(Koop et al., 2001) and less disturbed reefs generally have a greater likelihood of recov-ering from bleaching events (Brown, 1997a). Efforts to reduce pollution will generallyfocus on activities outside of reserves. This may require improving terrestrial land usepractices to decrease nutrient and sediment run-off, eliminating local use of persistentpesticides or improving the quality of effluent from municipal and industrial sources. Inthe case of atmospheric deposition of contaminants the efforts will need to be similar tothose needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, some atmosphericallytransported compounds, such as mercury, also have local sources. Mercury is used ex-tensively in gold mining which in many cases occurs in watersheds adjacent to tropicalmarine systems.8.REDUCE DAMAGING EXTRACTION Tropical marine ecosystems have long been a source of materials to sustain life, be it food, clothing or even building materials. As human populations have grown, the extent of theseextractive activities has become unsustainable. In addition to quantifying the problem of coral mining in the Maldives, Brown (1997b) has attempted to delineate alternatives forlocal construction. She estimates that, through increasing use of concrete blocks createdfrom coral sand and dead coral material, local demand could be satisfied until 2050. Re-ducing extraction pressure on these slow recovery systems (corals, mangroves and sea-grasses) will make them better able to respond to the stress of climate change. Additional-ly, decreasing removal of organisms and populations, increases the potential for greatergenetic diversity in these systems, again increasing the likelihood that they will be betterable to respond to the stress of climate change (e.g. Dodd and Rafii, 2001). PROTECT RESISTANTAND RESILIENT POPULATIONS OR COMMUNITIES 9.IDENTIFY THOSE POPULATIONS OR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ENDOGENOUS FAC- TORS WHICH MAKE THEM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE Some populations or communities may possess endogenous factors that enhance their ability to deal with the added stress of climate change. For example, some coral bleachingevents are caused by high temperatures exacerbated by UV (Lesser et al., 1990; Dunne and Brown, 2001). Zooxanthellae produce compounds called mycosporine-like aminoacids (MAAs), which can effectively act as sunscreens. Concentrations MAAs vary be-tween species and populations (Gleason, 1993; Shick et al., 1996) and they can be inducedto varying degrees by exposure to UV. It may be that some populations with naturallyhigher MAA concentrations, or an enhanced ability to induce these compounds duringtimes of stress, are less prone to bleaching under combined UV/heat stress conditions.Such endogenous factors may be present in a population as a result of surviving a previousbleaching event, effectively a preadaptation (West and Salm, 2003; Done, 2001). 10.MAINTAIN DIVERSE GENE POOLS, AND NATURAL DIVERSITY OF ECOSYSTEMS This is also a bet-hedging strategy. Since it is currently not possible to predict exactlyhow any location will change, it is best to retain a range of response options in ecosys-tems. Evolutionarily this protection from the unknown has come from genetic diversity.It is uncertain what gene or trait might confer a future advantage, but the more optionsyou have the greater the likelihood that you have a combination that will survive (see re-view in Dodd and Rafii, 2001). It is similarly beneficial to maintain diversity at thespecies level; you never know which species will be the key to helping the systemthrough a stressful period. This list is by no means complete. It should be seen as a starting point for developing ideas and more importantly, for developing field testing strategies to begin assessinghow these will work in your own system. Adequate monitoring of individual sites is essential to best assess how each ecosystem is being affected and what strategies can be implemented. For example, you can onlyBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 169 CHAPTER 6 Tropical MarineWWF 170 protect climate refugia if you know where they are. This monitoring must be coupled with field testing to see which strategies are most successful. In the case of climatechange, it is necessary to start implementing some strategies\u2014which can be seen as \"dono harm\"\u2014before they are fully tested. Otherwise, as the effects of climate change be-come more apparent and pressing, it will be too late to implement many of the strategiesand expect to have an enhancement in resilience or resistance. What is Necessary to Implement These Strategies? The first step is to gain the interest of informed resource managers and local communities.They will need to have sufficient levels of concern for their systems in relation to climatechange. The next step requires involvement of stakeholders in the resilience-buildingprocess. Much of the stress of protected areas is caused by those who live outside the re-serve through their competition for or damaging use of resources. More rigorous no-takeand protective status enforcement, more and larger protected areas and limiting of devel-opment and extraction even outside of protected areas will not happen unless stakeholderscan understand the benefit to them and are made part of the process in delineating this newlevel of protection. Finally, there must be vested long-term resources and vision for main-taining the protections that are created. Climate change is not a threat that can be solved inthe short term. Systems will need to be resilient for decades to come and the stress will be-come more intense as atmospheric concentrations of CO 2increase and temperatures rise. Case Studies It is crucial that we learn more about which strategies are effective and what additionalfactors may play a role in increasing the resistance and resilience of natural systems to climate change. Unfortunately, while there are many ideas about possible strategies,there is limited empirical evidence to aid those trying to make decisions. Waiting for fullexperimental conclusions before taking action is not an option. Climate change is al- ready affecting ecosystems, and waiting could allow windows of conservation opportu-nity to close. There are a few studies that have begun to assess the success of variousstrategies and may serve as models for developing other studies. MANGROVES Vietnam has an extensive coastline (3000 km) with the majority of its populations living in the lowland alluvial plains. Since 1945, there has been a 45% loss in mangrove coverin Vietnam (Jameson et al., 1995), mostly due to conversion of mangrove forests to agri-culture, including shrimp aquaculture (Tri et al., 1998). As previously mentioned, man-groves play an important role in coastal protection, and the plains previously protectedby mangroves are threatened by rising sea level (potentially a third of the Red River'sdelta will be inundated) and a possible increase in the frequency of storms, such as trop-ical cyclones. As a result, Red Cross/Red Crescent societies are supporting efforts to re-store mangroves to enhance protection for these regions. Since the project began in1997, 18,000 ha of mangroves have been planted along 100 km of coast. The increasedmangrove forest cover is improving conditions for associated species, including 109species of bird. Harvestable marine resources also seem to be increasing in number:BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 171 CHAPTER 6 Tropical Marineareas with restored mangroves are no longer having to purchase \"sea products\" such as crabs from other provinces. (D. V. Tao, Pers. Comm.) CORALREEFS Protecting coral reefs from the effects of bleaching might seem an impossible task.While nothing can be done to lower the temperature of the warming oceans, actions canbe taken that limit other stresses that make reefs more susceptible to bleaching. In 2000,then-Governor Tauese Pita Fiti Sunia declared his intention to achieve a goal of protect-ing 20% of American Samoa's coral reefs in \"no take\" MPAs. To improve the likelihoodthat these MPAs would meet their long-term goals of protecting biodiversity, WWF de-veloped a project to help identify not only the sites that are less likely to bleach and more likely to recover, but also to determine what factors account for these differences.To this end, the project is comparing seven sites with varying levels of formal protec- tion, impact from high nutrient terrestrial run-off and concentrations of endogenous pro-tective factors in their corals. Researchers survey the coral reefs quarterly for bleachingand recovery, monitor nutrient concentrations and water temperatures and assess theconcentration of the sunscreening mycosporine-like amino acids in corals at each site.The project includes sites in protected areas such as the National Park of AmericanSamoa and the Fagatele National Marine Sanctuary. Additionally, researchers are work-ing with local stakeholders (managers, villages) to not only conduct the research but tobegin discussions on possible response to study findings. In March of 2003, there was ableaching event in the waters of American Samoa associated with elevated water tem-peratures. Bleaching ranged from 5 to 30% at the study sites. The recovery of the reefsfrom this bleaching event is now being tracked. WWF hopes to be able to use resultsover the next two years to assist in making management decisions for coral reefs in re- sponse to climate change. To this end a Coral Bleaching Monitoring Protocol is alsobeing developed and efforts are underway to expand the approach of the AmericanSamoa project to other coral reefs around the world. Conclusion Protection of natural resources from climate change will require a two-pronged ap-proach. In addition to taking the types of measures outlined in this chapter, it will alsobe necessary to limit the rate and extent of anthropogenic climate change. This does notrequire that resource managers become advocates, but it may be useful to start docu-menting the impacts of climate change, the cost of preparing for the changes and theprognosis for success in responding at a local level. This information could be shared atmanagement and scientific fora to indicate the need for broader-scale action.

Recovery Climate Change Stacey Combes, Ph.D. Department of Biology, University of Washington FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS HAVE BEEN critical to sustaining life and estab- lishing civilizations throughout history. Humans rely on freshwater systems not only fordrinking water, but also for agriculture, transportation, energy production, industrialprocesses, waste disposal, and the extraction of fish and other products. As a result ofthis dependence, human settlements worldwide are concentrated near freshwaterecosystems, with over half of the world's population living within 20 km of a permanentriver (Small and Cohen, 1999). In addition to humans, an enormous array of plants, animals, and microorganisms de- pend on freshwater ecosystems for their con-tain only 0.01% of the Earth's water and cover a small fraction of the planet's surface,rivers, lakes and wetlands harbor a disproportionately high fraction of the Earth's biodi-versity. Freshwater fishes alone account for over one-fourth of all living vertebrate species. (McAllister et al., 1997). Because freshwater ecosystems continuously channel precipitation from the surround- ing landscape through the interconnected lakes, rivers, and wetlands that lie below, theycan be surprisingly sensitive to distant activities. Increasing human water needs and ex-tensive land alteration has contributed to the decline of countless freshwater species.Freshwater biodiversity is now more threatened than terrestrial biodiversity, and the pro-jected mean future extinction rate of North American freshwater animals is about fivetimes higher than for terrestrial animals, and comparable to predicted extinction ratesfor tropical rainforest communities (Ricciardi and Rasmussen, 1999). The long-term protection of freshwater species is largely dependent upon identifying the underlying physical processes of freshwater systems that are most vulnerable tochange, and determining how changes in these physical features might affect the resi-dent flora and fauna. For this purpose, it is useful to divide freshwater ecosystems intorivers, lakes, and wetlands. In this chapter, rivers and streams are considered to be chan-nelized bodies of water that generally display continuous flow, and lakes are relativelystill bodies of water that can be either connected (through rivers, streams, etc.) or isolat-ed from other bodies of water. Wetlands (also known as marshes, swamps, fens, bogs,BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 177 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterWWF 178 floodplains, or depressions) are areas where the water table is at or near the surface, and vegetation is submerged for at least part of the year. Many, although not all, wetlands are connected to or interact strongly with lakes and rivers. Because freshwater ecosystems are sensitive not only to water temperature, volume, and flow, but also to variability in these factors, rivers, lakes and wetlands are expected todisplay a wide variety of changes in response to global climate change. The purpose ofthis chapter is to provide information and strategies for designing and managing re-serves that will allow freshwater ecosystems to withstand and/or adapt to climatechange. The chapter begins with a review of current threats to freshwater ecosystemsand some of the observed and predicted effects of global climate change on these sys-tems. Next, general suggestions are presented for designing and managing freshwaterreserves to increase resistance and resilience to climate change. The chapter concludeswith a discussion of methods for selecting and implementing specific adaptation strate-gies to accommodate global climate change in freshwater ecosystems. Current Threats to Freshwater Ecosystems Because freshwater ecosystems depend strongly on physical features such as waterquantity, quality and flow, many of the threats to these ecosystems involve activities thatalter fundamental physical characteristics. Freshwater ecosystems throughout the worldare threatened by human activities that directly alter system hydrology, such as con-struction of physical barriers to flow, water extraction, and filling or draining of shallowhabitats. Pollution of waterways with toxic substances and excessive nutrients, as wellas destructive land use practices in areas surrounding freshwater ecosystems, lead to re-ductions in water quality. While the above threats directly affect physical features offreshwater ecosystems, the introduction of exotic species primarily affects native biota.The invasion of freshwater ecosystems by non-native species is rapidly becoming one ofthe most serious threats to freshwater communities. Overexploitation of animals associ-ated with freshwater ecosystems, particularly freshwater fishes, is also a continuingproblem. Finally, penetration of harmful UV-B radiation into water bodies is increasingin many areas due to interactions between a number of anthropogenic factors, and arange of negative impacts on freshwater communities may result. ALTERATION OF HYDROLOGY PHYSICAL BARRIERS TO FLOW Humans have constructed a variety of physical barriers, including dams, levees anddikes, to prevent flooding, generate power, supply water for irrigation or municipalwater supplies, and provide recreational opportunities. Dams have been built on every continent except Antarctica; they are prevalent in developed countries and their rate ofconstruction is increasing rapidly in developing nations. Dams have traditionally beenviewed as an environmentally-friendly and sustainable means of ensuring water supply,controlling floods, and generating power without polluting the environment. However,retaining water and altering its natural flow can lead to large changes in aquatic and ter-restrial habitats, both above and below dams. Initial flooding above dams to create reservoirs can result in massive losses of terrestri- al habitat; for example, India lost approximately 479,000 ha of forest land to variousriver valley projects from 1950-1975 (Goldsmith and Hildyard, 1984). Stagnation andlow flow rates in reservoirs can lead to large changes in water temperature, includingvariations in seasonal peak temperatures and a reduction in natural temperature varia- tion (Baron et al., 2003). Silt that is normally carried down rivers accumulates behinddams, and costly removal procedures are sometimes necessary to ensure that dams re-main functional. In addition, the decomposition of flooded vegetation above dams mayrelease significant quantities methane and other greenhouse gases, particularly in tropi-cal areas where plant biomass is high (McCully, 1996); the magnitude of this green-house gas release compared to fossil fuel burning has been widely debated (Rudd et al.,1993; Gagnon and Chamberland, 1993; Fearnside, 1997). Dams also cause dramatic changes in downstream flow regime, where seasonal, dynam- ic flows are replaced by steady water release for energy production, or intermittent largereleases to lower reservoir levels. The temperature variability of water released from thebottom layer of reservoirs is low compared to that of natural stream flows, and oxygencontent may be reduced. The loss of natural silt in released water can lead to a range ofdamaging effects downstream, including changes in chemical composition, river bankerosion, and massive habitat loss and erosion in coastal deltas and floodplains. Finally, dams pose a significant barrier to diadromous fish and other migrating animals. In the Brazilian Amazon, where many fish undergo long-distance migrations during therainy season, 79 dams are either planned or currently in existence (Pringle et al., 2000),and hydroelectric development is considered to be the greatest threat to Amazonian fish-eries in the near future (Bayley and Petrere, 1989; Goulding et al., 1996). On the Co-lumbia River in the northwestern United States, 19 major dams have already contributedto the extinction of at least 106 local stocks of pacific salmon (McGinnis, 1994). Humans also build obstructions such as levees and dikes to prevent water from flowing laterally over river banks during high flows\u2014in this way, land adjacent to rivers can bedeveloped with less risk of seasonal flooding. However, these barriers disrupt connec-tions between rivers and valuable floodplain habitats, which serve as refugia and spawn-ing grounds for many animals, and are often sites of high biodiversity. WATER DIVERSION/WITHDRAWAL In order to meet the agricultural and municipal water needs of a growing population, large quantities of water are diverted or withdrawn directly from rivers, lakes, or the underlyingwater table. A large proportion of the world's population is currently experiencing water stress, and human water needs are expected to increase dramatically in the coming decadesdue to projected population growth and increased development (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al., 2000). Withdrawal of water for human needs can reduce the total amount of water available to aquatic biota (resulting in low stream flows and declining lake levels), reduce seasonalBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 179 CHAPTER 7 Freshwatervariability in flows, and lead to large losses of habitat, particularly valuable edge habi- tats that are used for spawning or rearing (Tyedmers and Ward, 2001). Withdrawal ofgroundwater for agriculture in adjacent areas can completely dry up valuable wetlands,even if the habitat itself is protected (McDowall, 1984). Water that is withdrawn from freshwater systems is often returned in the form of household wastewater, agriculturalrunoff, or industrial cooling water, with reduced quality (increased pollutants, changesin nutrient load) and altered temperature. FILLING OR DRAINING SHALLOW HABITATS Wetlands throughout the world have been filled or drained for development or agricul- ture (Brinson and Malvarez, 2002; Junk, 2002). These habitats have traditionally beenregarded as useless in their natural state, and many countries have provided subsidies toencourage the conversion of wetlands to agricultural land. Thankfully, the valuableecosystem services that wetlands provide, including water purification, groundwaterrecharge, and flood control, are becoming more widely appreciated (National ResearchCouncil, 1995). INVASIVE SPECIES Apart from direct alterations of system hydrology, the most serious threat to freshwaterecosystems in many areas is the presence of invasive, non-native species. Invaders areoften adaptable generalists who breed and disperse quickly, endangering native speciesthrough highly efficient competition, predation, or habitat alteration. DELIBERATE INTRODUCTIONS The deliberate introduction of non-native species for commercial or recreational fishingis widespread; for example, approximately 80% of the alpine lakes in the western Unit-ed States have been stocked with non-native fish (Bahls, 1992). In many areas, lakes andstreams are continuously re-stocked to maintain populations. Although these fisheriesgenerate enormous income, the effects on freshwater communities can be devastating.Hundreds of native fish species in North America are threatened, and competition orpredation by non-natives is the primary threat to many of these species (Allan andFlecker, 1993; Schindler, 2001). In Lake Victoria, increased predation and competitiondue to the introduction of the Nile perch and several non-native tilapiine species (in ad-dition to ongoing environmental changes in the lake), led to the extinction of up to 200endemic cichlid species within a few decades (Ogutu-Ohwayo, 1990; Witte et al., 1992). ACCIDENTAL INTRODUCTIONS Many species are introduced to and spread throughout freshwater ecosystems acciden- tally\u2014for example, non-native species can be attached to boats or transported in ballastor bilge water. The zebra mussel, which is native to Europe, was accidentally introducedto the Great Lakes in 1986 through ballast water. It has altered water chemistry throughhighly efficient filter feeding, outcompeted populations of native mussels, and fouledboats, docks, and power plant intakes, costing millions of dollars in damage (Cooley,1991; Effler et al., 1996; Nalepa et al., 1996). Several species of native mussels, clams,WWF 180and commercially important fish are threatened directly or indirectly by its presence (Nalepa et al., 1996; Roberts, 1990). Non-native plants can also cause damage to aquatic ecosystems. The water hyacinth, which is native to the Amazon River, has been introduced to freshwater ecosystems onseveral continents, including Africa and North America. It grows on the surface ofwater, blocking light, decreasing oxygen levels, and changing water chemistry (Gopal, 1987). Entire food webs have been altered as a result, and fish populations have been re-duced or eliminated in some areas (Gowanloch, 1945; Timmer and Weldon, 1967). Inthe United States, water hyacinth has spread to rivers, lakes and lagoons throughout thecountry, forming dense mats that block canals and drainage pipes, prevent swimmingand boating, and impair waterway navigation (Buker, 1982). In Lake Victoria, water hy-acinth \"hot spots\" have persisted near areas of urban, industrial, and agricultural pollu-tion, despite efforts to eradicate the floating vegetation (Lake Victoria EnvironmentalManagement Project, 2003) POLLUTION Freshwater ecosystems are polluted by a variety of human activities, from large-scaleagriculture and industry to everyday behaviors, such as driving cars and fertilizinglawns. Large quantities of pollution often enter freshwater systems from point sources,such as industrial or municipal sewage outflows; for example, 23.4 billion tons ofsewage and industrial waste was dumped into the Yangtze River in 2001, threateninghuman health and the survival of the endangered Yangtze River dolphin (Young, 2002).Thus, the focus on protecting water quality in many countries has been on preventingpoint source pollution (i.e. U.S. Clean Water Act of 1972). However, nonpoint sourcepollution is far more significant in many cases. Airborne pollutants can enter the atmos-phere and travel long distances, entering lakes and waterways in otherwise pristine loca-tions. Pollutants dissolved in runoff from the surrounding landscape may account for thegreatest source of pollution in many freshwater ecosystems\u2014for example, it has beenestimated that 80% of the nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) that pollute U.S. water-ways derive from nonpoint sources such as agricultural and urban runoff (Shaw and Raucher, 1993). NUTRIENT POLLUTION Runoff from fertilizers used in commercial agriculture or private yards adds largeamounts of nitrogen and phosphorus to freshwater ecosystems. This can be especiallyproblematic in lowland areas and in lakes or rivers with developed shores. The addednutrients lead to excess growth of algae (which is sometimes toxic), resulting in reducedwater clarity and light penetration. Because of this increased primary productivity, the activity of decomposing, oxygen-consuming bacteria increases and oxygen levels de-cline. Shifts in the food web and alterations in bottom-water habitat can lead to changesin species composition and distribution. For example, the density, distribution and rela-tive abundance of aquatic plants can change after eutrophication (Schmieder, 1997), andvaluable fish species are often replaced by less desirable fauna that can tolerate low oxy-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 181 CHAPTER 7 Freshwatergen levels (Egerton, 1987). Natural eutrophication is a normal state in the succession of lakes as they age, but polluted runoff has led to early eutrophication and changes in thecommunity structure of many naturally oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) lakes. TOXIC POLLUTION Toxic pollution in freshwater ecosystems can devastate local biota and endanger human food sources. Most toxic pollution derives from industry (i.e. dioxin, PCBs) or agricul-ture (pesticides such as DDT and toxaphene). Heavy metals, such as arsenic, zinc, sele-nium, and mercury are also released from mining and other industrial activities. Heavymetals and toxic compounds can become volatized in warmer parts of the globe, enterthe atmosphere, and re-condense in cooler areas, often contaminating pristine sites andindigenous food supplies (Dewailly et al., 1989; Kidd et al., 1995; Wania and Mackay,1993). These pollutants cause massive mortality events, such as fish kills, and are foundin concentrations considered unsafe for human consumption in many aquatic animals,such as freshwater mussels (Lau et al., 1998). Because many pollutants accumulate infatty tissues, they are magnified in the food chain and can reach concentrations in fish- eating birds and mammals that are up to 10 million times higher than those found in pol-luted water (Schindler et al., 1995). Acid rain containing high levels of sulfuric and nitric acids is also a serious threat to many freshwater ecosystems, particularly lakes at high altitudes and latitudes. Thesepollutants enter the air mainly through the burning of fossil fuels, are transported at-mospherically to distant parts of the globe, and are finally released into freshwaterecosystems through precipitation. In lakes susceptible to acidification (where acids arenot readily neutralized by the soil or water), lake pH is lowered dramatically, andspecies composition and abundance can change as a result (Schindler et al., 1985;Wright and Schindler, 1995). LAND USE Destructive land use practices that result in vegetation loss anywhere within thedrainage basin of a river can have negative impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Theforests and native plant communities surrounding lakes, rivers, and wetlands help pro-tect water quality and quantity by filtering and storing runoff. Changes in land usebrought about by agriculture and urbanization (such as deforestation, chemical fertiliza-tion, and paving) lead to increased runoff with higher levels of nutrients and other pol-lutants. In addition, more sediments are washed into the system and water turbidityrises, with negative impacts on fish, filter feeders, aquatic plants, and bacteria (Baron etal., 2003; Megahan et al., 1992). The vegetation immediately surrounding water bodies (i.e. riparian or floodplain vege- tation) is particularly important to freshwater ecosystem health, as it shades water bod-ies (regulating water temperatures and providing thermal refugia) and supplies organicmaterial such as falling leaves, insects, and woody debris to freshwater systems. The de-forestation of Amazonian floodplains is considered to be one of the major forces behindWWF 182the decline of Amazonian fisheries, as deforestation in these seasonally flooded areas has led to massive erosion, increased sediment load, and a decrease in large, woody de-bris in the river (Goulding et al., 1996). Although its function has not been studied ex-tensively in tropical rivers, large, woody debris has been shown to play numerous im-portant roles in temperate river systems, including altering flow to create habitatheterogeneity (i.e. stepped channels and deep pools) and helping to determine riverchannel form and stability. Woody debris also has a long residence time in most waterbodies, and provides substrate, food, and shelter for a wide range of plants and animals(Bilby and Bisson, 1998; Petts, 2000). OVEREXPLOITATION Fish and shellfish harvests have declined sharply in the last few decades, and in manycases this decline is due to commercial or recreational overexploitation of these re-sources (Naiman et al., 1995). Overharvesting of aquatic species has occurred repeated-ly in freshwater ecosystems throughout the world, in part because high levels of naturalpopulation variability can mask the effects of overexploitation until population declinesare severe and irreversible (Ludwig et al., 1993). Attempts to bolster declining popula-tions, such as with the release of hatchery fish, often exacerbate the problem (Hilborn,1992; Meffe, 1992). Species inhabiting lakes can be particularly vulnerable to overex-ploitation in areas where there is not continual recruitment from populations outside thelake (Abell et al., 2002). Hunting or extermination of mammals associated with freshwater ecosystems (i.e. beavers, muskrats) can affect not only the biological community, but also the physicalstructure of freshwater ecosystems, as the activities of some species lead to flooding andthe creation of important wetland habitats. Hunting in tropical rivers and floodplains canadd additional pressure to endangered species such as manatees, turtles, river otters andcaiman (Junk, 2002). EXPOSURE TO ULTRAVIOLET-B RADIATION Exposure to high levels of Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation can have a range of harmfuleffects on living organisms, and damage to the ozone layer has caused an increase inUV-B radiation of up to 50% in some alpine areas (Schindler et al., 1996). Although theozone layer protects both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems from much of the sun's UV-B radiation, some aquatic animals may be more vulnerable to the radiation that reachesthe Earth's surface because they have historically been afforded a high level of protec-tion by natural characteristics of the waters they inhabit (Williamson, 1995). UV-B radi-ation generally only penetrates the top layer of water bodies; the depth of UV-B pene-tration depends on water clarity and on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon(DOC) and/or chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which are derived fromthe breakdown of plant materials or dead organisms. Animals living in clear or shallow bodies of water, those that are sessile or can't sense UV-B radiation, and those that are restricted to the upper layer of water during the day-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 183 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterWWF 184 time (i.e. small zooplankton taking refuge from downward migrations of predators) may be particularly vulnerable to increases in UV-B radiation (Williamson, 1995). Primaryproductivity has decreased as a result of increased UV-B radiation in some cases, but pro-ductivity could also increase, depending on whether the system is nutrient or grazer-lim-ited (Williamson, 1995). Many vertebrates, including amphibians, lay transparent eggswith little UV-B protection in bodies of water (Hansen et al., 2002). UV-B radiation canreduce hatching success, retard larval growth rates, and cause morphological abnormali-ties in amphibians, and increased exposure to UV-B has been implicated as a possiblefactor in (although not the sole cause of) recent worldwide declines in amphibian popula- tions (Blaustein et al., 1996; Blaustein and Wake, thedanger radiation in freshwater ecosystems remains site-specific; for example,85% of the potential amphibian breeding sites sampled in the U.S. Pacific Northwest areprotected by naturally-occurring levels of DOC in the water (Palen et al., 2002). The threat of UV-B exposure may be magnified by other human-induced stresses. For example, CDOM derived from healthy, forested drainage basins is far more effective at attenuating UV-B than colorless DOC from other sources (Schindler et al., 1996), anddeforestation decreases the input of CDOM to freshwaters. In addition, acidification of lakes causes a decline in DOC concentrations, and thus UV-B radiation may actuallybe responsible for many of the negative effects attributed to lake acidification (Schindleret al, 1996). Anticipated and Observed Effects of Climate Change on Freshwater Ecosystems Human activities within the last century have led to a dramatic rise in atmospheric con- centrations of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect.Within the next century, carbon dioxide concentrations are expected to at rise to levels at least twice as high as those present in pre-industrial times, and global climate is expect-ed to change in a number of ways as a result. This climate change will primarily affectfreshwater ecosystems through changes in water temperature, quantity, and quality(Shuter and Meisner, 1992), as well as through changes in the timing and duration offlows. Some of the expected physical and biological effects of climate change will affectall freshwater ecosystems, while others are specific to rivers, lake or wetlands. PHYSICALEFFECTS COMMON TO ALLFRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS TEMPERATURE CHANGES There is widespread consensus that the greenhouse effect will lead to a global rise in airtemperature, with mean surface temperatures increasing 1.5 to 5.8 \u00b0C by the year 2100(Houghton et al., 2001). Temperatures are expected to increase more at higher latitudes,and in many of these regions the effects of global warming have already been docu-mented; in Canada, mean air temperatures, water temperatures, and evaporation have allincreased in the past 20-30 years (Schindler, 2001), and ice cover durations over lakesand rivers have decreased over the entire northern hemisphere by almost 20 days sincethe mid-1800's (Magnuson et al., 2000).BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 185 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterHowever, in most cases, the effects of global warming on air and water temperatures are likely to be far more complicated that a gradual increase in average temperatures. Inmany regions, daily minimum air temperatures have increased more than daily maxi-mum temperatures, leading to a reduction in the diurnal temperature range (Easterling etal., 1997). Both observational studies and models of future climate change suggest thatthere will be more hot summer days and fewer cold waves (Easterling et al., 2000). Re-gionally, temperatures are likely to become more variable, and this increased variability(i.e. a 1 \u00b0C increase in the standard deviation of temperature) will lead to a far greaterfrequency of extreme temperature events than a similar change in the mean temperaturewould (Meehl et al., 2000). Rising temperatures are generally expected to lead to an increase in glacial melting, al- though increased winter precipitation could compensate for ice loss in some areas (Ar-nell et al., 2001). Many simulations suggest that glacier melting will depend strongly onthe rate of temperature change; for example, Oerlemans et al. (1998) predicted that inthe absence of increased precipitation, a rise of 0.4 \u00b0C per decade would eliminate near-ly all of their study glaciers by 2100, while a rise of 0.1 \u00b0C per decade would only leadto a 10-20% loss of glacier volume. Tropical glaciers may be especially sensitive toglobal warming, as the equilibrium line between ice accumulation and melting is moresensitive to changes in air temperature (due to the lack of seasonality in tropical temper-atures), and because glacial melting is significant year-round (Kaser et al., 1996). PRECIPITATION CHANGES Since 1900, surface precipitation has generally increased in mid- and high-latitude areas,and decreased in the tropics and subtropics (Easterling et al., 2000). Current models ofglobal climate change suggest that annual precipitation is likely to increase further inhigh and mid-latitudes and most equatorial regions, but decrease in the subtropics (Carteret al., 2000). However, predicted regional changes in precipitation are far less certain, andin many areas, the size of predicted precipitation changes due to global warming aresmall compared to those due to natural multi-decadal variability (Arnell et al., 2001). However, even slight changes in average precipitation could lead to substantial increas- es in the variability of precipitation events; because the size of precipitation events is notnormally distributed about the mean, a change in average precipitation will also cause achange in variability (Meehl et al., 2000). Climate change models predict that globalwarming will generally lead to more extreme events, such as heavy 1-day and multi-day precipitation (Easterling et al., 2000), and an increase in the frequency of extreme rain-fall has been observed in the United States and the UK (Karl and Knight, 1998; Osborn et al., 2000). In addition, most countries that have experienced a significant increase ordecrease in precipitation also experienced a disproportionate change in the amount ofprecipitation falling during extreme precipitation events (Easterling et al., 2000). Tropi-cal storm intensity has increased, and is expected to increase further in some areas, suchas southwest Asia (Anderson et al., 2002), but in other areas tropical storm frequencyand intensity is expected to remain the same or decline (Easterling et al., 2000). WATER QUANTITY AND FLOW CHANGES Although precipitation is one of the main factors determining water availability and flow, other factors such as evaporation, soil moisture, groundwater recharge, and glacialand snowmelt are also critical. Evaporation is generally expected to increase due to in-creasing mean temperatures. However, the exact amount of evaporation that will occurat a given site is determined by a host of other factors, including soil characteristics, theamount of water available, vegetation cover, and plant transpiration (which is affectedby temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations; Arnell et al., 2001). Soilmoisture will depend on soil characteristics and the magnitude of local precipitationchanges, and soil infiltration and water-holding capacity will in turn determine the vol-ume of run-off. For example, drier soils often shows reduced water infiltration, and lessextreme freezing events can reduce water infiltration in limestone soils (Boix-Fayos et al., 1998); reduced water infiltration could lead to greater run-off and an increase inflooding events. Groundwater recharge is affected by both the amount of precipitationand the duration of the recharge season, as well as by evaporation and soil moisture (Ar-nell et al., 2001). Although climate change is likely to lead to some changes in ground-water recharge, freshwater ecosystems that primarily receive input from groundwater are likely to experience smaller changes in water temperature and quantity than thosedominated by precipitation. Water flows depend primarily on precipitation in tropical and arid regions. In tropical river systems, seasonal heavy rainfall events already surpass the natural infiltration ratesof soil, leading to high sediment input and dangerous levels of pesticide runoff fromagricultural lands (Pringle, 2000); increased extreme rainfall events in these areas couldlead to further water quality problems. In higher latitude regions, temperature changeswill affect water flow through changes in snowmelt and the form of falling precipitation.In large parts of eastern Europe, European Russia, central Canada, and California, amajor shift in streamflow from spring to winter has already been observed, because ele-vated temperatures cause precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow (Dettinger and Cayan, 1995; Westmacott and Burn, 1997). Similarly, glacier-fed rivers, lakes and wet-lands (in temperate and tropical regions) may experience increased flows due to glacialmelting, even in the absence of increased precipitation (Arnell et al., 2001). Many models predict that extreme water flow events such as floods are likely to in- crease, due to heavier individual rainfall events (Reynard et al, 1998) or increased over-all precipitation (Panagoulia and Dimou, 1997). Some models also predict seasonalshifts in peak flooding seasons (Saelthun et al., 1998). Finally, models of climate changesuggest that hydrological droughts should increase in frequency, but this has only beenobserved in some areas, such as Hungary and China (Easterling et al., 2000). The effectsof climate change on low flow conditions appear to be sensitive to the storage capacityof the system; basins with little groundwater storage capacity may experience more fre-quent droughts because they do not benefit as much from winter groundwater recharge(Arnell et al., 2001). WWF 186BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 187 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterWATER QUALITY CHANGES The input of chemicals, sediments, organic matter, nutrients and pollutants to freshwater ecosystems are all likely to be affected by climate change. Both simulations and directobservations indicate that increased precipitation can increase water alkalinity via en-hanced weathering and input of base cations to streams or lakes (Avila et al., 1996;Sommaruga-W\u00f6grath et al., 1997). Intense storm events following prolonged dry peri-ods can lead to increased flushing of sediments or nitrates into water bodies (Arnell etal., 2001). Rising temperatures and changes in precipitation are likely to cause changes in the bio- mass, production, and composition of terrestrial communities surrounding lakes, riversand wetlands (Carpenter et al., 1992). These changes may affect the supply of organicmatter to freshwater systems, shading and light (including UV-B) penetration, as well asthe characteristics of runoff entering the system (i.e. DOC and nutrient concentrations,sediment load). Rising temperatures and evaporation may cause an increase in fires insome regions (this has been documented already in Canada; Schindler et al., 1990).Fires in regions surrounding water bodies could lead to increased nutrient input (fromburnt vegetation) leading to eutrophication, increased sediment load, reduced input of organic matter (DOC, woody debris), and reduced protection from winds. Water pollution could be affected in many ways by climate change. Increased volatiliza- tion of pesticides, PCBs, and heavy metals in warm and warming regions with conden-sation elsewhere will lead to increased pollutant loads in water bodies at higher latitudesand altitudes. Increased runoff could lead to increased pollution from agricultural andurban sources, while decreased water levels could lead to concentration of pollutantsfrom point sources and the atmosphere (Schindler, 2001). Increased glacial melt hasbeen shown to increase the concentrations of pollutants in glacial-fed streams and lakesby releasing organic pesticides and PCBs deposited in glacial ice during earlier decadeswhen pollution levels were higher (Blais et al., 2001). INCREASING HUMAN WATER NEEDS AND EXTRACTION Rising air temperatures and evaporation are likely to contribute to increasing humanwater use and water shortages. By far, the largest proportion of current and predicted fu- ture water use is for agricultural irrigation; in 1995, 67% of all water withdrawals and79% of all water consumed worldwide was used for agriculture, whereas municipal, ordomestic, use represents only about 9% of withdrawals (Arnell et al., 2001). Based on predicted population increases and development scenarios, water withdrawals are expected to increase 23-49% over 1995 levels by the year 2025 (Raskin et al., 1997).Municipal water withdrawals may be offset by declining per capita usage in some coun-tries, and increases in water usage by the industrial sector in developing countries (par-ticularly in Asia and Latin America) may be partially ameliorated by greater industrialefficiency (Arnell et al., 2001). Agricultural water usage, on the other hand, is expectedto increase due to higher evaporation rates and because larger areas of land are likely to be under cultivation (to feed an growing human population). Areas where agriculture ac-counts for a large portion of the GNP and water is already scarce (i.e. many Africancountries) are likely to be hardest hit by climate-associated water shortages (Smith andLenhart, 1996). Alterations in the way that water is priced (i.e. reducing agriculturalwater subsidies) could play an important role in promoting more efficient water use and thus decreasing human water needs and extraction. BIOLOGICALCHANGES COMMON TO ALLFRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS EFFECTS ON PHYSIOLOGY AND LIFE HISTORY Temperature change alone is known to affect a range of physiological processes and life history traits. Higher ambient temperatures increase the metabolic demands of many an-imals; for example, even at sub-lethal temperatures, warming would lead to a several-fold increase in the energy requirements of lake trout (Salvelinus nomaycush) (McDon- ald et al., 1996). The effects of higher metabolism on growth may depend on foodavailability. In zooplankton with an adequate food supply, increased temperatures lead to a dramatic rise in feeding, assimilation, growth, and reproductive rates (Schindler,1968), and local species richness can increase as a result (Stemberger et al., 1996). In-creased temperatures can also lead to a rise in the frequency of toxic algal outbreaks,and in their toxicity to other animals (Hallengraeff, 1993). Temperature affects body size in many aquatic animals; increased rearing temperature causes a reduction in body size at a given developmental stage in over 90% of cold-blooded, aquatic animals studied (Atkinson, 1995). Temperature also determines the sexof offspring in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and several groups of turtles (Conover, 1984). In one population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), off- spring sex was shown to be highly correlated with mean July air temperatures; statisticalanalyses indicate that a 2 \u00b0C rise in air temperatures would drastically skew sex ratios,and a 4 \u00b0C rise would virtually eliminate all males from the population (Janzen, 1994).The phenology, or timing of life history events, is also affected by ambient temperature;for example, breeding migrations and spawning dates have begun to occur earlier in sev-eral species of amphibians as a result of climate warming (Beebee, 1995). Life history traits are intricately linked with water quantity and seasonal flow in numer- ous aquatic animals. In tropical rivers, many fish undergo feeding and spawning migra-tions of several thousand kilometers that are dependent on predictable, seasonal floodingevents (Junk, 2002), and extreme flow levels may be necessary for maintaining popula- tions of a number of other species (Poff and Ward, 1989; Poff et al., 1997). On the otherhand, intense flooding can scour streambeds, displacing organic matter, bottom-feedingorganisms, and small fish fry, and substantial increases in flood frequency could cause ashift in species composition, possibly eliminating many species (Poff et al., 1997). The timing and duration of the breeding season in wading birds that frequent freshwater wetlands is strongly tied to water levels (Butler and Vennesland, 2000), and could be af-WWF 188fected by either increases or decreases in precipitation and water table levels. Frogs are particularly sensitive to decreased precipitation; low precipitation in Puerto Rico hasbeen correlated with drastic declines in frog populations (Stewart, 1995), and the ex-tinctions of four frog species in Costa Rican cloud forests have been linked to a series ofsevere population declines following extreme El Ni\u00f1o-associated droughts (Pounds etal., 1999). Some inhabitants of seasonal wetlands, such as fairy shrimp, are entirely de-pendent on precipitation-filled, ephemeral vernal pools to complete short, highly-spe-cialized life cycles (Eriksen and Belk, 1999). EFFECTS ON COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND DYNAMICS Climate warming is likely to alter the composition of many communities, as differentspecies will have different thermal tolerances and interactions between species may in-tensify as a result of reduced resources and habitat availability. In algae, thermal toler-ance can affect the outcome of competition for nutrients and alter community composi-tion (Rhee and Gotham, 1981). Where water levels or the size of suitable thermalhabitats decrease, biotic interactions (including human overexploitation) may intensifyas a result of increased densities of aquatic animals. For example, caddisfly competitionin streams that is usually limited to the summer season persisted year-round in yearswhen drought eliminated normal winter density reductions (Feminella and Resh, 1990).Climate change may affect motile vs. non-motile species differently, leading to differ-ences in species distribution; in the marine intertidal zone, vertical distribution of ma-rine invertebrates is tightly correlated with temperature, whereas the distribution ofmotile species is not (Huey et al., 2002). In temperate or high-elevation tropical systems, where water temperatures are currently cool, climate warming is expected to facilitate the spread and establishment of non-na-tives, especially those from warmer climates (Stachowicz et al., 2002). Once thermal bar-riers to invasion are removed, native species may be displaced by invaders with a com-petitive advantage, such as warmwater, omnivorous fish with fast life cycles (Carpenter etal., 1992). Natural high flows help minimize the success of non-native fish by removingspecies that are poorly adapted to dynamic river environments; the restriction of floodingby reservoirs has already helped facilitate the proliferation of exotic fish in many riversystems (Baron et al., 2003). Reduced flooding due to climate change could similarlyallow non-native fish to become established in areas where the current flow regimewould otherwise exclude them. Several species of exotic marine invertebrates may bene- fit from warming temperatures at higher latitudes, as earlier recruitment in warmer years helps them gain a competitive advantage over native species (Stachowicz et al., 2002); asimilar breeding strategy may be present in invasive freshwater invertebrates. Migration may be the only option for many animals that cannot adapt to increasing tem- peratures. During past eras of climate change, most plants and animals displayed rangeshifts, rather than morphological change, in response to changing environmental condi-tions (Noss, 2001). However, the rate of warming expected in the next 100 years is overten times higher than warming after the last ice age (De Groot and Ketner, 1994), and itBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 189 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterWWF 190 is unknown whether plants and animals will be able to migrate quickly enough to keep up with climate change (Malcolm and Markham, 2000). Meta-analyses indicate thathundreds of plant and animal populations have already shown highly significant, non-random changes in range boundaries, in the direction expected to result from climatechange (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003), and temperature is known to the affect geographicdistribution of fish, diatoms, and other aquatic animals (Meisner and Shuter, 1992;Reynolds, 1984). Unfortunately, the ability of many freshwater species to migrate is restricted by bodies of water that preclude migration or that don't allow movement in the correct direction.Migration is impossible from many isolated lakes and wetlands, and numerous majorriver systems run from east to west, precluding latitudinal migration. In the southwestand southern Great Plains (USA), nearly all major river systems run from east to west,and these systems contain some of the hottest free-flowing water on Earth. Many nativespecies in these areas are already living near their thermal tolerance limits, and the com-bination of increased warming and the lack of northern migration routes could cause ex-tinctions of up to 20 species of endemic fish (Matthews and Zimmerman, 1990). Even where migration is possible, it is unlikely that entire communities and ecosystems will be transplanted intact. Species differ in their levels of tolerance of environmentalchange, and in their abilities to adapt or migrate in response. Differences in sensitivity totemperature change are likely to alter community dynamics. For example, communitiescomposed of several species of Drosophila that were allowed to migrate between different thermal habitats did not simply shift to new zones when temperatures were increased tosimulate global warming (Davis et al., 1998). Interactions between species and with para-sites introduced to the system altered the relative abundance of species in different thermalzones in ways that were non-intuitive and difficult to predict. Thus, simple \"climate map-ping\", or assuming that species range boundaries will shift smoothly with changes in tem-perature, oversimplifies the effects that climate change may have on communities. EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON LAKES PHYSICAL EFFECTS ON LAKES Increased mean surface temperatures are likely to lead to increased water temperaturesand evaporation in many lakes, in both temperate and tropical areas (Schindler, 2001;Zinyowera et al., 1998). If precipitation does not increase enough to compensate, thiscould lead to reductions in outflow and/or lake volume. Important spawning and rearinghabitat near the edges of lakes (Tyedmers and Ward, 2001) would be lost if lake levelsdeclined, and lake characteristics based on water outflow could change dramatically.Lakes that currently supply outflow to downstream systems may become endorheic(with no outflow), and endorheic freshwater lakes may become saline (Schindler, 2001).The African Great Lakes are particularly sensitive to climatic effects on outflow, as cur-rent outflow is small (i.e. only 6% of water input to Lake Tanganyika leaves as riverineoutflow), and even minor declines in precipitation (10-20%) are expected to completelyclose these basins (Bootsma and Hecky, 1993). Changes in mean air temperatures have been shown to increase water temperatures in both temperate and tropical lakes, resulting in a range of physical and biological effects.Water temperatures in Lake Tanganyika, a deep tropical lake in East Africa, have risen by 0.2 \u00b0C at the lake bottom and 0.9 \u00b0C at 100 meters since 1913 (Verburg et al., 2003).Although the resulting change in the temperature gradient is relatively small, the verti-cal gradient in water density (which depends on temperature) has tripled. This sharp-ened density gradient has reduced annual mixing, which normally supplies nutrientsfrom decomposition on the lake bottom to surface waters. The lack of nutrients in theupper layers of the lake has led to a 70% reduction in primary productivity since 1975and an increase in water clarity and light penetration (Verburg et al., 2003). Temperate lakes display sharper thermal gradients and larger seasonal changes in water temperature than tropical lakes. Lakes at higher latitudes and altitudes currently experi-ence seasonal thermal stratification, in which they are covered by ice in the winter (withcool, relatively constant temperatures below), and develop a thermal gradient (thermo-cline) in the summer as surface waters warm up. Increased ambient temperatures haveled to an earlier onset of thermal stratification, longer ice-free periods, and deeper ther-moclines (thus smaller bottom layers) in many temperate lakes (Schindler et al., 1990).In addition, longer periods of thermal stratification with little vertical mixing results inreduced oxygen concentrations near the bottom of lakes. Lake chemistry may be affected by climate change in a number of ways. Drought and decreased groundwater flow may make some lakes more susceptible to acidification, asgroundwater often contains acid-neutralizing chemicals important to lake buffering(Schindler, 2001). However, the overall pH and chemical balance of lakes may be af-fected by temperature and precipitation changes in ways that are site-specific and diffi-cult to predict; a number of European alpine lakes that experienced a 1 \u00b0C increase intemperature over 10 years actually displayed an increase in pH, as well as trends in sul-fate and nitrogen concentrations that were opposite to trends in atmospheric deposition of these compounds (Sommaruga-W\u00f6grath et al., 1997). These changes are most likelyexplained by increased biological activity and enhanced weathering of surrounding sub- strates due to high precipitation. Concentrations of colored DOC, which derives from surrounding vegetation and pro- vides the greatest protection from UV-B radiation, has been shown to decline in high lat-itude lakes as a result of climate warming, reduced streamflows, and lowered water ta-bles (Schindler et al., 1996). Lake acidification (which can itself be caused by climatechange) will exacerbate this effect (Schindler et al., 1996). Conversely, increased pre-cipitation should increase DOC concentrations, and vegetation shifts due to climatewarming (such as altitudinal shifts in the tree line) may protect higher lakes by increas- ing DOC concentrations (Palen et al., 2002). Finally, the physical effects of climate change on temperate lakes can be synergistic and complex. For example, lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area in the boreal forests ofBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 191 CHAPTER 7 Freshwaternorthwestern Ontario experienced an average increase in air temperature of 2 \u00b0C over 20 years (Schindler et al., 1990). This resulted in an increase in mean and maximum watertemperatures, an ice-free period that was 20 days longer, and an 30% increase in evapo-ration. The area experienced below-average precipitation and reduced runoff into lakes.More frequent fires caused a rise in nutrient input, which combined with higher temper-atures to increase phytoplankton abundance and diversity. Reduced terrestrial input tothe lakes (because of fires and clear-cutting) reduced DOC concentrations and led toclearer lakes with less protection against UV-B radiation. Increased solar penetrationand higher winds (due to the loss of trees) led to deeper thermoclines and a reduction inbottom habitat (Schindler et al., 1990). BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON LAKES Although the effects of climate warming on the biotic communities of tropical lakes hasreceived little attention, large decreases in primary productivity due to climate warming(Verburg et al., 2003) are likely to have a significant impact on the rest of the food chain.In temperate lakes, the radical physical changes in lake chemistry and thermal stratifica-tion resulting from climate change can have a range of effects on biological communi-ties. As temperate freshwater fisheries play an important economic role in many coun-tries, a great deal of research into the effects of climate change on freshwaterecosystems has focused on temperate freshwater fish. Temperate fish can be divided into three major guilds according to their \"fundamental thermal niche\", or the temperature at which the choose to spend most of their time andat which they experience optimal growth, activity levels and swimming performance(Shuter and Meisner, 1992): coldwater fish such as salmon and trout (with an optimaltemperature around 15 \u00b0C), coolwater fish such as perch (with an optimal temperaturearound 24 \u00b0C), and warmwater fish such as carp and catfish (with an optimal tempera-ture around 28 \u00b0C). Seasonal thermal stratification in lakes allows all three guilds to co-exist because of variations in life history strategies (Shuter and Meisner, 1992). In the winter, cool- and warmwater fish are inactive, and cold water fish are active but experience little growth. Temperatures are optimal and growth rates highest for coldwater fish in the spring and fall, while the summer is optimal for cool- and warmwater fish. During the summer, the upper layers of the lake become too hot for coldwater fish and they are restricted to thecooler bottom layer, where oxygen levels are low and competition for food is fierce. Because climate warming leads to longer periods of thermal stratification, coldwater fish will be restricted to these bottom layers for longer periods of time, and deeper ther- moclines brought about by climate change may reduce the area of bottom layers andfurther intensify competition for food (Shuter and Meisner, 1992). Climate change mayalso lead to shorter spring and fall seasons, when temperatures are optimal for coldwa-ter fish. An overall rise in water temperatures will lead to increased metabolic demands,but coldwater fish will generally have reduced access to prey. Warmer temperatures mayWWF 192make winter slightly more favorable, but not enough to compensate for losses during other seasons (Shuter and Meisner, 1992). Overall, coldwater fish are likely to experi-ence decreased growth rates and increased heat mortality (Tyedmers and Ward, 2001). Some populations may be able to adapt to thermal changes; a shift in preferred temper- ature from 15 \u00b0C to 20-21 \u00b0C has been observed in one population of lake trout (Salveli-nus namaycush) in Canada (Sellers et al., 1998), and other populations of coldwater fishdisplay adaptive behavior, in which they spend most of their time in coldwater refugiabut make occasional feeding forays into warmer water (Snucins and Gunn, 1995). How- ever, the majority of coldwater fish populations are likely to experience range shifts, with contractions near the low-latitude and low-altitude limits of their current range, andexpansions to higher latitudes if migration is possible. Suitable habitat for coldwater fish in the continental United States may decline by as much as 50% (Eaton and Scheller, 1996), and range contractions of coldwater species could eliminate some of theworld's most valuable fisheries (Schindler et al., 1990). Conversely, however, climate warming and changes in thermal stratification may have positive effects on cool- and warmwater species, reducing winter kills, lengthening thegrowth season, and increasing available habitat, both locally and regionally, if polewardmigration is possible (Shuter and Meisner, 1992). If lakes are not nutrient-limited, pro-ductivity is likely to increase (due to increased primary productivity and growth rates);overall fish catch may increase, but there are likely to be changes in the relative abun- dance of fish species (Tyedmers and Ward, 2001). Finally, although most studies examine the effects of climate change on only a few species of fish, negative effects on one species can have an impact on the entire community. Forexample, a summer kill of planktivorous herring in a Wisconsin (USA) lake reduced pre- dation on zooplankton by 50%, which led to an increase in large zooplankton and intensi-fied zooplankton grazing, causing a substantial reduction in phytoplankton abundance (Kitchell, 1992). In addition, while many studies concerning lake water level focus on theeffects of declining levels, rising water levels due to regional or seasonal increases in pre-cipitation could also have negative impacts. In Lake Baikal, for example, the constructionof a dam along with increased precipitation led to a 1.5 m rise in the level of the lake, anda subsequent decline in fish biodiversity and production (Izrael et al., 1992). EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON RIVERS The effects of climate change on rivers are likely to vary widely depending on latitude.Temperate rivers, like temperate lakes, will be affected primarily by temperature changes, while changes in precipitation timing and quantity could have dramatic effectson tropical rivers. PHYSICAL EFFECTS ON RIVERS Increases in air temperature will strongly influence water temperature in many rivers(particularly smaller rivers and streams) because the surface to volume ratio of rivers isBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 193 CHAPTER 7 Freshwaterhigh (Tyedmers and Ward, 2001). Increasing air temperatures will result in warmer water throughout rivers, from the headwaters to the mouth, as well as reduced oxygen levels. Rivers that are fed primarily by groundwater will be buffered against increasingseasonal variability in temperature (as groundwater temperature generally equals aver-age annual air temperature), and may serve as thermal refugia in some areas, supplyingrelatively cooler water during hot seasons and warmer water during cold seasons. Temperate rivers experience seasonal thermal cycles similar to temperate lakes, with uniform cold temperatures in winter (sometimes accompanied by ice cover) and longi-tudinally stratified temperatures in summer, with lower temperatures at groundwater-fedheadwaters and higher temperatures downstream (Shuter and Meisner, 1992). High lati-tude rivers are already experiencing shorter periods of ice cover and earlier ice break-up(Magnuson et al., 2000), and many of the beneficial functions of ice jams (river scour-ing, changes in river channel morphology, flooding of riverine wetlands) may be com-promised. Flow regime is a critical component of river ecosystems. Mean flow may increase or de- crease depending on changes in average precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture, andgroundwater recharge, but seasonal shifts in flow may be more significant to freshwaterecosystems (Carpenter et al., 1992). Many rivers will experience altered timing or dura-tion of high and low flows due to changes in seasonal variability of precipitation, fre-quency of extreme precipitation events, and timing of snowmelt. Spring snowmelts arelikely to occur earlier due to warming, and winter flows are likely to increase in areaswhere winter precipitation falls as rain instead of snow. A shift in peak flows fromspring/summer to winter will reduce the cooling effect of snowmelt on summer rivertemperatures (Tyedmers and Ward, 2001). Where precipitation increases, stream flows may increase in volume and floods may be- come more frequent. Extreme flooding events and landslides could remove importantwoody debris from rivers and destabilize river channels (Carpenter et al., 1992). Where precipitation decreases, stream flow volume may also decrease, and reductions in runoffwill lower the concentrations of DOC and organic matter in rivers. Increased evapora-tion could also lead to reduced streamflow, even in the absence of precipitation changes.Summer and ephemeral streams in arid regions (which provide critical habitat for manyanimals) are more vulnerable to drying up. A reduction in natural flooding events couldeliminate many of the beneficial physical effects of seasonal flooding, such as creatingfloodplain habitat, displacing exotic plants, and determining river channel form. BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON RIVERS In tropical rivers, variations in air and water temperature are generally small, and watertemperature is mainly regulated by shade and rainfall, rather than by cool groundwaterrefugia. The rainy and dry seasons of the tropics lead to large, predictable seasonal vari-ations in precipitation and annual flooding of adjacent grasslands and forests, whichprovide abundant food and breeding grounds for fish. Thus, the life histories of tropicalWWF 194river fish are more strongly affected by changes in water level than by changes in tem- perature (Meisner and Shuter, 1992). As the rainy season draws to a close and flood-plains dry up, members of the \"whitefish\" guild, who are sensitive to reduced oxygenlevels, retreat to the main river channel with the receding floodwaters. \"Blackfishes\",who are more tolerant of or adapted to low oxygen levels, remain in marginal floodplainhabitats that become disconnected from the river and may even dry up completely (Wel-comme, 1979). Some of these species, such as the lungfishes, are able to aestivate (co-coon in the mud) and breathe air when their water supply evaporates. Climate change may affect the both the timing and extent of flooding in tropical rivers, although these effects are currently difficult to predict and will vary regionally. Accord-ing to some estimates, the tropics will experience the smallest change in temperature,but the largest changes in precipitation, with rainfall becoming more variable, both within and between years (Houghton et al., 2001). Changes in floodplain dynamics willdirectly affect fish populations and fisheries yield, as growth rates and overall fish catchis correlated with the area of flooded land (Meisner and Shuter, 1992; Welcomme andHagborg, 1977). Fish communities in temperate rivers will experience effects similar to those in temper- ate lakes. Coldwater fish that are restricted to cool refugia at headwaters during the sum-mer will experience increased competition, reduced growth, and possible range shifts(Shuter and Meisner, 1992). Warmer water and decreased oxygen content at headwatersmay have negative impacts on eggs and larvae often placed there (Carpenter et al.,1992). Diadromous stocks that migrate long distances during the peak of summer mayexperience higher rates of pre-spawning mortality because of increased metabolic needs and disease outbreaks (Tyedmers and Ward, 2001). Even in stocks that do not performsummer migrations (such as the Adams River sockeye salmon) climate change is likelyto result in a net population decline due to reduced juvenile emergence, growth and sur-vival (Henderson et al., 1992). Some invertebrates in northern rivers require a prolongedperiod of exposure to nearly 0\u00baC water, followed by spring warming, in order for eggs tohatch. The release of warmer water in the winter from dams has resulted in massivelocal extinctions of invertebrates for tens of kilometers downstream (Lehmkuhl, 1974),and overall river warming would be expected to have a similar effect. EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON WETLANDS PHYSICAL EFFECTS ON WETLANDS Increased air temperatures are likely to have a drying effect on many wetlands, unlessincreased precipitation compensates for evaporation. Shallow and ephemeral habitats,such as depressional wetlands (with no channelized flow in or out) or wetlands in aridareas could be lost entirely, especially if precipitation declines and groundwater is ex-tracted for human needs (Gitay et al., 2001). Overall, a drier climate is likely to lead tocontractions and loss of wetland habitat, as well as increased habitat fragmentation.Conversely, increased precipitation could lead to flooding, expansion and deepening ofwetland habitat, and increased connectivity. However, increased precipitation or ex-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 195 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterWWF 196 treme flooding may also lead to an increased input of sediment and pollutants, and could destroy some wetlands if vegetation or other important habitat features are completelysubmerged. Arctic and subarctic bogs located over permafrost could suffer dramatic changes in hy- drological regime if rising temperatures lead to permafrost melting and wetlanddrainage. Increased decomposition in thawed northern peat bogs, as well as the in-creased risk of catastrophic fires due to drier peat, could release large amounts of carbondioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to further global warming (Gorham, 1991) Coastal freshwater wetlands are particularly sensitive to extreme high tides resulting from an increase in storm frequency or magnitude; these high tides can carry salts inlandto salt-intolerant vegetation and soils, and could lead to the displacement of freshwaterflora and fauna by salt-tolerant species (Michener et al., 1997). Rising sea levels coulddestroy coastal freshwater wetland communities as saline water invades, especially ifthese communities cannot shift inland due to development or dikes (Tyedmers andWard, 2001). Salt water inundation of coastal freshwater wetlands is expected to cause significant loss of wetland habitat in Australia and elsewhere (Gitay et al., 2001). BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON WETLANDS Ephemeral, depressional wetlands, especially those in arid areas, often harbor rarespecies that would be lost if these areas dry up. For example, several endemic species offairy shrimp in California (USA) that are already severely threatened by habitat loss (Belk and Fugate, 2000) could disappear if reduced precipitation and increased evapora-tion eliminates their shallow, vernal pool habitats. Small, temporary wetlands are the most numerous types of wetlands in many land- scapes, and are often used by more species than permanent ponds (Gibbs, 1993; Seml-itsch et al., 1996; Semlitsch and Bodie, 1998). The drying and loss of wetlands wouldreduce not only the number and size of available ponds, but also increase inter-pond dis-tance (Gibbs, 1993; Semlitsch and Bodie, 1998), lowering the chances of amphibian re-colonization, since adult frogs are generally only capable of traveling 200-300 m (Sjo-gren, 1991; Skelly et al., 1999). Drying and loss of wetlands would also reduce habitatconnectivity on a regional scale, endangering migrating birds that depend upon a net-work of wetlands along their migration route (National Research Council, 1995). Wetlands in areas with increased precipitation might suffer fewer negative effects, and may even benefit from increased wetland area and connectivity. However, some rarespecies that are adapted to drier, ephemeral wetlands may not be able to compete withinvading species adapted to wetter habitats (National Research Council, 1995), andwading birds that require shallow water to feed may experience reduced access to feed- ing areas (Butler and Vennesland, 2000). Wetter, more permanent wetlands would sup-port more fish, which prey on vulnerable tadpoles and invertebrates that usually inhabitseasonal wetlands with less predation pressure (Semlitsch and Bodie, 1998).General Considerations for Designing and Managing Freshwater Reserves to Withstand Climate Change The likelihood that individual species or communities will be able to persist in the face of global climate change depends to a large degree on how resistant (able to withstandchange) and resilient (able to recover from change) they are (Noss, 2001). Because thereis still a great deal of uncertainty associated with climate change predictions (especiallypredictions of precipitation changes), and interactions between physical and biologicalfeatures of freshwater ecosystems can be complex and non-intuitive, focusing on increas-ing system resistance and resilience is a far better approach than trying to plan for a spe-cific set of predicted changes. Many common considerations in designing and managingecosystem reserves, such as preserving biodiversity and minimizing outside stresses, willalso help increase the resistance and resilience of communities to climate change. Addi-tional considerations that are unique to freshwater ecosystems will become increasinglyimportant in buffering systems against growing climatic and water extraction pressures. PRESERVE HABITAT HETEROGENEITYAND BIODIVERSITY Both species and habitat diversity increase resistance and resilience to climate change,as diversity provides a greater range of stress tolerances and adaptive options (Chapin etal., 1997). Diverse communities that have redundant species within functional groupsshould be more resistant to climate change because there are likely to be differences inenvironmental sensitivity among members within each group; functional group richnessalso appears to increase resistance to environmental change (Noss, 2001). High biodi-versity areas may also become important as sources for re-colonizing damaged sites or colonizing new ones as the effects of climate change become more severe (De Groot andKetner, 1994). In aquatic systems, high biodiversity is often found in older or isolated habitats, in sink- holes, caves or underground habitats, and in areas with high habitat heterogeneity\u2014especially dynamic habitats with seasonal changes in water level (i.e. river floodplainsof seasonal wetlands; Abell et al., 2002). Many of these areas also harbor rare species,such as endemic species that have evolved in and remain restricted to a particular habi-tat (i.e. communities of endemic cichlid fish in African rift lakes), relict species thatwere restricted to isolated habitats after previous range contractions (i.e. cold stenother-mic fish that were isolated to high latitude lakes after the last ice age), or species that arehighly adapted to unusual environments (i.e. cave-dwelling fish and invertebrates). Inprotecting some of these high biodiversity sites, rare or vulnerable species may also beprotected (often a primary consideration in reserve design). Protecting rare species, es-pecially those that are charismatic, can assist in drawing public attention and funding toconservation efforts, but strategies aimed solely at protecting one species may detractfrom the more desirable goals of protecting ecosystem function (Junk, 2002) and in-creasing resistance and resilience to climate change. Areas where natural physical barriers separate biota (i.e. impassable waterfalls), and transition zones between different habitats or ecosystems may also harbor high biodi-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 197 CHAPTER 7 Freshwaterversity (Abell et al., 2002). Protecting transitional zones has the added benefit of ac- commodating possible range shifts due to climate change, and can help preserve diversehabitat types. Protecting a variety of potential habitats may help increase resistance andresilience in vulnerable species; for example, protecting an array of natural ponds with awide range of sizes and hydroperiods will help ensure that amphibians have access tosuitable breeding sites regardless of climatic variation (Semlitsch, 2002). If possible,replicate sites of a particular habitat type should be protected to safeguard against thecomplete loss of critical species or communities if one site is damaged beyond repair byan extreme climatic event (Markham and Malcolm, 1996; Roberts et al., 2003). Although diverse communities may be more resistant and resilient to climate change, it is important that high biodiversity not be used as the sole criterion in selecting sites for con-servation. An equally important goal is protecting communities that perform valuable\"ecosystem services\" (Kareiva and Marvier, 2003), such as relatively low-diversity wet-lands that provide flood protection, water filtration and other services that are likely tobecome increasingly important as climate variability and extreme events increase. Pro-tecting sites with lower biodiversity also helps maintain functioning ecosystems overbroader regions of the globe, and preserves distinct evolutionary lineages that can pro-vide fuel for future evolutionary innovation (Kareiva and Marvier, 2003). Preserving sitesharboring high biodiversity can still be a valid conservation goal in many areas, and di-versity indices can be extremely useful in choosing between different sites withina habi- tat type (rather than using biodiversity indices as an absolute guide in choosing between different habitats). However, considering ecosystem services and other potentially bene-ficial features of low diversity sites is an important aspect of planning for climate change. PROTECT PHYSICALFEATURES RATHER THAN INDIVIDUALSPECIES Aquatic ecosystems differ from many other ecosystems in that they are usually gov- erned by \"bottom-up\" rather than \"top-down\" dynamics\u2014in other words, much ofecosystem function is determined by basic physical features such as water flow, channelmorphology, and nutrient balance, rather than by species assemblages (Moss, 2000).Protecting flow patterns, water quality, and water quantity will go a long way towardsprotecting biodiversity in freshwater habitats (Abell et al., 2002), whereas conservationefforts that focus solely on preserving particular species or groups of species withoutconsidering wider physical features of the system may be doomed to failure. In manycases, the function of a species in a freshwater ecosystem is actually more importantthan its identity; for example, plants are essential components of some aquatic habitats(i.e. floodplain vegetation and aquatic plants in shallow lakes), but the exact species ofplant may be less important than the physical features it provides (Moss, 2000). The physical features of rivers, lakes and wetlands are expected to undergo a number of changes as a result of climate warming and precipitation variability. Removing barriersto water flow, maintaining healthy, forested river basins, and reducing the input of nutri-ents and toxic substances will increase the likelihood that freshwater ecosystems will beable to adjust to climate change. For example, removing levees and other barriers to theWWF 198lateral expansion of rivers could prevent the loss of critical edge habitats and the species that depend on them, by allowing new floodplains to be established if average riverflows increase or extreme precipitation events become common. PRESERVE HABITAT CONNECTIVITYTO ALLOW ACCESS TO MIGRATION ROUTES AND THERMALREFUGIA Connectivity is an important feature of many freshwater ecosystems, as it can help pre- serve flow regimes, promote ecological integrity, and allow migrating animals to movebetween different habitats at various life history stages. Connectivity is important notonly between different freshwater habitats (i.e. between rivers, lakes, and wetlands), butalso along the length of rivers, and between freshwater habitats and subterranean sys-tems or groundwater sources (Abell et al., 2002). Maintaining connectivity will becomeeven more important in some areas as the effects of climate change increase, because connectivity may provide animals with access to thermal refugia, or allow them to mi-grate to more suitable habitats. Although some species may be able to adapt to climate change in their current habitats, warmer waters will force other species to move into cool, thermal refugia, where tem- peratures remain below their thermal tolerance limits and metabolic demands are lower.Many species (i.e. coldwater fish) already rely on thermal refugia at certain times of theyear, and these species are likely to become even more dependent on these refuges foryear-round survival. Headwaters of rivers and any areas where temperature-bufferedgroundwater enters a system should be protected, and vegetation over bodies of watershould be maintained to provide cooling. Maintaining or increasing connectivity be-tween cool refugia and the rest of an ecosystem should be considered, as this may helpprovide additional species with access to these areas. In many cases, where thermal refugia do not exist or other climate-related changes make an animal's environment uninhabitable, the only option may be migration to more suit-able habitats. Because migration of aquatic animals is already severely limited by the di-rection of connections between water bodies, preserving or improving the possible mi-gration corridors that do exist may be important in some cases. Rivers and other aquaticecosystems that allow movement in the north-south direction, as well as freshwater sys-tems spanning altitudinal gradients are particularly valuable migration corridors. In ad-dition, areas near the current range limit of species should be protected (in the directionof expected migration; Markham and Malcolm, 1996). Consideration should be given toprotecting areas that are currently not of interest, but that species are likely to migrateinto, or marginal habitats (i.e. areas that are too cold for most species) that are likely tobe improved by climate warming. Although maintaining connectivity between habitats and ecosystems may have a num- ber of beneficial effects in terms of allowing native species to adapt to climate change,the increasing threat of invasion by exotic species makes connectivity in aquatic systemsa more complicated issue. Because invasion by exotic species can potentially have dev-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 199 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterWWF 200 astating effects on ecosystems, the risks of invasion should be weighed on a site-by-site basis against the vulnerability of native populations to climate change, and the necessi-ty and feasibility of migration to other habitats. In cases where species are particularlysensitive to temperature changes and are likely to experience local extinctions due tothermal stress, and where migration corridors leading to more suitable habitats exist, thebenefits of connectivity may outweigh the risks of invasion. In other areas, however, therisks of invasion may be so severe that allowing one sensitive species to be lost would bepreferable to endangering the entire community. PROTECT SITES FROM HUMAN PRESSURES AND EXOTIC SPECIES Protecting reserves from outside stresses (particularly stresses that tend to reduce diver-sity) will become increasingly important as local climates become more variable, be-cause stressed systems display reduced resistance and resilience to change (Noss, 2001).Human stresses, such as overexploitation and poor land use practices, should be reducedas much as possible. In choosing between a group of candidate sites for new reserves, itmay sometimes be advisable to avoid sites that are already severely degraded or likely tobe subject to intense human pressure (Roberts et al., 2003), although restoration of someecosystem functions is possible. It is also critical to increase efforts to prevent access of invading species to reserves, and to eliminate or control harmful non-native species already present. Many systems arelikely to become more vulnerable to invasions, as thermal barriers that previously ex-cluded invaders will be removed, and communities that are already stressed by climatechange are invaded by warmer-adapted species (Carpenter et al., 1992; Schindler,2001). Even in sites that are well-protected from all other stresses, non-native speciescan wreak havoc on biological communities; for example, native fish populations in thepristine Blindekloof River in South Africa have been nearly devastated by invadinglargemouth bass (Skelton et al., 1995). Unfortunately, in some systems, preventing access of motile, invasive species may con- flict with the goal of maintaining connectivity to allow seasonal or climate-induced mi-grations. Isolating vulnerable habitats from other freshwater ecosystems may be feasi-ble in some cases, but building barriers that disrupt flow to prevent access of exoticspecies may do more harm than good. In cases where the risk of invasion is relativelylow and migration is important to resident species, maintaining current levels of con-nectivity while enacting careful monitoring of ecosystems (to allow early, aggressivemanagement responses to invaders) may be a suitable approach. MANAGE ENTIRE WATERSHEDS AND REGULATE EXTRACTIVE WATER USE Freshwater ecosystems are intricately connected to their drainage basins, and down-stream or lowland rivers, lakes and wetlands can be extremely sensitive to distant, up-stream disturbances. Deforestation, agriculture, and other pressures on terrestrial com-munities that drain into water bodies can alter the quality, quantity, and temperature ofwater in all freshwater systems downstream of the disturbance. BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 201 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterBecause freshwater ecosystems are so intricately connected to one another and to the terrestrial systems that surround them, common reserve considerations such as reservesize and buffer zones are less applicable. For example, Kruger National Park in SouthAfrica is a very large reserve that protects significant downstream portions of the riversthat flow though it; however, populations of several species of fish that are protectedwithin the park have declined as a result of upstream activities outside of the reserve(Skelton et al., 1995). Although reserve size and buffer zones may be applicable in lim-ited, small-scale cases (i.e. no-take fishing areas and buffer zones to protect seasonalbreeding grounds in Lake Tanganyika; Abell et al., 2002), protected habitat patches willgenerally provide only short-term solutions. Freshwater reserves will not be secure un-less upstream threats are removed by managing (or in rare cases protecting) the entiredrainage basin (Moss, 2000). Managing entire watersheds rather than simply protecting aquatic elements or habitat patches will become increasingly important as the effects of climate change intensifyand are magnified by interactions with human stresses. Human population growth islikely to lead to increased deforestation, agriculture, industrial development, and urban-ization within watersheds. Models of land use and climate change in South Africa pre-dict that abrupt, future changes in local land use will have a far greater impact on fresh-water hydrology than gradual effects of climate change (Schulze, 2000). Importantly, the stresses caused by these habitat alterations often exacerbate the effects of climatechange. For example, deforestation near freshwater ecosystems eliminates cooling, veg-etative cover over streams and reduces the input of large, woody debris. The loss ofshading further increases water temperatures that are already rising due to global warm-ing, and the lack of large, woody debris eliminate in-stream refugia. In addition, the lossof forest cover may lead to increased terrestrial and aquatic evaporation, and reducedsoil moisture and water infiltration. During heavy precipitation events, streams alreadyexperiencing unusually high flows would receive increased runoff due to low soil infil- tration, as well as increased inputs of sediments and pollutants. Perhaps even more important than projected increases in habitat alteration are the dra- matic projected increases in human water extraction. Population growth will lead to in-creased water extraction for agricultural irrigation, direct consumption, and industrialdevelopment. Increasing human water extraction is likely to be one of the primarystresses on freshwater ecosystems in coming years, and is expected to greatly outweighglobal warming in affecting water supply through at least 2025 (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al.,2000). Increasing human water demands on freshwater ecosystems that are particularlysensitive to climate change are likely to lead to more frequent water shortages and con-flicts over water use. For example, Egypt relies on the Nile river basin for over 95% ofits national water budget. Based on one scenario of global climate change, models pre-dict that a modest decline in precipitation (20%) and rise in air temperature (4\u00baC) wouldnearly halt flow of the Nile (98% flow reduction; Strzepek et al., 1996), and human de-mands would be likely to outweigh ecosystem needs in determining the fate of the re-maining water. Clearly, management schemes aimed at protecting freshwater ecosys-WWF 202 tems from climate change must take human water needs into account, and attempt to manage the timing and magnitude of water extractions. RESTORE DEGRADED SITES AND CONSIDER PERFORMING ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE-INDUCED THREATS Because freshwater ecosystems are strongly influenced by activities in the surrounding landscape and increasing amounts of water are being extracted for human needs, mostdrainage basins have already experienced some degree of degradation. Restoration ofdegraded sites holds great promise for freshwater ecosystems, in terms of both improv-ing the ecological integrity of damaged systems (thus increasing resistance and re-silience to future change), and providing tools to smooth the recovery of ecosystemsfrom future damage caused by climate change (McCarty and Zedler, 2002). Successfulrestoration techniques include neutralizing acidified lakes and rivers by applying lime(Schindler, 1997; Appleberg, 1998), and restoring the hydrology of wetlands by re-moving impediments to flow (Gilbert and Anderson, 1998). Exotic species such aspredatory game fish have been successfully removed from some freshwater systems(McNaught et al., 1999), but in many cases, controlling aquatic community composi-tion has proven difficult (McCarty and Zedler, 2002). All of the ecosystem problemsmentioned above could potentially be caused or exacerbated by climate change (i.e.lake acidification, changes in hydrology, invasions of exotic species), and lessonslearned from current restoration projects can help guide future responses to climatechange. However, it is important to keep in mind that restoration efforts are unlikely tobe successful after certain thresholds of damage have been crossed, such as the col-lapse of fisheries or permanent cultural eutrophication of lakes (McCarty and Zedler,2002). Rather than attempting to restore systems after they have already been degraded by cli- mate change, it may be possible to perform active interventions to ameliorate the effectsof climate change or to directly protect vulnerable species. Adding to water tables belowdrying wetlands or draining excess water from flooded habitats has been proposed (DeGroot and Ketner, 1994), and inter-basin transfers of water have been suggested as apossible adaptation to climate change in Africa and South America (Pringle, 2000;Smith and Lenhart, 1996). However, interbasin transfers result in the intermixing of di-verse faunal communities that were previously isolated, and may have unforeseen ef- fects on native communities (Davies et al., 2000). In addition, tropical rivers and lakes(for which many of these projects have been proposed) are particularly vulnerable to thenegative effects of interbasin transfers (Pringle, 2000). Flow conditions below damscould possibly be manipulated to relieve some of the negative effects of climate change,for example by releasing bursts of water to simulate flooding events (Middleton, 1999;Vaselaar, 1997) or releasing water from multiple reservoir layers to control temperature (McCarty and Zedler, 2002). However, although these actions may help alleviate someof the negative effects of climate change on systems already impacted by dams, erectingdams solely to control water flows would cause far more damage to the ecosystem thanthe original alteration in flow regime caused by climate change. BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 203 CHAPTER 7 FreshwaterSome of the more controversial suggestions put forward for helping species and com- munities adapt to climate change involve transplantation of animals. Although protect-ing severely threatened species ex situ(i.e. in zoos or aquaria) until a suitable habitat for reintroduction becomes available (Noss, 2001) is a sound idea, using artificially-aideddispersal to move aquatic creatures over watershed boundaries to cooler waters (Gitay etal., 2001) could lead to the extinction of existing fauna, as the transplanted specieswould be pre-adapted to warming waters and could have a range of unanticipated effects on the native community. Similarly, the often-devastating effects that non-native fish-eries stocking can have on native fauna would seem to make introducing better-adaptednon-native species to replace waning stocks (Gitay et al., 2001) a bad idea. Transplanti-ng vulnerable species to new, created habitats where no native community exists (i.e.uninhabited, enclosed basins) would eliminate the risk of damaging existing biotic com-munities (McCarty and Zedler, 2002), but creating functioning, self-sustaining ecosys-tems from scratch is likely to prove difficult. Re-introduction of species to their nativehabitat may be a useful approach in cases where an extreme weather event destroys ex-isting populations (De Groot and Ketner, 1994). USE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY Because many aspects of climate change are unpredictable and climatic variability islikely to increase, it is critical to maintain flexible conservation goals and strategies.Rather than striving to maintain current distributions of species and preserve currentecosystems, managers should allow for and even assist in the adaptation of species andcommunities. Static management practices with fixed policies designed to protect par-ticular species should be changed to adaptive management strategies aimed at protectingecosystem processes (Markham and Malcolm, 1996). Adaptive management is based upon the recognition that uncertainty is inherent in all natural processes, and the expectation that management practices will change over time(Parma et al., 1998). Passive adaptive management involves adjusting managementpractices based on what is learned from the results of past practices, but learning aboutthe underlying system is not an explicit goal. In contrast, active adaptive management issomewhat like performing a (hopefully) well-designed experiment; it involves formingmultiple hypotheses about how the system will respond (to climate change and/or man-agement practices), choosing strategies to systematically test and learn about the under-lying hypotheses, monitoring systems closely to evaluate responses, and adapting futuremanagement practices based on what was learned about the system. The rationale be-hind this approach is that we cannot hope to understand the complex systems we aresupposed to be managing without experimenting on them (Parma et al., 1998). Manage-ment practices in which a single (often arbitrary) strategy is chosen teach us little aboutthe underlying system, and it is often impossible to know exactly what aspects of thestrategy led to its ultimate failure or success. Obviously, there are some cases where experimenting with the response of a system is not an option; some strategies may be irreversible, or may be too risky if populations arealready endangered (Parma et al., 1998). However, adopting active adaptive manage- ment practices now, while the effects of global climate change are only beginning to befelt in many areas, may provide enough time to learn about the underlying processesgoverning how a particular system responds to change, and provide an understanding ofhow to best manage the system in the face of global climate change. Selecting and Implementing Adaptation Strategies for Your Particular Location The previous section illustrates some of the conflicts that may arise in choosing a man- agement strategy to sustain freshwater ecosystems in the face of global climate change.For example, should the focus be on protecting high-diversity sites that are more likely to be resistant to climate change, or on protecting low-diversity sites that performecosystem services that will become more valuable as climate change continues?Should connectivity between habitats be maintained or even increased to allow migra-tion, or should habitats be isolated to prevent invasion by exotic species? Applying ageneral list of conservation goals blindly to a freshwater ecosystem ignores the specificstrengths and weaknesses of the system, and does not account for the relative impor-tance of various threats. Performing a careful, site-specific analysis that takes all knownfactors into account and evaluates how to best meet conflicting goals is likely to be the best approach to designing a successful adaptation strategy. CHARACTERIZE AND MONITOR SPECIES/SYSTEMS THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE TO DETERMINE THE SCALE OF CONSERVATION NEEDS One of the most important steps in selecting an adaptation strategy for climate change is to characterize which life history stages, species, communities, or physical features inyour location are most vulnerable to changes in average climate, changes in climatevariability, or extreme events (Solomon, 1994). This can help determine the scale of management that is necessary. For example, if only one species of coldwater fish in a se-ries of lakes is declining and the rest of the community appears to be resistant to climatechange, a small-scale conservation strategy such as protecting thermal refugia andmaintaining potential migration corridors to pristine lakes at higher altitude may be suf-ficient. However, if increased precipitation and runoff from deforested, agricultural lands is causing a dramatic increase in sediment load and nutrient content, along withlarge-scale changes in species composition, distribution and abundance, a more ambi-tious basin-wide management plan may be called for. Attempting to predict which species will be most vulnerable to climate change before large effects are observed can be very useful, as initiating careful monitoring before effectsare noticeable will provide a baseline against which future changes can be compared.While predicting exactly how species will respond to change can be difficult, numericalmethods that combine assessments of climatic sensitivity (thermal tolerance, etc.) withgeneral vulnerability (life history traits, current knowledge of the species, taxonomicuniqueness, overexploitation) may help highlight species for further consideration (Her-WWF 204man and Scott, 1994). Identifying and protecting keystone species is also important in order to prevent cascading effects that would alter the entire community (Noss, 2001). Performing careful and continuous monitoring of both biological and physical indica- tors of change is critical, as reactions to climate change can be delayed in many plantsand animals. For example, directly monitoring the water table and hydrology of temper-ate wetlands may be critical in preventing habitat loss, because by the time the vegeta-tion shows a response to environmental change it may already be too late to save thesystem (Solomon, 1994). DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTING FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS WHILE DEALING WITH INCREASING HUMAN WATER NEEDS A serious potential threat, and one unique to aquatic ecosystems, is the anticipated rise in human water needs, mainly due to population growth and increasing development.Pressures caused by water extraction and climate change will almost certainly interact,exacerbating the effects of climate change on ecosystems and possibly increasing human water needs further due to increased temperatures and evaporation. Proposedadaptation strategies for human water resource management include \"demand-side\"adaptations, such as price incentives for conserving water, enforceable water efficiencystandards, and increased irrigation efficiency, as well as less environmentally-friendly\"supply-side\" adaptations, such as building more dams (Arnell et al., 2001). The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change recommends using Integrated Water ResourceManagement (IWRM) to adapt to increasing water resource demands (Arnell et al.,2001). In this process, all stakeholders are included in potential considerations of sup-ply- and demand-side actions before a decision is made, and the situation is continuous-ly monitored and re-evaluated . Unfortunately, IWRM does not consider maintainingaquatic ecosystem function as one of the goals of water management (i.e. aquaticecosystems are not considered a \"stakeholder\"); environmental damage is only includedas a potential negative side effect of some actions. A vast improvement over this water management strategy in terms of maintaining ecosystem health is ecologically sustainable water management, which strives to protectthe ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems while meeting current and futurehuman needs for water (Richter et al., 2003). This strategy has been applied primarily incases where one or more large dams already exist on a river and there are conflicts be-tween increasing human water extraction and ecosystem flow needs, a problem that islikely to become more common in the future due to climate change. Methods of ad-dressing water conflicts commonly include altering patterns of surface and groundwaterextraction, increasing efforts to improve water efficiency, and changing temporal pat- terns of water release from dams. All stakeholders are involved in the process of esti-mating ecosystem flow requirements (seasonal base flows, high and low flows, rates ofrise and fall), determining current and future human water needs, identifying incompat-ibilities (i.e. in seasonal or regional needs), and collaboratively searching for solutions.A critical component of this management strategy in terms of adapting to climateBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 205 CHAPTER 7 Freshwaterchange is the inclusion of short-term management experiments (i.e. injecting treated wastewater back into groundwater reserves) to test the effectiveness of various manage- ment options as climate change continues to alter water flows, ecosystem needs, andhuman water demands. The method also calls for the development of an on-going adap-tive management strategy to continuously monitor and respond to ecosystem changes. This method has proven effective in many cases, such as in the management of the Green River Dam in Kentucky, USA (Richter et al., 2003). This dam was managed toprovide recreational opportunities in the reservoir during the summer and water storagecapacity to protect against flooding during the winter. As a result, large quantities ofwater were released from the dam during the fall, which biologists believed were dis- rupting downstream prey aggregations and dispersing mussel larvae during the fallbreeding season. After examining ecosystem and human needs and identifying the in-compatibilities (mainly related to the large outflow of water in the fall), the managementof the dam was altered to release a steady, low volume of water throughout the fall,along with big bursts in November coinciding with natural storm events. The reservoirlevel was still lowered before the winter, when large storms could cause flooding, andthe new schedule provided a more natural flow regime for downstream wildlife (Richteret al., 2003). This case provides an especially \"tidy\" example of ecologically sustainablewater management (particularly because human water extraction was not a major issue), but the method has also proven effective in far more complicated cases where multiple governing bodies were involved and the goals of various stakeholders differed widely(Richter et al., 2003). PERFORM INTEGRATED RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT TO BUFFER SYSTEMS AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND PROVIDE ABASIS FOR LONG-TERM CONSERVATION Although a primary goal of ecologically sustainable water management is maintaining the ecological integrity of freshwater systems, the main focus is on managing the wateritself. As described previously, freshwater ecosystems depend on more than just thewater they contain\u2014rivers, lakes and wetlands are intricately connected to all of the ter- restrial systems within the drainage basin surrounding them. To protect freshwaterecosystems that are showing large-scale changes in response to climate change, or sys-tems that are likely to be vulnerable (due to land alteration or other anthropogenicstresses), the entire drainage basin must be managed. One-sided decisions to adopt fixed river basin management plans are likely to fail if un- expected climatic changes occur. For example, the tri-nation development authority in charge of the Senegal River basin in the Sahel region of West Africa initiated a plan sev-eral decades ago to convert large areas of the river basin to irrigated rice production, inan effort to reduce the countries'dependence on foreign imports. Two dams were con-structed to provide irrigation water, but during the 1960's, the Sahel began to experiencea severe and long-term drought that current climate models suggest may be permanent(Venema et al., 1997), constraining the amount of water available for flooded rice paddyWWF 206agriculture. Over the last several decades, the basin has suffered increasing desertifica- tion, due in part to climate change and in part to the abandonment of cleared rice pad-dies. As a result of water shortages and river basin degradation, large numbers of localresidents have migrated to urban areas. Proposed changes in river basin use includeswitching from industrial rice production back to local, village-based agriculture utiliz-ing cereal and grain crops with low irrigation needs, as well as a more ambitious plan toconvert areas of the basin to agro-forestry, which involves mixed vegetable productionwithin plots of reforested land; this reforestation would help lower air and water tem-peratures, and halt desertification. The reforestation plan also recruits unemployedurban residents in an attempt to reverse recent patterns of massive demographic shifts tourban areas (Venema et al., 1997). In order to avoid the necessity of restoring river basins that have been severely degraded by climate change and failed management, the basin-wide needs of ecosystems andlocal communities should be considered, as well as the potential impacts of future cli-mate change, before enacting any management plan. Integrated River Basin Manage-ment (IRBM) is a method of balancing basin-wide ecosystem needs with human waterresource needs to achieve economic, social, and environmental goals. One of the majorproblems with basin-wide management is that many river basins cross national bound-aries; worldwide, there are 261 major transboundary rivers that drain 45% of the Earth'ssurface, account for 80% of the planet's river flow by volume, and are home to 40% ofthe world's population (WWF, 2002). Transboundary rivers can make water manage-ment more difficult, but management of these systems is essential to future economicand political stability. With IRBM, the needs and expectations of all \"water stakeholders\" (local community members, civil authorities, water and fishery resource managers, scientists and conser-vationists, and representatives of the private sector) from all countries are assessed joint- ly, a basin-wide authority is created, monitoring methods are developed, and an adaptivemanagement plan is initiated (WWF, 2002). Decisions can be made locally, but must bein accordance with basin-wide strategy. Key aspects in determining the success or fail-ure of IRBM are actively promoting public involvement (through appropriately-scaledlocal discussions suited to the target audience) and ensuring sustainable funding for thebasin-wide authority (often through water taxes, reductions in water subsidies, or inter-national funding programs). Because it employs adaptive management strategies, IRBMis able to continuously respond to the effects of climate change. In addition, becausemanagement is basin-wide, IRBM provides the ability to protect climatic refugia andareas that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, as well as to minimize damag-ing land use practices and other human stresses that are known to interact with and ex-acerbate the effects of climate change. Although system-wide conservation can present difficulties in terms of reaching con- sensus, and can be costly and slower to achieve noticeable results than local campaignsto preserve endangered species, system-wide approaches ultimately conserve the func-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 207 CHAPTER 7 Freshwatertional value of the river basin and provide a sustainable basis for future conservation (Moss, 2000). Successful IRBM in Costa Rica, in which fossil fuel taxes and paymentsfrom a private hydro-electric plant compensate upstream landowners for the mainte-nance and restoration of forest cover, has improved water quality and quantity for down-stream towns, farms, and industries, and reduced sediment accumulation at the hydro-electric plant (WWF, 2002). In South Africa, IRBM led to the creation of the Workingfor Water Programme, a massive project that protects biodiversity while creating jobsfor 18,000 people clearing invasive, water-hungry plants from several river basins. Within a managed river basin, priority should be given to protecting upstream sub- basins and headwaters; these areas serve as thermal refugia, providing cool, oxygen-richgroundwater to many species not found downstream, and are often the destination ofmigratory fish and other animals (WWF, 2002). In addition, upstream areas affect theflow regime and water quality of all areas further downstream, and are often less de-graded and easier to protect (Skelton et al., 1995). It is also important to protect sidechannels and backwaters, which serve as refugia and spawning grounds for a range ofanimals, and provide corridors to important floodplains (Sedell et al., 1990). Finally,other downstream areas should also be protected, as these areas are necessary for themigration of diadromous species, possess abundant water resources, and are often moreproductive and species-rich than upstream areas. However, downstream areas are alsomore frequently subjected to human pressures such as water extraction and land use, soprotecting these areas may involve restoration or creative approaches to resource man-agement (WWF, 2002). PROTECT ENTIRE FRESHWATER ECOREGIONS TO PRESERVE THE ECOLOGICALAND EVOLUTIONARY DRIVING FORCES OF BIODIVERSITY Freshwater ecoregion conservation (ERC) involves protecting relatively large units of water and surrounding land that contain distinct assemblages of natural communities sharing many of the same conditions (Abell et al., 2002). These ecoregions are definedby the similarity of the communities and conditions contained within them, and can in-clude one or more drainage basins. Many freshwater ecoregions encompass a number ofbasins and cover vast tracts of land, such as the Amazon River and Flooded Forestsecoregion and the Yangtze Rivers and Lakes ecoregion (Abell et al., 2002). The main difference between freshwater ecoregion conservation and IRBM is that ecore- gion conservation focuses primarily on preserving biodiversity, while IRBM emphasizesbalancing environmental, economic, and social needs. In addition, ecoregion conserva-tion is often applied to areas of high-biodiversity importance, in order to preserve theseexceptional areas while addressing and analyzing the ecological and evolutionary driving forces of biodiversity. Because of its focus on protecting high-diversity communities andecosystems (which are likely to be more resistant and resilient), and because the largescale of ecoregion conservation allows managers to control most non-climatic stresses af-fecting freshwater ecosystems, ERC is particularly well-suited to buffer systems againstthe effects of climate change. Additional benefits of an ecoregion approach include theWWF 208BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 209 CHAPTER 7 Freshwaterability to address the conservation needs of wide-ranging species or species that require particularly large areas of habitat, and the ability to address threats that operate across anentire ecoregion with a single, coherent approach (Abell et al., 2002). In relation to climate change, freshwater ecoregion conservation may provide the most comprehensive and holistic approach to providing adaptation options (thermal refugia,migration routes, etc.) and minimizing anthropogenic stresses, thereby allowing regionsof paramount importance in biodiversity to resist, recover from, and/or adapt to globalclimate change. However, because many river basins throughout the world are heavilypopulated, a more balanced approach (such as IRBM) that considers socioeconomic fac-tors in adaptive management of river basins may be more likely to provide long-termprotection; as human water demands increase and human populations experience moredirect effects of climate change and extreme climatic events, interest in protectingecosystems is likely to wane and management schemes with the sole goal of protectingfreshwater ecosystems and biodiversity may lose support. Ideally, IRBM could be ap-plied to more heavily populated or degraded basins within a freshwater ecoregion, butoverall management of the region could be guided by ecological principles aimed at in- creasing resistance and resilience to climate change, thus combining the benefits of thetwo approaches. Ultimately, however, any management strategy for dealing with globalclimate change will simply buy time until either rapid, anthropogenic climate changeceases or species are no longer able to adapt and massive extinctions result. Manage-ment strategies can only provide long-term protection of freshwater ecosystems if theroot causes of climate change are addressed and solutions are enacted on a global scale.

WWF 216BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 217 CHAPTER 8 Protected AreasEcological and Socio- economic Benefits ofProtected Areas in Dealingwith Climate Change Nigel Dudley and Sue Stolton Equilibrium WELL-DESIGNED AND MANAGED protected areas may ameliorate some of the problems caused by climate change, with benefits well beyond the park boundaries.These potential benefits are predicated on a number of assumptions about the way inwhich natural ecosystems will respond to changing climate\u2014some of which still needto be thoroughly tested\u2014and on further assumptions about the design and managementof protected area systems. But we already know enough about the predicted and ob-served impacts of climate change, and about the role of protected areas, to draw someinitial conclusions about how to get the best out of protected area networks in terms ofbuffering against climate change. This chapter outlines some of the known and expected benefits that protected areas offer national or regional strategies to increase resilience against climate change and suggestsways in which protected area authorities and managers can maximise these benefits. Given the uncertainty inherent in climate models, this advice is still preliminary. Mostcontemporary research on the links between climate change and protected areas not sur-prisingly focuses on the threats posed to parks and reserves. Their potential role in buffer-ing ecosystems and human societies has been less carefully studied and at least some ofthe claims that have gained attention are based more on hearsay and received wisdomthan on quantitative data or real-life examples. Information has often not progressed fromhurriedly prepared technical reports into the scientific literature, making judgementsmore difficult. In the following account we try to sort out the myths from the reality andto provide protected area managers with a guide to maximizing the potential benefits thatprotected areas can offer in efforts to resist the impacts of climate change. There is a growing recognition that natural ecosystems, both large and small, could pro- vide a suite of ecosystem services related to climate change, ranging from protectionagainst immediate physical impacts such as rising temperatures, unstable climates andrising seas, to providing additional insurance against the predicted instability of agricul-ture, fisheries and water resources. We look first at the significance of particular impactsand then at how protected areas might relieve symptoms, in each case referring to real-life examples of protected areas. Wherever possible, we have drawn on protected areaWWF 218 management interventions that have been developed specifically as a response to cli- mate change; in one or two cases we use examples which have relevance to climatechange but that have been initiated for other reasons. The main issues examined are: disaster mitigation covering hurricanes, droughts, flood- ing, avalanches and coastal erosion; fires; biodiversity; water security particularly with re-spect to drinking water; the need for rapid crop adaptation; and food security, including thepotential of crop and fish stock failure. In some cases, the role of protected areas in miti-gating or relieving effects is already clear, while in others the jury is still out and we needto learn more before management recommendations can achieve any degree of certainty. Managing to Relieve the Impacts of Climate Change Many protected area managers already wrestle with a range of problems relating to cli-mate change effects within their parks or reserves. Here we suggest that carefully de-signed and managed protected areas can help relieve problems beyondthe park boundary. In some cases protected areas are simultaneously a potential buffer against a particularclimate-related problem and at risk from the same problem, creating a tension and theneed for some tough decisions from managers. We have already made clear that there is alot to learn about many of these impacts and therefore research and monitoring must beimportant components of any response. In addition, opportunities to use protected areasas buffers against climate change require two additional management responses: PLANNING TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF PROTECTED AREAS IN RELIEVING THE SYMP- TOMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: the importance of assessing protected area management effectiveness is increasingly recognized; adding climate change elements into suchassessments would be relatively easy and enhance their usefulness dramatically.This Issue Disaster mitigation FireBiodiversity conservation Food modification to maximise benefitsPotential economicvalue Figure 1:Possible matrix for conducting a local overview of climate change effectsBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 219 CHAPTER 8 Protected Areascould be helpful for individual protected areas and, in the case of a system assess- ment, aid in planning future protected areas. Such assessments could include pri-mary research or a thorough literature review, or begin more simply, with a localsurvey to overview the situation. A draft set of questions for such an overview issuggested in Figure 1. Ideally, such an analysis could be carried out on the system level (ecosystem or landscape), so that both protected area agencies and individual managers can putmanagement actions into a national or regional context. TESTING HYPOTHESES THAT PROTECTED AREAS CAN HELP MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: the cases described below show managers already thinking about using land and water resources to buffer against climate change (or sometimes makinginterventions that could help mitigate climate change without recognizing the connec-tion). However, these are rare examples. More systematic work is needed to quantifybeneficial impacts and to refine management interventions to maximize these benefits. In the following sections, we review the evidence, suggest what protected areas can do and, in each case, provide at the end a brief summary of management responses. DISASTERS: DROUGHTS, FLOODS, AVALANCHES AND COASTALEROSION Like the four horsemen of the apocalypse, a whole suite of disasters are predicted to in-crease in severity and frequency as a result of changing climate: changing rainfall patternscausing floods and droughts; extreme weather events such as hurricanes; a combination ofclimate changes that could increase avalanches; and the inexorable rise in sea level alongwith increased storm damage to coasts. Available evidence, from modeling studies and ob-servations, supports some but not all of these popular predictions. The IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that rainfall scenarios suggest an increase in both flooding and drought frequency in many parts of the world (McCarthy et al., 2001),and these predictions are echoed by both the United Nations (United Nations World WaterAssessment Programme, 2001) and the World Bank (World Bank, undated), while the im-pacts of climate change on frequency and intensity of hurricanes remain more uncertain.Variations in annual temperatures may not increase total avalanches, but certainly make it more difficult to predict when and where they will occur. Sea level rise is predicted to haveenormous impacts on many low-lying coastal communities; as this chapter is written thegovernment of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu is lobbying the Australian governmentfor space for the country's 9,300 inhabitants, currently living on land only 3 metres abovethe sea and considering a mass evacuation (Fickling, 2003). FLOOD The presence of natural vegetation generally reduces storm-related erosion andlandslip/landslide and can ameliorate local flooding, but is normally not enough to stopmajor floods. Research in New Zealand after Hurricane Bola in 1988 found that shallowlandslips/landslides only occurred in 1% of the area with forests older than 5 years versus30% of the area of cleared lands (Trustrum and Page, 1992). However, a review carried outfor the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation concluded that forests were only likely to reduce flooding in relatively minor storms (Calder, 2000), and claims that deforestation inthe Himalaya has led to flooding in the Ganges are now believed to be incorrect (Hamil-ton, 1987). A widespread belief that Hurricane Mitch in Central America had less impacton areas still rich in natural forest, such as Nicaragua, has been challenged by the Centerfor International Forestry Research (Kaimowitz, 2002). Yet in other cases, forests do ap-pear to have an important role to play in regulating water flow, including particularlyswamp forests such as the huge Varzea forests in the Amazon. Forests also provide bene-fits at a smaller scale, in the areas immediately surrounding the forest, so that integration of protected forests with working landscapes, as in IUCN Category V protected areas, of-fers benefits to local communities. A review in North America concluded that for manyreasons, including likely temperature changes and more frequent and intense storm events,climate change increased the need for forest protected areas to be as large as possible, in-cluding the ability to withstand extreme weather events (Noss, 2001). DROUGHT Maintaining natural vegetation can provide an important insurance policy in areas proneto drought and there is a growing consensus that social impacts of drought in the Hornof Africa have been exacerbated by prior forest loss. In arid Djibouti, the Foret du DayNational Park is the only large protected area in the country (IUCN category II, 10,000ha) and is also the only significant forest area. Being at a higher elevation and subject tomists, it retains more vegetation and thus provides a source of forage during drought: theprotected area is thus a natural buffer against starvation. Currently traditional manage-ment patterns are breaking down and over-grazing is resulting in replacement withdrought resistant trees, pointing to the need for negotiation and changes in management(Barrow, pers. comm.). AVALANCHE At a smaller scale, protection zones, which may or may not be officially protected areas but fulfill the same functions, are a key feature in avalanche control and small-scale flood control throughout the mountainous areas of Europe. Forest management in theTatra National Park, a transboundary protected area between Poland and Slovakia, has long emphasised avalanche control. In the Swiss national forest, 8% of the total area ismanaged primarily for avalanche protection and as long ago as the late 1980's this wascalculated to have an annual value of 3-4 billion Swiss francs (K\u00fcchli et al., 1998). COASTALIMPACTS Protected areas play an even clearer role in disaster mitigation in marine and coastalareas. Sea level rise and increased storm damage puts coastal communities and small is-lands at particular risk. Building physical barriers against the rising sea is technicallydifficult and colossally expensive for countries with large, low-lying coastal regions,stimulating a new approach to integrated management, relying on natural features suchas coral reefs and mangroves. A comprehensive review of marine ecosystem servicessuggests that natural features like coral reefs and mangroves are the most cost-effectiveWWF 220option for maintaining coastal integrity and cannot easily be substituted by artificial reefs and seawalls or by aquaculture (Moberg and R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck, 2003)\u2014making responsessuch as restoration of mangroves even more important (Field, 1999). Paradoxically, these natural features are also amongst those most acutely at threat from cli- mate change. In these cases, managers will be faced with a series of hard decisions, bal-ancing the benefits from a feature like a reef or mangrove, the chances of it surviving cli-mate change and the costs and benefits of protection. In some cases trade-offs may benecessary. For example choosing to concentrate money and resources into key areas andabandoning others. Looking beyond spatial biodiversity conservation to include other fac-tors, including the wider benefits of protected areas in terms of coastal protection, may in-fluence the choice of where to focus the most effort and could also help attract additionalsupport for those protected areas that are also helping to mitigate climate change impacts. The Sundarbans region of Bangladesh provides an almost text book example of the link between climate change and protected areas. This huge area of mangrove in the Gangesfloodplain is both at risk from climate change impacts and a potential tool in resistingthe impacts of such change. A recent review summarised seven national and internation-al analyses of climate change impacts on Bangladesh (Huq et al., 2003) and concludedthat the Sundarbans were at risk and increased disasters were likely in the coastal zonescovering 30% of the country. Impacts would result from sea-level rise and associatedfactors including high evapotranspiration and low flow in winter resulting in increased soil salinity. The IPCC predicts that in worse case scenarios up to 75% of the mangrovescould disappear. The area is heavily affected by tropical storms: about 10% of the world's tropical cy- clones occur in the Bay of Bengal and of those 17% hit land in Bangladesh. The man-groves fringing the delta have been a traditional barrier, providing socially and econom-ically valuable services. The Southwest Area Water Resources Management Projectcalculated that the absence of the Sunderbans mangroves would mean building 2,200kilometres of cyclone/flood embankments requiring a capital investment of Taka 16 bil-lion (US$ 294 million) with a yearly maintenance budget of Taka 320 million (US$ 6million) (UNDP et al., 1995). The Sundarbans are protected in three connected wildlifesanctuaries (IUCN category IV), although they continue to be degraded and in the pasthave been heavily logged (Scott, 1989). This has led to a requirement for mangroverestoration, and some experience is already being developed in the Sundarbans, for ex-ample on Sagar Island (Saha and Choudhury, 1996). Coral reefs also provide barriers to wave activity for low-lying coastal regions and is- lands but, like mangroves, are themselves one of the first habitats to suffer the impactsof climate change, mainly through coral bleaching. Many coral communities are alsosuffering intense damage from, over-exploitation, shipping and pollution. Marine pro-tected areas can relieve some pressure from corals, thus giving them the best chance ofmaintaining themselves and thus also providing a protective function. In AmericanBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 221 CHAPTER 8 Protected AreasSamoa WWF scientists are working with local communities to look at options for man- aging change. They are examining options for reducing the impact of coral bleaching inthe National Park of American Samoa and Fagatele National Marine Sanctuary by, forexample controlling high nutrient terrestrial run-off into coastal waters. FIRE Climate change will add an additional element to the already complex relationship be- tween fires and natural ecosystems. Hotter, drier conditions tend to increase fire fre-quency, resulting in changes in vegetation as more fire-tolerant species become commonin both the tropics (Goldamer and Price, 1998) and in temperate and boreal regions: innorthern Minnesota, USA, forest fires were most common in the warm, dry periods ofthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (Clark, 1988) and research in Canada suggests thata doubling of atmospheric CO 2could lead to a 46% increase in seasonal severity rating for forest fires, and possibly a similar increase for their incidence (Flannigan and VanWagner, 1991). In areas where fires have recently burned at unnatural and ecologically damaging levels - particularly in tropical forests where under normal conditions fires are a rarity - thereis strong evidence of a link with the climate phenomenon called ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o-South-ern Oscillation), which causes periodic droughts (Leighton and Wirawan, 1986), includ-ing the drought that affected much of the forests which caught fire in 1997 and 1998.The frequency and intensity of El Ni\u00f1o could itself be increasing as a result of climatechange (Trenberth and Hoar, 1996, 1997), which means the world faces warmer, moreviolent weather, and more forest fires. More generally, increased droughts and averagetemperatures in fire prone areas may also increase the frequency of fires. However, theseimpacts are likely to be outweighed by the influences of management: the fires in Braziland Indonesia in 1997 and 1998 may have been intensified because of El Ni\u00f1o, but theywere begun by plantation owners and slash and burn farmers (Holdsworth and Uhl,1997) and conditions were made more suitable for fire through earlier managementchanges (Uhl et al., 1988). Forest fires can directly affect protected areas - for example Kutai National Park in Bor- neo was virtually destroyed by fire (Goldammer and Seibert, 1992) - but in other partsof the world unnatural levels of fire suppression are a significant conservation problem(Noss et al., 1995) and it therefore follows that fire management responses to climatechange must be tailored to local conditions. In areas where fire is an expected part of the ecosystem, some balance between man- agement and non-intervention will probably be optimal, with prescribed burning usual-ly a more successful management intervention than outright suppression (Stephenson,1999) (which allows build-up of fuel and less frequent, but more catastrophic, fires). Infire-dominant landscapes, leaving forests to attain old-growth status can increase the risk of fire and thus protected areas close to centers of population are sometimes regard-ed as an added fire hazard. In the aftermath of unusually intense fires in Australia inWWF 222February 2003, there were calls from some quarters for logging in national parks to re- duce fire risk (Victoria Parks Service, pers. comm.) and some measure of fire manage-ment may be necessary. Conversely, in areas where fire is generally a factor of humanintervention, such as in tropical moist forests, frequent forest fires cause long-term dam-age (Woods, 1989) and protected areas can provide important buffers to prevent the fur-ther spread of fires from poorly managed swidden agriculture or fires used in pasturecreation or clearance for plantations. Training in community fire management is in these cases an important part of manage- ment in those protected areas with resident human communities (Karki, 2002). For ex-ample, working with local communities to manage and reduce fires is a major focus ofmanagement for the Pha Taem protected areas complex between Thailand, Laos andCambodia, and the presence of the protected area has opened up the possibility of cross-border cooperation in a way that would not otherwise be possible (Trisurat, 2003). Inother protected areas with grassland or savannah habitats, such as the Serengeti in Tan-zania, controlled use of fire is an integral part of management, usually to maintain par-ticular ecosystems. Biodiversity Ever since Edward Wilson published his classic text on biodiversity (Wilson, 1988), ithas been recognized that we are undergoing rapid loss of species and it has long been ar-gued that climate change will increase this trend (Markham, 1996). Recent studies sug-gest that a significant impact of global warming is already discernible in plant and ani-mal species (Root et al., 2003). Researchers have also found that other factors such asthe presence of invasive species and imbalances in hydrological cycles increase thesethreats (Crumpacker et al., 2000). Most protected areas are primarily aimed at protecting biodiversity, a role that is stressed in the IUCN definition of a protected area: An area of land and/or sea especial- ly dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of naturaland associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means(Anon, 1994). Such protection can range from providing a secure base for species thatspreads far beyond the border of protected area networks, such as the giant panda that isprotected through a reserve network but also lives in unprotected forests and mountains,to protecting the entire known population of endemic species with a strictly limited dis-tribution. The increased stress on biodiversity created by climate change therefore in-creases the arguments for protected areas. To some extent their role here is mainly to re-duce other threats by maximizing the resilience of the ecosystem and to provide large,unbroken blocks of habitat that will be relatively resistant to environmental change. Butmanagers are also looking at other actions to address climate change at a site and net-work level, including active restoration to help speed up changes in vegetation patterns created by temperature difference; translocation programs for threatened species; andactive management of patch dynamics. Experience with translocation at a habitat scaleis not encouraging (Hodder and Bullock, 1997) although translocation of individualBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 223 CHAPTER 8 Protected Areasspecies may be more realistic. Using protected areas to conserve biodiversity in the face of climate change often means cooperating between protected areas and also often be-tween countries (or other geographical/managerial jurisdictions), adding weight to argu-ments for transboundary protected areas. The practical implementation of these challenges is starting to be worked out by pro- tected area agencies, researchers and managers, often working in cooperation. In theNetherlands, a new national conservation plan looks specifically at increasing optionsfor migration between protected areas and a process of \"de-fragmentation\" pursued witha target that: \"by 2020 migration within and between nature areas will be secured by re-moval of physical barriers\" (Anon, 2000). A review undertaken for the UK governmentidentified three policy responses: the possible need to redraw boundaries of protectedareas and re-designate sites as habitat for particular species shifts; managed changesparticularly inshore from seawater defenses to recreate coastal habitat before this isflooded, including restoration and the use of holding reserves for species; and transloca-tion of species with a narrow distribution, such as the Snowdon Lily (Lloydia serotina) (Hossel et al., 2000). In the high Arctic, scientists working in a series of UNESCO bios-phere reserves including Abisko (Sweden), Zackenberg (Greenland), Taimyrsky (Russ-ian Federation) and Niwot Ridge (USA) are measuring responses of certain plants tochanging conditions and developing management responses (Arft et al., 2000). In NorthAmerica, cooperation between the Mapini Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and the BigBend Biosphere Reserve in Texas, USA, is examining options for translocation of theendangered Bols\u00f3n tortoise (Gopherus flavomarginatus) further north as a response to climate change (Hadley, 2002). Water Security In the past 100 years the world population tripled, but water use for human purposes mul- tiplied six-fold (World Water Council, 2000). Water security is already an important andsometimes politically explosive issue and this is likely to intensify under climate change.After the 1992 Earth Summit, Agenda 21 noted that: \"Higher temperatures and decreased precipitation would lead to decreased water-supplies and increased water demands; theymight cause deterioration in the quality of freshwater bodies, putting strains on the al-ready fragile balance between supply and demand in many countries\". The IPCC has re-peatedly identified potential problems with water supply, particularly in arid regions. Protected areas are increasingly being used to guarantee the quantity and to an even greater extent the quality of the water that we use, including particularly urban drinkingwater. As with some of the other links discussed above, this relationship is not without controversy. There seems to be no constant relationship between presence of forests and quantityof water, and simplistic claims that forests increase or stabilize water supply are often in- correct. Exceptions to this appear to be cloud forests that do intercept water and may in-crease flow. In addition, some old forests also increase net water flow. Studies of rainfallWWF 224and runoff data in Australia collected from large forested catchments in the Melbourne area that were completely or partially burnt by a large-scale wildfire in 1939, conclud-ed that the amount of water yield from forested catchments is related to the forest age.It was found that forest disturbance can reduce the mean annual runoff by up to 50%compared to that of a mature forest, and can take as long as 150 years to fully recover(Kuczera, 1987). In addition, and more importantly, natural forests in catchments do often appear to have a beneficial impact on water quality,thus reducing the very high costs of purifying drinking water. Forested catchments can therefore play an extremely important econom-ic role in reducing costs of purifying water and in situations where clean water is notuniversally available they can also help improve public health. Drinking water supplies provide a clear example of how the link between climate change, hydrology and water supply might relate to protected areas. Currently a third ofthe world's top hundred cities rely on protected forests for some or all of their drinkingwater and some, such as Melbourne, Dar Es Salaam and New York have made well-pub- licized links between forest protection and purity of water supply. Others, like Istanbuland Bangkok, suffer from water supply problems in part because of environmental dete-rioration in their watersheds (Dudley et al., forthcoming). In most cases, protected areasare important principally because of increased water purity while in some cities they arealso believed to increase net quantity of water available. Many municipal authoritieshave pre-empted the debates amongst hydrologists and protected catchments as insur-ance for their water supplies, particularly in cloud forest areas. Water supply links also exist between, for example, Mumbai (Bombay) and Sanjay Ghandi National Park in India; Bogota and Chingaza and Sumapaz National Parks inColombia; Rio de Janeiro and Tijuca National Park in Brazil; Vienna and Donau-AuenNational Park in Austria; and Abidjan and the Parc National du Banco in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.Economic studies point to the importance of these protected areas in terms of reducingpurification costs. Recent studies calculated that the presence of Mount Kenya forestalone, which is within a 70,000 ha IUCN category II protected area, saved Kenya's econ-omy more than US$ 20 million by safeguarding the catchment for two of the country'smain river systems, the Tana and the Ewaso Ngiro, from deforestation (Emerton, 2001).On a smaller scale, payment for maintaining forests to insure the future of water supplieshas been introduced for hydroelectric schemes, such as in Costa Rica (Rojas and Ayl-ward, 2002), for pure industrial water, such as payments negotiated with Pepsi Cola in Guatemala (Gretzinger, pers. comm.) and for irrigation. The World Bank is currentlysupporting the development or implementation of Payment for Environmental Servicessystems in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Domini-can Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador and South Africa. Many of these look specifically atthe impacts of protected areas on water quality. For example a project financed by theGlobal Environmental Facility is under preparation, focusing on Canaima National Park,with significant co-financing A USER'S MANUAL 225 CHAPTER 8 Protected Areas2002). As climate models suggest that water stress is likely to increase in the future, the added benefits and security provided by forest protected areas are particularly important. The cloud forests in La Tigra National Park in Honduras are a typical example, sustain- ing a well-regulated, high quality water flow throughout the year, which provides over40% of the water supply to the 850,000 people in the capital city Tegucigalpa (Dudley etal., 2003). As with mangroves and coral reefs, there is a tension here because cloudforests are also particularly prone to climate change (Bruijnzeel, 2001; Calder, 2002).Although some of the stresses on cloud forests are outside the control of managers onthe ground, research suggests that climate change stress will be exacerbated by otherfactors, including fire, drought and plant invasions (Foster, 2001). Additionally forest loss nearby can reduce clouds and thus adversely affect cloud forests (Lawton et al.,2001). The close link between cloud forests and water resources is therefore an addi-tional argument for devoting resources to cloud forest protection and for those responsi-ble for developing national or ecoregional protected area networks to include provisionof water amongst the arguments for protection of tropical montane cloud forests. Crop Genetic Stress Changing climate will increase stress on both new and traditional crop varieties and theIPCC has repeatedly referred to the need for crop breeding to respond to these changes(McCarthy et al., 2001). Changes in agriculture have tended to increase risks by radical-ly reducing the number of crop varieties, for example research by the Rural AdvancementFund International found that 97%of the varieties given on old United States Departmentof Agriculture lists are now extinct (Fowler and Mooney, 1990). Rice production pro-vides an example of extreme cultivar uniformity, with 75% of rice varieties grown in SriLanka descending from one maternal parent, a uniformity mirrored in Bangladesh andIndonesia (Groombridge, 1992). Wild relatives of modern crops therefore have a particu-larly important role to play in kick-starting the breeding of new strains under time pres-sure. Unfortunately many of these have virtually disappeared from their original centersof diversity in areas of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Protected areas are one specific response to this loss of agricultural biodiversity and an increasing number are being designed specifically to protect sources of crop genetic ma-terial. The potato provides a good example. Modeling suggests that there will be in-creased potato yield variability for Europe (Wolf, 2000), increasing risk of crop failure.In response to these and other threats, potato conservation is being highlighted in theAndes, where the wild ancestors originate. At Pisac Cusco, in Peru, seven Quechua com-munities are planning to a \"Potato Park\"; a community-based conservation areafocused on agri-biodiversity, managed through an integrated landscape model. The areais a recognised centre of crop diversity for potatoes and other important Andean crops(e.g. Quinoa, Kiwicha, Mashua). It lies at the heart of the ancient Inca Empire (and it issuspected that the Incas brought potato varieties from other parts of the continent). Theaim is to protect and conserve native plant genetic resources as well as associated tradi-tional knowledge and local cultural heritage. The initiative addresses local concerns re-WWF 226garding food security, poverty alleviation, gender equality, intellectual property and the right to self-determination for indigenous peoples. It aims to include ecotourism, themarketing of native crops and capacity building in sustainable agriculture. Peruvian au-thorities and institutions such as the International Potato Centre recognise the value of thescheme and a committee of government and non-governmental organizations is studyinglegal options for formal recognition. Indigenous peoples are learning of their rights to bi-ological resources and of the potential benefits derived from their use (Phillips, 2002). Food Security Climate change will also disrupt agricultural systems and fisheries. While there will beboth winners and losers in the resulting shifts in centers of food production, all the signsare that the poor\u2014especially those living in marginal environments\u2014will be the mostvulnerable (Downing et al., 1996). The IPCC estimates that by the 2080s about 80 mil-lion extra people will be at risk of hunger. Yields are likely to fall particularly in the trop-ics, where some crops are already near their maximum temperature tolerance (McCarthyet al., 2001). Protected landscapes and seascapes provide a potential buffer in three ways:by providing breeding grounds for commercial species, by providing wild foods to thepoorest members of society in time of agricultural failure and by preserving genetic re-sources needed for adaptive breeding. SUSTAINING FISHERIES: There is still considerable debate about the likely impact of cli- mate change on fishery resources, although an increasing consensus is developing thatclimate change will have both positive and negative impacts on the abundance and dis-tribution of marine fish. There are concerns that where climate change impacts reducefish stocks, this loss combined with over-fishing could lead to serious impacts for coastal subsistence communities and on countries'economic performance. Strategies toaddress climate change effects must therefore minimize pressures on fish stocks andprovide the best conditions for their maintenance. The IPCC identifies an important rolefor marine reserves: \"Adaptation measures that are relevant to the fishing industry mayinclude the following: ...Organization of marine biosphere reserves and protected areasfor the habitat of marine mammals\" (McCarthy et al., 2001). Unlike terrestrial protected areas, where the initial incentive has usually been wildlife conservation, many marine protected areas start with an aim of maintaining fish stocks.The presence of no-take zones and strictly protected zones often deliberately coincidewith spawning or nursery areas for fish. Because marine protected areas are generallynewer (less than 1% of the ocean is in a protected area compared with over 10% of theland), they have often included stakeholder approaches from the beginning, allowingtheir planning and demarcation to be subject to far more negotiation and buy-in thanwith early land-based protected areas. Until recently, links between marine protected areas and increased fish stocks were based largely on un-quantified observations by villagers and protected area managers. Aseries of research projects has now provided more concrete evidence that marine pro-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 227 CHAPTER 8 Protected Areastected areas increase the numbers, biomass and variability of fish and that they have a significant export to surrounding waters, so that fishing communities operating nearbysee an increase in catch (Gell and Roberts, 2003). Significantly, they show that MPAsprovide insurance against environmental variability and year-to-year fluctuations: theconditions that are predicted to increase under climate change. A review of 80 marineprotected areas found that on average reserves doubled abundance, tripled biomass andincreased both size and diversity of fish by a third (Halpern, 2003) and the same datashowed that increases usually became obvious within five years of protection (Halpernand Warner, 2002). Research projects in Kenya around the Mombassa Marine Park (Mc-Clanahan and Mangi, 2000) and in St Lucia in the Caribbean (Roberts et al., 2001) areboth typical in finding increased catches around MPAs as compared to other nearbyfishing areas, and local fishing deliberately targeting areas near the reserve (\"fishing the line\"). This evidence is building public support for marine protected areas as a long-term insurance policy. The 1500 km 2marine component of the new Quirambas Nation- al Park in Mozambique has been developed and agreed with local communities in partto protect fish breeding grounds (WWF Endangered Seas Campaign, pers. comm.). Many current reserves are too small to have a significant impact on fisheries. A recent re- view (Roberts and Hawkins, 2000) and theoretical modeling exercise (Pezzey et al., 2000)both suggested that larger reserves were often required, with ideally between 20-40% offishing grounds being set aside, with the amount of protected area increasing with fishing intensity. The presence of reserved areas to help buffer against fluctuations caused byENSO events and other fluctuations is likely to become increasingly important. However,enforcement effectiveness has been highlighted as a major problem for marine protectedareas (Jameson et al., 2002) and their role in maintaining fish stocks depends on the rigourwith which governments and local communities are prepared to enforce their protection. NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS AND GAME: Throughout history, poor people have col- lected wild foods in times of shortage, including game and non-timber forest products.This pattern continues, both in the developing world where, for instance, wild gameforms 70-90% of protein intake in parts of Africa (Sayer and Ruiz-Perez, 1994) and inEurope and North America, where recent immigrants are reviving non-timber forestproduct (NTFP) harvests (Hansis, 1996). Natural forests are acknowledged as serving as\"safety nets\" for the rural poor (Wunder, 2001), and this role is likely to become more im-portant under climate change because sources of agricultural food will become increas-ingly stressed and liable to seasonal failure under fluctuating climate conditions. The extent to which protected areas can be included in this safety net is the subject of practical research projects around the world. In places where large-scale land conver-sion has occurred, they may be the only source of some wild foods. The collection ofNTFPs and game from protected areas has traditionally been seen as a management\"problem\", and indeed unregulated collection can cause serious biodiversity losses(Barnett, 2000), even for subsistence purposes (Noss, 1998). However, protected areamanagers are increasingly working with local communities, not to ban collection andWWF 228hunting but to manage it on a sustainable basis. This has immediate social benefits and if local people are allowed controlled access to resources they have more incentive towork with rangers in controlling organized poaching. Programs to implement sustainable use of wild species have been introduced in many protected areas, so far mainly for reasons other than climate change: the following twoexamples are from Africa. Bwindi Impenetrable Forest Reserve in Uganda (IUCN cate- gory II, 32,000 ha) is home for half the world's remaining mountain gorillas along withimportant populations of chimpanzees and elephants. It is surrounded by agriculturalland, up to the park borders in some places: although soil is fertile, agriculture takesplace on steep slopes and in sometimes harsh climatic conditions. To address local re-sentment at the introduction of protection, agreements have been reached with 21 neigh-boring parishes to collect NTFPs, including medicinal plants and handicraft species, andto practice beekeeping. Twenty percent of the park has been reserved for this purpose,with collection areas changing over time to maintain populations. Local people collabo-rate with rangers in collecting information about changes in population of desiredspecies (Makombo, 2001 and information collected on site), thus building experience onhow the protected area can be harvested sustainably. Lob\u00e9k\u00e9 National Park in Southeast Cameroon has followed a similar pattern, although here negotiation with communities started as soon as the park was agreed, being run asa WWF project since 1995. Lob\u00e9k\u00e9 is in a less heavily populated area than Bwindi andis surrounded by forest, although the latter has generally been logged. The key need ofcommunities is for game. Through a detailed stakeholder consultation, based around theprinciple of exchange\u2014rights for responsibilities\u2014five community-managed huntingzones have been agreed covering 200,000 ha along with other forms of collection (Hak-izumwami, 2000 and information collected on site). It is hoped to avoid the problems ofover-exploitation and consequent loss of both biodiversity and meat sources that have plagued other protected areas in Africa. Conclusions:What Does This Mean for Protected Area Agencies? This review has shown that, at our present levels of understanding, protected areas havemuch to offer in terms of helping to maintain food security in times of climate change,benefits in terms of both water security and various forms of protection against disasteron land (although the particular implications under climate change remain obscure insome cases), a key role in controlling coastal erosion and a general role in relievingecosystem stresses such as fire. In summary, protected area managers can in many instances contribute to wider efforts at mitigating climate change impacts and incidentally increase support and perhaps re-sources for management. Key points that have emerged from the following review are: MAINTAIN AND INCREASE LARGE RESERVED AREAS: Large, unfragmented reserves are likely to be most useful in both resisting climate change and providing resilienceBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 229 CHAPTER 8 Protected Areaswithin a landscape - increasing core reserve areas, linking reserves and developing effective buffers are therefore crucial first steps. PLAN PROTECTED AREAS WITH DISASTER MITIGATION IN MIND: protected areas can play an important local role in protecting communities from climate-related floods andlandslips and can play a nationally important role in terms of avalanche and coastalprotection. As reefs, mangroves and upland forests are also at risk from climatechange, choice of where best to put management resources should also be influ-enced by protective functions. RECOGNIZE THE ROLE OF PROTECTED AREAS IN MAINTAINING TERRESTRIAL FOOD AND WATER SUPPLIES: the examples given show that small changes in management attitudes and practices can in many cases allow the natural vegetation within pro-tected areas to help supply emergency food and forage and plentiful water, all like-ly to be in shorter supply in the future. SITE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS TO MAINTAIN FISHERIES: as fish stocks suffer from multiple problems of over-exploitation, pollution and climate change, ways ofmaintaining breeding stocks become more important. The beneficial role of MPAsis now proven and the need to maintain fisheries should be a major factor in in-creasing reserve coverage from the current 1% of the ocean that is protected.

WWF International Endangered Seas Campaign, personal communicationBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 233 CHAPTER 8 Protected AreasBUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 235 CHAPTER 9 Impact AssessmentsRegional Biodiversity Impact Assessments for Climate Change: A Guide for Protected Area Managers Lee Hannah, Ph.D. Center for Applied Biodiversity Science, Conservation International PROTECTED AREAS MANAGERS ARE increasingly concerned about the possible impacts of climate change on the sites they manage. Tools for assessing these impactsare now often in desktop form, including Regional Climate Models (e.g., the HadleyCentre's PRECIS) and species range shift models (e.g., desktop GARP). However,while these tools are now within the computing capacities of some protected areas, theyrequire a long time to run (up to 6 months for a regional climate model like PRECIS),coupled with specialized training and interpretation. For these reasons, protected areasmanagers will probably remain reliant on studies done by university researchers or as-sessment agencies for the immediate future. This chapter explores some of the issuesprotected areas managers need to understand to properly interpret and apply studies ofregional biotic effects of climate change. The chapter opens with a discussion of modeling tools now available for regional analy- ses. Protected areas managers need to be aware of these tools so that they can judge thequality and appropriateness of regional studies for application at their sites. The secondpart of the chapter outlines issues of interpreting these studies. Knowing how to inter-pret studies can help avoid either their being taken too literally or ignored due to theconsiderable uncertainty they carry. Finally, the chapter examines some modes of col-laborative research between protected areas managers and researchers that may helpmove ahead both understanding of climate change impacts on biodiversity, and the for-mulation of effective conservation responses. Assessment Tools Major regional universities and biological research centers will increasingly have thecapacity to generate assessments of biotic impacts of climate change. Regional ClimateModels (RCMs) are now available which run on a desktop PC. Such RCMs give climateprojections at a scale that is useful for regional impact analysis, in contrast to models ofWWF 236 global climate, called General Circulation Models (GCMs), which are generally run at scales too coarse for meaningful regional analysis. The output of a Regional Climate Model may be used in species range shift (or 'niche') models, to provide species-level projections of possible biotic impacts. Such models usethe current climatic tolerances of a species to infer possible changes in its distributiondue to alterations in climate. Biological impact assessments using these tools are likelyto proliferate in the coming years, and not all will be of equal quality. It is therefore im-portant to understand the broader range of assessment tools to put gauge the utility ofthese studies for protected areas planning. Several major types of tools are available for assessing the impact of climate change on biodiversity. These include: global climate models, regional climate models, dynamic and equilibrium vegetation models, species bioclimatic envelope models (Figure 1), and site-specific sensitivity analysis. Models of global climate, General Circulation Models (GCMs), provide broad resolu- tion projections of future climate changes. A typical protected area occupies just a smallfraction of a GCM grid cell, and there are substantial differences in projected climatechanges among GCMs. Nonetheless, GCMs are an essential entry point for conserva-tion assessments of climate change, since they represent the only source for estimates offuture climate changes due to global greenhouse-gas forcing. Global GCM projectionsfor several models are available on the internet (e.g., http://www.meto.govt.uk/re-search/hadleycentre/models/modeldata.html). Software is available on CD-ROM forpersonal computers which allows the comparison of simulated results from severalmodels, which is useful given the considerable inter-GCM uncertainty (see Wigley etal., 2000 for mailing address for CD/software requests). Most current GCM assessments are transient simulations, that is, they simulated a real- istic, gradual buildup of greenhouse gases. Simulations that use an unrealistic, all-at-once increase are called equilibrium simulations and generally should be consideredoutdated. Equilibrium simulations (i.e., a step increase in CO 2) show increasing temper- ature change poleward in both hemispheres, while more sophisticated transient simula-tions show temperature change decreasing with latitude in the southern hemisphere out-side of Antarctica. Northern and southern hemisphere climate system dynamics aremarkedly different and GCM hemispheric coupling is problematic, so models devel-oped with a southern hemisphere focus (e.g. several excellent modeling exercises inAustralia) may be more appropriate in southern hemisphere applications. Using inap-propriate models or simulations may bias results, especially in the southern hemisphere.GCM relevance to biodiversity assessment is also improved by selecting results fromfully-coupled ocean-atmosphere models appropriate to the region in question. Regional climate models may be imbedded within GCMs to provide higher resolution results for use in regional assessments. Two major regional climate models in wideuse are MM5 (Mesoscale Model version 5) and RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Mod-elling System). These models capture the regional influences that in some settingsmay be more important than global forcing in determining local climate changes. Forinstance, conversion of forest to pasture in the Amazon may produce local precipita-tion effects that overwhelm likely precipitation changes due to global greenhouse gasforcing. Regional models represent both the land-use changes and resultant cloud for-mation dynamics of this effect in ways impossible in a GCM. Regional models run atnational or sub-continental scales useful in conservation planning. Their results areless widely available than those of GCMs and they are not available for all regions.However, the Hadley Centre has released a relatively new RCM called PRECIS,which is relatively simple to run on a personal computer, although it can take 6months or more of continuous computing for a single model run (thus multiple runsfor various emissions scenarios or multiple GCMs might take several computers orseveral years). Training for PRECIS is available in one-week workshops in manyparts of the world. Regional climate modeling is therefore now within the grasp ofmost major regional universities. Dynamic vegetation models, forest 'gap' models, biome envelope (or 'correlative') models and species envelope models all use GCM and regional climate model resultsto provide insights into different aspects of the biogeography of future climate change.Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) use first principles of photosynthesis,carbon processing and plant physiology to predict plant functional types. Forest 'gap'models simulate species-specific succession dynamics at the stand-level (<1 ha), buthave limited ability to represent landscape-level changes. They have data requirementsthat limit their application primarily, but not exclusively, to temperate forests. Globalbiome models use the climatic boundaries of current vegetation to simulate future dis-tributions in changed climates. Global biome models assume vegetation is in equilibri-um with climate and so cannot model dynamic transitions, while DGVMs incorporatedynamics but do not yield species specific results. Forest 'gap' models do both, butonly for a small area and only for species for which growth and reproductive charac-teristics have been studied. Species bioclimatic envelope models are the best available tool for producing the species-specific information necessary in conservation planning (Figure 1). They aresimilar in principle to biome envelope models, in that the present distribution of aspecies is used to 'train'a model to predict the climatic conditions in which the speciesmay exist in the future. Envelope construction may be done manually on a GIS platformor through rule-based techniques such as genetic algorithms or general additive model-ing . Unfortunately, these models currently face numerous limitations, including the in-ability to model dynamic transitions, the effects of inter-specific competition, herbivory,dispersal, or other factors (e.g. soil type in some models).BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 237 CHAPTER 9 Impact AssessmentsWWF 238 To make the results of species bioclimatic envelope models most applicable to real- world conservation problems they must be coupled with land-use projection models. Land use projection models represent the current pattern of habitat fragmentation andmodel future patterns based on projections of parameters such as population and con-sumption levels. The potential range shift of a species approximated by bioclimaticmodels is then reduced to the available habitat as projected by the land use model. Forexample, a species whose potential climate envelope shifts into an area entirely domi- nated by agriculture or urban development may be faced with extinction. Integrative and sensitivity analysis based on the ecology of sites and individual species is an essential supplement to modeling, even if it may lack the attractive spatial speci-ficity of models. Models cannot predict species composition at a landscape scale in a dynamic, competitive environment (dynamic vegetation models lack species-specificity,envelope models lack dynamic and competitive elements, 'gap'models lack spatial res-olution). Evidence of paleoecological and paleobiogeographic responses to climatechange form a central element of this analysis.

A sensitivity analysis asks what would happen if various cli-mate variables changed, systematically testing each variable for changes that are bothpositive and negative in sign. The end result of this process is a picture of what respons-es may be expected under a wide range of climatic conditions. Paleoclimatic evidencesuggests that global climates may be capable of switching rapidly between states. Thepossibility of reversal of current warming trends within centuries argues that sound con-servation plans should be robust to both warming and possible cooling. An excellent in-troductory review of climate models, biogeographic models and sensitivity analysis inregional environmental assessment is given by (Sulzman et al., 1995). Interpreting Modeling Regional modeling, interpreted carefully, may provide critical input to practical conser-vation strategies. First, protected areas managers must accept that there are major uncer- tainties associated with climate change projection and species range shift models. Thisdoes not mean that their results are useless or should be ignored. Rather, it means thattheir results should be viewed as an aid in risk management. Protected areas managementis often about identifying threats, weighing future risks and designing managementstrategies accordingly. Climate change is a threat which should be treated similarly. An insurance analogy is useful in this context. Insurance companies provide a service that helps their customers manage risk. Their customers want to avoid future scenariosin which low probability but high cost events (such as an auto accident) disrupt theirlives. They therefore weigh the likelihood of future high cost events and invest in insur-ance accordingly. Protected areas management alternatives are often explored as insurance against future threats having unacceptable impacts on biodiversity. For instance, a park may have amanagement strategy in place for dealing with a large catastrophic fire, even if none hasoccurred in recent history. In the insurance analogy, the fire is a low probability eventwith high costs to biodiversity, so having a plan in place to minimize the damage is asound investment, just as an insurance policy is often a sound investment. This type of risk management applies to climate change as well. Any particular projec- tion of the future is unlikely to be exactly correct, but it is wise to plan for a range ofpossible futures to balance risk and minimize large negative consequences. Certain ef-fects of climate change, such as temperature increase, are now relatively high probabili-ty events, while other effects suggested in modeling may be low probability events,some with highly negative consequences. Sound application of modeling results in pro-tected areas planning requires balancing the risk of possible future events and creatingmanagement strategies that minimize the probability and impact of scenarios that havelarge negative consequences for biodiversity.WWF 240 The output of a typical single-species model is illustrated in Figure 1. While model out- put is expressed as a map of future species range, it should be recognized that this isonly one of many possible alternatives for the future range of the species. Different cli-mate models (both RCM and the GCM in which it is embedded), different emissionsscenarios, different species models and different input data might all present differentresults. A first principle in judging regional modeling or assessments is therefore 'themore scenarios the better'. Second, assessments can be conducted with coarse-scale GCM climate scenarios or finer-scale regional (RCM) projections. The finer scale of RCM output is much more appropriate to regional analysis, and RCMs capture the effects of regional land usechange (such as effects on precipitation due to forest clearing) as well. As second gener-al principle is therefore 'a study done with RCM climatology is more reliable than onethat uses GCM climatology'. However, many assessments in the near future will be limited to a few scenarios and GCM-scale climatology. What use, if any, are these assessments? Here a return to therisk management perspective is useful. If one has no information about the likelihood orseverity of a future event, it is extremely difficult to manage the associated risk. There-fore, even one scenario of low probability can be a major help in management. It allowssome assessment of risk, and allows other, independent lines of evidence to be exploredto refine the estimate of risk. For example, a range shift projection such as illustrated in Figure 1 provides one assess- ment of the relative vulnerability of the species to long-distance dislocation due to cli-mate change. This estimate can be refined by examining other relevant factors, such asland use in the direction of shift, dispersal capability of the species, and other factors.The modeling itself may also be examined to determine what climatic factors drove thesimulated shift. If these factors seem relevant for the species, the probability of the pro-jection goes up. By adding projections and lines of evidence, uncertainty can be re-duced, negative impacts in the future balanced, and management strategies evolved. Protected Areas Management Refinement of management practices in response to the results of an impact assessmentcan be done in four major steps: scenario-building; enhanced monitoring; biological survey; and review and revision of management practices. Scenario-building is an iterative process in which modeling is used to refine manage- ment and management revisions suggest further areas of enquiry for modeling. Scenar-ios are created that span the range of uncertainty in climate change and biotic responsemodeling, and that capture important management variables. Monitoring and manage-BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 241 CHAPTER 9 Impact Assessmentsment are tested repeatedly against the scenarios and the scenarios themselves are re- peatedly revised as more data becomes available and uncertainties change or decrease. Scenarios should be created that capture possible major ecological events in the system being conserved. For instance, dynamic vegetation or envelope model results should beexamined for biomes or habitats 'on the edge'\u2014systems that are near threshold for con- version to a different growth form, dominant vegetation or disturbance regime. Scenar- ios should also be constructed for rare, threatened and climate-sensitive species. Rareand threatened species may be vulnerable to further population reductions due to cli-mate change, and these should be considered in management plans for these species.Climate-sensitive species include species with small ranges (even if abundant), specieswith limited (<500-1000 m) elevational ranges, and upper elevation species whose habi-tat may be reduced with warming. Finally, scenarios should be constructed that describethe possible impact of climate change on ecosystem processes. Droughts and stormsoften limit plant functional types or open forest canopies for regeneration. Change infrequency of these events may therefore alter vegetation structure, succession, andspecies diversity and composition. An expanded monitoring program is based on the scenarios developed. Testable scenario predictions monitored in the field permit adaptive management responses. Many param-eters of enhanced modeling will be biological, including climate-sensitive species andprocesses. Installation or upgrading of weather-data gathering capability is a physicalmonitoring step to be considered. Collection of sound weather data has proven importantin documenting climate correlates to species range changes, changes in abundance (am-phibian decline) and even possible extinctions in the Monteverde cloud forests of CostaRica. Remote sensing and regional modeling may help in the design of a monitoring sys-tem which focuses on variables that may be vulnerable to change, for instance liftingcloud bases in tropical montane settings such as Monteverde (Lawton et al. 2001). Biological survey work can complement monitoring and scenario refinement by provid- ing key data. Detecting individualistic species range shifts requires data on distributionand abundance generally not available nor previously considered necessary at most pro-tected areas. Survey programs can help fill this data need and provide baseline data formonitoring. For example, scenarios from modeling may show that a species not knownfrom a reserve may find favorable climatic conditions there in the future (Rutherford etal., 1999). Such species may exist in the reserve but have escaped documentation. Sur-vey work can help find outliers of the species or increase confidence that it does not exist in the reserve, information critical to the design of effective monitoring systems. Additional distributional data even on common species may be required for effectivemonitoring. Inexpensive GPS units make park staff on regular patrol or even tourists onremote trails potential data gathering allies in this effort. Additionally, species rangeshifts may respond not just to climatological changes, but to changes in community in-teractions as well (e.g. Harley, 2003). Biological surveys will help refine models to re-flect key biotic as well as abiotic variables.Review and revision of management practices is the final step in an iterative process of revision of management based on modeling, scenarios, monitoring and survey. Model-ing results and management scenarios will suggest management practices to be re-viewed and revised. Examples of management practices that will often qualify for re-view are management of fire or other disturbance regimes, classification of 'sensitive'areas, and management for 'representative'species. Fire and other disturbance regimes are often intensively managed in protected areas. These management practices will interact with climate change effects in ways that may not beapparent without careful monitoring. Fire may maintain certain vegetation types past theirclimatic optimum, or, if managed uncritically, suppress new vegetation types that are be-coming climatically favored. For example, in Central Canada, long-grass prairie is pre-dicted to be climatically favored over present forest types in future warmer climates (Scottand Suffling, 2000). Fire suppression may retard this transition. Fire management there-fore has an effect that must be judged against regional conservation goals\u2014either mainte-nance of forest or promotion of grassland in newly suitable climate space. Sensitive areas form an important part of management in many protected areas. Cli- mate change will introduce a new class of sensitive areas. Climate change-driven alter-ations in range or abundance may render once resilient species sensitive. Rapid rangeshifts may make robust systems sensitive. Changes in disturbance regime may createnew or recovering vegetation sensitive to many types of use. Non-analogue communi-ties may arise with unknown sensitivity requiring conservative management until theyare more fully understood. Heavy tourist traffic may facilitate dispersal of invasivespecies into areas vulnerable because they are in transition to new vegetation types.These and other climate change sensitivities should be considered as sensitive areas aredesignated and managed. Many protected areas are established or managed to conserve 'representative'ecosys- tems that may no longer exist in future climates. Minor vegetational elements or evenoutlier pockets may become dominant vegetation types in the future. Site goals will bedifficult to set for changing vegetation without reference to regional trends and conser-vation goals. In the Central Canada example above, management for 'representative' forest is appropriate if the regional management goal is to retard biotic response to cli-mate change, while promoting fire to stimulate transition to long grass prairie is appro-priate if the regional goal is to allow natural transitions to take place while maintainingrepresentation goals in a flexible regional protected areas network. Many other man-agement issues will evolve from a systematic modeling, and management scenarioanalysis. Finally, almost all protected areas management plans have 3- to 10-year time horizons, which are insufficient to allow for anticipatory management responses to climatechange. A minimum appropriate planning time horizon for climate change is 50 years,while a 100-year horizon is necessary to capture many possible climate change effects.WWF 242BUYING TIME: A USER'S MANUAL 243 CHAPTER 9 Impact AssessmentsIncorporating sensitivity analysis and climate change management scenarios into a management plan will require that at least part of the management plan has a longertime horizon. Species range shifts, impacts of extreme events and resource asynchronies often occur on regional scales, so an effective management strategy includes mechanisms for coor-dinating conservation actions at the regional level. Regional coordination is necessaryfor conservation goals and management to be coherent on the same scale at which theseclimate change impacts will operate. Examples above show that managing for 'repre-sentative' vegetation is a relative term at the site level when climate is changing. Re-gional goals for representation can only be maintained in a dynamic climate when man-agement at multiple protected areas is harmonized (Rutherford et al., 1999). Thiscoordinated management may require formal agreements, for instance when nationalboundaries are crossed, or may simply involve appropriate planning within existing pro-tected areas systems and conservation agencies. Modeling and monitoring will often be more effective when coordinated within a re- gion. Monitoring must be done in a way that is relevant to management goals, so re-gional goals require regionally coordinated monitoring. Sharing technical and financialinputs for modeling across multiple users on a regional basis increases cost-effective-ness as well. Regional coordination will become increasingly important as climatechange progresses. In the short-term, identifying and establishing these collaborations isa priority. Peace Parks initiatives and other collaborative management efforts are alreadypaving the way for these systems. Collaborative Research Creation of a climate change-integrated conservation strategy requires synergy among anovel set of actors and funding sources. Conservation managers, biogeographers, ecolo-gists and climate change scientists are all needed to formulate an effective managementstrategy. Funding from research sources will be required for modeling and assessmentactivities with clear connections to applied conservation. Conservation agencies willneed to source funding for major new investments in monitoring and revision of man-agement practices. Creation of this synergy will carry a cost, and responding to the newchallenges of climate change to the conservation of biodiversity will require major newfinancial commitments. In a world filled with conservation challenges, managers will not be able to undertake all of the elements of climate change-integrated conservation strategies described herein the short term. What is important, is that managers, biogeographers and ecologistsbegin to consider the impacts of climate change in their area, and adopt at least some el-ements of a management strategy, progressively building capacity at the local level asthe challenges posed by climate change mount.Literature Cited Harley, C.D.G. 2003.
