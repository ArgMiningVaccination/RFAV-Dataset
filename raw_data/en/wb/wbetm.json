C a n d i d a t e U n i v e r s i t y o f W e s t e r n S y d n e yiii ABSTRACT by Sharon Bourgeois Chairperson of the Supervisory Committee: Dr Mary Greig School of Humanities The central concern of this thesis is the diversity of the discourses of caring within nursing knowledge. Drawing on three of the tools of 'Foucauldian archaeology', namely the statement, discursive formation and discourse, 'An Archive of Car ing for Nursing' is identified. At least three discourses comprise this Archive. These are 'caring as doing' and 'caring as knowing'. Ea ch discourse is described in the thesis and critically analysed for influences on contem porary nursing knowledge, education, theory, management and practice. Practice exemplars are utilised to elaborate the conflict between the author's discursive posit ion and the positions of other nurse practitioners and educators. The thesis contributes to nursin g knowledge, nurse education and practice. How nurses are positioned with in discourses of caring and how they resist within these discourses, is especially sign ificant for nursing's future. iv TABLE OF CONTENTS AN ARCHIVE OF CARING FOR NURSING ______________________________ i Abstract ________________________________________________________________iii Table of Contents _____________________________________________________ Introduction ________________________________________________2 Introduction __________________________________________________________2 History of Ideas: Caring ________________________________________________8 Ideas Related to the Etymology of Care _____________________________________________8 Caring Influences in Modern Nursing: Florence Nightingale ____________________________14 Caring Perspectives: Early Colonial Days of Australia _________________________________20 Caring Influences Parallel to the Nightingale System in Colonial Australia _________________25 Caring: Contemporary Perspectives ______________________________________27 Caring as Unique to Nursing _____________________________________________________27 Caring and Research ___________________________________________________________36 Caring and Nursing Theory ______________________________________________________39 Caring and the Profession _______________________________________________________47 Conclusion ______________________________________________________________49 Chapter ogical of Caring ________________________86 v Methodology: Caring Linked to Foucauldian Concepts in the Nursing Literature 138 SECTION II- An Archive of Caring for Nursing __________________________153 Chapter 3: Caring as Being ___________________________________________157 Introduction ________________________________________________________158 Description of the Discourse: Four Elements _____________________________159 Element 1).

Sydney 28 February 2006 xi PREFACE Two different practice-related experiences have motivated me to undertake this study of caring. The first experience arose out of conversations with fellow nurses who worked in different contexts of nursing from myself. These nurses unsettled me when they would voice criticism about my field of nursing by claiming that they were more caring than nurses who work in the operating theatre. Consequently, I start ed to question why some nurses would claim their role to be more ca ring than others. From my perspective, as nurses we all have the same goals. That is, we all work to satisfy patient needs regardless of the context of nursing (the wards, the intensiv e care units, or operating theatres, etc.). In my view, caring applies e qually to all facets of nursin g regardless of the practice context. During these conversations, I also realised that some of my peers held the view that caring in their contexts of practice was more va luable, important and es sential than in my practice. They never went so far as to say that I d on't care for my patients. But they certainly made it clear to me that my approach to caring was not to be valued in the same way as theirs. Their voices were tinged with a lack of respect for the caring that occurs in the perioperative context1. I had obviously taken someth ing for granted that was now being called into question and I soon became aware that my view of caring and that of nurses outside of the perioperative contex t were not the same. I value caring in my nursing practice and I firmly believed that caring undertaken within the perioperative 1 Perioperative nursing refers to the roles of nurses who are e mployed in the operating theatre suite of a hospital. Examples of roles include scrub nurse, scout nurse, postanaest hetic care (recovery) nurse. Sometimes perioperative nursing is referred to as operating theatre nursing. xii environment can be equated with the caring that my peers provided f or their patients. Realising that these different perspectives a bout caring exist was one stimulus for me to seek to understand why debate s about caring exist. Indeed, this has led me to formulate the questions to which I sought understanding throughout this st udy. Central to an understanding of these nurses' views is recogn ising what caring actually means to nurses. In particular, it became ap parent that vast differences exist in our perceptions, attitudes and values toward technology and relat ionships. To start with, my peers continually emphasised that they viewed my practice as technologically based. For them, the very fact that I work primarily with equipment, machines and instruments meant that caring was not occurring. These nu rses could not envisage caring occurring in the perioperative context as it exists in ot her nursing contexts because the nurse-patient relationship here primarily involves unconscious patients. Many of the nurses that I had discussed caring with had stated that perioperative nurses prefer to work with things rather than peopl e\u2014that they are not in a caring role and do not offer the empathy that other nurses would offer. These peer s emphasised that verbal communication and the relationship they have with the patient who is 'awake', was one of the key elements that demonstrated caring for them. However, for those of us in the perioperative context, this form of commun ication is not essentia l for caring to be occurring. Communication is an important part of caring during a patient's 'awake' phase, but caring means more than this. I felt strong ly that caring included being an advocate for the patient during surgery. Caring involved protecting the patient's body, the patient's xiii privacy, and the patient's rights during th eir perioperative passage. These passionate exchanges with my peers emphasised how diffe rently we viewed th e meaning of caring and complicated my view about cari ng in nursing. On a purely personal level th ese discussions annoyed me! I enjoyed my field of nursing and became irritated with the portrayal of perioperative nurses as technocrats and noncaring nurses. I continually felt that in co nversations, I had to defend my role and my identity as a caring perioperative nurse. Thes e heated discussions, with their associated passion, became one of the mo tivating influences for me to undertake this study. The second practice-related experience motiva ting me to undertake this study arose from the push to employ technicians instead of re gistered nurses in anaesthetics (Peters and Laxford 1995:21). I attribute these changes in employment to the different ways that caring is viewed. On the one hand, I have personally witnesse d the employment of technicians to work as assistan ts for anaesthetists in operating theatres within hospitals, in New South Wales. On the other hand, I have al so seen nurse managers resist a push by medical officers and administrators to employ technicians and take a stand by insisting that registered nurses are employed to care for patients undergoing anaesthesia. From my practice-perspective2 as a nurse who has worked in the role of anaesthetic nurse, there are differences between the anaesthetic technician 's work and the anaesthetic nursing role. Registered nurses employed in the anaestheti c role fulfil caring nursing roles which are crucial to providing quality, competent, standard s of nursing care. Technicians are not nurses and therefore nursing is not enacted. Competence quality an d standards for these 2 Practice-perspective is a term I use that encompasses my vi ews, actions, behaviours, values and attitudes developed from my education and experiences as a nurse. xiv contrasting roles therefore are not measured ac ross the same criteria . The nursing role is far more expansive; it inco rporates specialist knowledge, has different lines of communication. It encompasses a complex and valuable role compared t o the technician. The anaesthetic registered nurs e focuses on caring for the patient, a complex nursing role that involves utilising expe rience, knowledge and expertise. Of course equipment, machinery and technology are utilised, but thes e are tools for nursing and not the focus. As a result, I believe that the employment of technicians at the cost of nursing staff does a great disservice to patients. Other influences that have led me to undertake this study include my interest in theories of nursing, in the education of students and my participation in further educational studies. Through these influe nces, I have been privileged to access literature, ideas and debates. As a consequence I have recognised the need to investigate how nurses understand caring itself. In this context of difference and debate about caring there exists a theoretical distancing of perioperative nursing. The pe rioperative literature contains only a small set of articles that link caring and the perioperative nurs e (Parsons, Kee et al. 1993; McNamara 1995; Murphy 1995; Parsons 1995; Riley and Manias 2002). Nurses in the pe rioperative context do not talk about their contex t of practice from the perspective of caring, nor do they write about it. Perioperative nurses write prim arily from the perspect ive of what nurses do. That is, about procedures, policies, te chniques, standards and education (Howery 1997; Riley and Manias 2002). In addition to this theoretical distancing, the work environment for perioperative nurses is one that is closed to outsiders. Conseque ntly, these nurses are xv separated from the usual discourses that occur within various nursing contexts, and several barriers are in place that prevent nurses from interac ting as a group. These barriers include the intensive scheduling of operations, staffing constraints and the requirement to change attire when perioperative nurses visit other areas in a hosp ital. We see then that the nature and function of the perioperative en vironment place these nurses in a position different to other nurses. Several views relating to how nurses are positioned in the operating t heatre have been put forward by Robin Riley and Elizabeth Manias . These ideas include the proposition that perioperative nurses do not fully understa nd their own roles of practice. There is controversy about whether nurses in this en vironment are indeed nursing, and debate occurs about whether nurses should be presen t in the operating theatre at all (2002:316). Given that these ideas are presented about nurses from within their ow n specialty area, we can see why nurses outside of this context of pra ctice find it difficult to see the caring that perioperative nurses attest is present in their practice. We see then in the perioperative literature the documentation of procedures asso ciated with different nursing roles, policies to promote nursing, educationa l sessions for students and st aff, and the application of specialty standards for the perioperative nurse co nsistent with expert practice rather than expressions of caring (Howery 1990; Schmekel 1991; Waugfaman, Inc. 2001; Chiarella 2002). I have come to realise that caring has been both institutionalised and sanctified. On the one hand it has been extensively described by very influential nurses like Jean Watson, Madeleine Leininger and Patricia Benner. On the other hand, there are other nurses who xvi do not have the view that caring is exclusi ve to the pheno menon of nursing (Huch 1995). That is, they view ca ring as a phenomenon that is shared with other health care professionals. Caring is a contested site in the nursing literature (Leininger 1985; 1986; Bishop and Scudder Jr. 1991; Huch 1995). Many ideas, mo vements and theories have been generated, but clearly there is a lack of agreement about ho w caring should be defined (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990; Swanson 1999; Paley 2001). These premises have led me to rethink the very idea of caring and to consider the way that nurses understand how they see and speak about caring. What is it th at is being said and what is visible in practice? An investigation of caring is clearly needed. This thesis does not however seek to reiterate what caring is or what caring is not. A large body of literature about caring, which has developed from a spiralling interest in caring as evidenced by theses, publications, conference presentations, policy developments and codes for nurses, already exists in the field of nursing. Nor does this thesis take a position in th e debate about ca ring. What is necessary is to make sense of caring as a discursive concep t, because this would offer a new perspective on the understanding of caring\u2014o ne where the nurse is shifted from the centre of meaning to the subject of discourse of caring. I wish to understand why a debate in nursing about caring exists, why nurses present caring differe ntly and what conditions are involved in perpetuating or stopping the discussion. Caring as a concept appears in many differe nt discourses and its meaning is determined by its location within these discourses. The meanings of caring th at are appropriate to different fields and practices influence these fields, practices and discourses. In order to understand caring, I want to be aware of the relations between caring and politics, history, xvii power and institutional forces that are operat ing in nursing. I aim to open up a space about caring that has not been entered into be fore and to map the landscape of this space. In doing this, my analysis w ill incorporate where and when ideas about caring surface, who presents these ideas, what gives these people the right to sp eak about caring and how these ideas are transplanted and transported across the world. I want to identify what it is that allows these ideas about caring to contin ue. My intention is to identify the dominant views about the understanding of caring as it relates to the context of nursing. I have said that I have adopted a discursive approach for caring as my area of concern. This approach is based on the work of Michel Foucault, in particular his classic study The Archaeology of Knowledge (1972). In this work, Foucau lt elaborates some key terms\u2014 archaeology, discourse and the archive\u2014which I have found useful to u nderstand nurses' views of caring. Foucauldian archaeology is an approach that allows for the \"... analysis of verbal performances\" (Foucault 1972:206). That is, it specif ies what can be said, what allows us to say what we say, what rules are in play at the time we speak and what gives us the right to speak from where we do. Th e use of archaeology renders viable the establishment of norms in the knowledge described (caring) and throu gh an analysis of statements, archaeology sets about establishing the rules that allow for the formation of discourses (Foucault 1972:207). By understa nding caring knowledge through the use of archaeology, my intent is not to enter th e debates about caring but to show how the debates themselves have come about. An archaeological analysis of the terms and conditions which the debates have been cond ucted is not a genealogy (Foucault's later Kendal l and Wickham 1999), because genealogies do enter the debates around power/knowledge relations in nursing. A genealogical approach which focuses on power/knowledge relations in instit utions is valuable if the archaeological xviii groundwork is done. This thes is contributes the archaeological groundwork of caring in the discipline of nursing. Discourse is a particularly valuable approach for understanding car ing. It has history, meaning, truth, and can be trea ted as a practice (Foucault 1972:127). Discourses create the world that they represent. Crucially for Foucault, there is no one true discourse, (1972:70). It appears that for nurses though, caring is viewed as one discourse (Heslop and Oates 1995; Huch 1995; Paley 2001). Di scourse is the gene ral domain of all statements that are individualisable as a grou p with regulated practice s that acco unt for all statements making up the discourse (Foucault 1972:80). It is thes e individualisable groups with regulated practices (discourses of caring ) that I seek to iden tify in this thesis. For statements to become meaningful in di scourse, a system of what Foucault calls functioning occurs (1972:128). This system termed the 'archive' (Foucault 1972:128) \"... differentiates discourses in their multiple existence and specifie s them in their own duration\" (Foucault 1972:129). The archiv e defines a practice that allows many statements to emerge as regula r events and to be transforme d, thus allowing ideas about what can be said to be counted as usual or norm al. This thesis then seeks what is usual or normal. In acknowledging what is usual and normal about caring for nurses, this thesis identifies and describes those discourses th at comprise the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing' through the employment of archaeologic al analysis. xix Essentially, this st udy can be termed a problematisation3 of caring (Gutting 1994:37), that is, this study is an examination of the arch ive behind the 'caring nurse'. This involves studying those practices (which could be view ed as experiences) that make caring an object of thought and encourages an individual to recognise or understand themself as a 'caring nurse'. I wish to understand how nurs es see, speak, and write about caring; how they understand caring. Nu rses understand themselves and their practice in ways consistent with their beliefs and views, dependent on the caring par adigms that make sense for them. As mentioned above, I have come to realise through archaeology that there is not one sole discourse of caring operat ing. On the contrary, an 'Archive of Caring for Nursing' exists. As we will se e within this 'Archive of Cari ng for Nursing' there are at least three discourses of caring operating. These discourses I have labelled, 'caring as being', 'caring as doing' and 'caring as knowing'. I began this preface with an explanation of my motivation for writing this thesis. These motivators arose from two distinct sets of experiences. The fir st came about following conversations with fellow nurses who criticized perioperative nur sing practice from the perspective of caring. The second related to bureaucratic and mana gement practices whereby registered nurses are being replaced by technicians to work with the Anaesthetist in the operating theatre. These motivators, together with other influences, led me to believe that the way nurses speak, see and unde rstand caring can be markedly different. It was the ideas associated with how nurses speak of and understand ca ring that drew me to investigate caring using the tools associat ed with archaeology (Foucault 1972). 3 Problematisation, while it commenced in Foucault's work on arc haeology, is a term that draws more on his later work, the \"charting of experience\" (Gutting, 19 94:37) and the thinking of the problem rather than the que stion. Therefore, events that are relevant to the problem (the caring nurs e) their transformation and di splacement, the strategies exhibited and the truth games involved are warranted as objects o f investigation. xx Turning now to mark caring as the central concern of my thesis, the following chapter in Section I introduces the idea of caring and lays out a care ful set of contextual factors within which archaeology is situated. A framew ork that examines caring from a historical perspective from the mid twentieth century forw ard is used. Chapter 2 explains the thesis as archaeology, an investigation into the stat ements, discourses and discursive formations that form caring knowledge for nursing. The archaeology reveals the conditions which make possible the appearance of changes to theory in different disciplines, policies specific to institutions and educational programs that value particular professional practices. Firstly, I introduce Foucault an d the metaphor of arch aeology, providing a detailed theoretical discussion of this notion (1972). In partic ular, I discuss archaeological tools\u2014the statement, discourse and discursi ve formation. Following this, a discussion ensues about the approach I have adopted to pe rform an archaeological analysis of caring from the nursing literature. Finally, examples of how nurses have used Foucault illustrate his influence in relation to caring in the nursing literature. The following three chapters (3, 4, 5,) are discussions drawn fro m the archaeological analysis. Each of thes e chapters describe s a named discourse that formulates the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing': 'caring as being', 'car ing as doing' and 'car ing as knowing'. The framework for the discussion about each of th ese discourses follows a similar pattern. Firstly, the elements of the discourse, as derived from the analysis of statements and discursive formations (these terms are addressed in depth in the archaeology chapter), are identified and examples, drawn from the literatur e, serve to illustrate each element. Then for each discourse, is sues pertinent and influential to nursing within the individual discourses are elaborated thro ugh analytical discussion. xxi In order to elaborate on and to contextualise caring, this thesis deploys personal accounts of experiences as a way of showing how caring operates. In fact, acco unts of my practice- perspective appear at the begi nning of each chapter. These accounts serve to illustrate, describe and to assist the reader to make sens e of ideas that are presented within the three discourses. Each account is presented as an anecdote and is drawn from different facets of my nursing practice over ma ny years. They refl ect various nursing ro les from my career including for example, clinician within the perioperative context and lecturer within the higher education sector. The final chapter concludes that three discon tinuous well-bounded discourses of caring exist within the 'Archive of Caring for Nurs ing'. The thesis is not constructed around a genealogy. The literature provides examples of the valuable work already undertaken about power/knowledge re lations in nursing. This thesis fills the gap in Foucauldian approaches to knowledge deve lopment by providing an exam ple of an archaeological examination of caring, the critical ground work required for info rming genealogies of caring in the future. 1SECTION I- BACKGROUND, CARING AND METHODOLOGY 2Chapter 1: Introduction Introduction Within the context of nursing, the central concern of this thes is is how caring is viewed. I have already indicated my personal motivation for this thesis in the prefa ce and in introducing this term I acknowle dge that the concept of caring is highly valued in nursing. A plethora of writings in the nursing literature is evidence that caring can be seen to have derived from research, from descriptive an alysis, and from theoretical perspectives. However, despite the multitude of these publ ished entities, caring for many nurses continues to be a confused phenomenon and the analysis of what caring really means to nurses as a group has proved to be elusive (Paley 2001). How is caring understood by nurses who work within different areas of nursing practice? Caring means different things to nurses and an extensive body of literature about caring characterises nursing in many Watson 2003). It is understood from differing contexts and perspectives, and nurses take diverse positions in regard to its value. Impor tantly, nurses do not agree on a definition of caring for nursing, nor how caring contribu tes to nursing knowledge and practice (Huch 1995). As a phenomenon, theory and practice, cari ng is spoken about in nursing as if it is an agreed upon idea, even though nurses them selves may not be cognisant of the different ways that caring is viewed nor self-reflexive on the contested nature of the concept and of the plurality of interpreta tions of the term. What is visibl e about caring may or may not be 3understood through the statements and arrang ements of visible pra ctices. For all these reasons caring can be seen as a contested site for nursing, and coming to an un derstanding of this is what this thesis is about. I have already indicated in my preface that th e work of Foucault (1972) is integral to the approach taken in this thesis , to understand and to analys e caring,. His conceptual tools for archaeological analysis provide a systemat ic approach with which to analyse concepts, ideas, practices, themes and statements about ca ring (together referred to as 'elements' in this thesis) and to propose for nurses a new way of understanding how they see, speak and write about caring. A Foucauldian approach allows one to consider that caring is not just one discourse, as nurses currently proj ect, but that caring is in reality several discourses\u2014this thesis identifies three discours es of caring: 'caring as being', 'caring as doing', caring as comprise the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'. Recognising and understanding th at caring means different th ings to nurses and working with these disparities about ca ring, provides nurses with a means to come to terms with their nursing practice from a newly info rmed perspective\u2014as a way of knowing. In working through this analys is of understanding caring, the materials for this research are purposefully selected. In keeping with th e work of Foucault, I am looking at things people say and write through th e selection of events and the telling of tales about caring practices in nursing. The documentations of caring that have been selected from the nursing literature are those readily available to the author from the 1970s forward; a dynamic period in which nursing has undergon e substantial change an d has been affected by much significant advancem ent and a proliferation of ideas. These advances and changes have considerably influenced caring in nursing. 4Within this period of adva ncement and change (the 1970s forward), institutional and bureaucratic processes, policies, technologie s and strategies have been imposed without consideration of how caring is recognised as a sensible and commonsensical concept for nurses. In the traditional sense (history of ideas, science), the history of caring is concerned with the already given, recognisable by facts, dates, events where the definition of relations between the facts of events provides a continuity of ideas for history (Hoy 1986:223). Facts and events cont ribute to the idea that cari ng is a phenom enon\u2014one that is assumed to have a shared meaning and has historical significance. Caring, when viewed from the perspective of a hist ory of ideas is built upon what was known. New \"truths\" are added to existing bodies of knowledge; deve loping, clarifying, refining and progressing knowledge (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:19; Hynes 2005:1). In contrast to this notion of continuity of id eas, Foucault's archaeological method (1972) does not focus on tracing the continuities of ideas but analyses discontinuities in the history of thought (Hynes 2005:1) and the in cidence of interruptions that suspend these discontinuities (Foucault 1972:4). For nurses, to recognise and to understand that caring is not a continuously developed body of knowledg e that has been developed from the past but is one that can be analysed through archaeology provides the potential to change the ways that they see, speak and write about ca ring. It has the possibility to change the face of nursing by questioning the system of knowledge created a bout nursing. The aim of this thesis therefore is to systematically analyse ac counts of caring in the nursing literature to determine discourses of caring that are evident. Before taking up the ideas asso ciated with caring discourses , to provide a background and to illuminate caring for the reader, the follow ing section explores caring ideas. The ideas 5presented can be seen to have contributed to continuities of knowledge. The section has not been written as a literature review but is provided here to si tuate and contextualise caring. The ideas provide examples of \"truths\" in the traditional history of ideas that add to the understanding of caring. To begin this background sectio n, I start by drawing on etym ological findings that give insight into indicative aspects of how caring is viewed. From this viewpoint, we see how in different periods, as documented in histor ical writings, care has meant different things to many people. While this discussion se ction draws on document ed historical and etymological references, the following historic al discussion focuses more on insights and the background of modern nursin g and colonial nursing in Aust ralia rather than on a full historical discussion. As the fo cus of this thesis is situated on care in the context of Australian nursing from the 1970s forward, hi storical reference is only drawn from the immediately preceding historical period. That is, the advent of modern nursing (Doheny, Cook et al. 1987:9) and its ea rly development in Colonial A ustralia. This is where my historical limit is drawn. While a historical perspective of caring from the onset of modernity would be intere sting, this is not my project. Ra ther, given that the thesis has its grounding in Australia, wherever possible, Au stralian history is expl ored as a context and background and Australian nursing illustration s are utilised to colour and exemplify the discussions. Following the discussion of etymological and historical references, a more structural account incorporating contemporary ideas of cari ng is presented. Debate about caring as a phenomenon in the nursin g literature has been ex tensive and dynamic. This is partly due to interest generated about it as a recognised phenomenon importan t to nursing and 6partly due to theoretical and research deve lopments contributing to continuities of knowledge. Access to nursing literature has become more interconnected worldwide and discussions about caring have become more profound for nurses. Caring conferences have added to the expansive knowledge about caring (Gaut 1993). Directives generated by nurses, for nurses, to research and advance caring in nursing ha ve further perpetuated these developments. The effect of this body of nursing literature, together with the caring conferences, contributes to an understanding and reconceptualisation of caring as a critical concept (Davies and Lynch 1995:385). Not ever y contemporary idea is discussed in this preliminary section, but those identified are significant to stateme nts generated in relation to the three discourses of caring that have been identified in this thesis. Ideas such as modern nursing and the new fronti er of colonial Austra lian nursing are both influential and contributory to this thesis beca use of what Foucault re fers to as bodies of knowledge. Disciplines (nursing ), institutions (health care facilities\u2014hospitals, clinics), discourses (caring) and practitioners (nurses) have been influential in the refinement of knowledge about caring in nursing. That is, th e order of things for bodies of knowledge of caring is based on the rela tion between ideas of principles, methods, classifications, reasons and a body of practices in nursing (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:19). These all work to make speech possible, to organise concepts and ideas of ca ring and to help produce objects of knowledge such as the caring nurse (Foucault 1972:44; Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:22). How we describe th e caring nurse depends upon the discipline, commentary and the author (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:22) and one' 1972:4; Merquior 1985:17; Davidson 1986:221). 7I turn now to discuss caring, focusing firstl y on references drawn from the etymology of care, then I move on to disc uss historical caring influences in modern nursing, caring perspectives from Colonial Australia an d contemporary perspectives of caring. * * * 8History of Ideas: Caring Ideas Related to the Etymology of Care Caring in nursing has a long history. The aim of this section is to provide an historical perspective of caring drawing from e tymological references to care. The references show that usage and understanding of ca ring in today's language can be seen to be influenced by history. Furthermore, history provides examples of the generation of different ideas than can all be unders tood as caring. Several early references to care arising from the Old En glish language are cited in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970 ), and some of these early references continue today in the modern dictionaries (Pearsall 2001) . Interestingly, it is care and not 'caring' as a conc ept that is defined in these early citations. Reference to caring is not evident in Eng lish dictionaries or in nursing and allie d health (Delbridge evident in dictionaries and thesau ruses. Care, as the primarily referred to concept is for the most part used in the form of a verb (to care for a patient or to perform care on a patient). Ca re in the Thesaurus (T ardif 1985:188), aligns the noun form with such words as \"medical tr eatment, job, protection, work ... \" . The word \"caring\" as presented in seen in the ad jective form as \"kind\" (Tardif 1985:189) and \"care for\" with words such as mind, take pains, nurse and fuss over\" (Tardif 1985:189). These words used in language fr om early times (Mu rray, Bradley et al. 1970:115) only marginally refl ect how care and caring are written about in the nursing 9literature today. Examples in the nursing literature show that the meaning of care and caring has changed to also re present actions, behaviours, themes, constructs, feelings, emotions, or a role in society. Far from a continuity of idea s being represented, etymologically based findings show that there are discontinuit ies in the way that care has been derived. Interruptions to the cont inuities of thought therefore suspend the accumulation of knowledge and the ability to trace care back to its origin (Foucault 1972:4; Hynes 2005:1). From a history of ideas perspective, the tracing of the meaning of ca re through literature and verse shows that various la nguage forms are evident. 'Car e', as derived from Original Teutonic and Old Englis h forms, is noted as caru, or cearu. An Old Saxon form was cara, and a Gothic form was known as kara. Obsolete versions of ca re (evidenced around 1250) related to \"mental suffering, grief and trouble or an utterance of sorrow\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115). Care also took the meaning of a \"burdened state of mind arising from fear, doubt or concern about anything; solicitude, anxiety, or mental perturbation\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115). To be in care was to be \"troubled, anxious or concerned\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115). Another tran slation example of the above forms of care is \"serious or grave mental attention; the changing of anything; concern; ntion, regard; 1970:115). From this definition, \"To have a care, keep a care, take care\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115) evolved; it emerged in 1588 and 1590 in Shakes peare's writings. Care was reported to mean \"charge; oversight with a vi ew to protection, preservation, or guidance\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115). Arising fr om this version was \"To have the care of, to take care of\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:11 5), which was visible in 1579. Today this form can be seen in the literature where one is concerned about or for a nother. Historically, 10another definition identifies care as an \"object or matter of care, concern or solicitude\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115). In addition to the above, early forms of 'car e', there are further variations such as the forms \" carian\", \"cearian\", \"carien\", \"car\", \"kar\", \"care \" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115), from Common Teutonic. These variations show how the history of ideas takes meaning from origins and how different definitions of ca re are being used. Definitions include to \"mourn, sorrow, have trouble, trouble oneself\" (M urray, Bradley et al. 1970:115). Evident in literature around 1230, was th e meaning of care as \"to care for, to take thought for, provide for, look after , to take care of\" (Murray, Brad ley et al. 1970:115). Later, in 1536, evidence of care was reported as \"To feel conc ern (great or little), be concerned, trouble oneself, feel interest\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115). What we see here then is not a continuity of thought but evidence of interrupt ions; that the history of a concept is not a continuous accumulation of knowledge (Foucault 1972:4). In 1593, care was identified to mean \"to be careful, to take care\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115-6). In the negative an d conditional construc tion, 'not to care ' passes from the notion of \"not to trouble onesel f\" to \"not regard\" attention to\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115). In othe r words the negative form of an action was used. These forms, including the negative co nstruction, persist in examples drawn from the nursing literature that have been used fo r analysis in this thesis. They will become evident in later chapters when I describe each of the three discourses of the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'. 11To this point, I have looked at the word care as it stands alone in the OED , but when we examine care in concert with nurse, changes can be seen in the meanings of the word beginning around 1425. The Middle English fo rm of nurse was described as \"one who takes care of, looks after, or advises anot her\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:265), whereas \"at nurse\" by 1557 had the meaning \"in the care or charge of a nurs e\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:265); later, it also si gnified the actions of a wet nurse. To \"put to nurse\" had the meaning to commit to the care of a nurse an d shows in Shakespeare's writing in 1593 (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:265). This form depicts the role of the nurse as one who manages, who has care of the other or perf orms the action of care . This action of the nurse, according to definitions from the OED includes to: \"suckle, and otherwise attend to\", or \"to take care or charge of, to be reared or brought up in a certain place\", or \"to be brought up under certain conditions, in a cert ain environment; to foster, tend, cherish (a feeling) in one's heart; to brin g or rear up with care; to wait upon; attend to (a person who is ill), to try to cure (an illness) by taking ca re of oneself; to perfor m the duties of a sick- nurse (as in Florence Nightingale 1861)\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:115; Leininger 1981b:9). Here we have referenc es to care that reflect the mo thering or nurturance role of women in society, the role of women in caring for the sick and the societal expectations one would have of a nurse. Parallels can be drawn with today's literatur e on caring. For example, we can see the citations above in the followin g statements: caring is nursin g (Leininger 1985; Nay 1998), nursing acts of care (Watson 1979; Gaut 1986; Fe aly 1995), attitudes of caring (Clarke and Wheeler 1992; Swanson 1993), feelings of caring (Bevis 1981; Kuhse 1993), caring relationships (Fry 1989; Janho nen 1993), caring as nurture (Dunlop 1986; Dunlop 1994), to name a few. As seen through Shakespeare's writings, the nurs e is viewed as \" A person, 12generally a woman, who attends or waits upon the sick; now esp. on e properly trained for this purpose\" (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970:265). Much as etymologies can demonstrate discontinuities in knowledge an d understanding, this definition from Shakespeare's time does show that the outlines of a contemporary understanding of the lin kage of \"nurse\" with \"caring\" had emerged by the late si xteenth century. The above Shakespearean example, elaborates the type of person involved in the nu rsing role at the time. It accentuates the training of the nurse and draw s together care and the nurse by examining the role of the nurse as well as the function of care. Viewing care from a history of ideas is difficult , given that it is fraught with discontinuities in the history of thought. From this perspect ive however, 'care' has had a presence in early English forms from around the year 1000. It has been used with various meanings in the literature, especially since the 1500s, and these historical references to care continue to be apparent in today's publications about caring in nursing. However, the way that nurses describe and define caring today is more expansive than those ideas which have been presented in the etymological survey. Care and Other Key Words Moving on to today's nursing literature, and to examine the association of care with other words, we see that care is viewed as the diam etric opposite to 'cure' (Colliere 1986; Moccia 1988). Where care is relegated to nursing an d allied health care, cure is aligned to medicine, therefore establishing a dichotomy fo r many nurses where care and cure exist in structural opposition to each other (Wat son 1999b). The etymological foundation carefully distinguishes the sepa rate origins of care and cure . As Dunlop (1986:662) states: 13 'Care' comes from the English ian' denoting in the verbal form 'to trouble oneself', whereas 'cure' comes from the Latin via French (cur\u00e9 in France is still a priest). The body of nursing literature presents care and cure as opposites. The cl aim for care however, is more expansive and is reflected in the language of many health professionals. Cure remains medically oriented even though ca re is also a recognised part of medicine, but it has not been identified to the same ex tent as it has for nurs ing. For some nurses (and as seen for the nurses identified in the preface) owning care is imp ortant (Watson 1979; 1985; Leininger 1988; Huch 1995). However, t h i s c l a i m f o r c a r e i s a l s o m a d e b y health professionals and lay persons as an ap proach to health and healing (Watson 1999b) and therefore some nurses assert that care cannot belong to nurses alone (Huch 1995). Care as Compound Nouns The association of care with other words in today's nursing language has meaning when it is used as compound nouns. For example, nu rses use the terms \"car e 1996:71), et al. 2000), care\" (Chao 1992), \"pastoral care \" (Nelson 1997), \"basic, fund amental or essential care\" (Kozier, Erb et al. 1989; Crisp and Taylor 200 1) and \"intensive care\" (Hogg 1994). These uses of care invariably mean the 'taking care of' in relation to the associated term\u2014as in the taking care of health in 'health care'\u2014 or the providing of care. Through the use of these terms in language, we are encouraged to dr aw an analogy to activities associated with the word care. These actions or activities are wh at nurses would do to 'care for' or 'to take care of' (for example, the pe rson or their health). These above terms are global terms and presented as nouns in the nursing literature, but in essence they portray the activities of 14the nurse. In addition, the terms 'nursing care' and 'caring' may b e used interchangeably, and the exact sense in which any of these is being used is rarely defined (Leininger 1981b:3; Lea and Watson 1996:71). This can be seen in nursing texts where nursing, nursing care and nursing practice are words that are exchanged t o mean the same (Kozier, Erb et al. 1989; Potter 1998). The same can be sa id for nursing and caring (Leininger 1986:3). What we begin to see then is that langua ge has greatly influenced caring as a concept. Compound nouns based on 'care' ar e a recent development for nursing but also the advent of modern nursing (attributed to Florence Nightingale)\u2014as I present below\u2014 has been influential in this regard. As seen above, the meaning of caring in the nursing literature is varied and derives from multiple sources. A continuous accumulati on of knowledge is not traceable through etymological writings and discontinuities in knowledge and understanding of caring exist. Caring Influences in Modern N ursing: Florence Nightingale History presents many examples of what is sa yable and visible about caring in nursing. It presents unities of human knowledge that are accepted in history an d tradition (Mulligan 2003:429). An example is the history that surrounds the endeavours of Florence Nightingale. Credited with the founding of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale is considered as the symbol for nursing, a feat that continues in her legacy in that nurses today celebrate International Nurses Day on the day of her birth (Doheny, Cook et al. 1987:9). During her time, pub lic interest in health bega n to be demonstrated among various groups; doctors, clergy and philanthropic citizens advoc ated for the establishment of different systems to care for the sick (Donahue 1985:238 ) and within this process Nightingale's work made a majo r contribution to health outcomes (Dingwall, Rafferty et 15al. 1988:37). While her endeavours are contextu alised within nursing, it is essentially Florence Nightingale who initiated changes to caring for people not only in Victorian England but influentially worl d wide, including Australia. While she is credited with instigating the development of modern nursing, the literature places her as a Victorian ideal, a compassionate care giver and an in fluential change agent for health care and nursing (Hobbs 1997:55). Nursing depends on Nightingale as an ideal to enunciate its history (Buchanan 1999:30). As an icon fo r modern nursing, Florence Nightingale continues to be a reference for students enroll ed in nursing programs especially from the perspective of historical changes, theoretica l ideas, nursing practice and professional development (Pesut 2004:16). Florence Nightingale held a priv ileged position in society that allowed her to have access to persons in prominent societal positions, to travel extensivel y and to be heard (Dingwall, Rafferty et al. 1988:38; Godden 1995:244). In a period (mid-1800s) when nursing was not regarded as a respected profession for women, she visited many hospitals, studied various nursing systems and advocated for education and caring in nursing. Her own nurse training in 1851, at the Kaiserwerth in Germ any, did not occur until after she had already practised nursing in English hospitals (Donahue 1985:240; Doheny, Cook et al. 1987:9). Following her three month period studying at Kaiserwerth, Floren ce Nightingale then continued her studies with the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul in Paris. These studies placed her in a position to undert ake the role of Superintendent for the 'Establishment for Gentlewome n during Illness' (Donahue 1985:241; Dingwall, al. 1988:40). This appointmen t provided Florence Nighting ale with the opportunity to put her theories into practice. Her goal for nurs ing was to change the so cial view of nurses 16from that personified by drunken, dirty wome n such as 'Sairy Gamp' to that of well educated caregivers (Donahue Cook et al. 1987:9; Bradshaw 1990; Godden 1995:245). Thus, her contribution to society involved cha nging how nurses in Victorian England were viewed, spoken about and thought of (Godden 1995:244; Darbyshire 2000:41). This issue remains a professional goal for nur ses. The image and educational status of the nurse are key profe ssional criteria for nursing and I return to them in the discussion about the discourses of caring in Chapter 5. Foucault (1972) insists that we should question what is normally accepted as history and knowledge. A major discursive sh ift took place in the period of Victorian English history, and the modern discourses of nursing are transf ormations of what occurred as a result of the Crimean War. From a position of pr ivilege, and possessing essential nursing knowledge, Florence Nightingale was appoin ted Superintendent of the Female Nursing Establishment of the English General Hospitals in Turkey. She departed for the base hospital at Scutari with a party of thirty-eight self-proclaimed nu rses\u2014of various experience\u2014to care for soldiers during the Crimean War (1854 to 56) (Donahue 1987:16; Hobbs 1997:42; Coat es 2000:118). Her strategic placement there was a result of a series of discursive events. One of these events was a war correspondent's report about the lack of care provided to the English soldiers. This report publicly compared the care provided to the French Army, who had sent along nursing sisters with their soldiers, to the la ck of care being given to British soldiers (Donahue 1985:242; Coates 2000:43). Histor ically, no women had cared for soldiers before, during English war ca mpaigns. The public outcry in response to the newspaper reports increased the pressure on the then Secretary of War in 1854, Sir Sidney Herbert., a friend of Florence Nightingale at whose requ est Florence Nightingale was placed in the 17Crimea (Coates 2000:89). Privat e funds, some collected by The Times newspaper were put at her disposal, thereby allowing her to circ umvent bureaucratic ch annels and to provide soldiers with much needed care (Doh eny, Cook et al. 1987:9; Hobbs 1997:52). Historical reports claim that Nightingale ch anged nursing care pra ctices. Her belief was that care of the ill person was to be undertaken by a partic ular type of person. Nurses were persons with specific traits who created a caring and helping atmosphere that in turn facilitated healing (Kom orita, Doehring et al. 1991:23). For Nightingale, this particular type of person was a woman, who was educat ed, was above reproach from doctors and who was trained in the practice of care. Historically, we see th at the care nurses provided to persons under Nightingale was different to the cure work undertaken by doctors (Godden 1995:241). Florence Nightingale's version of caring for patients was the enactment of several strategies during the Crimean war. One such strategy was to keep the environment clean (Coates 2000:241). Mattresses, linen and clothing were washed or boiled to remove maggots, insects, lice and vermin. Floors were scrubbed and the promo tion of light airy rooms became normal practice. Hygienic practi ces for patients, including the emptying of chamber pots, were essential. Another strategy related to physi cal body care in that patients were bathed, given nutritious meals an d were to be kept out of draughts (Coates 2000:126). The care of the mind of the ill was an important factor too. The mind needed to be rested, but also stimulated, and patients were moved to windows s o they could look out at the view. In addition, Florence Nightingale's instructions inc luded card games that assisted with the occupying of the mind. The writing of letters home helped soldiers to overcome their melancholy. A st rategy evident in he alth care facilities today was grouping 18 the ill as a measure of care. Fl orence Nightingale placed pati ents with the same illness together in the Crimean Hospita ls, affecting aseptic techniques and thereby changing care practices. Here we see the nurse is now viewed as one who is a carer of the environment, the physical body and the mind. Also, record keeping about care pract ices provided the documentation of care. It was this record keeping that allowed for t he comparisons and evidence of care that she4 later used to advoca te changed practices of caring for the sick and ill in political forums (Don ahue 1985:243; Coates 2000:96). Today, Florence Nighti ngale is viewed as an institution of nursing, as the epicentre of documented change. In her time, she was seen as a figure of authority and in her later years wrote two books that wer e aimed at educating society about caring practices, and which remained the dominant paradigm of care until the 1970s. She published the book entitled Notes on Nursing: What It Is and What It Is Not in 1859 (Nightingale 1946; Hobbs 1997:58). This influential book sold 15,000 copies in a very short period of time and is the most famous of her books. With revisions and additions, the te xt was repeatedly translated (into three languages) and rei ssued (Doheny, Cook et al. 1987; Hobbs 1997:58). The information for this book came from data Florence Nightingale coll ected during her nursing experiences, and laid down what it is to be a nurse. The book offered guidelines for attending to personal hygiene and about caring. She transcended the boundaries of hospital care, conveying ideas as sociated with caring for people in hospitals as well as helping them to live (Doheny, Cook et al. 1987:11). 4 Caring practices and changes that occurred during the Cr imean War were reported in the newspapers in England and Florence Nightingale had an avid public following based on her caring practices of soldiers. During her time at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, Florence Nightingale reduced t he mortality rate from 50% to only 2%. She was the first nurse, who, through the initiation of caring incorporating c leanliness and nutrition, demonstrated through documentation, proved that quality care made the differ ence between life and death.

London, The Stationery Office. 19 In Notes on Nursing (1859), Nightingale offers hints to women who have the personal charge of the health of othe rs (Donahue 1985; Hobbs 1997:58). Skills required for use by these carers, and the needs of invalids, are the major focus of her book, where she presents her views on care, on germ theory, and on women's role in the sickroom. She also emphasises nursing as health oriented. Th at is, nursing was to put people in the best condition for nature to restore or preserve heal th and to prevent or cu re disease or injury (Ray 1981:26). Nighting ale used this book and her popularity to ed ucate the public about sanitation issues and to endorse caring as a career that educated women could undertake (Hobbs 1997:58). Historically, nurses have long affirmed th at caring for people is their central focus (Euswas 1993:310). We see as a result of the endeavours of Fl orence Nightingale following the Crimean war and from her published books that the way pe ople were thinking a bout caring changed. Caring is associated with a new image; the nu rse is no longer a pers on of ill repute but a nurse like Florence Nightingale is depicted as an icon (Donahue 1985:244; Darbyshire 2000:41). Many of her suggestio ns for improving care for pati ents are eviden t in caring practices today. She stressed the ideas of fresh air, medicati ons, quiet, mobility, piped hot water, a call-bell system for patients, cleanliness, and comfort in the ho spitals, as well as educating the public concerni ng health and illness (Doheny, Cook et al. 1987:12). She directed the training of nurses, who were referred to as the 'Night ingale Nurses', in public health, public reform, and health prom otional aspects of nurs ing and care of the sick. (Donahue 1985; Doheny, Cook et al. 1987:12; Kozier, Er b et al. 1989). Her schools 20incorporated many of the educational practi ces she had seen at the Kaiserwerth and she developed the principles of nursing education. These principles included that the training school should be an educational institution supported by public funds and associated with a medical school. It should be affiliated with a teaching hospital, bu t also independent of it. Professional nurses should be in charge of administration and te aching. Her belief was that the school for nurses should be an educational and not a service in stitution for the hospital, an issue that was de bated for many years after Flor ence Nightingale's death. Much change was occurring in health care in Victorian England during Florence Nightingale's time. There were developments such as medical schools, hos pitals, clinics, and community agencies (Doheny, Cook et al. 1 987:12). Even with these changes, she still insisted that there should be a home for nurs ing students in order to maintain discipline and character (Notter & Spalding, 1976 in Do heny, Cook et al. 1987:12; Godden 1995). Nurses, in Florence Nightingale's view, are th ose with specific traits who create a caring and helping atmosphere which in turn will facilitate healing (Komorita, Doehring et al. 1991:23). Many of Florence Nightingale's id eas were still ev ident in the early 1970s. Drawing from my days of nurse training in Thames, New Zealand, we were compelled to live in the nurses' home, had restrictions placed on our freedom and we re obliged to follow the strict moral enfo rcing rules of the home. Caring Perspectives: Early Colonial Days of Australia Colonial Australia was influenced by Nighting ale and her efforts to promote caring and nursing education in Victorian England had an impact on the develo pment of nursing in Australia. Problems associated with caring pr actices in Australia stimulated changes to nursing and the arrival of tr ained nurses into colonial Australia (Stevens 2003:21). In 21England, Florence Nightingale received a letter from Henry Parkes , the then Colonial Secretary in Australia, requesting her to send out four nurses to establish the Nightingale system at Sydney In firmary (Bowd 1968:4; Borland 19 96:557; Russell 2000:12; Stevens 2003:22). The letter was prompted by the report of a Sub Co mmittee in 1865, which was highly critical of cond itions at the Infirmary and had stated that all the out buildings were \"in a filthy c ondition\" and \"the yard in a disgusting state\". The comforts for patients were of a very poor standard and the \"food is of an inferior description and is served up almost cold due to wretched kitchen accommodation\". The report concluded with the comment that it was \"now nine years since the Medical Officers called attention to the ne cessity for a more efficient system of nursing\" (Med ical Bill cited in Bowd, 1968:4). At this time, caring in Sydney, Colonial Au stralia was based on middle-aged untrained women who were considered to be slovenly an d lazy. They staffed th e Infirmary from six o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night. The wards were then locked for the night and a wardsman (usually a previous patient) slept in a small room adjacent to each ward (Bowd 1968:4; Heslop and Oates 1995:261). The women would leave patients to lie dirty, in unmade beds for weeks at a time with the excuse that \"the doctor said they were not to be disturbed\" (Florence Nightingale, Letters to Mary Barker , 1868 cited by Bowd, 1968, 4-5). Other descriptions of the cond itions refer to the state of accommodation for the ill. Here is an example cited by Bowd: 22The squalor of the wards was almost indescribable. They were extr emely dirty with old clothing hanging all ro und the beds. Old ra gs and rubbish of every conceivable nature was pushed under beds or crammed into corners and littered the ward genera lly. It is not to be wondered at that a patient once treated at the Infirmary could ne ver be induced to return (1968:5). It was as a result of these deplorable condit ions and low standards of care that Parkes appealed to Florence Nightingale. Because th ere were insufficient trained people to meet the requirements of English Hospitals, his request for nurses wa s not easy to fulfil. However, Florence Nightingale and Mrs Ward roper, Superintendent of the training school and Matron of St. Thomas' Hospital, London, decided that Sydney Infirmary, a hospital of 190 beds, would requ ire at least a Matron and five trained nurses. They then had to find volunteers to go to an unknown country, a pena l colony, on the other side of the world (Bowd 1968:5). Following the receipt of Parkes' letter, Miss 1836) from Gravesend on the December, 1867 (Bowd 1968:5; Stevens 2003:21). However, on thei r arrival in Sydney on the 5th March 1868, they found the promised accommodation was not ready. Lucy Osburn was al lotted a room in the hospital formerly used by a wardsman. She fo und it difficult to sleep that first night because of bedbugs and as a consequence the next day she arranged for herself and the other nurses to use an unoccupied part of the medical officers' q uarters. They remained in this accommodation until their new quart ers were completed in September, 1868, subsequently named 'T he Nightingale Wing' (Bowd 1968:5). 23The institution of nursing was drawn to publ ic attention one week after the Nightingale nurses arrived in Sydney. Lucy Osburn provided care to Th e Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Alfred, who was visiting Sydney, after he wa s wounded by a bullet fired by a demented Irishman (O'Farrell). Her caring for the Duke resulted in a subscri ption for the specific purpose of building a hospital known as th e Prince Alfred Hospital (Bowd 1968:6). This hospital (now refurbished) still stands today on its original site at Camperdown in Sydney, New South Wales and was one of the sites of my perioper ative teaching employment. These early colonial Australian days provided a challenge for nurses to care for patients. Although Lucy Osburn set about implementing the nursing system she had learned in London, she found that there were many impe diments to enacting caring processes. For example, as Bowd reports, there was a grave shortage of bed linen. When all the beds were made up with tw o ragged sheets, there were about thirty left over. In many cases daily changes were required, but this only became possible after Lucy Osburn and he r sisters had diligently ma de up sufficient sheets (1968:6). Other examples of an inability to care can be seen in the l etters written by Lucy Osburn. She wrote of the female ward as not having a toilet, a sink, nor a tap, and all the slops were emptied into a pail and carried throug h another ward to be emptied in the toilet containing one seat for fifty patien ts (Letter to Floren ce Nightingale from Lucy Osburn in 1868, cited in Bowd, 1968:7). Structural, physical and environmental conditio ns impacted se verely on the care that could be provided. Blame was placed on the old Governor Macquarie-era building. It had become so infected with germ s over the years that it was common for secondary infection 24to occur in the treatment of wounds. These conditions detracted fro m the system of care that the Nightingale Nurses were trying to implement following the example of Nightingale's advocacy of environmental cl eanliness\u2014a difficult task to achieve in Colonial Australia. Many graphic examples of the difficulty of caring experiences in early Australian history are documented (Bowd 1968:7). Obstacles includ ed buildings that housed the human louse, bed bugs and verm in; and managers who forbade the washing of walls. Any efforts by Lucy Osburn to ge t above these problems were undermined or forbidden, and a lack of control of the persons, patients and nurse s in her charge contributed to her lack of ab ility to be able to provide care as she had been instructed (Bowd 1968:7). Caring as instigated by Lucy Osburn progress ed after a Commission of Enquiry report in 1873, which investigated the Sydney Infirmary. This report completely vindicated and re- appointed Osburn as Superint endent of Nursing and gave her full management of the wards, patients, nursing, cooking and those persons engaged in the departments. Lucy Osburn continued on to establish the Nighti ngale system in Australia (Bowd 1968:2; Heslop and Oates 1995). The type of care provided by nurses by the late nineteenth century was a ... strenuous and constant round of spongin g, poulticing and positioning; before antibiotics and vaccines, intensive nurs ing was the only effective therapy for patients with infectious dise ases, such as typhoid fever, scarlet fever and influenza. Trained reliable nurses could be entrusted to care for these patients around the clock, and many lives were saved. The bene fits of efficient nurs ing were also seen in improved recovery of patients after surgery (Borland 1996:5 57). 25As a result of Lucy Osburn's teachings of the Nightingale system, several nurses were appointed as matrons and assu med the responsibility for manage ment and for establishing formal programs of instru ction throughout Australia (Bowd 1968:22; Bullough and Bullough 1984; Borland 1996:557). As settlement in Australia continued, care for the population prov ided by nurses changed and the environment where nurses cared for pa tients shifted from the hospitals to the community. District nurses, who rode bicycl es and cared for the aged and infirm and delivered new born babies in the home, beca me known. Bush nurses provided care to isolated communities on horseback after receiving information ab out patients by word of mouth (Heslop and Oates 1995 :259; Borland 1996:557). At this time the dominant influence on the thinking of Australian nurses reflected th e colonial roots of Britain until the 1970s, when changes to nursing became evid ent. The structure of the training system had remained unchanged for over a century in Australia (Short, Sharman et al. 1993; Borland 1996:557; Condon 1996). Caring Influences Parallel to the Nigh tingale System in Colonial Australia A history of caring, parallel to the Nighting ale System and Lucy Osburn's efforts in Australia but operating from different persp ectives, exists. This hi storical perspective contributes to the histor y of Australian nursing through the identification of other group s who cared for the earl y settlers (Hes lop and Oates 1995; Stevens 2003:21). Motivated by the misery and cruelty endured by many of the early convict s ettlers and in particular, the convict women, the Foundress of the Irish Sis ters of Charity sent four of her Religious Sisters, who were trained as nurses, to Australia in 1838 (Jones 1982:1) . The Irish Sisters of Charity were the first religio us sisters to arrive in Austra lia. They cared for women at 26the Parramatta Penitentiary and visited th e poor in Sydney town (Borland 1996:557). Later, other Catholic groups entered Australia to care for the inhabitants. Among these were The Sisters of Mercy, who arrived in Pert h in 1846 (Jones 1982: 1) and the Canossian Sisters, who arrived in 1949. These Sisters assi sted settlers from Ital y to adapt to their adopted homeland. The Bethlehem Sisters arri ved in 1962 and continued their apostolate in geriatric nursing (Jones 1982:1). Another person who had become concerned at the lack of ca re for the elderly in his diocese, was Dr Moore, Bishop of Ballarat. He set off to Europe in 1888 to request help from the Poor Sisters of Naza reth, an English order of nuns who care for the aged, the dying and for destitute children. This group is credited with caring for the aged aboriginal community in Australia (Jones 1982:1; Heslop an d Oates 1995). In 1930 in Victoria, the Company of our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament\u2014T he Grey Sisters\u2014which assisted in the preservation of family life, became ren owned. Their nursing apostolate was carried out primarily in their care of mothers and bab ies in both hospital and home (Jones 1982:2). It was the Brown Sisters who had their beginnings in Coogee, New South Wales (1913) and provided care to those in need in their own homes (Jones 1982:2). Although these groups were involved in caring in the early colonial days in Australia, the discourse on nursing and caring is reproduced from the British texts on nursing for nursing students. The above discussion highlights changes in the discou rse of caring over a specific time period as influenced by Nightingale, her nurs es and other sectarian nurses. We see that the discourse of care was subject to change, instit utions were also affe cted and the image of 27 the nurse changed from one viewed as a lowly drunken person to one that was almost angelic5. Following this pathway, caring pra ctices remained essentially unchanged in Australia until transformations be gan to appear ar ound the 1970s. Caring: Contemporary Perspectives Globalisation, technological ad vances and the rapid increase in scientific knowledge have had a significant impact on caring since the 1970s. A new category of nurse\u2014the enrolled nurse aide\u2014was introduced in an effort to improve the nursing services offered (Russell 2000:15). Overseas information started to infi ltrate into the knowledge of nurses. During the mid 20th century many nursing journals bega n publication and this added to the proliferation of knowledge development for nursing. Furthermore, nurses began to undertake post-registration programs and to acquire higher degrees, creating a research based approach to knowing in nursing. In the current body of literature, what is being stated and what is visible about caring are not synonymous. The vast body of literature gives testimony to this and perpetuates it. Caring itse lf has become a unique concept where there has been extensive research, theorization and discussion (Watson 1979; Leininger 1981b; 1989; Swanson 1999). While cari ng may be a unique concept of in terest for study in nursing, the discourses of caring for nurs ing show that the meaning of caring is very indistinct, imprecise and blurred. Caring as Unique to Nursing The concept of caring as unique to nursing has a history of only ab out 40 years (Lea and Watson 1996:71). Specifically, the term 'caring' was not represe nted in the vocabulary of nurses before the 1970s (Olson 1993:31). It is interesting to note that caring was not 5 Pictorial representations of Florence Nightingale holding t he lighted lamp contribute to this persona of the angelic. 28 defined in early editions of nursing dictionaries (Glanze, Anderson et al. 1990:210), yet these were dictionaries of reference for students of nursing. Given that there are different definitions being used by multiple writers in nu rsing, perhaps it is an agreed definition of caring that proved to be difficult for these editors. Dictionaries are seen as presenting words in common use at a particular time (Mac kay 1994:44), yet it is certainly interesting to see that caring remains a word that is not defined in medical nursing dictionaries despite there being many thousands of literature articles that can be identified from a concept search in the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (2004). Admittedly, this literature set does not identi fy an agreed definiti on of caring and the nursing literature is replete with various definitions of caring. M oreover these definitions are not congruent (Huch 1995). A reflective wander through my first nursing text (Pearce 1971) brings to light the absence of caring as a concept for consideration by st udents of nursing. This text was primarily a set of nursing procedures for students to lear n rather than an examination of the concepts of both nursing and caring. To day, texts written for students of nursing th at encapsulate the procedural activities of nursing have included caring. These texts are supported by references to nurse theorists, such as Watson (1985), Leinin ger (1985), Benner and Wrubel (1989), and others. They tend to align caring with the concep ts of communication, values, ethics and morals (Kozier, Erb et al. 1989; Crisp and Taylor 2001). Other constructs of caring such as behaviours, ca ring attitudes, caring in a technological environment, caring as a sense of being or ca ring practice, are found in journal references but are not allocated space in this form in nursing texts. The texts present caring from a narrow perspective compared to the available li terature that supports multiple definitions Donahue, M. P. (1985). Nursing. The Finest Art. An Illustrated History . St Louis, C.V. and Burnard 1997 ; Bradshaw 1998). Within this literature set, a lack of consensus about a definition of caring as a discrete body of knowledge for the nursing discipline is embedded (Huch 1995; Paley 2001). Historically, nurses have affirmed that ca ring for people is their central focus. An exploration of the vast amount of nursing liter ature reveals citations useful in the pursuit of the concept of caring (Lea and Watson 1996 :71). This can be conf irmed by viewing the electronic databases that list many thousands of references catego rised under 'caring', cross referenced with other concepts suc h as: research, attitudes, perceptions, relationships, technology, education, manage ment, leadership, ethics and feminism, to name a few of the categories. A trace of caring throughout the literature certainly shows evidence of caring as a concept of interest; one that is well represente d as a discussion and research issue but an understa nding of the discourses of caring and their discursive formations is not evident despite the dominant discourse of nursing labelling nursing as a caring profession. Several key figures interested in caring have emerged within and outside of nursing. From within nursing, influential writers include Leininger (1977; Roach (Roach 1991) and Wolf (1986). Semina l philosophical works from outside of nursing commonly refer to authors such as Buber (1970), Mayeroff (1971) and Erikson (1980; 1982). From the feminist literature, research by Gilligan (1982) and Noddings (1984) continues to excite and to inform nuses about caring. The k ey figures identified above are continually referred to by nurses who write about caring. 30 Philosophical writings contribute to caring and have developed aside from it but have been imported into the meanings of caring. There is no doubt that nur ses' writing and researching about caring have learned from Mayeroff. Milton Maye roff, a Professor of Philosophy at State University College of Cortland, New York, published his work On Caring in 1971 . This work was part of a program that aimed to bring to the public seminal books in a variety of fields. Mayeroff presente d caring as 'helping the other grow' and identified eight major ingredients of caring: knowing, alternating rhythms, patience, honesty, trust, humility, hope and courage. In addition he detailed some aspects of caring and special features in caring for people; the ways caring may order and give meaning to life, and characteristics of a life orde red through caring. He claims that: To care for another person, in the most significant sense, is to help him grow and actualize himself ...Through caring for certain others, by serving them through cari ng, a man lives the meanin g of his own life. In the sense in which a man can ever be sa id to be at home in the world, he is at home not through dominating, or explaining or appreciating, but through caring and being cared for (Mayeroff 1971:1). In other words, he believes that in the contex t of one's life, caring has a way of ordering our other values and activities around it. This th en brings a basic stabili ty to life in that \"he [man] is 'in place' in the world, instead of being out of place, or merely drifting or endlessly seeking his place\" (Mayeroff 1971:2). Mayeroff presen ts a generalised description of caring and an account of how caring can give comprehensive meaning and order to one's life. The concep ts continue to be cited in th e nursing literatu re on caring. For example, Mayeroff's ideas related to how people grow and on caring as a 31developmental process, are refl ected in the work of nurses studying caring (Wolf 1986; Nyberg 1990a; Wilkes and Wa llis 1993; Walters 1994). Another influential figure apar t from Mayeroff is the Jewish philosopher an d theologian Martin Buber who wrote about human relationsh ips between self and others. He spoke of the world as two fold for ma n [sic], and claimed that The basic words are not single words but word pairs. One basic word is the word pair I-You. The other basic word is the word pair I-It; but this basic word is not changed when He or She takes the place of It. Thus the I of man is also two fold. For the I of the basic word I-You is different from that in the basic word I-It (1970:53). Buber's ideas are complex and can be seen refl ected in the language of caring theorists Watson (1989) and Leininger (1985). When ba sic words are spoken they establish a mode of existence and are spoken with one's being. Buber affirms a relationship between I and You, and that experiences of man in his work are referred to thus: ... the experience is \"in them\" and not between them and the world. The world does not participate in ex perience. It allows itself to be experienced ... The world as experien ce belongs to the I-It. The basic word I-You establishes the world of relation (1970:56). Buber discusses becomi ng. That is, that The basic word I-You can be spoken with one's whole being. The concentration and fusion into a whole being can never be accompli shed by me, can never be accomplished without me. I require a You to become; becoming I, I say You (1970:62). 32 In his work, Buber presen ts that the 'I the Self ' is able to be both separate from and yet joined with the other. In Watson's work about caring, there appear to be several influences of the 'I-You' of Buber, especially where he speaks of love as a cosmic force. \"Love is responsibility of an I for a You:\" and \"Feelings accompany the metaphysical and metapsychical fact of love, but do not constitute it; and the feelings that accomp any it can be very di fferent\" (Buber 1970:66). In Watson's (1989) transpersonal caring rela tionships and her philosophy and theory of caring for example, she identifies the ontology of being caring and reflects ideas that can be traced to Buber (1970), where he contends that what determines the being of people is the way they relate to the being of events of their world. Moreover, Watson's work discusses caring as ... the heart of nursing and the ethical and philosophical foundation fo r our acts. As such, caring involves a deep level commitment to patients, families, communities, societies, and to planet Earth (1994:3). She professes caring as a mode of being and th at it is about cosmic concerns that emanate from the person. The traditions of philosophy have influenced the research of cari ng (Watson 2002a:246). In examining caring from a language other than English, Walter s (1994:4) draws on Heidegger (1962) and suggests that care, c oncern, or apprehension, is our most fundamental or primary wa y of being-in-the-world. ... Dasein , when understood ontologically, is Being-in-the- world belongs essentially to Dasein , its Being towards the world [ sein zur welt] is essentially concern (Heidegge r 1962:84 italics in original). 33The Heideggerian mode of thought has had a great deal of influence in nursing and authors who combine this idea with caring include Benner (1984), Ben ner and Wrubel (1989), Dunlop (1986; 1994) and Walters (1994). In Watson's wr itings there can be seen a Heideggerian influence, especially in her ex pressions of 'ontology of being caring' and 'caring as a mode of being '. Other authors writing about caring who have drawn on philosophical ideas include Gaut (1986), Roach (1991), Eriksson (1994), Ray (1987), Benner (1984; 1994b), Swanson (1991) , Boykin and Schoenhofer (1993). Later, in the discussion section for the disc ourses of caring I again refer to the influence of philosophy but for now, and moving away from philosophy, there ar e other issues that are pertinent to caring in nursing. In particular , the difference between caring and nursing is not always readily overt in the nursing literatur e, yet nursing life is full of references to care. Wolf stated that \"Many nurses believe that the art of nursing is comprised of actions that are predominantly caring in nature\" (W olf 1986:84). For some nurses 'caring is nursing' and 'nursing is caring' is a pr edominant theme (Dunl op 1986; Olson 1993:68). S o m e n u r s e s e v e n g o s o f a r as to suggest that nursing and caring are inseparable, (McFarlane 1976:196; Morrison 1991:4) whereas Euswas has asserted more forcefully that ... not only is caring an essential comp onent of nursing, but nursing in the full sense cannot be separated from caring (1993:323). Both Watson (1988) and Leininge r (1977; 1985) have formally st ated that the 'core' or the 'essence' of nursing is caring . In my own studies, when I perform a close reading of the nursing literature, there are instances where caring can be sub stituted for nursing without a change in textual meaning. Mors e, Solberg et al., in their meta -analysis attest to this view and state that: 34From the nursing literature it is difficult to discern the differences bet ween the terms caring, care, and nursing ca re. Care or caring may specify the actions performed, as in to take care of, or the concern exhibited, as in caring about, the former having a more general one (1990:2). What makes understanding this difference difficult is that a consistent use of terms is not evident in the literature. Therefore, meanin gs and understanding ha ve become blurred. Despite the ongoing research an d literature about caring, it is a phenomenon that remains elusive and differentiated (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990; Paley 2001). Caring in nursing is contentious, and nurses find it difficult to re ach a consensus regarding the components and definitions of caring, or the process and perspectives of caring (Smith 1999; Paley 2001 ). Recent ideas in th e literature (Watson 1999b; Watson and Smith 2002) now urge nurses to review this search for difference and for defining caring (Cook and Cullen 2003:193). Nurses are urged to ad vance contributions from the perspective of new directions that integrate and extend the knowledge of caring. Sp ecifically Watson and Smith call for schol arship that can ... generate advanced theory-guided practice models that creatively u nite ideas, rather than locking theories into fixed boxes, inhibiting th eir application and evolution (2002:460). In other words, nurses should move toward combining knowledge, views, and conceptions, to view caring more from the pe rspective of a global entity than from within specific dimensions. However, there continue to be different meanings for caring, and nurses express difficulties discerning differenc es between care, nursin g care and caring in the literature. One such area is the m etaparadigm proclaimed for nursing. 35 The metaparadigm is an abst ract component of a structur al hierarchy of contemporary nursing knowledge (Fawcett 199 7:1). It specifies the guidelines, principles and procedures that can be articulated for the discipline of nursing (Kim 1997:22). The metaparadigm of nursing (Fawcett 1984; 1993; Wotton 1996; Fa wcett 1997) identifies four subordinate concepts for nursing \u2014person, health, environment and nursing \u2014 that provide the \"... overall perspective of the nursing discipli ne\" or the world view (Doheny, Cook et al. 1987:46; Fawcett 1997:1; Kim 1997:22). It serv es as a means of or ganising observation and research into nursing. Worth commenting here is that 'nursing' is a subordinate concept of 'Nursing', the larger organising component of knowledge development. This has made discerning the metaparadigm diffi cult for some nurses when a subordinate concept is the same as the superordinate co ncept within the metaparadigm. However, in elaborating the metaparadigm of nursing, it is these paradigms that define the concepts\u2014 nursing, person, health and environment. During the development of the metaparadigm of nursing (the theoretical organisation of nursing) in the late 1990s, some nurses believed that caring was left out (Lei ninger 1993 in Huch, 1995) while others had se rious contentions a bout its inclusion (Watson and Smith 2002:456) or its level of development (Dohen y, Cook et al. 198 7:46). For those nurses who argue that caring is the essence of nursin g, perhaps caring is fo r them is the concept seen to replace nursing as a paradigm within the metaparadigm. That is, it is a subordinate concept of 'Nursing'. Both Watson (1990a) an d Knowlden (1998) attest to this point of view about caring being identified as one of the subordinate concepts in the nursing metaparadigm, contra ry to the view held by Fawcett (1997). 36Caring and Research Throughout the development of caring nurs ing knowledge, research has played an extensive role. The caring research liter ature has utilised a va riety of research methodologies, incorporating scientific, philosophical, theoretical and methodological underpinnings (Sherwood 1997; Jacox, Suppe et al. 1999; Swanson 1999; Watson 2002a; Watson and Smith 2002). Nursing research has been most prolific since th e 1970s and caring has been a central co ncept (Hinshaw 1999:19; Jacox, Suppe et al. 1999:4). The advances in nursing education have been a significant contributo ry factor with students enrolled in advanced education degrees \u2014at Ma sters and Doctoral levels\u2014contributing to clinical research (Jacox, Suppe et al. 1999:4). The concept of ca ring continues to escalate, as seen in outcomes such as dissertations, journal publications, theoretical debates, conference proceedings and professional policy developments (Swanson 1999:31). Caring is informed both from within the field of nursing and from other discipli nes, fields and discourses which contribu te to its source of strength for knowledge development. Research from outside of the field of nursing that has been influen tial for caring includes, as mentioned earlier, the wo rk of two significant author s: Noddings (1984) and Gilligan (1982). Their work continues to be cited from the primary source. Caring as described in the teaching relationship for example, comes from Noddings (1984), who writes from a feminist perspective. She states that 'whe n we care' we are touched by the other and expect to touch them, i.e., we enter into a relationship. One particular aspect of caring relations she discussed was engrossment, in which the consciousness of the carer is focused on the cared-for. There is also an attitude of the one ca red-for and usually some observable action. Her point is that 37one may properly claim to care for another if the first person [engrossment] conditions are met, but the relation itself cannot be called 'caring' unless the cari ng is completed in the cared-for (1984:139). This notion of relationship of caring betw een the nurse and the patient is but one perspective of the nurse-patient relationship. In studies of persons' understanding of their moral agency and the nature of certain moral dilemmas, Gilligan (1982) identifi ed what she called a 'voice of care'. Th is characteristic of many women's thinking about morality is in co ntrast to a 'justice' voice, which is more typical of the responses she received from men. The caring perspec tive is distinguished by a concern for care, responsiveness and taking responsibility in interp ersonal relationships and by a context-sensitive mode of deliberati on that resists abstract formulations of moral problems. She states that The ideal of care is thus an activi ty of relationship, of seeing and responding to need, taking care of the world by sustaining the web of connection so that no one is left alone (1982:62). Again we see this notion of relationship and action as important fo r caring. Following on from Gilligan's work there has been a re-exa mination of the 'ethic of care' (Holmes 1992; Bowden 1997) and the ethical signif icance of caring (Fry 1989). In addition to the above two re searchers, Eriksson claims th at caring is traced through semantics, anthropology and the history of ideas (Eriksson 1994: 11) where the concept of caring is connected with love . His point (Eriksson 1994:11) is that:: 38The concept of \"caring\" is connected with the concept of \"love.\" The English word \"cherish\" (whi ch means to hold dear, feel or show love for) originates from the Latin word \"car us\" (in English: \"care,\" \"caring\") which means love. \"Caritas\" means human love and charity (Nygren, 1972). Anthropologically, every human being has a desire to give and to receive love (cf. L\u00e9vinas, 1988). The history of ideas states that t he foundation of the cari ng profession through th e ages has been an inclination to help and minister to those suffering (Eriksson, 1992a). The above themes can be seen to be reflected in studies about caring. Caritas especially is one theme that has been used by Watson in her theoretical developments about caring science and a theory of cari ng (Watson 1985; Watson 198 8; 1999a; 2003). Love is also reflected in the work by Wolf (1986). A vast amount of knowledge ha s been generated from resear ch about caring by various 1993; Boykin, et al. 1994; Watson 1999 b). Several meta-ana lyses of caring have been performed (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990; Sherwood 1997; Swanson 1999). Morse and her colleagues (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990) reviewed 26 nurs e authors and identified that there were at least five conceptualis ations of caring operating in nu rsing. Much of the work being performed at this time was unitary and did no t consider other developments of caring. A review using a meta-synthesis was performed by Sherwood (1997) usi ng a qualitative perspective. A limited meta-analysis of cari ng research was performed by Swanson, who reviewed approximately 130 articles published between 1980 and 1996 explicitly related to the concept of caring (1999:32). Her results were inductively derived categories based on 39research findings that were hierarchic ally ordered into levels\u2014capacities, commitments/concerns, conditions, caring acti ons, and consequences. She reports that ... scientists interested in the concept of caring have by and large stuc k with the more interpretive methods of knowledge buildin g. The challenge remains for the discipline to allow for the coexistence of multiple paradigms for inquiry about caring (Swanson 1999:56). A later work by Jean Watson (2002a) titled Assessing and Measuring Caring in Nursing and Health Sciences contributes philosophical and methodolog ical tenets, historical information and research tools to caring. Research and theory development can be seen to influence each other when considering caring. The application of rese arch findings into theory development (Watson 1999b) and the development of theory fr om research are two broad ex 1992; Euswas 1993; Williams 1998; Irurita 2 000). This next section seeks to elaborate those theorists who have been influential in the nursing li terature in regard to caring. My aim is not to discuss all theorist s who have developed theories of caring (nor do I recount their theories) but to overview those theori sts who are influentia l through the act of repeatedly citing in the nursing literature. Caring and Nursing Theory Nursing theory devel opment has been a critical infl uence in knowledge development about caring. Specifically it is Leininger and Watson who are cited as advancing the theoretical banner for caring in nursing. Th ese theorists have pub lished models espousing caring as central and fundamental to nurs ing. Supporting the development of their 40theoretical ideas is the proliferation of published papers that tran sport these ideas worldwide. Madeleine Leininger is one of the foremost proponents of caring and has worked extensively in this area since her doctoral studies of cultural differences in the perceptions of care in 1954 (Reynolds and Leininger 1993:3 ; Alexander, Beagle et al. 1994:423). Armed with an anthropological and nursing preparati on, Leininger developed her theory from the perspective that patients have the right to have their sociocultural backgrounds understood (Reynolds and Lein inger 1993:4). She designed ways to conceptualise caring from both nursing and anthropo logical perspectives (Leininger 1981b:5 ), highlighting the notion that care and culture are inextricably linked and can not be separated in care actions and decisions in nursing (Leininger 1988:153). She claims t hat one of her rationales for studying caring is because ... the construct of care appears critical to human growth, development, and survival for human beings for millions of years . Caring appears to be the largely unknown ingredient for he lping others under the threat of illness in a humanistic and scientific manner (L eininger 1981b:7 original emphasis and italics). She goes on to state that another reason for stud ying care is to explicate caregiver and care recipient roles because little was known about these roles as provided by nurses and non- nurses in diverse cultures. By studying caring, it can be preserv ed and maintained for current and future cultures. In addition, th e nursing profession had not systematically studied caring in relation to nursing before , and caring should be studied (Leininger 1981b:8). 41Leininger's work is vast and she has written pr olifically with in nursing to profess and to elaborate her theory. She is well known today as the founder and leader in nursing of the Cultural Care Theory Group and the Transcultural Nursing Society (fo r more information, see the Culture Care Theory webpage at the address, http://www.tcns.org/ccrg/ ). Globally, researchers have utilised her culture care theory as a methodology. Educational programs have been developed to assist nurses to understand culture care theory with conferences and spec ialty journals supporting the dissemination of knowledge. Like Madeleine Leininger, the work and leadership of Jean Watson h as been influential and dynamic throughout the world in nursing. She has contributed the ory to nursing and is widely accredited with development of the carative factors, the human science of caring and more recently, cari ng-healing. The work of Watson feat ures prominently in this study, as she has contributed many id eas to caring. She has influenced others and has integrated knowledge from various fields, disciplines, unit ies, practices, and so forth, to change and modify her own ideas and philosophies abou t caring. Her public ations reflect the evolution of her theory of caring, praxis, re search directions and education (Watson 1979; 1985; Watson 1999b; 2002c; 2002a). Watson put forward a philosophy and science of cari ng, one that proposes caring as the essence of nursing practice. It is a moral idea l and includes the actual caring occasion and the transpersonal human relationship between the nurse and the p atient or client (Barnhart, Bennett et al. 1994:1 50). Her work, since her initia l treatise on caring in 1979, has continually explored caring within the co ntexts of nursing. She proposed a caring- healing theoretical framework, one that is cons idered a philosophy, a theory and an ethic, 42to return nursing to its human foundation, seek ing to restore human valu es at all levels in the health care setting (Watso n 1994:2-3). Watson has continued to redevelop her theories and ideas associated with caring, health and healing with the advent o f a new world view for nursing (Watson 1999b; 2002c; 2002a). The emergence of a new nursing paradigm is what Watson ca lls a transpersonal caring- healing model, one that she sees as the fu ture for the nursing profession as well as a model that can be translated to other disciplin es such as medicine and health care (Watson 1999b:xxii). The following illust ration captures her thoughts: In considering postmodern nursing and beyond, the word 'nursing' sh ould really be slashed out to in dicate that it is no long er an adequate word for this time of transformation toward ca ring and healing. It is too embedded with the so-called modern nursing pr actices, procedures, language and stereotypes which encode and restrict what is yet to become and must become if it is to mature as a dist inct health profession, meeting its unmet expectations to society for the caring-h ealing so desperately needed for all (Watson 1999b:xxii-xxiii). Watson is calling for ch ange and part of that change is for those wh o are involved in the caring-healing practices of the future; to leav e behind influences, stereotypes and institutional thinking that was dominant in the modern era (such as the influence of medicine on nursing) and to move toward the raison d'\u00eatre of the largest group of health professionals in the world. Yielding to tenets of postmodernism is evident in nursing (Heslop and Oates 1995; Watson 1995:63) and working fr postmodern perspecti ve, Jean Watson's book on 43Postmodern Nursing and Beyond (1999b) is a continuation of he r earlier theoretical work, but moves her ideas to another leve l. It comprises a framework for both praxis and theory and aims to present nursing as a ... paradigm case for women and the caring-healing dimensions of nursing's work, work that has been expunged from the traditiona l Western world cosmology, and particularly the modern masculine archetype of traditional science and medicine ... (Watson 1999b:6) For Watson, this book is a documentation of what she sees as the way forward. It leaves behind a past where nursing was lost and open s a door for caring in the future. In this future, caring intersects with other health professionals, moves beyond modern nursing yet remains connected with Florence Nighti ngale's approach to health and healing. These initial ideas in the nurs ing literature that identify debate about and competition for caring still continue alongside Watson's new paradigm idea s from 1999, and much of the literature generated about cari ng, views it from one persp ective or another, promoting difference rather than commonality (Watso n and Smith 2002:452). Wa tson and Smith call for nurses to advance and to unite their ideas rather than keeping t heories (ideas) as separate entities which inhibit their applicat ion to practice and to future changes in nursing (Watson and Smith 2002:460). Their id eas draw on the work of nurse theorist, Martha Rogers (1992), who has been informing the research of nurses in regard to a unitary view of what it means to be human. Watson's6 work is searching for what she calls a 'unitary caring science': that is, a mergin g of two discourses: Watson's transpersonal caring science and Roger's science of unit ary human beings. Through the synthesis of 44 these two discourses, a \"... distinct unitary view of human with a relational caring ontology and ethic that informs nursing ...\" (Watson and Smith 2002:45 2) is developed. Here we see that Watson is transporting her ideas about caring scie nce into another realm for nursing. She is extending her leadership challenge to nurses, asking them to combine and to develop ideas in the form of a synthesis rather than resorting to a compartmentalisation of ideas and knowledge. She presents a synthesis\u2014using her tenets of caring science with caring transpersonal caring science, as an exemplar\u2014to merge two discourses. In this study the work of these theorists\u2014Leininger and Watson\u2014 is ext ensively featured in regard to their ideas and statements about caring. They ar e by far the caring theorists most cited by other nurses wi thin the nursing literature. Th eir work is accessible through books and journal publications, an d I have been fortunate to meet both Jean Watson and Madeleine Leininger as they have travelled the world and entered into s cholarship activities here in Australia. However, many ot her theories of caring have been developed but have not been used as widely, nor have th ey been published so extensively. Some of these theories are about care generally (Orem 1980; Swanson 1991; Euswas 1993), while others refer to a construct of care such as integrity (Irurita 2000), communication (Knowlden 1991; 1998), touch (Kolcaba 2003) and the quality of care (Williams 1998). There are several examples of nurses expl oring care using the Culture Care Theory method as presented by Leininger (see the Culture Care Theory website for a list of researchers http://www.tcns.org/ ) and a cadre of nurses who ex plore caring science (Watson and Smith 2002). 6 Professor Jean Watson was the recipient of the National League for Nurses Martha E. Rogers Award in 1993. W atson, J. and M. C. Smith (2002). \"Caring science and the science of unitar y human beings: a trans-theoretical discourse for nursing knowledge development.\" Journal of Advanced Nursing 37(5): 452-461. 45Arising from the work of these nurse theorists and from the work o f the many other nurses who are researching, professing and wr iting about caring, there continues to be a development of knowledg e about caring that is viewed as essential for nursing and for its progress. However, considerable opposition exis ts toward the acceptance of caring as the knowledge for nursing. In 1993, at the 'Biennial Nurse Theori st Conference\" in Toronto, Canada, this opposition was clearly voiced. In response, Leininger proclaimed that caring is the essence of nursing and stated: We had already begun th e caring explication in the 1960s. So, as you know, I have held that caring is the overall concept... [Continuing she argued that] In our inte rnational work we have care as a central dominant domain of nursing. That's what we're about and that 's what we'll continue to look at until we have established it firmly as the root and basis (Huch 1995:38). Her comments were in answer to a question directed at a panel of nurse theorists primarily assembled to debate caring. Not a ll theorists present were in agreement with Leininger's comments. Responses from the other eminent nurse t heorists present, when asked the same question as Dr Leininger in th e conference forum, \"Is nursing the study of caring in the human health experience?\" respond ed very differently. It was very clear that these nurse theorists viewed caring and nursin g from very different perspectives. In the responses (Huch 1995) these theorists did not ag ree that caring was ce ntral or the essence of nursing, as presented by Dr Leininger. While she affirmed that caring is a body of knowledge and stated that ther e are over 175 constructs of care, the other theorists were not as forthcoming about holding caring to be the body of knowledge for nursing and stated that other forms of knowledge were required before nu rses could care. The 46following excerpts show the degree of differe nce in the debate compared to Leininger's statement above. Dr King in her response claims that: If caring is a process, I don't know how it can become a major concept in the nursing metaparadigm, because conc epts are terms such as perception and health, and they're not processes. You are automatically caring. We've always had nursing care as part of ou r literature and history. And what is it? I haven't seen yet in th e literature the characteristics that make up care or caring, and I think th at is where we have th e problem (Huch 1995:38). Dr Parse's contribution to the debate was that: ...caring is a ubiquitous term; it is not the central phenomenon of nursing. The human-universe-health process is the ce ntral phenomenon. The definition of caring is \"to be concerned for something or someone\" and I think many people in many disciplines are concerned about others... Caring in the human health experience is not the proper way to state the phenomenon of concern to nursing\" and \"Most theories a nd frameworks in nursing do not address caring as a central focus\" (H uch 1995:38). Following Dr Parse, Dr Peplau assert ed that: ... Although I applaud Madeleine's [Leininger] efforts and the efforts of others who have been thinking about caring and have been writing a great deal about it, I do not believe it be longs exclusively to nurses ... I don't think we should latch onto this one concept and say it belongs to us (Huch 1995:39). Dr Roger's response was that: 47... while we all care, unless there is knowledge that goes before, there is nothing to care with, and I think it is about time that we begi n to value knowledge of some sort... It's time we bury the whole idea of caring as the essence of nursing and look at some substance (Huch 1995:39). Interestingly, Dr Jean Watson, who is identified as both an influential nurse leader and theoretician who professes caring, was not a part of this debate (as reported by Huch 1995), and yet she has contributed extensively to the caring literature in nursing. However, her voice and views about caring are well docume nted in the literature. In this context of debate about caring as the knowledge for nurs ing, theories of caring continue to be developed (Williams 1998; Kolcaba 2003) and redeveloped (Watson and Smith 2002 ). These have contributed to the knowledge base of nursing and to an understanding of practice. The nursing profession ha s embraced caring for nursing. Caring and the Profession Caring, when recognised as a body of knowle dge for nursing, supports the claim by some nurses that nursing can legitimately be called a profession. The dev elopment of knowledge has been through endeavours such as theory ad vancement, professional activities, research support and infrastructure (H inshaw 1999:19). One such example is the establishment of the 'Center for Human Caring' by The National League of Nursing in New York. Caring conferences supported through this endeavour have been held wo rldwide, with proceedings published (Tripp-Reimer and Co hen 1990; Gaut and Leininger 1991:xvii; Gaut 1993) contributing to know ledge development for nursing. 'The Center for Human Caring' (operating since 1986) establ ished at the University of Colorado, School of Nursing, by Dr Je an Watson has an ov erall commitment 48... to develop and use knowledge of human caring and healing as the foundation for transforming the heal th care system an d as a framework for a dramatically new system that affirms and sustains human caring and healing activities as the moral and sc ientific basis of clinical practice (www.uchsc.edu/2/6/99:1). The Centre has established itself as an in ternational 'Consortium of Centers For Human Caring', which is a network of nurses and other health profession als committed to an ethic and philosophy of caring based upon a paradigm of human cari ng and healing. The Centre has internationa l affiliates in Canada , New Zealand, the Un ited Kingdom and in other areas. Functioning in concert throughout the world within this network of centres are the major international conferences that focus on caring for their theme (Tripp- Reimer and Cohen 1990; Gaut 1 991; Gaut 1993; Huch 1995). Together these groups have provided leadership and development and have supported the initiatives for nurses researching caring. There is evidence in the literature that the nu rsing profession claims caring chiefly for the role of the Registered nurse. This can be seen reflected in education al texts where terms such as 'care provider' or 'caregiver' are used, or in standards of professional performance and quality of care (Kozier, Erb et al. 1989; Crisp and Taylor 2001) . These types of terms subsume the notion of care into the action performed for a patient, but contingent upon this action are the standards by which a nurse must operate. In Australia, caring is claimed by the profession via the use of standards associated with the competencies for registered nurses (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 2001). These competencies p rescribe caring from the perspective of planning, im plementing and evaluating care and are entities that are required for inclusion into curricular document ation. Codes of conduct for the Australian 49nurse (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 1993; 1995; 2001) also take up the challenge of care, as do requirements for nurse registra tion (Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001:7) which then become subsumed as legal entities for nursing practic e. Conclusion Caring in nursing is a well researched but cont ested site which continues to lend itself to worthy knowledge development. In this initial section (preface and int roduction), my aim has been to situate my study, firstly from th e perspective of why I have embarked on this study of caring, and to provid e background and illumination fo r following sections. It has not been my intention to unde rtake a thorough literature revi ew of caring. Indeed, this is well represented in various meta -analyses and published literat ure reviews avai lable in the nursing literature. My approach to contributing to knowledge deve lopment about caring is to stand back and to examine caring as a whole\u2014as a monument\u2014one that is described in its character dispos ition and to seek its conditions of existence within the field of nursing (Foucault 1972:7,139). Following this background an d illumination of caring, I present the work of the late Michel Foucault, philosopher and historian of ideas (Short, Sharman et al. 1998:xi) in the next chapter (chapter 2). Firstly, I introduc e those ideas of Foucault which have been influential in the format ion of this thesis, in that they have provided me with the tools to analyse caring. This methodolog ical, archaeology chap ter provides an insight into the ideas associated with Foucault, namely archaeology, genealogy and ethics, but essentially details the ideas associated with archaeology. I elab orate the three key conceptual archaeological tools (the statement, discourse and discursi ve formations) that provided me with the 50mechanism to generate knowledge through this research and to apply archaeology as a research methodology (Parker 1992; Kendall and Wickham 1999). Moving on from this generalised discussion about Foucault and archaeology, my next chapter elaborates the applicat ion of Foucault's ideas about archaeology into the research process for this thesis. Specif ically, I detail how I have anal ysed the caring literature in nursing and formulated what I have termed th e 'Archive of Caring for Nursing' and the three discourses evident within this archive. The chapter includes templates that have been used to analyse literature, tables associ ated with the analyses, and figures showing the formation of the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing' and the Discourses of Caring. The application of Foucault's id eas to caring in nursing is not new. The literature shows that nurses favour the applic ation of Foucault's later ideas to their writings. That is, concepts such as power, knowledge, ethics , and governmentality are widely cited. Few examples of research associated with arch aeology as a methodology are evident (Paley 2001), even though discourse as a concept has been used in relati on to caring in nursing (Heslop and Oates 1995). The final componen t of the archaeology of caring chapter (chapter 2) is to draw attenti on to how nurses have used Fouc auldian concepts in relation to caring in nursing. This section is limi ted to those references that link Foucault and caring in nursing. While Fouc ault is well cited in nursing and health care, discussion is contained to references about caring. The methodological discuss ion reveals both the promise of Foucauldian Archaeology and the sh ortage of critical reflexivity about the most basic of nursing practices\u2014caring. 51Chapter 2: Methodology Methodology\u2014Overview Our next patient, Case y Young, was already in the anaesthe tic bay. I had be en in to see her, introduced myself, and I had told her about the next fe w steps she was to encounter before being wheeled into the operating room . Together we had reviewed the operating theatre patient checklist to ascertain that sh e was the next patient we were expecting and that all the necess ary requirements were completed. I had also cross-checked with Casey the operation we were to pe rform. Following my patient check, I left Casey to the anaesthetic team for preparation. As the scout nurse for t he theatre, it is my role to pr epare the operating room for each patient. An imperative action is to ensure that all equi pment used from the previous patient's surgery is removed, extra supplies are returned and al l rubbish, linen and packaging is also take n away before Casey enters. Safety and accountability are foremost in my mind during this period . In the event that a swab, sp onge or instru ment could not be found following a procedural count before closin g a patient's wound, then a search of the entire room would be routinely performed. Accountability during changeover is essentia l. If the room isn't cleared and ready for Casey's arrival, then several different scenarios might ensue. One such scenario could be that not all rubbish was removed and we ma y include in the instrument and sponge count an article that was actually from the pr evious patient, therefore potentially losing 52an article inside Casey. Another scenario wo uld be that I would not be available to support and care for Casey appropriately, because I would be undert aking other activities that would preven t me from being with her. In this role of scout nurse, organisation and speed become important and a feeling of pressure and haste is often felt within me during the changeover period. On this occasion, I attributed this feeling to my response to th e anaesthetist on the te am as well as to my own desire to perform the role well. Other anaesthetists would wait at the anaesthetic- theatre room door and ask if they could enter the theatre with the pati ent; that is, if we were ready. I wouldn't go any slower at prep aring the theatre for this changeover but at least some recognition for the requirements of the role is appreciated. Today's anaesthetist wasn't this way inclined and he would ba rge in, when he was ready, with little communication to the te am, or any respect for any of th e nursing roles. Communicating with him about team requirements had never worked in the past and very little, if anything was ever done by management to re lieve the tensions that developed within the team. My approach towards him was to try to keep the peace and avoid any confrontations; mainly to keep my blood pre ssure down and to ensu re a reasonable work day. He was in the unit three days a week an d most of us would try to negotiate changes to different operating rooms to avoid being in this team. All the sc out nurses felt that this anaesthetist was 'a pain' to work with and a few had argued quite fiercely with him. But in the end, because th ere was a patient that needed to be cared for, we just tried to do what we could and often 'chased our ta ils'. A little more time would allow for all necessities of the role to be covered. To care for my patient I needed to be ready, organised 53and available as soon as the patient came into the room. However, in this operating room this was often di fficult to achieve. From my role perspective, it was important to stand beside Casey while she was going off to sleep without any distractions. To be able to do this, I needed to make sure that we had all the equipment before we started in order to minimise the number of times that I would have to leave the room to get something. Standing besi de Casey as she went off to sleep was a comfort measure for her, for me it was considered a carin g and a safety measure. In the event that she stretched and moved on the very narrow ta ble, then I would be close by to offer both emotional and physical support. Bringing a patient in before we have the th eatre ready also rushes the scrub nurse. When a patient is lying on the operating table most surgeons assume they ca n commence. It is a compounding situation that needed lots of su btle management and co vert techniques. One such technique is not to open the gloves for the surgeon and to continue with our activities. This can have the effect of slowin g down processes. Unfortunately, if a medical student is in the room s/he wo uld be requested to perform this action, thus thwarting our efforts. Opening the knif e blades for the scrub nurse as a final act was another technique used. Sometimes I might open the sw abs and sponges last so that cleansing the patient might also be slightly delayed. The se techniques work to slow the pace of the theatre team so that both the scout and sc rub nurses can quickly catch up and ensure that all 'accountable pr ocesses' are comple ted and we are safe to start. When the patient is wheeled into the operating room before I am ready, then some functions associated with my role are done by the anaesthetic team. To day this included positioning Casey onto the 54table and putting in place the pressure devices to protect her during the surgery. My compromise was to place equipment and devices beside the table as a silent request to the anaesthetic team to ensure their use. In the role of scout nurse, cari ng is not only communicating wi th Casey before she is 'put to sleep,' standing beside her and holding her hand as she goes unde r the anaesthetic, but it is also ensuring that the th eatre is cleaned before she ente rs, that I am organised before we start and that I can control the elements at work in the theatre. Caring not only involves caring for Casey's feelings but also in volves: caring for her body by ensuring that she is safe during her surgery, that she is correctly position ed, that she is protected from others by closed doors, that only authorised personnel are in the room and t hat she is not exposed unnecessarily. Caring also means that I should be organised for Casey, attuned to the operating theatre climate an d competent in my care for her. Two seemingly quite different forms of behavi our are illustrated in the anecdote above, both of which I would consider to constitute a form of caring. One is interpersonal\u2014 being there for a person\u2014the other is procedural, technical even : having systems in place to keep the operating theatre environment running efficiently. How can both types of activity be considered caring? Nurses workin g in different contexts would probably agree with one of these approach es; they may even see that both are relevant. In answering the questions I have about cari ng, I decided to consider in depth what nurses are writing and saying about cari ng. To do this I dr ew on Foucault's Archaeology of Knowledge (1972). That is, I have use d an archaeological analysis as the methodology of choice for this thesis in order to understand how nurses view caring differently from one 55 another. Archaeology is useful in identifying divergent theoretical viewpoints that have been presented, and to come to conceptualise the debate that is occ urring in nursing about caring. The above anecdo te about Casey demonstrates my perspective on caring within the context of my role in the perioperative environment and highlights some of the ideas about caring that emerge from within this context. Discussions with my peers present other perspectives, as was identified in the preface. Methodology: Overview of Archaeology Introduction Nurses from across the world ar e searching for elemen ts that make nurs ing unique. In the nursing literature, caring is presented from ma ny perspectives; it is defined in a multitude of ways and is understood via a set of repeat ed claims. Some of these claims support each other, whereas others give a totally differe nt viewpoint about caring. For example, as discussed in the introductory chapter, caring has not been subsumed as a concept in the meta-paradigm of nursing7, yet there are several nurse-theo rists who argue that caring is the knowledge base necessary for nursing (Leininger 1981 b:6; Leininger 1990:28; Huch 1995). Furthermore, researchers studying cari ng have used various types of methods that aim to define, explain, pred ict and compare cari ng in nursing (S wanson 1999; Watson 2002a). In order to discern why caring is view ed differently by a nurse in a ward or in a specialty unit (as presented in my preface), firstly, I felt that I needed to gain an understanding of what has been stated since caring became known as a concept important for nursing (Leininger 1981b:3). Secondly, I be lieved that an approach that would allow for a critical analysis of what has been said (statements) by nurses, especially their claims 7 Nurse theorists have presented definitions of the concepts of n ursing to support and elaborate their theories of nursing. Fawcett presents these concepts as the meta-paradigm of nu rsing. These concepts of nursing are nursing, person, environment and health (1989:6). 56 to defining caring was necessary . An interpretation of the text The Archaeology of Knowledge by Michel Foucault (1972) provided the method that would allow me to u nderstand why nurses in the practice setting perceive caring for their patients differently from each other. What specifically led me to use the text The Archaeology of Knowledge as a methodology was firstly the way that archaeology makes it possi ble to articulate cari ng and to understand how caring as an object of knowledge has been produced. Th rough the identification of key concepts or elements, I can come to make sense of what is being stated in regard to caring. Secondly, the statement, as the basic unit of a discourse, forms the object within what Foucault terms a discursive practice (F oucault 1972:44); therefor e, caring knowledge is constructed in the very discourse which acco unts for caring. To explain this further, in the story about Casey, as the scout nurse I have an object of caring in mind. Caring has a meaning in the context of nursing practice for the scout nurse. For the patient, caring may have a different meaning (such as a feeling of comfort as she goes off to sleep under the anaesthetic) and when I'm in the role of recovery or anaesthetic nurse8, caring again has another meaning that translates into my practi ce. If I were to list some of my expressions of caring within these three perioperative nu rsing roles, there would be some statements that would apply to all of the roles, but ther e are others that are specific to each role. Hence, I began to see that statements and conc epts (units of discourse) about caring are different for the nurse, depend ent upon many factors such as the perceived role of the nurse, the context of practice, institutionalised education pr ocesses and power/knowledge relations. 8 These are nursing roles in the perioperative context, along w ith the scout nurse role. 57Identifying that caring can be viewed from different perspectiv es led me to recognise that I could study caring as a disc ursive practice (Fouca ult 1972:117): that is , a practice that involves identifying persons who speak from within institutional sites (hospitals, universities, schools of nursing, research) an d formalising the objects spoken about within a discourse (Foucault 1972:44 ). Thus a discursive practice can be defined by the knowledge that forms it (Fou cault 1972:182,195). This know ledge arises from speakers within the discourse who define the objects at the level of the sta tement. That is, the speakers make core, repeatable claims of knowledge and such claims e merge via a density of texts that illustrate the discursive practice and therefore pro duce discourses. The juxtaposition of these statements, discourses and discursive pra ctices form knowledge for nursing as a discipline revealing conditi ons which make possible changes to theory. As mentioned earlier, my intent in this thesis is to provide archaeological descriptions of the discourses of caring that are operating for nursing. That is, I aim to question what has already been said about caring in nursing th rough the medium of nursing literature. The large number of referen ces to caring in the nu rsing literature attests to the already-said as a vast documented entity that arises from many perspectives. Using archaeology as a methodology allows one to notice what is being said about caring. As Foucault puts it: ...[archaeology] designates a general th eme, of a description that questions the already-said at the level of existe nce: of the enunciative function that operates within it, of the discursive formation, and the general archive systems to which it belong s. Archaeology describes discourses as practices specified in the element of the archive (1972:131). That is, he specifies the rule s that have allowed what can be said (or not said) about a discourse and the rules of discursi ve formation (Foucault 1972:25). 58In this chapter my aim is to present the tenets of an archaeological analysis using the work of Michel Foucault. Initially I present a brief synopsis of Michel Foucault's ideas in order to contextualise the approach taken, the re levance of the selecti on of archaeology and how his work has shown examples of analyses of problems. I then move on to discuss archaeology as a methodolog y based on ideas taken from The Archaeology of Knowledge. Drawn from this methodology, the three conceptual tools for understanding things in an archaeological analysis\u2014the statement, disc ourse and discursive formation\u2014are discussed in detail. Foucauldian c oncepts such as the subject, elemen ts and object are also discussed Michel Foucault Michel Foucault (1926-1984) was an infl uential new generation thinker (Merquior 1985:11; O'Farrell 1989:7) and is credited with one of the mo st dazzling minds of his era. Some indeed have claimed that he founded a new approach to research (Said 1994:39) and major themes of health and re search have been used to illustrate his broader theories (Petersen 1993:119; Petersen and Bunton 1997) . In 1970 Foucault was elected to the College of France as the 'P rofessor of History of Systems of Thought' (Sheridan 1980:120), a title he claimed in some way classified his work. Although he is from time to time considered as a philosopher or an hist orian, (more often the latter) he was not like other philosophers or historians. Racjman cl aims that \"Foucault was an exceedingly visual historian. His histories are f illed with vivid pictu res that stick in the mind\" (1994:224). Foucault himself contributed to this ambiguit y about his classification when he stated in the Archaeology of Knowledge: 59Perhaps I am a historian of ideas after all. But an ashamed, or, if you prefer, a presumptuous historian of ideas. One who set out to ren ew his discipline from top to bottom; who wa nted, no doubt, to achieve a rigour that so many other, similar descriptions have recently acquired, to make it cross the threshold of scie ntificity ... declares that he has been doing, and wanted to do, something quite differe nt... I cannot be satisfied until I have cut myself off from 'the history of ideas', until I have shown in what way archaeological analysis differs from the descriptions of 'the history of ideas' (Foucault 1972:136). Readers have analysed Foucault's texts in di fferent ways, and this has resulted in the attachment of many labels including: stru cturalist and poststruct uralist, geneal ogist (Smart 1994:3). This labelling certainly suggest something of his elusiveness to classification (O'Farrell 1989; Macey 1993). Offering an analysis of knowledge and trut h, rationality and powe r and technologies of governmentality and the self, Foucault's texts identify problems of how and why certain things (behaviour, phenomena and processes) become a prob lem. In other words, he emphasises how and why particular forms of conduct become characterised, classified, analysed and treated\u2014in effect problematicised. Some examples of the forms of conduct he analysed include texts that interrogated the dualities of madness (madness/reason) and sexuality (sexuality/perversion) (Smart 1994:8) . In effect this is how I see caring\u2014that it has become problematicised. Th at is, caring has become characterised, it has been classified, analysed and treated in many forms, and at least three elements within nursing are part of this problem: 1) nursing prac tice and the contexts of nursing; 2) the 60perceptions of different persons (for exampl e, in the above story Casey's perception versus my perception as the sc out nurse); and 3) the explosion of theoretical and research literature related to caring, and influencing nursing education and practice. These issues will become apparent later when I discuss the discourses of caring. To return to Foucault , he considers that thoughts take place primarily as events, and recognises space as the element in which la nguage and thought occur (Said 1994:53). That is, he is interested in the spatial mapping (such as cultural space, e pistemological space) within which knowledge becomes knowledge rather than an a ccidental array of facts and objects (Steiner 1994:400). To illustrate, one of the spaces for caring in this thesis is nursing, specifically after the 1970s, where nu rsing can be seen to have its own cultural space and knowledge. Overall in Michel Foucault's work, three main domains of analysis can be found: systems of knowledge, modalities of power, and the self 's relationship to itse lf. In each of these domains Foucault employed very specific forms of analysis, which are called respectively, archaeology, genealogy and ethics (Davids on 1986:221; Dean 1994) . Considering these forms of analysis we can see why he has been labelled an archaeologist and genealogist. Archaeology and genealogy are the most distincti vely Foucauldian terms. It is archaeology and the analysis of systems that I am concer ned with in this study as they allow the isolation and analysis of structu res of caring that are treated as discursive systems. I have elected not to discuss Foucault's other forms of analysis; genealogy and ethics. Both of these form the latter part of Foucault's work . While they are methods that can be used to analyse caring (Holmes 1992; Heslop and Oate s 1995; Paley 2001), archaeology gives the clearest sense of how objects of knowledge ar e produced. My intent is to analyse systems 61of knowledge in order to reveal the conditio ns which make change possible (archaeology) rather than modalities of power (genealogy) or the self's relationship to itself (ethics). I do however draw on power, in a general sense, in a later chapter (chapte r 5) since I push the archaeological method to incorporate the co ncept of power when I discuss the discourse 'caring as knowing' (one of the three disc ourses identified from my archaeological analysis). To differentiate archaeology further from ge nealogy, archaeology allows one to address questions within the domains of reason, truth and knowledge, whereas genealogy addresses questions concerned within the do mains of power, domi nation and government (Dean 1994:2). Archaeology uses history as a way of understandin g the present and the taken-for-granted that arise from a series of complex relations be tween events (Kendall and Wickham 1999:4). Using this approach, archaeology describes dis courses as practices and allows the exploration of networks of wh at is said and what can be seen. Genealogy on the other hand, while maintaining many of the components of archaeology including the examination of the statements in the archiv e, is concerned with the analysis of power and knowledge, pointing out origins and function s that are hidden in total histories. An archaeology of caring is foundational for gene alogies that link caring to present concerns with an emphasis on power relations as an ongoing process (Rabinow 1984:34; Flynn 1994:14). Archaeology Based on his earl ier work (i.e. Madness and Civilization, 1967; The Order of Things, 1970; The Birth of the Clinic, 1973), Foucault presente d a methodological text, The Archaeology of Knowledge , which is concerned with outlining the di stinctive features of an archaeological analysis of discursive format ions (Smart 1994:40). This text gives an account of the 62existence of various systems of thought that lie within the paradigms from which they originated (Roth 1994:101). In this work, Fouc ault outlines his conception of discourse, stating his interest in the conditions which ma ke discourse on caring possible. His concern is with discourse in terms of knowledge, an d where knowledge is understood as a matter of social, historical and politic al conditions under which statements come to count as true or false (Foucault 1972). Discourses, which are specific bodies of k nowledge, are examined at the level of the statement; that is, what can be said? What can be thought? (McHoul and Grace 1993:31; Ro th 1994:101). What archaeolog y tries to describe is the very different domains of know ledge. It questions knowledg e from a different direction and describes knowledge from a different set of relations (Foucault 1972:195). More specifically, archaeology denotes the history of that which renders possible a certain form of thought. It deals with epistemes necessary, unconscious and anonymous forms of thought (Merquior 1985:41) that comp rise a comprehensive body of knowledge (O'Farrell 1989:54). An epis teme can be likened to a slice of history common to all branches of knowledge, or a total set of relations that unite the discursive practices at a given period. That is, an episteme refers to an order of things, which organises everything and makes things possible\u2014and others impossible. It allows us to speak of some things and not others and dete rmines how we make sense of th ings, what we kn ow and what we can say (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:16-17). The order of things is based on relations, such as principles, methods, reasons and practi ces. Foucault identifies that three major epistemes have operated over the last fo ur hundred years (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:19). These are the Renais sance, the Classi cal and the Modern epistemes, where examples of sameness and difference can be identified. Danaher et al. suggest that according to Foucault 63... what we have, think, know and un derstand today was not inevitable but, because of the way in which our episteme is ordered, we have very little choice of either understanding th at things could have been different, or of speaking different ly about them (2000:21). The ordering of the episteme contributes to our understanding of how we speak of concepts, events, things, et cetera. In archaeology, Foucault describes systems that establish statements as events and things. He labels these systems of statements as the ar chive. The archive is the law of what can be said and the system that governs the appe arance of statements as unique events (1972:129). It defines the mode of occurrence of th e statement and is the system of its functioning, differentiating di scourses in their multiple existences. The archive defines a practice (discursive practice) that causes multiple statemen ts to emerge as regular events and reveals the rules of practice that enable statements to survive and to undergo regular modification. The archive then is \"... the general system of the format ion and transformation of statements\" (Foucault 1972:130). The archive is the general condition of possibility\u2014the system of discu rsive regularities that determines what can and cannot be spoken in a given historical era. By this Foucault means a kind of concept-bank\u2014wha t is sayable or thinkable in any given era or context. It is composed of multiple and va rying discourses and is an enab ling system of rules which is never entirely complete and is therefore always open to change (M cNay 1994:66). As a system of discursive regulariti es\u2014that is, ideas and beliefs that fit into a set of patterns, whether those who hold them realise it or not\u2014the archive of a society, culture, civilization can not be fully described and becaus e we speak from within the rules, it is not 64possible to describe our own archive. The archive emerges in fragments, regions, and levels with a greater clarity as time separates us from it. Within this context of disc ussion about archaeolog y, Foucault refers to unities (for example, medicine is identified as a unit y) where a field can be claimed. Foucault discounts these fields on whic h large groups of statements are based as illusory, actually full of gaps, intertwined with one another, co nsisting of interplays of differences and transformations (Sheridan 1980:96). In an ar chaeological analysis, the unities (e.g. medicine) are freed up (or given a more ge neral space where they may be analysed differently) where the field is made up of the totality of all effective statements (whether spoken or written). In freeing up this field, and by analysin g the texts associ ated with the field, a 'pure description of discursive even ts' (an understanding of the statements that actually form the objects an d concepts of the discourse) can be attempted (Foucault 1972:27). The field of discursive events is a grouping that is always fi nite and limited at any moment to the linguistic sequences that have been formulated. Hence, to analyse a discursive field means to analyse the statement in the exact sp ecificity of its occurr ence, to determine its conditions for existence, fix the limits of its position and establish its c orrelations with other statements that it may be connected to . It also means showin g what other forms of statement it excludes. How is it that one particular statement appea red rather than another? Principally, the aim is to identify how the statement assumes a place no other occupies: a question Foucault poses as \"...what is the specific ex istence that emerges from what is said and nowhere else?\" ( 1972:28). Therefore in archaeology, when analysing the statement, it is important to be able to identify the forms of regularity 65present, the relations between statements an d groups of already established statements and between the statements and groups of statements and events (for example, technical and political). The aim of archaeology is to re veal the space in which discursive events are deployed and to describe the interplay of re lations within and outside of statements. One of the essential characteri stics of archaeology remains the multiplicity of ways in which it can be defined. Its fluidity as a mode of research that cannot be fixed into a rigid canon means that it is able to learn from it s sources (that is; the information identified, data collated and approach taken). Archaeological analysis involves documents, but interestingly for Foucault a document is not an inert piece of material in history. He writes about the 'uvre': that is, a writer's work co nsidered as a whole or unity. These uvres Foucault considers to be monuments of the past that were located in history and were transformed into documents. In analysing these documents, Foucault's aim in archaeology is to uncover the principles and consequences of what he calls an 'aut ochthonous transformati on' that was taking place in the field of historical knowledge (1972 :15). He viewed ideas as historical events and as such, history transfor ms documents into monuments. Instead of using documents to reactivate a collective memory or to point to what people did and said, they should be treated as monuments of the past. That is, to treat discourse not as the theme for a commentary which would revive it, but as a monument to be described in its character disposition (1972:7). These monu ments are traces left by the past that the archaeologist tries to decipher and to organise, into intelligible grou ps, in relation to each other (O'Farrell ul and Grace 1993:49). 66To present an archaeology therefore, is to write a history of ideas based not on knowing the subject (i.e. who the writer is), but on ideas embedded in discursive practices and to seek in the discourse its conditions of existe nce (Foucault 1972:38). It is possible to show how persons within the same discursive practi ce (for example the di scursive practice of caring) can speak of different objects (caring as a practice versus caring as a relationship) and can have contrary opinio ns. (Remember that I describe in the Preface how nurses from various practice contexts viewed caring differently). Thus, the discourse is referred to the field in which it is deployed. Arch aeology highlights the way that discursive practices are distinguished from one another and reveals the tr ansformations that occur at different levels of history. Three key conceptual tools are necessary to understanding th ings in an archaeological analysis. These are the statement, discourse an d discursive formation. Put together, these tools produce knowledge developed from rese arch: that is, researching those resources from the past (history) that make it possible to identify what is said at any given period and where it is said (Said 1994:37). In the following sections I will discus s each of these three conceptual tools, beginning with the statement, then discourse and finally the discursive formation. These are the three tools that I have used to an alyse caring in this thesis. In discussing these three tools it is necessary to include two other terms\u2014 the subject and the object. I have cl osely interpreted Foucault's text The Archaeology of Knowledge and I have drawn on other writers who have in terpreted Foucault's wo rk over the years to inform this research (Smart 1985; Hoy 1986; Deleuze 1988 ; Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000). I now turn to discuss the first conceptual tool: the statement. The statement is a variable entity in Foucauldian an alysis and it is this variability 67that I pursue in my examination of this tool from the perspective of fun ction, unit and relations of the statement. The Statement In archaeology, a statement is not defined by the grammatical characteristics of a sentence, nor is it defined as a proposition. A statem ent is wherever one can recognise an act of formulation, for example a promise, an orde r, or an observation. The most important thing about a statement is what it makes possibl e, conceptually, socially and politically, and what is distinctive about it compared to other statements. The historian examines statements in regard to what it is that make s them make sense. As such the statement is: ... a function of existence that properly belongs to signs and on the basis of which one may then decide, through analysis or intuition, whethe r or not they 'make sense' according to what rule they follow one anoth er or are juxtaposed, of what they are the sign, and what sort of act is ca rried out by their formulat ion (oral or written) (Foucault 1972:86-7). Continuing on, the statement is a function that can be revealed with concrete contents in time and space (for example, cultural space) as seen in a collection of written works. The statement as a function then is its actual practice; that is, the field it operates in (enunciative field), the rules that govern its existence and the condit ions for its existence (Foucault 1972:57). In this field, in which statements operate, t hey may have been formulated elsewhere but can be taken up by the discourse. They are acknowledged and described, while others may be discussed and some rejected . There are stat ements that belong to different domains of objects and different types of discourse bu t they are active within the discourse studied. Some statements are no longer accepted or discussed, but 68were parts of the discourse for a period. However, they no longer define a body of truth for that discourse (Fouca ult 1972). What counts is the regu larity of the statement, because different individuals can intervene. So we see that a statement accumu lates into a specific object, which then becomes preserved, transmit ted or repeated. It preserves itself within its own space and continues to exist while the space endures or is re constituted (Deleuze 1988:11). As a unit in a Foucauldian anal ysis, a statement must have mate rial existence (for example, statements occur in texts, journals, confer ence reports, etc.). These formats give the statement materiality. It has a substance, support, place and date, and when these characteristics change , the statement changes identity too. Foucault differentiates statements from enunciations. An enunciatio n takes place whenever a group of signs is emitted, but it is an unrepeatable event, in that it has a situated and da ted uniqueness whereas the statement is further defined by its status as a thing or object whose identity varies with the complex set of material instit utions. The rule of this materiality that the statement obeys is the order of the institutio n. (For example, in statements made about caring, the institutions may be universities, hospitals, or nur sing bureaucracies and statements may be found in such document s as job descriptions, policies or journal articles). Therefore, the identity of the st atement is subject to conditions and limits: ... those that are imposed by all other statements among which it figures, by the domain in which it can be used or app lied, by the role and functions that it can perform (Foucault 1972:103). To illustrate, statements made in relation to caring might be contextualised within the field of theory as opposed to statements from with in the field of ethics. The statement may be repeated but it is repeated alwa ys under strict conditions which reveal it to be a specific 69and paradoxical object\u2014an object that is pr oduced, manipulated, used, transformed, exchanged and perhaps even destroyed. The stat ement is not something that is said once and then lost, but the statement as it emerges ... appears with a status, en ters various networks and various fields of use, is subjected to transferences or modi fications, is integra ted into operation and strategies in which its identity is maintained or effaced. Thus the statement circulates, is used, disappears , allows or prevents the realization of a desire, serves or resi sts various interests, part icipates in challenge and struggle, and becomes a theme of a ppropriation or rivalry (Foucault 1972:105). The statement is dynamic, meaningful and participatory within the discourse. The statement must be re lated to an adjacent fi eld. This field provides a particular context (which may be nursing) and a specific repres entative content. It is made up of other formulations within which the statement appe ars and forms one element. These elements comprise for example, statements, objects, concepts, theoretical choices, practices, enunciations and notions (Foucault 1972:162,182) . The field is also made up of all of the formulations within which the statement refe rs, either through repetition, modification, adoption or by opposing them or by commen ting on them. The statement takes its place in this field without regard to order. It may fade away or conversely be valued, preserved, sacralised and offered as an obj ect to a future disc ourse. (An example would be statements about caring that are taken up by persons co ncerned with caring or nursing ethics). The statement is therefore immersed in an enunci ative field in which it appears as a unique element. Statements then have a place and a meaning, a time when they are discussed, people who discuss them, and questions that relate to their complex web of meaning. It is 70a part of a network of statemen ts in which it plays a role in an enunciative network that extends beyond it (Foucault 1972). The existence of statements, th eir value, efficacy and power, cannot be dissociated from the right of the person to make them (for example, in nursing, Dr Je an Watson holds the position of Professor of Nursing and has pub lished her theory of caring). Statements cannot come from just anybody. The right to make a statement in cludes the speaker's status (for example, Professor and Dean of Nursing), their level of knowledge (Dr Watson is recognised as a nurse theorist and a leader in nursing), and the in stitutional sites from which they speak (a universi ty based school of nursing or as a leader of a nursing organisation). However, it is possible within the discourse for co ntrary opinions to surface and for contradictory choices to be made. Wh at counts as serious and important at one time will not necessarily be co unted as an item of truth at another period. Furthermore, the procedures of rewriting, transcribing, translating and re fining statements are ways in which statements may be diminished\u2014termed 'procedures of intervention ' by Foucault (1972:58). Statements from one field may be transferred and applied to another and therefore rearranged into a new whole (discourse). The statement is limited to a referential. Th e referential forms the place, conditions of existence, field of emergence, authority to different iate between individu als or objects, the states of things and relations that are brought to play by the stat ement itself. The possibilities of appearance and delimitation for the statement ch aracterise what Foucault terms the \"... enunciative level of the formulation \" (Foucault 1972:91). To describe this enunciative level is to analyse the relations (relations may be just ified by tradition and authority or commentary, of the order of repetition or acce ptance) between the 71statements and the spaces of differentiation, in which the statement itself reveals the differences. The statement always defines itse lf by establishing a specific link with something else that lies on the same level as itself (Deleuze 1988:11). The statement possesses a particular relation to a subject. The subject of a statement (the subject may be the nurse or the patient) is a pa rticular function and is not necessarily the author of the statement, and the position of the subject can be a ssigned. This position may be a vacant place that is filled by different in dividuals (for exampl e, caring nurses). Foucault presents it as ... a dimension that characterizes a whole formulation qua statement . It is one of the characteristics proper to the enunciative function and enables one to describe it (Foucault 1972:95). Describing the formulation of the statemen t determines what position can and must be occupied by the individual if he or she is to be the subject of it. That is, the subject occupies a position in relation to the domain of objects that allows concepts to be formed on the basis of coexistence betw een statements. Not all position s of the subject, all types of coexistence between statements and all disc ursive strategies are equally possible, hence there can be no one true discourse. The form ation of certain concepts is dependent on the statements in which they are made and the coexistence between statements, affording the differing statements in a discursive practice. In archaeology, statements as a conceptual tool are analysed to see how they may be grouped and linked to one another and to disc over how recurrent elements of statements can reappear, dissociate, recompose, change, be taken up into ne w structures and constitute new organisations among themselves . The aim is to describe their dispersion 72throughout the writings, the field in which co ncepts can coexist and the rules to which the field is subjected (Foucault 1972:38). Unders tanding the way that st atements have been grouped and linked together renders the discou rse visible and consequently makes visible the knowledge that has deve loped and the politics underlying this knowledge. In the discussion so far I have elaborated th e first conceptual tool by presenting what Foucault meant by the statement. In the next section I will focu s on the meaning of discourse (1972:117); the second of the thre e tools used for understanding things in an archaeological analysis. Discourse Discourse is a complex and much used word across disciplines and comprising many meanings (Foucault 1972; van Dijk 1997). Even Foucault's own usage of discourse changes over time. In the Archaeology of Knowledge he uses 'discourse' in three ways: 1) discourse is a term for a coherent group of st atements; 2) any given discourse is made up of relatively few statements; and 3) statements are essentially rar e. While a discourse has the potential to take in an indefinite number of statements, in actuality only a limited number will constitute a discourse, and thes e are referred to again and again (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:35). Discou rses (i.e. groups of statements) act to both constrain and enable what is known. Therefore, statements are parts of knowledg e and are part of a technique for the production of human subjects (e.g. caring nurses) and institutions (i.e. nursing). For Foucault, discourse is thought of in term s of bodies of knowledge or relatively well bounded areas of social knowledg e, where discourse is used to describe individual acts of 73language \u2014the ideas and statements that allow one to make sense of a nd see things (McHoul and Grace 1993:26). Th e task of discourse then is to make differences: to constitute them as objects, to analys e them and to define their concept. In de scribing the grouping of statements, Foucault defined discourse as follows: We shall call discourse a group of stat ements in so far as they belong to the same discursive formation; it do es not form a rhetorical or formal unity, endlessly repeatable, whose appe arance or use in history might be indicated (and, if necessary, explained), it is made up of a limited number of statements for which a group of conditions of ex istence can be defined. Discourse in this sense is not an ideal, timeless form that possesses a history; the problem is not therefor e to ask oneself how and why it was able to emerge and become embodied at this point in time, it is, from beginning to end, historical\u2014a fragment of history, a unity and discontinuity in history itself, its divi sions, its transformations, the specific modes of its temporality rather than its sudden irruption in the midst of complicities of time (Foucault 1972:117). Therefore for Foucault and as used in this th esis, discourse is a grou p of statements that belong to the same discursive fo rmation (I take this up as the third tool for discussion) in which conditions can be defined. Within discourse, a writer's work should be co nsidered as a whole, or as Foucault states: a unity (uvre). (Remember that I referred to the uvre earlier when I di scussed the statement in archaeology). It is this product that belongs to the writer, and within this work it is possible to consider continuities of ideas or thought. An example in relation to caring would be the work of Drs Jean Wats on and Madeleine Leininger, who have both 74individually presented a unity about caring. Fo ucault conceived that, within a unity, an irruption of a real ev ent can be seen and archaeology is a search for when this event occurs. Of importance is whether the event is repeated (i.e. contin ues) and known about or whether it is forgotten. Consideration is given to whether th is event is transformed in any way or possibly hidden from view, or perhap s totally erased. In reference to caring, an irruption would be when a n ew statement is formulated, for example when Leininger claimed that \"nursing is caring and caring is the heart of nursing\" (Leininger 1981b:3). The analysis then includes how it is that this event has occurred and continued in nursing. Residing in the discourse are the systems of formation, that is: the complex group of relations that function as a ru le (such as power and ideolog y) and lay down what must be related in a discursive practice for a conc ept to be used. To digress for a moment, discursive practices are identifi ed as a body of rules (anonymo us, historical) determined in time and space, and for a given area (social, economic, geographical , linguistic) that has defined conditions of operation (Foucault 1972:208; Dreyfus and Rab inow 1983:92). They are further identified by the set of conditions in accordan ce with which a practice is exercised, or gives rise to partially or tota lly new statements, or with which the practice can be modified (Fou cault 1972:208-9). Continuing with discourse, the defining of a system of formation is to characterise a discourse (or a group of statemen ts) by the regularity of a prac tice or their use. The system of formation outlines the system of rules that are put into operation if an object is to be transformed; a new enumerati on appears if a new concept is developed. This may be a metamorphosed or imported conc ept, or a strategy may be modified and hold its position as part of the discourse. In addition: 75... what it also outlines is the system of rules that has to be put into operation if a change in other discourses (in other practices, in institutions, in social relations, and in economic proc esses) is to be transcribed within a given discourse, thus constituting a new object, giving rise to a new strategy, giving place to new enunci ations or new concepts (Foucault 1972:74). In other words, there are rules that govern be fore a concept can be used in a discourse. In discourse we seek the rules of the formati on of the discourse in discourse itself. We look for systems that allow for the emergence of objects, the appearance and distribution of enunciative modes (techniques, structures, the forms of know-how by which people are able to produce and recognise utterances), th e placing and dispersion of concepts, and the use of strategies. Foucault sees discourse as the general domain of all statements, sometimes as an individualisable group of statements, (that is a group of statements about an object) and sometimes as a regulated practi ce (such as nursing) that accounts for a certain number of statements, with every stat ement bearing a certain regularity. Statements therefore should be approached in terms of the organisations (arch ives) of which they form a part. Therefore, what can be said or not said about something (e.g. caring) is not absolutely fixed, because it varies historically. Nor is it open to what a person may state at any one moment (McHou l and Grace 1993:40) because suc h possibilities are limited by, for example, the regularity of the statement and by the institution s. We can speak in a discursive practice of knowle dge (that is, groups of statements that act to both constrain and enable what can be known and that are part of knowledge). This discursive practice is the space in which the subject may take up a position and speak of 76the objects that are dealt with in the particular discourse. It is the field of coordination and subordination of statements in which conc epts appear and are defined, applied and transformed. Knowledge is defi ned by the possibilities of use and appropriation offered by a discourse. A discursive practice may be defined by the knowledge that it forms, and there is no knowledge withou t a particular discursive practice (Foucault 1972:117). Discourse then contains the ability to say so mething other than what is said. A principle of vacuity operates; that is, that everything is never said. Of importan ce is not only what is said, but also what is not said, or not yet stated; that is, the gaps, limits, divisions, voids in the discursive formation (See Danaher, Schirato et al., 2000:35 for a discussion of how science is an example of a discursive formation) . Statements occupy a place that is entirely their own. They are analysed in their own place or own spac e (i.e. legal, bureaucratic, political space). The discovery of the place it belongs to or occupies and the ramifications of the system of formation make it possibl e to map its location. This mapping traces particular instances of where discourses have occurred, to make co nnections between these instances and to bring th em together to identify a particular discursive formation (Foucault 1972:41; Danaher, Schirato et al. 20 00:17). Here discursive formations the organising principles of an episteme. \"They wo rk to make speech po ssible, organise ideas or concepts, and produce 'objects of knowle dge'\" (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:22). The concept of power brings into the archae ological analysis the question of subjection and the political struggles associated with embodied subjects. Power relations have a capacity to produce the truths by which our so ciety lives and the cond itions necessary for the production of these truths. Th ese conditions are not entirely stable and are difficult to control, yet they are the know ledges that quickly pronounc e truths about humans (i.e. 77their nature, potential and endeavours). Theref ore an archaeological analysis shows that knowledges undergo transformati ons and reorganisation and it delineates the historicity of concepts and objects. This makes it both critical and controversi al, because it robs 'truths' of their self-evidence. The conditions of knowledges (positivity) imply an economy of power relations (between different fields, in stitutions, bureaucracies, and other groups) and the proposition that pow er produces knowledge. Th at is, power and knowledge directly imply one another. There is no powe r relation without the field of knowledge, or knowledge that does not presuppose and consti tute at the same time power relations. This power is mobile and contingent in that it can flow from one point to another. These power relations require the functioning of a discourse, the production of truth through power and the exercise of power through th e production of truth. Thus, writing an archaeology requires exposing the political and strategic nature of knowledge (McHoul and Grace 1993:55:65). To provide an example of the above to ca ring; power can be interpreted from the perspective of embodied subj ects who are positioned to speak within the discourse about caring. For example, from what site or institution they speak, a nd what they are saying, (that is, the statements that form the objec ts and concepts). Thus, discourse produces power relations from the perspective of who listens and partakes in this discourse. The embodied subjects speaking from within the discourse influe nce the thinking of nurses through the use of tech niques such as using, repeating, disr egarding or transforming what is said. When esteemed nurses speak from positions of authority their statements are taken seriously. Using my previous example, the nurse theorist Dr Madeleine Leininger writes prolifically about caring international ly and consults about caring throughout the world. The groups of statements that form th e object of caring and th e discursive practice 78of caring as espoused by Leininger, are take n up by colleagues in the same University, by students enrolled in courses at her home university and other institutions and by researchers and other theorist s who are concerned with caring and who utilise her work. They listen and partake in the discourse\u2014that is, they repeat, use, disregard or transform statements. They are located in different institutions, are involved in various fields of nursing and have different spaces (for example, social, political an d bureaucratic) to contend with and contribute to the pr oduction of truth for the discourse. An analysis of discourse then requires one to take up the related themes and to discover in what way statements may be characterised in the time in which they were presented, reactivated or used. Statements are first internalised by su bjects who invest them in techniques. The statements are put into operat ion by becoming practices (such as caring practice). Statements constitute their own pa st, they define and rede fine what makes it possible and are posed as an event that has oc curred and as a form th at can be modified, transformed or spoken ab out (Foucault 1972:123). In discussing discourse, I have presented the second of the three conceptual tools (that is the statement, discourse and discursive formation) used for unders tanding things in an archaeological analysis. The third tool I no w turn to discuss is discursive formation (Foucault 1972:38), otherwise labelled 'order s of discourse' (Danah er, Schirato et al. 2000:21). Discursive Formation The simplest definition of a discursive format ion would be to say that it is a system of 'rules' underlying any discourse. As such, a di scursive formation is not a type or level of 79discourse but a system that describes the re lation between statemen ts in the field of discourse and the way that an object of di scourse can be formed. Foucault states definitively: Whenever one can describe, between a number of statements, such a system of dispersion, whenever, between objects, type s of statement, concepts, or thematic choices, one can define a regularity (an order, correlations, positions and functionings, transformations), we will say, for the sake of convenience, that we are dealing with a discursive formation (1972:38 original italics) . Discursive formations are organising principl es that can be read through practice of embodied subjects. They work to make speech possible, to organise ideas and concepts and produce objects of knowledge (Danaher, Sc hirato et al. 2000:21). For the formation of a discourse there are three types of rules. Firstly, there are surfaces of emergence. These are the social and cultural areas in which a particular discursive formation will make its appearance. The second rule of formation is th at practised by author ities of delimitation, where subjects within particular institutional bodies are inscrib ed by certain knowledge and authority that is recognised by the pu blic. The third rule is termed grids of specifications, which are those systems and forms of differentiation against which an object is classified, measured and defined. These rules interact with one another in a complex way to form the conditions of possib ility of a discourse and the application of these rules identifies the field to be covered (Foucault 1972:38). In an archaeological analysis, the emergence of the statement involves mapping when the statement emerged and when new statemen ts began to function. Describing the 'authorities of and analysing the 'grids of specification' (Foucault 1972:41) enhances the defining of objects within the discourse. There are many conditions 80necessary for the appearance of an object of discourse. These include: that one cannot speak of anything at any given time, that the relation s that are established between institutions, economic and soci al processes, behavioural patterns, systems of norms, techniques, types of classification and modes of characterization, need to be considered in order to identify what it is that enables objec ts to appear, to juxtapose with other objects and to be placed exterior to the field. These relations are complex and characterise discourse as a practice or as a series of events that occur at different levels. In archaeology discursive relations are at th e limit of discourse offering\u2014 objects of which it can speak and determining the group of relations that di scourse must establish in order to speak of the object. Objects formed by discourses cons truct the world that speaks them and they have a history. In an archaeology, to analyse discourse is to define the rules of production of an object and the or dering of objects where discourses are treated as \"... practices that systematically form the object s of which they sp eak\" (Foucault 1972 :49) and create the world in what they represent. Perhaps the most powerful assertion I could make of the Foucauldian view would be to claim that objects help make subjects. That is, the positions occupied by the subject are defined by the situation in relation to the various domains or groups of objects. The subject (for example, the caring nurse) is one that questions, li stens, sees, and is situated at a distance. The relation can be from where th e subject speaks and interacts with others (for example; institutional, technical) as a subject, who perceives, observes and teaches. Discourse is the totality in which the dispersion of the subject and a discontinuity with self may be determined; where a network of sites is deployed. In their discussio n of the subject in regard to Foucault's work, McHoul and Grace state tha t 81 Discourse is not simp ly the means by which a human subject\u2014existing prior to the discourse\u2014expresses it self or accomplishes something. Rather the discursive conditions (rules and criteria) set up spec ific places or positions in which subj ects can form... (1993:48). This means that it is not simply what people say about caring that is important but the discursive conditions and positio ns subjects occupy contribute to the discursive formation of caring. That is why people can say a particular thing at a parti cular time. While this method could be considered anti-humanist, understanding how nurses as subjects are positioned in the discourse of caring, it is no t to disregard the humani ty of caring, but to analyse the discursive formation of caring. Archaeological Analysis The point of this discussion is that the th ree conceptual tools as discussed above are essential for undertaking an archaeological analysis. To move the discussion further, I now consider issues associated with an archaeologic al analysis. In this next discussion section I draw on my archaeological anal ysis of caring to situate the discussion about caring. I also offer limitations based on this archaeolog ical 'excavation' for consideration. As discussed above, archaeological analysis is concerned with discourse as a monument where discourses are defined as practices obeying certain rules, to show in what way the set of rules that they put into operation is not reducible to any other. It is a differential analysis of the modalities of discourse, which defines the 82... types of rules for discursive pra ctices that run through individual uvres, sometimes govern them enti rely, and dominate them to such an extent that nothing eludes them; bu t which sometimes, too, govern only part of it (Foucault 1972:139). Archaeology is a rewriting, a transformation of what has already be en written. It is a systematic description of a discourse-object (s uch as caring) and strives to uncover when words are not used each time in the same sense, or when th e same nucleus of meaning is apprehended through different words. It aims to uncover to what extent one can affirm the same theme that emerges in very different discourses and vocab ularies. Archaeology opens a new door to the understanding of nursing as both a practice and as a mode of knowledge. This methodology provid es an alternative approach to the already well researched and theorised phenomenon of caring. It contribute s to the development of nursing knowledge and to the understandin g of caring in the field of nursing as a discourse and not a phenomenon. Furtherm ore, as a methodology it provides a mechanism that allows for the viewing of caring from a different pe rspective. The use of archaeology as a methodology co ntributes to a far closer ex amination of the meaning of caring, to changes in the meaning of caring over time and also to an understanding of caring as presented in the literature, than has been achieved prev iously for caring in nursing. It identifies the discursive format ions to trace systems of thought as objects (McHoul and Grace 1993:11) and examines th e methods, practices and techniques by which official discourses go about the pr ocess of normalisation and occlude forms of knowledge which are different from them (McHoul and Grace 1993:17). 83Archaeological analysis allows one to examin e caring from the pers pective of sameness and difference (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:19). That is, th rough archaeological analysis the same statements can be identified that contribute meaning for caring. Conversely, the use of other statements ma y provide a different meaning for caring. Archaeology contributes to the search for the continuance of meanings of statements for the discourse and the identification of statements that no longer contribute to the discourse. The method allows for an identification of th e discourse to be por trayed, that is, the statements of the discourse and the space in which the discourse is situated. It provides the opportunity of understanding that the order of things is different for caring and that we can speak differently about caring (Dan aher, Schirato et al. 2000 :21). A pure analysis of caring rather than an application of certain principles of Foucauldian thought is an outcome of archaeological analysis. Therefore it is a more accurate analysis and provides for an in-depth understanding of Foucauldian principles (Danaher, Sc hirato et al. 2000:3). An alternative account of many of the same \"facts\" that anchor the received view of caring in nursing can be achieved. Archaeology is concerned wi th how disciplinary knowledg es (caring in nursing) functioned (McHoul and Grace 1993:15) and how bodies of ideas change and transform. in this case an investigation of the conditions that made possible the eventual development of caring in nursing. The reco gnition of change and the broadening of horizons can be identified at the statement le vel and in the ordering of statements that form the discourses of caring. Change is examin ed closely. Archaeology is a social critique in that it opens up a space for change. As Gutt ing states, it is the \"... preferred instrument for current social and cultural analysis\" (1994:3) for it underline s the close link between perceiving, conceiving, saying and doing (Flynn 1994:32). 84 Furthermore, archaeological analysis allows us to identify distinct bodies of knowledge. In this study, three discourses of caring have been identified through archaeological analysis. From within the discipline of nursing, caring is known globally as a body of knowledge. This thesis challenges this view and suggests that in effect, caring is three discontinuous well-bounded bodies of knowledge. They overla p, intersect and provid e an overall view of the world (McHoul and Grace 1993:32), th ereby identifying and categorising the knowledge for each discourse of caring. Discou rses are established over a period of time and it is timely to us e archaeology as the method to understand caring in nursing, beca use discourse cannot be analysed while we are imme rsed in it. Now that time has progressed, archaeology offers an alternat ive account of many of the same facts that anchor the received view of ca ring in nursing. It is these three disc ourses that comprise what I have termed 'An Archive of Caring for Nursing' following Foucauldian thought. Whils t archaeology discovers the archive, it is however not possible to describe the archive exhaustively or in its totality. The archive emerges in fragments, regions and levels and becomes clearer as time separates us from it (Foucault 1972:130). In nursing, caring is vi ewed generally as a concept or phenomenon and therefore, the analysis of the archive pr esents us with another way of thinking. As more time passes, the unders tanding of this archive will change, and our knowledge of caring will be different in some ways but perhaps the same in others. A future excavation of the literature w ill attest to this. It would be fair to say that the philosophical perspective that I have taken limits this study, that is, from Foucault's perspective and th en again, from his early work before he 85developed his ideas further. This was however, a purposeful decision, given that other methodologies utilised to study caring to date have not be en able to expl ain why nurses collectively cannot decide what the meaning or definition of caring is. An archaeological analysis was necessary to excava te the meaning of caring as presented in nursing. It has provided the means to approach caring at a different level, to generate knowledge and understanding and to describe caring from the viewpoint that an arch ive exists. Therefore I am able to contribute to the body of nu rsing knowledge from a different perspective\u2014 one that allows for the understanding of caring as a set of knowle dges set up by institutions. Secondly, the documents retrieved that refl ected caring in nurs ing are also a study limitation. Not all of the iden tified articles and texts from throughout the world were available. Some of the contributing reasons were that not all journals were accessible from Australia, because of limits placed on subscrip tions and database access. In addition, there was difficulty in obtaining articles that were now out of print, and resources (physical, economic and time) precluded access. This st udy is based in Australia and much of the work on caring is published overseas. Therefor e, conditions that a ffect discourse vary because of global and local factors (economic, political, bureaucratic and differences in nursing practice). Insight into these conditions comes by way of ac cessible texts. However, access to this information is limited. Conclusion I start from trying to understand what enable s nurses to speak and know about caring and what it is that constrains them within a specific historical period. From my own perspective, I am not immersed in a particular discourse of caring but my a im is to show 86that within nursing different discourses of ca ring exist. When we can see that nurses view caring differently because of the discourse they are immersed within then we are able to realise that more than one discourse of caring exists. To this end, this is a study of 'An Archive of Caring for Nursing' using Foucau ldian archaeology as th e analytical method. (This discussion has taken us a long way from the story about Casey.) However, it is the reality of this story that highlights how arch aeology as a research method has allowed me to understand caring. The scout nurse's story ab out Casey is located in time and space. It is a nursing practice example from the late 19 90s, specific to operating theatre nursing and to the role undertaken by the scout. The cu lture and practice of nursing, the political context, and the bureaucratic pr ocesses all contribute to this period. The statements about caring have come from my practice as a sc out nurse and these statements formulate the object of caring as stated by me (the scout nurse) in this role in the space that they have surfaced. The anaesthetic nurse who is also caring for Casey, and Casey herself, would formulate their own objects of the discourse. You might ask, would they be the same? To understand caring in the domain of nursing has been a matter of analysing the statements, the discourse and discursive formations (using Foucault's concep tual tools). The result of the archaeology and multiple analyses has led to 'An Archive of Caring for Nursing' being identified from this study. Methodology: An Archaeological Analysis of Caring In the previous section of this chapter, I discussed archaeology (Fo ucault 1972) and in particular elaborated the thre e tools essential for undertakin g an archaeological analysis: namely the statement, discourse and discursive formation. In this sect ion, my intention is to elaborate how I have utilised Foucault's no tion of archaeology to analyse caring from within the context of the nursing literature post 1970. The adoption of this time frame is 87based on changes that have impacted on nurs ing since this period. These include for example: developments in education for nurses , such as the transfer of nursing education into Institutions of Higher Education in Australia; the publishing of caring as a phenomenon of interest to nurses; the development of caring theories and access to published papers as a result of technological advances. In addition, my own nursing experiences are located in this time frame. This time frame reflects a new era for nursing. Enough time has pass ed since the early developments of caring in nursing by Watson (1979) and Leininger (1981) to warrant an excavation of the nursing literature in orde r to examine caring from the Foucauldian perspective of discourse and archaeological analysis. Relevant texts, research reports, literature reviews, discussion papers, and commen ts (from this point on collectively called documents) were analysed to provide the da ta upon which the disc ussion of caring is based. The first phase of the method was to locate as many documents as possible in the nursing literature that were published or availabl e. Unfortunately, not all documents were retrievable because of reasons associated with access and availability of journals and texts, library subscription restrictions and comput er issues. However, a large collection of documents (approximately 856) was accessed. Documents retrieved were cross-referenced using the bibliographies and reference lists in an attempt to identif y statements from other documents that were not readily available. All retrieved documents we re subjected to several 'close readings' in order to come to terms with how discourse constructs the object of study\u2014caring. 88In order to make sens e of the retrieved documents, using Foucault's ideas of archaeology and discourse, I developed a criteria set (see Figure 1) based on the writings of Foucault (1972), McHoul and Grace (1993), Dreyfus an d Rabinow (1983) and Parker (1992). The criteria set was used as a tool that provided a mechanism to methodic ally approach textual analysis of retrieved informat ion. A template summar y (see Figure 2) acted as a prompt, an organisational format for the criteria and for the recording of my comments. It later became a trigger for my though ts as I investigated each piece of literature. All of the documents on caring re quired several analytical reads (clo se readings) before information could be extracted and recorded (see Figure 3 as an example of a recorded template). The first 'close reading' consisted of reading the documents to record statements about caring. Most of these statements were one line se ntences though research instruments and thematic analyses were reco rded as collections of statements. The second reading concentrated on literature reviews or disc ussions where referenc es were made to statements about caring made by other authors (citations) . Mapping of these citations provided a time line for the ap pearance of statements as well as a cross check for the variation of statements that were able to be identified, for example, when an author would cite a previously published piece of work and restated caring ideas, th emes, practices, and et cetera. Multiple citings allowed for the ownership of statements by authors to be recognised at the time when the statements or iginated and to identify the re-use of those statements in the discourse. The final readin gs were made to examine what institutions, practices, bureaucracies and initiatives (s ee the earlier discussion about discursive formations) may have been influential. By way of organisation, each completed te mplate summary was attached to the document under analysis for later data interpretation and further analy sis. In essence, this approach 89provided me with the strategy to document the stat ements about caring and assisted me to identify the discursive practices and rules of formation for the discourses I later named. 90 Figure 1: Criteria Set for Archaeological Analysis Discourse Defined Discourses are knowledges; knowledg es are collected into disciplines (McHoul and Grace 1993:42). (My notes for consideration)Discourse refers to relatively well- bounded areas of social knowledge (McHoul and Grace 1993:31). A discourse would be whatever constrains but also enables writing, speaking and thinking within such specific historical limits (McHoul and Grace 1993:31). Discourses are discontinuous but can overlap and intersect as they change historic ally (McHoul and Grace 1993:31). What can be said? What can be thought? (McHoul and Grace 1993:36). Discourse is the general domain of all statements (Foucault 1972:80). Groups of statements act to both constrain and enable what we know (McHoul and Grace 1993:37). Identified by the existence of criteria of formation, transformat ion, and correlation (McHou l and Grace 1993:44). Group of statements belong to a single system of formation (Foucault 1972:107). The heart of Foucauldian thinking is to treat past discourse as a monument to be described in its ch aracter disposition; seek in the discourse its conditions of existe nce; refer the discourse to the practical field in which it is de ployed (McHoul and Grace 1993:49) Note Order of Things is discourse of lif e, labour, language. Archaeology of knowledge is a reflection of The Order of Things (Foucault 1970). 1. Discourse is realised in text Consider the meanings of this text, such as ideas and statements which express an institution's values (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:x). Explore the individual acts of language, ideas and statements that allow one to make sense of and 'see' things (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:x) Map from the text points (irruptions), define the form they assume/relationships/domain th ey govern (Foucault 1972). Is the meaning presente d here the same as the meaning presented in earlier texts? (McHoul and Grace 1993:51). Are there transformations of the statements? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:44). 2. Discourse is about objects Ask what objects are referred to an d describe them (Parker 1992). Are there new objects for a discourse at a given period? (McHoul an d Grace 1993:54). Are there changed modes of operati on/conceptual shifts/alterations in theoretical options? (McHoul and Grace 1993:54). Consider practices that systematically form the object s of which they speak (Parker 1992:8). 91 Discourse constructs representation s of the world. Consider. (Parker 1992:8). Consider the reality of the objects to the discourse (Parker 1992). Talk about the talk as if it were an object, a discourse (Parker 1992:8). Contradictions as objects (spaces of dissension-assertions /objections) Intrinsic contradict ions\u2014those that are employed within the discursive form ation (Foucault 1972:151-4). Consider the visible structure (form, number, arrangement, groups ) (Foucault 1972:151). Consider a succession of events which may be an object (Foucault 1972:167). How can the statements which refer to a common object be grouped together (to catalogue discurs ive formations )? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:61). What was said in all the statements that named the object? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:61). What are the background practices (to the enunciative functio n) which make the statement and thei r objects possible? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:62). What counts as objects? What sort of things can seri ously be said about them? What concepts can be used in the saying? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:71). 3. A discourse contains subjects What rights do they have to spea k in this way (Parker 1992:9). What position/function does the speaker have? (Foucault 1972:200) What do they say in the discou rse, what would someone who identifies with them say? (Parker 1992) Specify what types of persons are talked abou t in this discourse (some may be object s) (Parker 1992:9). Discourse creates subjects, i.e. the nurse, the patient/client What is it at this period of time that makes people ta ke this statement seriously? (McHoul and Grace 1993:5 8). What historical conditions made various types of what specif ic and delineated subjects possible? (McHoul and Grace 1993:91). What is it that gives this speech act seriousness? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:58). What are the conditions (rules and criteria) from where subjects ca n speak? (McHoul and Grace 1993:49). Which talkers can be taken seriously in this period? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:66). Who has the right to make statements? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:68). From what site do these statements emanate? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:68). What position does the subject of discourse occupy? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:68) Who can be taken seriously? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:68). 92 Who has the right to speak with the presumption that what s/he says comes true? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:68). Statements cannot come from any body; their value, efficacy, the ir therapeutic powers and their existence as statements cannot be dissociated from the statutorily de fined person who has the right to make them to claim them the power? Consider (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:68). Statement should be part of a technique or techniques for the production of human subjects an d institutions (McHoul and Grace 1993:38). 4. A discourse is a coherent set o f meanings Archaeology seeks general rules that will be uniformly valid in the same way at every point in time. Wh at are these? (Foucault 1972:166). Map a picture of the world this di scourse presents (Parker 1992:11). How would a text using this discou rse deal with objections to the terminology? (Parker 1992:10). Archaeology wishes to uncover the analogies and differences as they appear at the level of the formati on. Are these evident? And in what way? (Foucault 1972:160-1). Show how quite different discursive elements may be formed on the basis of similar rules (Foucault 1972:160-1). Show the different formations; the archaeological isomorphisms (Foucault 1972:160-1). Show to what extent these rules do/do not apply in the same way, are or are not linked in the same order, are or are not arranged in accordance with the same model in different types of discourse (Foucault 1972:160-1). Define the archaeological model of each formation (Foucault 1972:160-1). Show how entirely different concepts occupy a similar position in th e ramification of their system of positivity (archaeological isotopia) (Foucault 1972:160-1). Show how a single notion may cover two archeologically distinct elements (Foucault 1972:160-1). Show how a single notion may cover two archeologically distinct elements to indicate the archaeological shif ts (Foucault 1972:160-1). Show how from one positivity to an other, relations of subordination or complementarity may be es tablished (Foucault 1972:160-1). Establish the archaeological corr elations (Foucault 1972:160-1). What is the context in which the statements (discursive formations) make sense? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:55). Statements are understood via the rules which govern their functioning (McHoul and Grace 1993:38). What rules govern the system of sta tements: i.e., in what ways are the statements actually related? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:55). 5. A discourse refers to other How is it possible for men within the same discursive practice to speak of different objects, have different opinions and make 93discourses contradictory choices? (Foucault 1972:200). How do the discourses draw me taphors and institutional support from each other? (Parker 1992:14). Contrast the ways of speaking/disc ourse/against each other. What are the different obj ects they constitute? (Parker 1992:14). Where do the discourses overlap or what ways do they constitute what looks like the same objects in different way s? (Parker 1992:14). What are the conditions of existence for th is? (McHoul and Grace 1993:48). Where does the discourse come from and from where does it derive its right to speak? (Foucault 1972:205). What is the interrelationship between the different discourses in th e analysis? (Parker 1992:12). How can the discourse be legi timated? (Foucault 1972:205). 6. A discourse reflects its own way of speaking Refer to other texts to elaborate discourse as it occurs, perha ps implicitly, and where it addres ses different audiences (Parker 1992:14). Reflect on the term used to descri be a discourse, a matter which involves moral/political choices on the part of the analyst (Parker 1992:14). Consider that discourse is a practice that has its own forms of sequence and succession (Foucault 1972:169). Uncover the level in which history can give place to definite types of discourse (own type of historicity and are related to whole sets of various historicities (Foucault 1972:169). What can be said? (Foucault 1972:179). What made it possible at the time it appeared? (Foucault 1972:179). 7. A discourse is historically located Discourses are located in time, in hi story, for the obje cts they refer to are objects constituted in the past by the discourse or related discourses (Parker 1992:15). How and where have discourses emerged? (Parker 1992:16). How have discourses changed and told a story. How have they referred to things which were always there to be discovered? (Pa rker 1992:16). Map the points at which the projec tion of one concept upon another could take place (Foucault 1972:161). Fix the isomorphism that made a transference of methods/techniqu es possible (Foucault 1972:161). Describe the field of vectors an d of differential receptivity (conditions of historical possibility) (Foucault 1972:161). What sort of talk in a given period can be taken seriously? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:66). What are the small discontinuous regions when the statements were taken seriously? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:71) (i.e. islands of density in which statements proliferate ). 94 How is one discursive formation substituted for another? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:73). Describe how the different elements of a system of formation were transformed. (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:74). If discourses systematic ally limit each other, what other discourses are operating that limit this discourse? (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:75). 8. Discourses support institutions Where does the discourse exist ( texts, speeches, journals, media, lectures, programmes, everyday speech, etc.) (Parker 1992) . and emerge from them Discourse is often a pr actice which reproduces the material basis of an institution (Discursive practices\u2014[holding a hand]\u2014those that reproduce institutio ns (Parker 1992:17). Identify the institutions that are at tacked, subverted when this or that discourse appears (Parker 1992:17). Archaeology reveals relations betwe en discursive formations and non-discursive formations (instituti ons, political events, economic practices and processes) (Foucault 1972:162). Rapprochement archaeology is de ployed in the dimension of a general history seeking to discover the whole domain of instituti ons, economic processes and social relations on which a discursive formation can be articu lated (Foucault 1972:162). What is the practical field in wh ich it is deployed? (McHoul and Grace 1993:48). Describe and analyse dependencies; within and between discourses and the forms of sociopolitical change (McHoul and Grace 1993:48). 9. Discourse produces power relations Look at which categories a pers on gains and loses from the employment of the disc ourse (Parker 1992:18). Look at who would wa nt to promote and who would want to dissolve the discourse (Parker 1992:19). Describe and analyse dependencies within and between discourses and the forms of sociopolitical change (McHoul and Grace 1993:48). Power connects discourses and th e positions it generates for its subjects (McHoul and Grace 1993:48). In the following section, I will elaborate each of the nine crit eria used during the analysis of the literature. This will give an insight into how each criterion triggered my thoughts during the analysis and how I analysed the information in the nursing liter ature for the statements, discourse and discursive formations. 95For the first criterion that discourse is realised in text and therefore meanings (connotations, a llusions, and implications) evoked in the literature could be analysed from writings (Foucault 1972; Parker 1992:6) I considered the meanings of the word 'caring' in any given text. I identified and mapped statements relevant to caring (in rega rd to time, author and a brief synopsis of meaning), then examined the relationships assumed between state ments and identified the areas of nursing practice to which the statement alluded. After identifying the statements about caring presented in the documents, I th en clustered the statements that provided a similar meaning of caring and segregated out differing statement s or statements that stood alone. In order for me to ga in an understandin g of the statements , discourse and the discursive formation, I needed to identify the author of each piece of writing, the date and place of publication and sometimes the audience the writing addressed (if kno wn). This afforded an insight into who was writing abou t caring, from what institutional site and what definition of caring they were mobilising. The country of origin of the publication was able to be determined, as were the cultural , political, social and theoretical influences in some documents. These pi eces of information were reco rded on the form developed from the template summary (s ee Figure 2 and Figure 3). 96Figure 2: Summary Template 1. Discourse is realised in text 2. Discourse is about objects (These spaces were used to record my notes related to each document) 3. A discourse contains subjects 4. A discourse is a coherent set of meanings 5. A discourse refers to other discourse 6. A discourse reflect s its own way of speaking 7. A discourse is historically located 8. Discourses support institutions and emerge from them 9. Discourses produce power relations Further analytical work using the Criteria fo r Archaeological Analysis and the template summary provided me with an insight into the objects of the disc ourse. These objects were able to be identified and compared to other objects also assumed within the discourse. The analysis meant searching for changes in the objects' mode of operation, along with any conceptual shifts or alterations in their meaning within nursing. Analysis included discovering what makes them count as objects, how they were grouped together 97(discursive formations) and what statements counted to name the o bjects. That is, by asking the question, 'what obje cts are referred to?' Consequent ly these objects were then described (Parker 1992:9). 98 Figure 3.

For example, questions posited during the analysis included; what rights does the author have to speak in the way that they do in the discourse? At what period of time are they speaking? Are they visible within the discourse? From what site do they speak? What was it that gave the speech seriousness or truth? (Parker 1992:10; McHoul and Grace 1993:38). The criterion that a discourse is about a co herent set of meanings (Foucault 1972; Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:55) provided an approach to analysis. In considering this statement, I constructed a map of how cari ng is presented (see Figure 4). Working from this view meant searching for the archaeological isomor phisms, identifying the different formations, the irruptions (Foucault 1972:25) as they oc curred and the reasons for their occurrence. The aim was to uncover same ness and difference as they appeared at the level of formation and to seek the general rules that we re uniformly valid in the same way at each point in time. A dimension to the analysis was to examine the context i n which the statements are understood, the rules that govern the system o f statements and ways that the statements are actually related. This anal ysis helped me to understand the rules and conditions of existence of the discursive formation of caring. 102Figure 4: Extract from Discursive Map of Caring Year 1225 England 1984 USA 1986 Australia Construct Care Caring Caring Author/s Oxford Engli sh Dictionary (OED ) (Murray, Bradley et al. 1970) Leininger 1984 Dunlop 1986 Thoughts/ Ideas / Examples/ Questions OED 2a To be troubled, uneasy, or anxious OED 2b To feel concern (great or little) be concerned, trouble oneself, feel interest, Now only with for.

Essentially, I was looking for where disco urses overlap and 103searched out the conditions of existence for each discourse of caring. This was of prime importance to my study, because it seemed on initial examination that the debate about caring in nursing (see discussion in the preface and introductory chapter) could be understood by considering how and why caring came about and how nur ses are positioned in understanding caring. Furthermore, examining the literature and searching for examples that show how it was possible for persons within th e same discursive practice to speak of different objects, (e.g. the ward nurse and the operating theatre nurse present different views of caring), to have different opinions, and to make contradictory choices, seemed relevant beca use this would help to determine how each discourse could be legitimated. This analysis relied on questions such as : What can be said in the discourse? What made it possible for the st atement to appear at the time it did? Answering these questions included examining how a discourse refle cts its own way of speaking, that is, the type of language that is used and the position of power one has when placed in relation to the discourse. (Questions asked included: Who has the right to spe ak? What statements are used to convey meaning?). An aim was to uncover when history gave a place to the discourse, or when persons who were speaking about the objects of each discourse were taken seriously. Identifying the objects of the discourse meant recognising that the di scourse is located in time and in history. It was ne cessary to discover how and wh ere the discourse emerged, to identify changes that occurred within the disc ourse and the story that has been told by these changes. That is, when a concept can be seen to be projected onto another or when an isomorphism can be identified. These points in time were charted and mapped. Archaeological analysis meant examining when small disconti nuous regions that Foucault 104calls \"islands of density\" (i.e. groups of statements) were taken seriously, and how one discursive formation was subst ituted or transformed into another (Foucault 1972:114; Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:71). Th is involved delving into the literature that cites or discusses caring to examine what other discourses were operating that might have limited or influenced the discourse of caring. The criterion labelled discourses support institut ions and emerge from them (Parker 1992; McHoul and Grace 1993)\u2014the mechan ism for this emergence in cludes subjects, bodies, power/knowledge relations\u2014was applied to the analysis through the examination of documents to find out where the discourse actu ally exists (i.e. texts, speeches, journals, media, lectures, programs, etc.). This allowed me to identify the disc ursive practices that reproduce institutions (or subvert an institut ion) and to reveal the relations between the discursive and non-discursive formations (for example, eco nomic practices and political events). Foucault is well known for his work follo wing archaeology, related to power and knowledge and his claim that discourses pr oduce power relations (for example, the structure of institutions as in his genealogic al studies). In my study, for example, one question considered during the analysis included; what would a person ga in (or lose) from employing the discourse? I also searched for illustrations of persons promoting or wanting to dissolve the discourse (Parker 1992:19). Fo r Foucault, power is a discursive relation located at local, region al and material institutions, outside of conscious decisions. Crit ical is the idea of how power produces effects such as subjects who allow power to flow (McHoul and Grace 1993:21). 105During the analysis of text, th e aim of the research at the an alytic level was to show how a discourse connects with other discourses, ho w it sanctions oppress ion and to show how dominant groups tell their stories about the past in order to justify the present. A search for the different domains of knowledge, identi fying when the discursive practice achieves individuality and autonomy was recorded. Using the criteria for archaeological analysis and documenting information on the template summary gleaned from documen ts, provided the foundations necessary so that the next ph ase of the research could be implemented. This next phase, after critically analysing the retrieved documen ts as described above and recording information onto the template summ ary, was to develop a Discursive Map of Caring (see the extract from Discursive Map of Caring: Figure 4). This mapping technique, devised from the data, summarised th e irruptions of events identified in the literature. For example, who was speaki ng, how often they spoke and how they understood caring. The mapping technique prov ided an overview of caring as it was situated within time. I then made explicit all of the statements about caring from the retrieved documents so that all objects in each of the discours es could be fully recognised and appreciated. The statements were collec ted using a Quick Link line scanner. These scanned statements were transferred into Mi crosoft Word documents as text and became a large file of ca ring statements. To make the statements even more explicit , I again analysed the textual information (retrieved documents) and their attached template summaries to dete rmine the statements that represented the same ideas, themes and notions about caring. The scanned statements were then organised into Word documents that refle cted similar ideas or themes. The Word documents were then clustered together (see Figure 5 for an exam ple 106of clustering ideas). Many do cuments could be categorised under several th emes because more than one idea, concept or object wa s often presented in the document under analysis. For example, information presented in a literature review may rewrite, transcribe, translate and refine previous statements (see Foucault, 1972: 58), depending on the aim of the article. Therefore it was appropriate to identify writers who were referred to through methods of citation and recitation. The clustered groups of statements (in the Word documents and organised similarly) were subjecte d to further analyses to identify themes (see Figure 6). Labels were attached to make sense of the theme that had been developed. These labels reflect my categorisation techni ques and interpretation of knowledge, my adopting a subjective categorisi ng and an interpretive dimension. This subjective element reflects knowledge generated th rough this research, an in-d epth understanding of the statements identified and the discursive formations of caring that a re operating. 107Figure 5: The Clustering of Caring Id eas/Statements\u2014Examp les of References Identified for Categories. Caring as a Relationship Caring Categories/Themes Caring as a Miller 1995; Hope Bush the exercise, I again analysed the theme s and reorganised them by a process of further clustering and categor ising; here elements began to em erge. The use of the term elements is taken from Foucault, wherein elemen ts may comprise objects, concepts, theoretical choices, practices, enunciations or notions (Foucault 1972:182). 133 These elements identified were further analysed for meaning and I eve ntually found that three distinct discourses of caring emerged from the analyses. To make sense of the analyses and the processes undertaken to iden tify the discourses, I organised them into a summary classification table (see Figure 7) that shows the elements reduced from categorised themes (as shown in figure 5) and provided an example of statements beside each element. Reflecting on Foucault's archae ological analyses, I realised that the three discourses identified collectively formed An Archive of Caring for Nursing. Working backwards from the discourses to the elemen ts, themes and the associated statements, these statements made about caring can be se en to contribute to the three discourses identified.

Each of the chapters (3-5) in the discussion section is devoted to one of the three discours es of caring identified for the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'\u2014'caring as being', 'caring as doing' and 'caring as knowing'. In developing these discussion se ctions, I have drawn on ideas presented by Wickham and Kendall who discu ss archaeological research in action and in particular discourse analysis (Kendall and Wickham 1999:26,42) and I have employed th e principles of archaeology as presented by Foucault (1972). For each discourse, I have described the el ements of the discourse (where elements comprise objects, statements, concepts or them es that have been gr ouped together by a regularity such as an order, position, function or transformation). The chapters ar e organised as a description of th e discourse firstly then as a discussion that draws in the discursive formation and illustra tes the discourse. To begin th is archaeological analysis I worked 'upwards'. That is, I st arted analysing at the level of the statement, identified the discourses and made sense of these disc ourses by understanding the discursive formations. This was achieved by describing those relations between statements in the discourse and the way that an obj ect of discourse can be formed. As stated above, it is from the levels of analysis as presented in this section of the methodology chapter that the discussion secti on (chapters 3-5) has been developed. The archaeological analysis performe d is an analysis that has iden tified 'An Archive of Caring for Nursing' which I elaborate to the discourses and the disc ursive formations of caring, based on statements in the nursing literatur e available to me in New South Wales, Australia and that were publ ished from the 1970s forward. My aim in the discussion 136section is to go beyond this analysis of archae ology and to critically analyse concepts that Foucault mentions in The Archaeology of Knowledge and elaborates in his later work. Such concepts will of course include power and knowledge, institutions, gender, society and technology. I have not performed an analysis that elaborates each concept with each discourse; nevertheless, I have selected diffe rent concepts that allow me to illustrate the discourse under discussion. 137Figure 7: An Archive of Caring for Nursing AN ARCHIVE OF CARING FOR NURSING DISCOURSES OF CARING ELEMENTS EXAMPLES OF STATEMENTS DISCOURSE: CARING AS BEING Caring as Human Development Caring as Essential and Intrinsic Caring as Presence Caring as a Relationship Caring as a component of the human being Caring is a human element Caring and interactions in the life cycle Caring as a human trait Caring as a basic way of being Caring is essential for survival Caring is primary Caring matters to people Caring creates self and world Caring is essential to humanity Capacity to care is nearly indestructible Ethics of care Caring as a moral value The caring person is in the other's world Being with the person Societal value of caring Technological caring Valuing of caring Caring occurs spontaneously Caring as a relationship Caring as a partnership Negotiated care Caring as values of self Caring as an expression Caring as a commitment Caring as a mutually empowering relationship Codependent caring 138 DISCOURSES OF CARING ELEMENTS EXAMPLES OF STATEMENTS DISCOURSE: CARING AS DOING Caring Constructs Caring Themes Caring Practice Constructs associated with caring Construct of caring Caring constructs Care themes of nursing Caring behaviours as themes Caring themes Thematic groupings of care behaviours Caring for Caring by giving Caring by helping Caring actions Caring activities Carative factors Caring behaviours DISCOURSE: CARING AS KNOWING Caring for Nursing Caring Knowledge Caring as unique to nursing Care is central to nursing Caring is the core of nursing Caring is the essence of nursing Caring is the essential component of nursing Caring as an art Caring as a science Caring curricula Caring theory Caring as central to theory Human caring knowledge Standards of care Expert care Caring expertise Competent caring Caring conferences Theories of caring Methodology: Caring Linked to Foucauld ian Concepts in th e Nursing Literature 139Although there have been a number of complaints from some writers that Foucault's method is far too complex to be usable, others have found that it produces novel results. Jean-Claude Bonnet, for example uses Foucault's method to writ e about cooking, as it is discussed in a number of eighteenth-century texts, the Encyclopaedia in statements' (\u00e9nonc\u00e9s culinaires) , a 'culinary' and the ' a new collective subject' to 'alimentary practice'61 On the whole, however, such detailed applications are rare an d most writers only borrow isolated methodological points or concentrate on theoretical points raised by the book The Archaeology of Knowledge (O'Farrell 1989:62). Essentially the literature in nursing shows evidence of O'Farrell's thoughts: that while Foucault's concepts are represented in the literature, they are primarily discussed as individual points as they fit into the rhetoric of thought and ideas being expressed. In the nursing literature, there is a paucity of eviden ce to show that nurses have undertaken an archaeological analysis of statements related to caring. Discussion nested within Foucauldian thought about caring concepts is based upon an inad equate study of the archive. Genealogical discussions make assumpt ions about change bu t do not take into account how they change nor do they provide an adequate understanding at the statement level. That is, the statements people make se nse of: statements that are ongoing, multiple, not unitary but are important for nursing, nurs ing education and practice, given that they speak about how power influenc es what can be sa id and therefore known about caring. In the caring nursing literature, Foucault is re ferred to at the conceptual level, where his ideas, terms, concepts and themes formulate the initial discussion phases in literature- based discussions. In many cases he is one of several theorists/philo sophers who inform 140the work of the author, or he is referred to from a postmodern perspective. However, the methodological approaches fo r using Foucault's terms are usually not elaborated and conceptual development and application is often the approach use d. Furthermore, there is a dearth of evidence in the nursing literature to show that an archaeological analysis of caring has been performed. Discourse is defi ned by Foucault in a very particular way. More often than not it is taken from the Fo ucauldian literature and used in a linguistic methodology which bears out the role of power/knowledge relations in marking and placing bodies. There is little discussion in the nursing literature ab out Foucault's notion of archaeology or reference to the use of archaeology to understand Foucauldian concepts. Rarely is the statement mentione d, yet discourses when identified appear to be fluidly documented. The following discussion illustrates such Foucau ldian concepts as arch aeology, genealogy, power, knowledge and the notion of surveillance as used by nurses in the caring literature. Firstly, I discuss the few examples that reflect archaeology in the caring nursing literature. Secondly, I present an example of genealogy, and then I provide illustrations of the use of Foucauldian concepts and their application to caring in nursing. Firstly, the use of archaeology can be seen to have been influential in the development of nursing knowledge. Colin Holmes (1992) an d John Paley (2001) are examples where reference is made to the use of Foucault's archaeology. The method ological approach to Critical Theory and the Di scourse of Nursing Ethics by Colin Holmes (1 992) referred to the Foucauldian notion of discourse. A working de finition, as presented by Foucault (1972), was used in this work which he submitted for the Degree of Doct or of Philosophy. Holmes' approach was to perform a literatur e review extracting the central aims and 141subnarratives of a written discourse usi ng an analytical framework based on The Archaeology of Knowledge. He did not attempt an archaeological analysis but presented the literature of nursing ethics as a contemporary discourse, identifying the objects of the discourse, enunciative modalities and conc epts. His work reflec ts the meta-concept s as portrayed by Foucault, rather than methodologically applying the specific instances of Foucault's work such as an archaeological analysis. John Paley (2001) used archae ology as a 'borrowed' Foucau ldian term to describe his analysis. As he ... not because I share Foucault's stru cturalist leanings, but because the process (and the results) of my excava tion are roughly similar to his (Paley 2001:189). What he proposed was an analys is of why, for 30 years, nurses have found the goal of retrieving caring from its elusiveness as one th at is unattainable. In his paper, he focused on qualitative, discursive and theoretica l accounts of caring and organised his presupposition under five headings of what kn owledge is concentrating on, aligning caring knowledge development to Foucault's (1970) te xt on knowledge. Paley does not identify in any detail his approach to this analysis, apar t from claiming that the process is similar to Foucault. He concludes that \"knowledge of caring is an aggregate of 'things said'\", grouped into attributes and consisting of asso ciates (2001:192). He proposed that nursing knowledge development of caring is limited be cause of multiple associations for caring, divergent accounts of caring and competing ca ring theories. Because of this, Paley believes that it is impossible to apply caring knowledg e. He very strongly asserts that \"nursing's 'way of knowing', at least as far as caring is concerned, is approximately 350 years out of date\" (Paley 2001:196). Not surprisingly, Pa ley has received strong criticism about his 142claims in regard to caring knowledge development in nursin g, his approach to research and his past critiques of nursing (Deary, Deary et al . 2002; Watson and Smith 2002). Secondly, genealogy, a later Foucauldian me thodology, has been applied to nursing. Genealogy as a meth odology permits the opening up and reve aling of power and domination of particular disc ourses, disrupting the continuity of knowledge development and the truth claims of professions (M cHoul and Grace 1993:85; Oates (199 5) used genealogy to show how different understandings and practices of nursing care h ave come into being and have governed nursing and scholarship in four different historical epochs. They used genealogy, as opposed to archaeology (as used in this thesis), to interrogate the history of nursing care in Australia, searching out the un iformity in which nursin g care is constituted to illuminate the struggles, resistances, disc ursive and non-discursive practices at the everyday level of nursing practice. Their wo rk is sited within sociological theory to explore the social and historic al basis of nursing knowledge and practice, and they adopt the Foucauldian concepts of discourse, knowle dge, power and pastoral governmentality. Through the use of genealogy as a method, Heslop and Oates show that caring as a discourse is contextualised primarily within power and knowledge. In some instances the view of this caring discourse lies closely to nursing as a discourse and differentiation between nursing and caring is difficult when re ading the text. Their definition of discourse follows Foucault (1970), identifying discourse as \"...produced by a se ries of statements forming a representation of a subj ect or object that is given force by its setting or utterer. Patterns of statements are termed discur sive formations\" (Hes lop and Oates 1995:257). Their claim is that caring is a discursive formation because it is made possible under 143certain social conditions of possibility. Hesl op and Oates link this back to truth and the constitution of a science. They draw on the Foucauldian notion of power in that power is productive and relational. When knowledge fails to command adherence t hen a disjuncture occurs and new knowle dge is generated. The history of nursing in Australia is the mechanism to examine caring discourses from one time period to an other. Nursing is not distinguished from caring and while th e authors consider caring across epochs, essentially they are focused on the history of nurs ing and health care rather than caring, as in this thesis. In contrast, this thesis st arts at the statement level and contributes to nursing knowledge those statements that make up the discourses of caring. This thesis is the precursor to future genealog ical analyses of caring and th e consideration of power. It provides a demonstration of the detailed and original thinking that is required to inform a genealogical analysis. Archaeology may point toward a genealogy but need not do so. In this thesis by using the tools of Foucauldia n archaeology, the discourses of caring are firstly identified from the statement level and an Archive of Caring for Nursing becomes evident. Thirdly, writers in nursing can be seen to use Foucauldian concepts in stead of Foucault's methodologies. For example, the concepts of power, knowledge, disc ourse, surveillance and the gaze (see for example Delacour 1991; 1991; McKenna and Wellard 2004). Street (1995) uses power as a relationship, citing the work of Foucault. That is , power is something that is exercised over bodies in a part icular context. She aligns her discussion with the question, 144\"How is power functioning in this instance , how is it being produced and how are the relationships being stru ctured?\" (Street 1995:44). In de termining this question, Street claims that power relations can be discovered within the intricate webs of human social relationships. Working further with Foucault's concepts of power and knowledge, Street (1995) discusses the exercise of power combined with knowledge in nu rsing and states that it is primarily analysed through reflection on lang uage, meaning and cult ural practices. She examines power and representations, and identi fies the competing subje ct positions of the nurse in health care practices. The Foucauld ian concept of the pano pticon is drawn upon in her study, where power is seen in the form of the professional gaz e. That is, it is \"... not only exercised through fo rms of representations but also through systems of differentiation which codify the person into discrete medical categor ies\" (Street 1995:46) which then become the focus of the professi onal gaze. These concep ts of Foucault are applied in her research, based on what she terms participatory research\u2014a contextualised form of research. The Foucauldian (1976) notions of the panopti con, power and knowledg e are seen in the work of Lawler (1991). She uses the term 'the nursing gaze' and applies this to the taking of a nursing history (1991:37) claiming that patients may be subj ected to unnecessary surveillance during this proce ss. In nursing there is limited discourse on the body and some of its functions and in the absence of this discourse, some nursing functions are located outside accepted practices, causing a pr oblem for nursing. It is within this context that Lawler draws on the Foucauldia n concepts of power and knowledge. 145The relationship between the body and the state is one way that Lawler (1991) situates her discussion with the work of Fo ucault. She st ates that His analyses illustrate the extent to which the body is an integral part of social life, not only at the interpersonal level, but also within the cont ext of social organisation and institut ional techniques for social control (1991:60). She also draws on the work of Turner (1984, cited in Lawler, 1991) w hose view of sociology is very influenced by the work of Foucault. An understanding of the knowledge embedded in the accounts of practice given at the end of the shift handover was the subject of research by Pa rker and Wiltshire (1995). In theorising about their study, they drew on the ideas of Foucault in relation to the panopticon and the medical ga ze, linking knowledge to th e notion of discipline, and considering power as central in the produc tion of knowledge. They acknowledge that disciplinary power is exercised through techni ques of social control (Foucault, 1977 in Parker and Wiltshire 1995) such as the use of the panopticon as a surveillance technique aimed at bodily conformity. In delineating nursing practi ce knowledge, Parker and Wiltshire described three modes. These are; \"... reconnoitre , the nursing scan, savoir , the nursing gaze, connaissance , the nursing look\" (Parker and Wiltshire 1995:156). They attest that because of the dominance of the medical voice, supported as it is by the disciplinary po wer of medical knowledge, it is not surprising that the nu rsing voice is somewhat muted. The Foucauldian notions of panopticism and the medical gaze help in understandin g the complex domain of disciplinary power relations within which hospital-based nursin g practice occurs. 146 The emergence of the modern hospital and the clinical gaze reinforced the discourse of medical power (Short, Sh arman et al. 1998). Short, Sharma n et al., (1998) situated their discussion in regard to institutions and medical surveillance drawing upon ideas from The Birth of the Clinic (Foucault, 1973 in Short, Sharma n et al. 1993). The gaze positions patients as a body to be cured. Patients were rendered powerless in r egulated hospital settings and medical knowledge was given precedence over sub jective interpretations of patients. Foucault's ideas are drawn upon to assert that medi cal knowledge is repressive and controlling as it defines people according to dominant discourses that subject bodies to new and more subtle forms of monitoring, surveillanc e and regulation (Short, Sharman et al. 1993:91). The use of Foucauldian concepts can be seen to be evident in the work of Nelson (1995), where her focus is on the spiritual aspect of western nursing pr actices (Nelson 1995). Nelson asserts that Continuities in discourse and practice are unremarkable given the Christian basis of western society, a stat e of affairs that ha s lasted for nigh on two millennia. What is remarkab le is the manner in which this Christian genealogy has been rendered invisible by the humanist adoption of both techniques and discursive space of Christianity (1995:42). While Foucault is not closely referred to in this paper, the adoption of his terminology and concepts is evident; for example: discourse, discursive space, govern mentality, knowledge, power, genealogy, and technol ogies of the self are all referred to in the text. 147In discussing poststructuralism and nursing, Wi cks (1999) refers to Foucault's work in relation to discourse, knowledge and power . For Foucault, discourses are ways of constituting knowledge, social practices an d forms of embodied subjectivity (Foucault 1970; 1972 in Wicks 1999:15). She discusses his work in terms of power and resistance in that power is productive as well as repressive; it circulates, exists in actions and provides spaces of freedom within the ruling relations (1999:15). She claims t hat these concepts seem to have potential for the analysis of an area of women's work. In particular, she is interested in the bio-medical discourse of scie ntific medicine and explores the extent of the dominance of this model of knowledge in relation to nursing and practice. Specifically she states I am interested in the extent to which nurses are immersed in and constitute the dominant discourse and the extent to which and in what ways they resist it (Wicks 1999:16). Several writers use the Foucauldian lens of discourse to uncover influences on complex social and political constructions (Traynor 1996; Nelson 1997; Poll aschek 2003; and Wellard 2004). Di scourses therefore give rise to the ways we think and act and ultimately contribute to the development of prac tices for nursing. From a different perspective to the use of Foucauld ian concepts for un derstanding caring in nursing, there are writers who align Fouc ault with postmodern tenets. Holmes (1992) places Foucault under the same banner with postmodern authors, bu t claims that his position is somewhat 'notoriously ambiguou s' (1995) because although Foucault's allegiance has been claimed by the postmoderni sts, he himself has denied this allegiance. Foucault however is still cited as an influe nce in postmodern thought. Short, Sharman and Speedy (1998) referred to Foucault in respect to postm odernism when they discussed the 148development of sociological thought. Their reference to his work w as in regard to the \"... subtle ways in which knowledg e and power are intertwined in the production of truths that come to appear as self-evident and inviolable\" (1998:10), therefore the body was viewed as a site for the exerci se of power. Both Holmes (199 5) and Short, Sharman et al., (1993; 1998) refer to the contexts of mental health and psychiatric care and Foucault's work, especially Madness and Civilization (Foucault 1967) is cited. Situating postmodernism and referring to postmodern shifts, Jean Watson (1995) recognises the influence that Foucault (and other writers) has had on caring in nursing. Through the writings of nurses, reflecti ve of broader \"cultural, philosophical transdisciplinary shifts oc curring worldwide\" (Watson 1995:60) postmodern ideas are evident. Nursing is placed within these shifts in that it must engage with the postmodern approach, and indeed its themes and concepts are reflective of this (1995:63). Watson has embraced the postmodern approach for nursing and her caring theori es, as evidenced by her book Postmodern Nursing and Beyond (1999b). Feminist claims to Foucault's work can be tr aced to post-structura list views (Wicks 1999) and more specifically to the emphasis on the interconnectedness of po wer and knowledge, and the importance of resistan ce. Wicks asserts that the work of Foucault is not unproblematic for feminists, their concerns being his conceptu alisation of agency, power and resistance and their connections. She claims that Foucauldian an d feminist approaches do not sit well together and contradict each other at many points, acknowledging the work of Pringle (1988 in Wi cks, 1999) who claims that \"...while it may not be possible (or desirable) to fully integrate the two framewo rks, it is advantageous to keep them in the same sort of tension...\" (1999:18). Wicks lays claim to F oucault's work 149for feminism because of the language offered in regard to analysis of power, and uses the tools of discourse analysis to \"... examine vari ous texts and dialogue for their implications for gender inequality in the daily work of nurses and doctors\" (1 999:19). Wicks's aim was to search out and analyse medical and nurs ing discourses, drawing from ethnographic field work encompassing participative and non-participative observation in a general medical ward, supported by in-depth , semi structured interviews. By contrast, MacDougall (1997) draws on Foucault's (1976) discu ssions about homosexuality as a category of social oppression. He examines the nature of caring in relation to men and their masculinity, deta iling male oppression where male voices are lost, specifically in regard to homophobia an d racism. He alleges that homosexuality is inextricably linked to other categories; to the way gender itself was c onstituted to privilege men over women. While men are increasing in numbers wi thin the nursing profession and hold a desire to be caring, it remains that that the main caring role in society is still carried out by women (MacDougall 1997). The Foucauldian notion of discourse is empl oyed by nurses to inform nursing and practice. Traynor (1996) cites Foucault in rela tion to discourse analysis that explores the practice of language as it is used to c onstruct a reality that often serves to support particular institutions or polit ical ideologies. Traynor uses Foucault's analysis of madness to punctuate his critique and identifies several discourses of caring. Fo r example: caring as duty based on Nightingale's writings,; the disc ourse of caring as a therapeutic relationship that emerged in the 70s and 80s, then caring as an ethical position. In his work, Traynor makes use of history to identify the different discourses of caring. He argues that groups in nursing have responded to the biomedical discourse by seeking to re-establish their 150activities within different discourses which he cites as caring, ho lism and qualitative research. Discourse, as discursive practice, forms part of the discussion about language and discourse as presented by Casey and Hendrick s (1995), who generate an understanding of discourse within the confines of nursing diagnosis. In citing Foucau lt (1972), they offer that the first step in discourse is to discov er how the laws operate behind the statements and their place of origin. Therefore they ask, who is qualified to sp eak, who sanctions the spoken word and from where is it spoken? Reference is made to other authors when defining discourse and discursive practice, but essentially they ke ep to the realm of the Foucauldian notion of discourse. Foucault's ideas about discourse are cited in re gard to professionalisation. The discourses of radicalism and mainstream discourse are defined by Fair clough (1992 in Kermode and Brown 1995) and reference is ma de to \"... how discourse is shaped by relations of power and ideologies, and the constructive effects discourse has upon social identities, social institutions and systems of knowledge or belief\" (Kermode and Brown 1995:9). The authors encourage nurses to critique the popu lar discourse and to recognise that all ideas have a political component. Con sidering the health profession as being in transformation, Holmes and Gastaldo (2002) analyse nursing as a means of govern mentality and as an entry point for resisting theory and practice, subscribing to th e idea that nursing is a professionally powerful group. Anne Opie (1998) uses Foucauldian concep ts of discourse when she discusses the practices of multidisciplinary teams to em power users. Key disc ussion points in the 151conceptualisation phases of her paper are terms like 'power' (bot h constraining and productive) as related to the pr oduction of discourse through the generation of truth, and the way that discourse produces and reproduc es particular forms of representations of reality. She recognises that there is always more than one discour se circulating through society and that alternative discourses present different repr esentations of social and alternative constructi ons of the body with both in tended and unintended effects. Therefore discourses operat e as modes of resistance. Perioperative nursing as a context of nurs ing practice has been explained from the perspective of Foucault's notion of power\u2014in particular the productive nature of power (Riley and Manias 2002:317). Events such as the development of techniques, knowledge and technological progress have combined to affect the role and the responsibilities of the nurse and to segregate the practice of perioperative nurses. Spe cialised knowledge of these nurses specific to the context of pra ctice has \"... emerged through the productive nature of power\" (Riley and Manias 2002:317) . These nurses are subject to power through management practices as well as yielding a marketing power in manageme nt decision- making and through knowledge, therefore show ing that power operates at the micro level in this contex t of practice. The aim of this first section has been to introduce caring from the pe rspectives of a history of ideas and from c ontemporary nursing practices. A backdrop to caring in nursing is provided to situate and inform the reader. The methodology chapter discusses the work of Michel Foucault, his ideas of arch aeology and how Foucault is referred to in the nursing literature in regard to caring. The three tools for understanding things in 152Foucauldian archaeology as the methodology for this study of caring are elaborated in depth. I now turn to section II and pres ent the Archive of Caring for Nursing. 153SECTION II- AN ARCHIVE OF CARING FOR NURSING 154The result of the archaeological analysis usi ng the methodology described in chapter 2 is the formulation of 'The Archive of Caring for Nursing' and the identification of the three discourses differentiate d for this Archive. An Archive is an organising system that has established statements as events (and things; (see Foucault 1972). Likewise the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing ' as excavated through my archaeological analysis of caring of th e nursing literature has established statements about caring as events and things. For the peri od under study, from the 1970s forward, it determines what is possible, what can and ca nnot be spoken. The syst em of rules for the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing' can never be complete and is alwa ys open to change. Therefore this Archive can never be fully described, but as time sep arates us from it we begin to see with much more clarity. In writing this thesis, I make the Archive of Caring emerge when it othe rwise would not be visible. In positioning myself with this Archive, my past as a nurse, primarily drawn from perioperative nursing and my academic learning and experiences, influences my approaches to nursing practice, knowledge and in viewing the nurse as a subject. Three different discourses: 'caring as being', 'caring as doing' and 'caring as knowing', construct the Archive of Caring for Nursing (Foucault 1972:130). The discourses compete, overlap, intersect and shape nursing as a discipline, practice and community of nurses. In the following three chapters, I describe , discuss and analyse each of the three discourses for this 'Archive of Caring for Nu rsing'. I open each chapter with an anecdote from my nursing practice a bout caring, and then descri be the discourse from the 155perspective of elements that I have identifi ed during my archaeological analysis. The notion of elements is a term borrowed from Foucault, in that elements may comprise objects, concepts, theoretical choices, practices, enuncia tions or notions (Foucault 1972:182). Formulating these elements are stat ements of the discours e that are governed by operating rules of formulation, which may include institutions, political events, economic practices and other proc esses (Foucault 1972:162). It is the organising structure of elements that I use to organise my descri ption and analysis of the three discourses of caring as identified in this thesis. Finally I draw a discussion of relevant issues derived from the discursive formations in operation for each discourse. Not all issues can be taken up for ea ch of the discourses, due to the complexity and number of issues and restrictions impo sed on this thesis. Furthermore, the discursive formations themse lves cannot be fully discussed and applied, given the nature of institutions , practices, and so forth, which intersect with caring and nursing world-wide. The first of the three di scourses from the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing' for discussion is 'caring as being'. It needs to be remember ed that The Archive of Caring is not the only view of caring and that caring ha s been constructed by others (Swanson 1991; Watson 1999b). This thesis th erefore mounts a challe nge to others; that viewing caring as an 'Archive' is better th an seeing caring as technology, theory or essentially as practices. Caring in nursing is an area where Foucauldian concepts have been us ed to inform and situate discussion. Essentiall y Foucauldian ideas are referred to conceptually throughout the literature of caring fo r nursing; however, few methodological applications of 156archaeology are evident. Genealogical discussi ons related to caring are more prevalent in the nursing literature than archae ological examples. 157 Chapter 3: Caring as Being THE FIRST DISCOURSE IN THE ARCH IVE OF CARING FOR NURSING: CARING AS BEING Today is their first day. They sit attentive in the lecture theatre as I stand at the lectern. A hushed silence falls over the room. I be gin. \"Welcome to nu rsing ....\" and I gaze around the theatre at a sea of excited faces. These students have enrolled in the Bachelor of Nursing. This is their first lecture in a subject that reflects the bei ng (donning the uniform and adopting the pers ona of the nurse), doing (givin g their first injection) and knowing (understanding and integrating the co des associated with nursing) of nursing. From my past teaching experien ces, I know that they will consider this subject as the nuts and bolts of their course \u2014they will consider it to be the most important component of their study. From en gaging in this subject they see, feel and be come the nurse. Another part of their excitement exists because this subject houses their clinical practicum and allocation to health facilities . This is when they excitedly don their nursing uniform and enter the professional arena as a nurse. When I pose the questions, \"why have you enrolled in nursing and what is nursing?\" I'm not surprised at their re sponses. While some document the television drama of nursing and provide a public te levision image of nurses, the ma jority of answers reflect a human element of caring and their responses tell the stories. They provide statements such as, \"I have a wish to help people\" an d \"nursing provid es me with the opportunity to help others;\" I have always been interested in caring for people\" and \"I have always wanted to be a nurse\". Some students report past hospital experiences when someone has cared for them and now they have a wish to reciprocate. Others have family members who are nurses. In the past twen ty years that I have been te aching students of nursing, 158 these responses have not changed. The stud ents espouse the view that nursing is important for our society and sh ow a firm belief that we ne ed to care for others. These students have an image of nursing; an image that draws on the historical story of 'The Lady with the Lamp'\u2014Florence Nightingale. The students and I share a view of what caring in nursing is. At th is stage their answers reflect that caring in nursing is a form of being. That is, that caring comes about because we are a human and that it is a necessity for nu rses to be caring. These ideas can be seen to be reflected in the above anecdote for th ese students of nursing. The students may have been influenced by past role models such as family or fri ends, have encountered past health related experiences, or encountered th e image of the nurse on television, but the answers to their choice of profession clearl y emphasise that caring is a part of our humanity. Being a nurse involves caring. This is a discursively form ed concept of nursing internalised by subjects, whic h however has been critiqued by those who define nursing in terms of technologies and practice regimes. Introduction This discourse, 'caring as being' is the first of three discourses iden tified for the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'. My aim is to draw from the archaeological analysis to present this discourse through the organising structure of elements. Within this discourse, caring statements reflect four elements, which I have identified and labelled u nder the following headings: caring as essential and intrinsic, caring and human development, presence and caring relationship. During the description, I draw on examples from the literature to support each of the above elements. Following the description of the discourse, I then discuss the implications that ma y be drawn for nursing when nu rses view themselves from within this discourse of 'caring as being'. The main organising ideas for this discussion are: 159 nursing resourcing, models of care, technolog y, gender and power. Let me now describe the discourse 'caring as being' Description of the Discourse: Four Elements Element 1). Caring as Essential and Intrinsic There are some nurses who take on board the notion of a discourse of 'caring as being' and who view caring as essential to humanity. This is clearly reflected in statements where caring is presented as a part of the make up of the human being; it is an essential part or element intrinsic to the human (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:4; Lewis 2003:37) and because we are human we are caring (Chinn 1991:8). Other statements support the idea that caring is a part of our creation, generated th rough our development (Wolf 1986:86; Chao 1992:181). The idea is also presented when th eorists such as Benner and Wrubel make the claim that caring is a basic way of bein g (Benner and Wrubel 1989:278) \"Caring ... means that persons, events, projects, and things matter to people. Caring is es sential if the person is to live in a differentiated world where some things really matter ... \" (p.1 and partly recited in Nay, 1998:402). Moreover, they co nsider caring to be a motivating factor, essential to meaning and purpose: Caring sets up the condition that so mething or someone outside the person matters and creates personal concerns. Wi thout care, the person would be without projects and concerns. Care sets up a world and creates meaningful distinctions, and it is these concerns that provide motivation and direction from peo ple (Benner and Wrubel 1989:1). These statements are echoed by my students. Th ere is an essence of care embodied in the figure of the caring nurse that is evident ov er time, and my students have often drawn on the image of Florence Nightingale as an iconic representation of the caring nurse. They 160 h a v e a d e s i r e t o b e a n u r s e, take direction from the profession of nursing and hold strongly to the viewpoint th at it is their patients wh o are their primary concern. Importantly, caring is se en as an intrinsic part of being human and essentia l for the nurse. Its value is fundamental to human experience (Clifford 1995:37 ) and one that entails the capacity to care (Forrest 1989:816). The human being is charac terised by care and caring is our human mode of being. When we cease to care, we cease to be human (Chinn 1991:16). These ideas discursively construct subject positions th at are internal ised. A sense of caring becomes part of our very makeup, it is essential for us to be a human; and for us to be human we must therefore care. Referring to a humanist position, Boykin et al. also support the notion that caring is a part of the pers on, that is, that persons are caring by virtue of their humanness and that people re spect and acknowledge ea ch other as caring persons (1994:159). Presumably we would neve r cease to care. The suggestion that caring is an essential element to our humanity as sumes that we care because we are human beings. The following excerpt illustrates this idea. Caring is the expression of our hu manity, and it is essential to our development and fulfilment as human be ings. While our capacity to care is somewhat fragile and must be nourished and called forth, and while it may be repressed or suppressed, this capaci ty yet is nearly in destructible (Chinn 1991:8). Inherent in this above quote is the need to be caring in order to be fulfilled and to develop. Caring is not a capacity that we are without and it is someth ing that we can express. However, when is it when we are not at our fullest caring potential? Is this when we may be uncaring (Halldor or Larson 1991:64; Watson 1999a:34; Allan 2001:51)? That is, when our caring 161 capacity is repressed or suppressed. Is this wh en we see the uncaring that is projected in the media by nurses\u2014the other side of caring nurses. My students reiterate caring in their tutorial sessions when they voice the opinion that caring comes from within. Their view is that as a human, it is part of them and ex pected of them. They see this expectation as an expression that nurses care for peopl e and discount the vi ew of uncaring or noncaring by nurses, taking on board the domi nant discourse about caring and therefore projecting a normalising effect for nursing. I return to this notion of noncaring in the following discussion, because it impacts on the nurses who view themselves from within this discourse. The idea that caring is essential for humanity is also interwoven th rough the theoretical writings of Jean Watson\u2014ideas that were init ially published in 1979. Watson claims that her list of carative factors9 provide a structure and philosoph ical guide for her theory and imply how a nurse in teracts with patien ts (Barnhart, Bennett et al. 1994:151). Her theory of caring incorporates the notion of 'caring as being'; one that brings forward an identity, an image, and one that portrays a caring nurs e. The idea that cari ng is intrinsic and 9 The Carative Factors as presented by Watson are: 1. A humanistic-altruistic system of values. 2. The instilling of faith-hope. 3. Sensitivity to self and others. 4. Helping-trusting human care relationships. 5. Expressing positive and negative feelings. 6. Creative problem-solving caring process. 7. Transpersonal teaching-learning. 8. Supportive, protective, and/or corrective mental, physical, soc ietal, and spiritual environment. 9. Human needs assistance. 10. Existential-phenomenological-spiritual forces. (1994:6) 162 essential for the nurse contributes to this discourse and has had meaning since the 1970s but is still relevant today and heard in the voices of students. The question of caring as a moral or ethical va lue is a central theme and can be seen to be of influence in different ways (Benner 1984; Fry 1988; Morse, Solberg et 1997; Falk Raphael 1998; Gloyes 2002). Statements, concepts, ideas and themes that relate moral values and ethics of caring continue to be influential in shaping the discourse under discussion. Caring is viewed as good or right and of universal value, or it is presented as a central ethic unique to nursing (Moccia 1988; Harris on 1990; Brandt 1994; Davies and Lynch 1995). These ideas can be seen to contribute to this discour se through the role modelling of caring for example. The ideas are reflected in the theoretical developments of caring and as an illustration, caring as a fundamental value can be seen in Watson's work in regard to caring theory (Watson 1985; Watson 2003). Although the above ideas are relevant and influe ntial in this discourse we can see that they contribute and belong to what now makes up a separate discourse iden tified as nursing ethics or sometimes caring ethics (Holmes 1992; Thomps on, Melia et al. 2000). To elaborate, statements, ideas, themes, concepts, and so forth, contributing to the discourse, can be seen to reflect the work of Gilligan and the claim of caring ethics for the predominantly female occupation of nursing. Th is field of caring ethics and its relevance to nursing has been ... dominated by feminist critique of patr iarchal institutions and the masculinist ethics that supposedly supports them. So me of this arose out of the debate sparked by Kohlberg and Gilligan. Kohl berg (1973, 1976) claimed to have 163 established in his research\u2014on the stages of moral development in children\u2014that the highest stage of moral development is a form of altruistic ju stice orientation or rational ethics based on universal princi ples. He also made the further highly controversial claim that women rarely reach this highes t stage of moral development. Gilligan (1 977), on the basis of her re search, published empirical evidence to show that women express their 'understanding of ethics in a different voice'. This feminine ethic is not one that is inferior to Kohlberg's male idealisation of an organizing and controlling ethic, but is rather an ethic concerned with conflict resolution, th e acceptance of responsib ility and caring\u2014something, she argues, Kohlberg failed to do justic e to in his categorization of development stages (Thompson, Me lia et al. 2000:96). In other words, caring ethi cs has its basis in a different, feminist ethic and moral responsibility than it does for males. There is a schism between what is termed a caring perspective (\"... distinguished by a conc ern for care, responsiveness and taking responsibility in interpersona l relationships, and by a context sensitive mode of deliberation that resists abstract formul ations of moral problems\") and a justice perspective (\"... emphasis is placed on ri ghts, duties and obligations, while moral reasoning is marked by schema tic understandings of moral problems that allow previously ordered rules and principles to be applied to moral cases\") (Bowden 1997:6). Hence, in nursing, writers situated within this discou rse emphasise the need to take into account women's ethical experiences. Discussion about the polari sation of female and male orientations of ethics continues in the literat ure and caring ethics is inherently bound up within this discussion. For example, To set up caring and justice as antithetical to one another is danger ously misleading, for there can be no real care where the basic requirements of justice 164 are not met, and no real justice where there is no care for the [patient] ... (Thompson, Melia et al. 2000:97) Statements such as the above highlight the intensity of the discus sion about merging these two polarised debates in ethics and as a consequence provide suppo rt for the establishment of a discourse of caring ethics. I do not plan to discu ss any further the ideas associated with caring ethics as a discourse, because of th e work by Colin Holmes (1992) in Critical Theory and the Discourse of Nursing Ethics who undertook a literature review of nursing ethics and then applie d the analytical framework as outlined by Foucault (1972) to extract the central themes and subnarrativ es of the discourse (Holmes 1992:4). I encourage readers to access this work by Colin Holmes, as he pays particular attention to feminism, virtue ethics and caring and clai ms that caring could be viewed as being expressed through the adoption of praxis for nursing (1992:248). Therefore what we see occurring here is a sharin g of statements and ideas between discourses and a transformation (see Foucault, 1972:172) from one discourse to an other, but with each discourse continuing. Supporting this discourse ('caring as being') is the idea that intrinsi c caring is linked to human development, which is the next elem ent that I address for this discourse. Element 2). Caring and Human Development The idea that caring is intrinsi c is again evident when caring is identified as an essential ingredient in human developmen t (Wilkes and Wallis 1993:19); an idea that arises from the work of Milton Mayeroff (1971). In his wo rk, caring is describe d as helping the other grow\u2014that is, care is an extension of the self (1971:3)\u2014yet at the same time it is separate and can be respected in its own right. To help another grow involves encouraging and 165 assisting others to find and create areas of th eir own in which they are able to care. This growth includes learning an d integrating new ex periences and ideas (1971:7). The notion of caring as helping another grow and ac tualise themselves is thus viewed as a developmental process that has a general patt ern (1971:1). Mayeroff's writings on caring were not specifically aimed at he alth care or nursing. However, nurses such as Wolf (1986) and Morrison and Burnard (1997) cite his work incorporating caring a s a developmental process, in that caring assumes co ntinuity that helps people grow. The link between caring and human development can be traced to wo rk outside the field of nursing, in particular, to psychology. Today, these references are often cited as secondary sources within the nursing literature. As well as Mayeroff (1971), key authorities cited include Erikson (1980; 1982) and Fro mm (1957). This link between caring and human development, ha s been transferred throughout th e literature, arising from the much-referred-to work of Zane Robinson Wo lf (1986), who discussed the concept of caring, and nurse identified behaviours, in Topics of Clinical Nursing , a collection of papers dedicated to caring. She drew on several theorists outside the domain of nursing to ground the creation of her Caring Behaviours Inventory. In particular, Wolf referred to the work of Erik Erikson, the psychologist, and his conception of caring as a component of human development. As an example, Wolf di scussed the concep t of caring specific to \"human interactions throug h the life cycl e\" (Erikson, 1963 and Brody, 1978 in Wolf 1986:86). In her discussions, Erikson's stages of moral development are equated with caring acts that humans provide to others throughout their life cycle . These caring acts highlight the developmental stage a person is at. In essence, th ese stages are a part of all human development and the actions of care illustrate how things are with humans. 166 Within the context of human development we see caring described from the viewpoint of social interactions (Wolf 1986:86,90). The way th at society interacts to care for others is also translated to how nurses provide care in nursing. These ideas li nked with social development consider such aspects as love, mothering and a child's trus t, together with attachment and nurturing. In particular, Wolf (1986:85) makes reference to Fromm's (1963) The Art of Loving: ... mature love is union under the condition of preserv ing one's integrity, one's individuality . Love is an active power in man; a power which breaks through the walls which separate man from his fellow men, which unites him with others; love makes him overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet permits him to be himself, to reta in his integrity. In love the paradox occurs that two beings be come one and yet remain two (original emphasis). Fromm's theory of love refers to the objects of love (such as motherly love, self-love) and the practice of love. Implicit in his ideas is that it is a part of our humaneness but that we need to practise the art of lovi ng in order to love. This concept of love is evident in the assumptions related to human care values in nursing as presented by Jean Watson (1988:32) from her theory of ca ring. Her viewpoint is that 1. Care and love are the most univ ersal, the most tremendous, and the most mysterious of cosmic forces: they comprise the primal and p sychic energy. 167 2. Often these needs are overlooked; or we know people need each other in loving and caring ways, but ofte n we do not behave well toward each other. If our humanness is to survive , however, we need to become more caring and loving to nourish our humanity and evolve as a civilization and live together (1988:32). From Watson, we see that humanness is understood as something tha t is fragile and that the linkage between caring and loving cements a unique thought fo r our humanity. The difference between love and caring is \"...that with love, one must be altruistic and self- sacrificing by giving up one's own needs in the service of and benefit to another. In caring both persons must be served\" (Bevis 1981:56). References made to caring and loving as part of our human makeup and de velopment express the view that caring is a part of all of us, but they also open the portal for the discussion that some of us may not have fully developed and therefore our capacity to care may be different or perhaps suppressed or repressed, as identified earlier. Could we da re to suggest that perh aps this is why some persons will become nurses or why nursin g remains a female dominated profession (Rushing 1996:158; Anker 2001:151). A larg e body of literature demonstrates that nurturing is associated with gender roles in society (Brown , Lumley et al. 1994; Lupton and Barclay 1997; 997; Morin, Patterson et al. 1999; Miers 2000; 2002). Why is it that for some people and in some groups people care mo re than others or submit to an occupation of caring? (B adgett and Folbre 2001:327). The link between caring and loving is not evident for all nu rses in this discourse, nor is the idea that nurses may be more humane and therefore take up nursing, as in Fromm's notion that love is part of our humaneness. Caring though for Watson is about our humanness, which she views as fragile, needing nourishment and is seen as an implied component of Watson's Theory of 168 Caring (Watson 1979; 1985; Watson 1988). Wit hout nourishment (such as education, role models in nursing, codes of conduct, standard s of practice) the risk is that uncaring is always a possibility. In contrast there is no tr anscendental position in regard to caring and no judge in all persons to offer what caring is for all persons. Cultural groups will define caring differently and as we see in this thes is, discourses of cari ng are not one and the same. The discourse on human devel opment raises issues from wi thin a masculin e perspective of caring. MacDougall (199 7:811) contends that alt hough men are changing and redefining themselves, it is still the minority of men in Western culture who have embraced caring behaviours as typically presen ted by women. We do see men in nursing; however, they are not usually in what is term ed the bedside role of nursing practice but are more dominantly represented in such ar eas as education, technology supported areas, administration and manageme nt (Rushing 1996:158; Miers 2000:11). Gender theories provide a way of understandin g some of the issues relate d here (Anker 2001:151) and I shall return to this is sue of gender in the di scussion section of this chapter (social issues), particularly because from a discursive pers pective nursing remain s a female dominated profession (Rushing 1996:158; Miers 2000:11). Still within this dimens ion of human develo pment, the idea that cari ng in nursing is seen as an 'innate human trait' (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:4) is an idea th at has come about through the categorisation of several nurse au thors' writings on caring. In this meta- analysis, psychological influences are again us ed to refer to human development, and trait 169 theory (Baron and Kalsher 2002:410) is drawn upon to suggest that nurses demonstrate caring as a result of innate hu man development. The trait theoretical approach attempts to isolate and describe the basic properties of the human that direct behaviour (Baron and Kalsher 2002:410). This idea that caring is a trait would lend support for the argument that caring differs between people. However, a link betwee n the development of caring and the trait approach is not readily evident in the nursing litera ture. There are two meanings associated with human development that are subsumed within this discourse and that tend to be blurred toge ther in the literature. One is the notion that there is an essence of our humanness, the othe r is that there is the need for humanness. Firstly for example, because we are human, caring is essent ial for all humanity and is necessary for human survival and secondly, cari ng is intrinsic for humanity and therefore all humans care. Caring is vi ewed as a necessity for life or is necessary to sustain the human race\u2014our humanity. Based on the huma nistic approach (Fjelland and Gjengedal 1994), caring is promoted as something that is always there and as a dev eloping element in people. Nelms' nursing stories portray this very clearly: \"The amazing thing about ca ring is that you never run out. It just gives you more reason to care\" (Tammy's story in Nelms 1996, p. 369) and \"Caring is something you give and receive or that Caring makes your understanding richer and deeper\" (Lib by's story in Nelms 1996, p. 370). Other thoughts see caring and being as one, for example \"... nurses embraced themselves as cari ng beings...\" (Nelms 1996:373). 170 These stories portray caring as intrinsic, something that cont inues to develop as it is practised\u2014much like practising the art of loving as presente d by Fromm (1957), and drawing in Watson's ideas about caring needing nourishment. So far for this discourse 'caring as being' we see elements where carin g is viewed as essential and intrinsic, an d human development is pivo tal for caring. The next contributing theme depicts caring as presence and shares space with ontological, humanistic and societal ideas. Element 3). Cari ng as Presence There are some writers who view caring as so mething that is both willed and true, and as presence. This notion is delineated in the work by Boykin, Parker et al., when they claim that caring is \"... the intentional and authenti c presence of the nurse with another who is recognised as a person living caring and gr owing caring\" (Boykin and Schoenhoefer, 1993 in Boykin, Parker et al. 1994:160). Their view of caring is further pu rsued by Barry (1994), who perceived nursing practice as the fundamen tal value of caring, and again by Benner and Wrubel (1989), who make the assertion that caring matters to people. Influences from Heideggerian thought are evident when auth ors use expressions su ch as 'to presence oneself' with another, to mean that one is available to un derstand and to be with another (Heidegger 1962). Nelms, in referring to presencing concludes that it is ... situating of the nurse's se lf sensitively and imaginativ ely in the world of those being cared for. Presencing is the gift of one's self in hu man interaction and requires receiving another's presence as well as one's presence . By caring for and valuing the other, the nurse's being is enhanced (1996:368). 171 This theme of presencing views caring as the ability to presence onese lf. The nurse is with the patient in a way that acknowledges a shared huma nity (1989:113), an idea reflected in the seminal work by Wolf (1986) when she claims that caring creates self and the world (a reflection of Mayeroff 1971). She contends that \"The process of caring is characterized by being with the person; that is, the caring person is basically in the other's world\" (1986:87). My students also express this view of presence and being within their tutorial sessions. Their idea is that caring is about being there with the pa tient; that they have a presence and they firmly hold the belief that machines, while they complement caring, can not take away the presence of the nurse in being with the patient . In these students' discussions, they draw on concepts of holistic care for their patients and attest that their ability to provid e this care is reflected by thei r presence. Yet in our society, as technological advanc es in nursing continue, these ad vances can be seen to compete with the personalised care (as in presence ) that nurses have previously provided. My students were horrified when I read to them the following extract: There are now programmes of research dedicated to developing robots able to care for patients\u2014care, as defined from the perspective of the scientific community, not necessarily care as perceived by patients and nurses (Gillian 1995:58). The concept of the robot providing care for pa tients sent a shudder through my students. However, technological initiative s continue to be taken up by nurses, especially those who practise in units, where such technological components are readily utilised (for example, nursing environments such as Intensive Care Units and Operating Theatres). The students fail to see that technological changes can be as innocent as a pair of gloves, as they focus 172 on the more complex and visible technological initiatives such as the ventilator that is used to assist a person to breathe (Lumby 2001). Nurses who position themselves within this discourse certainly have the viewpoint that the nurse must be with the patient to care an d this is a widely shared popular opinion. Some examples within the literature relate society's expectations of the nurse (Reverby 1987b; van Maanen 1990; Pollack-Latham 1991) while others refer to society's expectations of the profession, and these all vouch for the presence of the nurse (Nyberg 1990b; Clifford 1995). Historical and intuit ive reactions to caring are based on societal expectations that encompass cultures (Chao 1992 ; Janhonen 1993), the idea of family and community based caring an d personal relationships be tween carers (Swanson 1993; Woodward 1997). The discourse illustrated by thes e statements is that caring is a natural occurrence in the world. These ideas support the belief that caring in our society is a fait accompli, and this has a major impact on institutional practices, such as those associated with the profession of nurses, remuneration, re cruitment and retention issues for nurses. Australian society has an expectation of the caring nurse and se veral protocols from different institutions elaborate this expect ation, including the Nurses Act 1991 (NSW) (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 1993; 19 95; 2001; Nurses Regi stration Board NSW 2001). However, in the current climate of human resource problems for nursing (Fagin 2001) this expectation is increasingly difficult to meet. I will return to this point about human resourcing problems later in the discus sion section; for now I leave you with the view that presence and human resourcing are in direct conflict for caring in nursing. Contrasting with the nurses' common-sensical perspective about caring, there is limited critical discussion that active ly analyses the societal defini tion of caring. As a concept, 173 caring is a 'generally known term' and hence, when society discusse s caring, it is not a term that is usually 'unpacked' but is one that has become normalised wit hin the discourses of caring. Caring definitions and id eas usually start from the nurse or from the health care system perspective rather than from the patient/con sumer/societal perspective within a cultural context. Implicit in all discussions however , is the notion that society does recognise and value caring as important for society (Reverby 1987b; 1987a). Commonly cited evidence is linked to historic al references about family and religious caring (Donahue 1985), which see caring situ ated as a part of societal development. Historical paintings, postage stamps, lead light windows, photographs, poems, stories, reflections and crafts as textual examples from across many countr ies, also reproduce this discourse on caring (Donahue 1985; Wendler 2002 ). Caring is seen as a way of serving others, protecting humanity an d human dignity; thus it has become attached to social ideals (Watson 1979; 1985; Fry 1989) and has since beco me a socially mandated requirement for nurses and the nursing profession in Australia (Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001) through the Nurses Act 1991 (NSW). Caring as presence is the third of the four themes that describe this discourse. To summarise, it is a them e that has tentacles th at reach into several aspects of nursing practice. The new practitioner views presence as important, as do established institutions of humanity, with rules and re gulations for nursing reflecting this. The final theme is well documented within the nursing literature and takes the notion of presence to a degree of specificity where caring occurs as a relationship. 174 Element 4). Caring as a Relationship As identified earlier, this discourse\u2014'caring as being'\u2014describes ' caring as essential and intrinsic', 'caring and human development', and 'caring as prese nce'. The fourth element that emerges as another subset in this discou rse is that of 'carin g as a relationship' (Watson 1979; Wolf 1986; Kitson 1987; Swan son 1991), fundamentally because one of the crucial elements identified for caring in nursing is that it occurs within a caring relationship. Several different types of caring relationships can be seen in the nursing literature. For example, these include the nurse-patient re lationship (Fry 1989; Hogg 1994) or nurse- client relationship (Swanson 1991) and the caring student-te acher relationship (Paterson and Crawford 1994). In particular, the cari ng relationship involv es an interpersonal relationship (Knowlden 1991:202) or is some times voiced as a caring nurse-patient interpersonal relationship (Morse, Solberg et al . 1990:6). It is also described as one where caring is an inclination towa rd another (Greenleaf 1991:73) or it involves engagement (Morse, Bottorff et al. 1992:819) or getting to know one another (Janhonen 1993:162). Furthermore, the caring relationship involves depth and intimacy (K uhse 1993:34), it is a service (Kitson 1987:160), as well as a dy namic human to human transaction (Watson 1988:27). Characteristics of the caring relationship incl ude the emotional aspect of the relationship (MacDonald 1993:26), a commi tment within the relationsh ip (Morse, Bottorff et al. 1992:819), reciprocity and mutuality (Fry 175 1988:48), connecting (Clayton, Mu rray et al. 1991:161), a pe rformance of duties (Chao 1992:182) and a possession of a level of knowledge and skill (Kitson 1987:160). As we can see, the caring relationship is one that is dynamic and consequential. The emphasis on caring as a relationship has come about because o f changes within the nursing profession, including the defining of th e role of the nurse (Gaut 1981:17). The nurse's role has dwindled since the 1970s, due in part to the development of allied health professional roles such as physiotherapy, oc cupational therapy, nutritionists and support workers in health care. These changes among ot hers have seen nurses voice caring from the perspective of the caring relationship. In my personal circles, di scussions I have held with allied health professional s have identified that they hold a claim to the caring relationship with clients. Yet when I present this notion to my nurse colleagues there is a denial that allied health professionals care fo r patients; one particular comment that I have heard on several occasions at cu rriculum meetings comes to mind. The difference between caring as viewed by nurses and cari ng as claimed by other health professionals is that nurses ca re 24 hours a day whereas th e other health professionals arrive and leave throughout th e shifts and are usually only available during the daylight. These colleagues voice that ca ring belongs to them. The nurs e as carer creates a caring relationship over time with the patient. Their vi ew as identified above is that other health professionals objectify the patient from a technical perspective\u2014 a view where this objectification is one of uncaring and not cari ng for patients from the nurses' perspective. This point of course needs more discussion. It is particularly re levant to the third discourse for this thesis, 'caring as knowing', and I shall elaborate these ideas more fully in 176 a later chapter (chapter 5). For now it is important to note that the element 'caring as relationship' is influenced by what is said by allied health professionals. A more recent expression about the caring relati onship that brings caring into the area of consumerism is the perspective of caring as a partnership (Webb and Hope 1995:101). In this discussion arena, caring is considered a partnership with patients, where the patients are viewed as being active part icipants of care. Sharing th is space of consumerism is negotiated care (Keatinge 1998), which connec ts care with power, interests, goals and elements that are recognised as part of a negotiation process. In other words, caring becomes a negotiated process between the nurse and the pati ent, in which the patient's goals, interests and the balance of power be come part of the partnership process. In Foucauldian terms this reflec ts notions of power and kn owledge (Foucault 1980) where the patient is the subject as in partner, ra ther than an object. Keatinge differentiates negotiation and negotiated care and states that ... the specialist nature of ne gotiation in nursing care, an d its fundamental role in the care process, suggests that negotiati on in nursing is of increased complexity and is more appropriately termed nego tiated care (Keatinge 1998:36). Illustrations of negotiated care emphasise that integr al to this form of negotiation is a focus of understanding meanin gs, and negotiating and coordi nating differing and shared interests towards achieving shared goals of pa tient care. Nurses play the key coordinating and negotiating role in achiev ing negotiated care (Keatinge 1998:39). They are not only with the patient but negotiate nursing care with the patients a nd relatives, and negotiate and coordinate the care delivered by all the members of the health care team. At the same time, as nurses are negotiating the process th rough which to deliver care, they are also 177 giving thought to coordinating and negotiating the interests and goals of the care delivered by a vast number of othe r health care practition ers (Keatinge 1998:41). This idea of negotiated care is not widely take n up as a discussion point in the literature by nurses, and is a concept arising in the late 19 90s. It will have signif icant impact on practice as this idea puts the nurse/patient relation ship at the centre of often conflicting or opposing goals (for example, time required by patients as opposed to the time available to nurses, resource costs, staff mix ratios and allied health professional roles). In my discussion section of this chapter I look at issues associat ed with resourcing and models of care. In still other examples of stat ements that contribute to th is element of the discourse, theories\u2014for example humanistic, psychologica l and critical theories\u2014are drawn upon to present the idea that ca ring is a mutually empowering rela tionship (Caffrey 1994:13). This type of relationship creates meaning, rein forces commitment and assists patients to mobilise their own resources, with the nurse ta king on the role of advocate. That is, \"Both persons in a caring relationship experience so mething akin to self-a ctualization\" (Caffrey 1994:13). Caffrey has the view that ...caring as an empowering re lationship, stems from a solid base of self worth, is nonjudgmental, spontaneous, and experien ced as a spiritual bond between those involved in the caring relationship. Caring is an energizing phenom enon (1994:15). The relationship draws out the functions of th e nurse as an advocate, and sees nursing's primary goal as the empowerment of all through cari ng (Caffrey 1994:16). Patient involvement within the caring relationship is adopted in Australia as a competency 178 standard for the nursing profession. The standa rd identifies that the nurse protects the rights of individuals and groups in relation to their health care\u2014a publish ed standard for professional and ethical prac tice for Australian Nurses determining nursing practice (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 2001:9). Relationships between nurses and patients involve great depth and intimacy (Kuhse 1993:34) and for some theorists, care is seen as an emotion (Wolf 1986; Kuhse 1993; Swanson 1993; Gavin 1997). This aspect of care appears to have arisen from discussions about care as a virtue (Allmark 1998:466) in that emotions are alig ned with values and with the ordering of human emotions (Dunlop 1986:662). The value of a nurse being able to 'care about' a patient reflects an emotion as opposed to 'caring for' a patient, which is technical (Gavin 1997:694) . As Swanson puts it: Being with, being emot ionally present to other, is the caring category that conveys to clients that they and their experiences matter to the nurse. Emotional presence is a way of sharing in the meanings, feelin gs and lived experience of the cared-for. Being with assures clients that their real ity is appreciated an d that the nurse is ready and willing to be ther e for them (Swanson 1993:355). Swanson succinctly draws together the noti on of presence and the element of the relationship between the nurse and the patient. Influences of Heid eggerian thought are evident within these writings, as indicated by such terms as 'lived experience', 'reality of the person' and 'being with'. Other ontologic al ideas are prevalent in these types of discussions (Benner 1994a) for example, in regard to cari ng and connectedness (Barry 1994:77). This idea of being connected, whil e evident in the work of Watson (1994) can also be seen in the writings of Benner and Wrubel (Benner and Wrubel 1989). They state that 179 \"Caring\" as a word for be ing connected and having things matter works well because it fuses thought, feeling, and action (B enner and Wrubel 1989:1). In these discussions 'being conn ected' is a componen t of the caring relationship. Caring brings together the caring nurse and the pa tient in a sense of being and as a way of expression. The image of the nurse, the oblig ation required of the nurse and the visibility of caring contribute to this no tion of the caring relationship. To summarise, this discourse 'of caring as be ing' comprises four elements. Together these elements present a world view for some nurses in how they see them selves as a nurse, how they speak of caring and how they practise . The elements are not individual entities in this discourse but intersect, overlap, and contribute to each o ther. What we see is that this discourse is evident in nursing throughout the literature and h as implications for practice. I now turn to a critic al discussion about nursing, usi ng ideas generated from this discourse in relation to nurses who position themselves within it. Discussion: Implications for Nursing When we examine the discourse 'caring as being', we see that ideas are transferred through time. The ideas draw upon our history, societal expectations and several well- established disciplines. References identify that 'caring as being' is a social expectation of nurses, one that contributes to the firmly entrenched assumptions that nurses are caring and that nurses are there for and with the pati ent. There is an expe ctation of presence, a caring relationship (nurse-patient) and an assu mption that caring is es sential and intrinsic. Statements that present caring as form of being have arisen from an ontological perspective. For example, caring is a basi c way of being (Benner and Wrubel 1989:368). This notion of care is one that points to the soul of the human\u2014that is, to the very 180 notion of being human. Nurses who have intern alised this discourse subscribe to the view that caring is a part of all of us. Of interest he re is that some nursin g curricula will actually teach caring, yet others have nursing care implicit in the teaching of skills, processes or procedures, and hence the discourse of cari ng as being is not fully articulated. The nursing literature has many examples wher e caring is presented from an ontological perspective. That is, caring is viewed as essential (Bishop an d Scudder Jr. 1991:56), and as Edwards (2001:168) explains ontological care from the Heideggerian philosophical framework: ...as humans we inevitably find oursel ves in the midst of things, we are 'thrown' into the world. As a result of this, we have no option tha n to do our best to deal with or cope with, the situations we find ourselves in (Edwards 2001:168). Edwards refers to Heidegger's view of caring as one where the matu re person is able to make choices in the world in which they ar e compelled to deal, and therefore caring reveals what matters to pe ople (Edwards 2001:168). Based on the Heideggerian philosophy, a mature person is one who can care for self and for others (Bishop and Scudder Jr. 1991:56). This notion of care is reflected in th e work of some of the writers in nursing (for example, Wats on, 1979; Benner, 1989; Leininger, 1985), and those who follow and recite their work. Caring has dominated the nursing literature si nce the 1970s and continues today to be a source of the 'sayable' in nursing. Viewing ca ring as universal is problematic from the Foucauldian perspective. Foucault would view caring by examining local particular 181 situations and knowledge. How we make sense of things, what we can say and what we know comes about as a result of certain or ganising (usually unconscious) principles (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:17) that are taken for granted and sup ported by different institutions (e.g., profession of nursing, registering bodies for nursing, councils of nursing). When we acknowledge that ther e are nurses who internalise this discourse 'caring as being', then we begin to unde rstand some of the issues that become relevant and important for these nurses\u2014issue s that create for the nurse a series of internal conflicts, thereby contributing to stress and other symptoms in nursing (Hunt 2003:28; McVicar 2003:633). Such conflicts can be seen in the diminishment of th e ability of th ese nurses to provide care for their patients because of imposing requirements f rom multiple sources. Some of this inability may be manifested intrinsically by the nurse, but in other situations extrinsic factors deny the nurse the capacity to care, as they believe good nursing requires. Meanwhile, this prevalent discou rse continues to teach them th at they 'should' be caring and hence, it implies that failu re to live up to their ideolo gy is a personal failure, and feedback to nurses is incongruent with ho w they are positioned in the discourse. Nursing Resourcing There is no doubt that on the surface this di scourse\u2014'caring as being'\u2014is highly valued by the nurse, the profession and by societ y. However, another picture is presented because of competing discourses and inte rsecting technologies. These include for example, the medicalisation of health care (Wicks 1999), techno logical restrictions (Hogg 1994; Rudge 1997; Lumby 2001), the imposition of bureaucratic structures (Parker 1999), and economic rationalism (Lawler 1999). 182 Much has been said about the nature of cari ng and the many ways caring is hidden or invisible (Roberts 1990:349; Jenny and Logan 1996:352) or only not iced in its absence (Greenleaf 1991:80). This notion of caring as hidden deftly removes value from caring when in today's nursing arenas, evidence ba sed practice is highly valued (Pearson 2002:18). Consequently, when caring is viewed as hidden or in visible, attributing value or worth is difficult. Failure to quantify caring keeps hidden the contrib ution nurses make to society (Greenleaf 1991:73) an d yet, by quantifying caring it is then located within the economic rationalist model of society and the scientific models of proof, with the subsequent potential to move caring away from a humanist perspective. Quantifying humanism is in itself a dilemma and the literature presents little in the way of clarifying this economic worth (Buerhaus 1986:13). Th e discourse on nursing resources from a management viewpoint quantifies resources, and caring is valued as a low or non measurable commodity. Commodities that are valued in our society are resourced in a multitude of ways (for example, financial, physical, huma n, etc.). It is this perspective of resourcing that reflects poorly within nursing today when care and econ omics are interrelated forces in the health care arena (Nyberg 1990b). Despite the domi nance of the humanistic value of caring (Donahue 1985) the resourcing of caring fails to be viewed in a positive light. One such measurement for identifying worth for caring ca n be attributed to the staffing levels in health care facilities. There is a large body of literature suggesting a world wide shortage of nurses (Fagin 2001; Young 2003:2) and in Australia, nursing has be en the subject of several politically based reviews (Department of Education Science and Training 2000b; 2000a; 2002c; 2002b; 2002a; 200 2d). One succinct conclusion was that there is significant 183 unmet demand for nursing (Department of Ed ucation Science and Training 2000b; 2002c; 2002d). If the current conditions in nursing and health care continue, an even more severe shortage of nurses will resul t (Fagin 2001). The Internatio nal Council of Nurses has expressed grave concern regarding the lack of progress in addressing nursing human resource issues across the world (Young 2003:2). In Australia, a major new recruitment strategy has been laun ched to help solve nursing and midwifery shortages by a national advisory board of professional, bureaucrat ic, educational and un ion groups (Advisory Board 2003). Nurses who have internalised this discourse experience conflict as a consequence of nursing staffing levels within health facilities. Feedback to nurses comes from patients who relate the amount of time available for their care as significant for them (Williams 1998:811). Patients perceive nu rses to be noncaring when th ey are in a hurry and efficient (Riemen 1986:32). Compounding the caring efforts of these nurses are resource availability that is also seen to \"... impact on the amount of time ava ilable for nursing care delivery\" (Williams 1998:811). Thus, percepti ons of caring are a ffected because of constraints and restrictions associated with inadequate staffing levels and resource availability and as a result, nursing care is d eemed to be uncaring. Furthermore, patients consider nurses to be noncaring when they experience them \"... acting practically for patients while at the same ti me maintaining an emotional distance from them\" (Allan 2001:51). This creates a source of stress for the nurse who has intern alised the discourse 'caring as being', especially when noncaring is expressed as an opposite to caring. These statements are linked to the behaviours and at titudes of the nurse and become internalised in nursing, traversing cultures (A lexander, Beagle et al. 1994:431). 184 A description of noncaring is offered by Ri emen (1986), based on a study that analysed patients' descriptions of noncaring beha viours and the attitudes of nurses. Three themes emerged as typical of the no n-caring interactions. First, the nurse was perceived as 'being physically presen t but emotionally distant'. Second, the nurse's actions were interpreted as belittling, inhumane, and devalu ing to the patient as a unique individual. This resulted in the third theme: patient fee lings of frustration, fear, depression, anger, and anxi ety. It appears that these are attitudes or behaviors that would be occurring while the physical aspects of care are provided and that the technical care must not only be competent, but delivered in a caring manner (Rieman 1986, cite d in Shiber and Larson 1991:64). To be noncaring, one would ne ed to be insensitive, non pe rceptive of the feelings of another and not distinguishing one person from another (Watson 1999a:34). It is consistent with a lack of relationship and a lack of communication. Noncaring behaviours have a stronger impact on the patient than a caring interaction (Shiber and Larson 1991:135) and indeed, when I have spoken with friends, colleagues or even new acquaintances about this thesis, they invari ably brought up their personal noncaring experiences, which were always at the forefront of the convers ation. Later, this conversation would move to discuss the 'kind' or 'nice 'nurse rather th an the caring nurse. Sometimes, however, I believed that the person I was talking to rais ed this only because they felt that they needed to balance th e conversation, given my status as a nurse interested in caring. Nurses themselves are not comfortable with the view that patients b elieve them to be noncaring (Allan 2001:52), especially when st affing resources impact on the quality and 185 outcomes of care that they are able to provid e (Young 2003:2). In Australia, the Act for professional registration, which aims to prot ect public health and safety, provides for members of the public to make complaints a bout the quality of care or lack of care (Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001:3). Nu rses are regulated, can be brought to account for their practice and can lose their right to practise under the Nurses Act 1991 (NSW). The expectation is that they mainta in appropriate standards of professional conduct and behaviour (Austr alian Nursing Council Inc. 2001:2; Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001:17). The legiti mate concerns of nurses who internalise themselves from within this discourse are not heard, where the context of staffing and resourcing is unhelpful, creating anxieties about their ability to care. The discourse, 'caring as being' is primaril y situated within the humanist discourse on caring. It is viewed as intrinsic to the human and the e ssence of care (Watson 1988; Leininger 1991b; Patistea 1999; Gloyes 2002 ). When nurses are unable to practise according to prescribed standa rds, and when their practice is impeded by issues such as poor resourcing as well as other imposed condit ions, then these issues provide them with the excuses to abate their consciousness as to why patients may d eem them to be noncaring as a nurse. However, the nurse's inability to care, pl us the required need to meet standards of practice contributes to an intrinsic feeling of stress for these nurses. The problems for nurses associated with the inadequate level of re sources will continue as the conflict created by for exam ple, poor staffing, reflects on their ability to care for patients. The view that noncarin g is a result of th e reality associated with the lack of supervision and support provided to nurses (Clifford 1995; Davies and Lynch 1995; Allan 2001) as well as the limited numbers of nurses available to care for patients (Fagin 2001; 186 Young 2003:2) provides nurses with a reason as to why their patients and other persons may view them to be noncaring. However, it does not assist their inter nal feelings of stress. Resourcing nursing brings about problematisations for caring. T he patient and the nurse are positioned differently in the discourse an d the statements about caring have different meanings for both of these Foucauldian subjects. The nurse is po sitioned as a caring nurse on view for others to see, and essentially surveillance is in ope ration (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:188; Castel 1991:288). The patient represents t he cared for person. However, incongruence for these subject positions about carin g becomes evident as they speak of what caring means for them. The patient views the carin g provided by the nurse. The nurse is compared to other nurses' caring behaviours and to inherent societal beliefs of caring. Thus the expected and the non-attended contribute to nurses being criticised as noncaring or uncaring. In this example we see power operating as a \"...matrix of force relations at a given time, in a given society\" (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:186). There is control of the caring nurse through surveillance by others; however, we see other practices and technologies aff ecting the caring nurse as for example, an inadequate staffing le vel for these nurses equates to limited time in order for them to establish the r elationship required between nurse and patient, thus comp rising another facet of noncaring (Purkis 1996) and subsequently contribu ting as a recognised stressor for the nurse (Fagerstr\u00f6m, Eriksson et al. 1998:985) as well as an exercise d form of disciplinary power (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:191). Compounding this situation of the lack of available time for establishing practice requirements, are the changes evident related to models of care in nursing and the length 187 of time that patients are now admitted to the health care service. It is t his issue that I now consider within the context of this discourse 'caring as being'. Models of Care Various models of care (Hart 1998; Ducket 2002) have been introduced into the health care system over the past years and these mode ls reflect an economic rationalist approach to patient care delivery (Lawler 1999). In Au stralia (and overseas), the health care of individuals and their families is changing, and care has taken a different approach to that provided in the 1970s and 1980s. A day surgery unit, where patients undergo operations on a day-only basis and then go home, is an increasing method for dealing with patients' surgical requirements. Between the 1970s and 1980s, my patients would spend several weeks in a health care facility being cared fo r by nurses, following surgery. Today, the patients undergoing procedures for the same condition are cared for by nurses over several hours immediately following their surg ery, then they are discharged home or to another level institution for care dependent on their needs. The leve l and resourcing of caring has changed, with limited patient access to their registered nurse. Patient care teams are becoming more prevalent and members of these teams are now made up of other levels of carers (for example, assistants in nursing and enrolled nurses) rather than the sole registered nurse providing care as utilised in the holistic model of care from the recent past. The length of time of caring provided to patients by the registered nurse has decreased, and this impacts on the quality of care (You ng 2003 574:2). This same experience of less caring provided by indivi dual nurses occurs for maternity patients who leave hospital under the 'early discharge sche mes' following the birt h of babies, and for patients who come to the health care facility on a visiting day-only basis for chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment. One way of defining patient care no w is according to the 188 increased expected time for patient recove ry, and moving them more quickly toward discharge (Ducket 2002:24). Impacting on these ti me delivery models is the introduction of technology-assisted medicine; key hole surgery for example, im pacts on the time related to care delivery (Sandelowski 1999:204). Patien t recovery periods have decr eased, and patients are now more stable and able to be discharged hom e to the care of a family member. Community based nursing in Australia, a service that nu rses provide to patients in the homes, also affords patients a level of care by nurses following their discharge from a health care facility. For those patients who are perceived as being able to ca re for their own needs following discharge, caring by nurses co ncludes physically on discharge. However, in some facilities, my experience has been that a follow-up ph one call is made within 24 hours to verify the postoperati ve condition of the patient and to reiterate the future appointments and required ca re that was identified on discharge. These progressive techniques and models therefore change the na ture of caring by displacing it from the nurse to the patient and/or family, as well as extending it outside the physical boundary of the health care facility, redefining nursing as a profession and the nurse as a subject. For the nurse who internalises this discourse 'caring as being', th ere are several impositions for caring practi ce. The caring relationship between the nurs e and patient changes depending on the le ngth of time the patient is in th e health care facility. Further, from my own experiences in acut e care facilities, there is an increased number of patients whom the nurse now encounters, especially fo r example, in day surgery type units when multiple patients are admitted for surgery at the beginning of a day and then return to the day unit following their surgery. Furthermore, in health care fac ilities (such as hospitals) 189 patients are moved around th e facility during their recove ry period (for example, Emergency Department to Intensive Care, th en into a High Dependency or Step-Down Unit and then into a Ward). This is of course dependent on the type of care perceived to be required for the patient and also by the avai lability of bed space. At each level of care the patient is cared for by different nurses dependent on the shif t allocations, leave, and other role requirements. In sum then, the rationalisation of health care means that the nature of the hospitalisation experience and cari ng as provided by nurses (for example, the model used by nurses for caring) has changed considerably. Nurses are no longer able to provide the same level of care, in the same way, that the patient re ceived in the past, and family caring in th e home is now becomi ng more commonplace. Changes affecting models of care transform caring into a technical problem and thence into a field of expanding power. What we have essentially is a norma lising of caring. This arises from technologies and strategies creating a conflict of implementations (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:196) as well as simultaneo usly constituting new rules and procedures for doing things (Smart 1985:72). Nurses are positioned as caring n urses but caring is impeded, displaced, and mo ved to others thro ugh the competing technologies and practices of institutional chan ges, technological advancements, econom ic rationalism and patient management systems. What occurs th en is the change in th e caring statements for nursing, and consequently the discourse of caring has varied meanings for nurses. Technology Technological advancement is a pivotal fact or that has contribu ted many changes to discourses of caring (Sandelowski 1999; Lumby 2001). Alongside thes e changes, whilst caring has been stated as being valued within the nursing literature and in statements of 190 professional bodies, it has also been devalu ed by society (Reverby 1987b) and has been upstaged by medical technology (Falk Raphael 1996:40). Technical nu rsing skills (Lea and Watson 1996:15) are linked to competent cari ng (Shiber and Larson 1991:64) yet when nurses speak of a loss of caring or of noncaring they suggest that care must go beyond the technical (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:7; Gavin 1997:695). On the other hand, patients (for example, in emergency departments) rate highly the technical 'aspects of caring in relation to nurses' work' (Jenny an d Logan 1996:352; Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998:927). The impact of the discourse of technology as progress on nursing knowledge, education and practice contributes to the caring situati on for the nurse. When caring is viewed as divorced from technology, then caring causes distress for nurses. Leininger identified this as an issue in the 1980s and today it is st ill very relevant, with consequences whereby nursing is now severely affect ed by the nursing shortages throughout the world (Young 2003:2). Her view in the 1980s was that Some nursing care experts become extrem ely frustrated and disappointed because they cannot practise care. Instead they may be coerced into becoming high-level technicians who seldom have time to give personalised care to people by listening, comforting, and providing other essentia l care acts to clients and families. Sometimes these competent and sensitive caregivers leave nu rsing because they are disillusioned about nursing as a caring profession and their inability to practise care (Leininger 1986:5). For the nurse who resides within the world view of this discourse, t he technological advancements of today contribute to their internal stress and conflicts, and in concert wit h the worldwide situation of poor resourcing of nursing, what we are seeing are outcomes 191 that affect nursing overall. That is, these nurses leave nursing e arly and do not return. There is also a situation where nursing is no longer considered a career choice for others, and the framework of pra ctice is disrupted. Instead of caring as the core b usiness of nurses we see a shif t in text and talk elaborating conceptions of nursing without elaborating caring as an integral part of nursing. That is, caring moves to the invisible for nurses (Lawler 1991; Baker and Diekelmann 1994). Policies and procedures of nursing repr oduce a discourse on concepts of care management, care process or outcomes of ca ring (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990; Pollack- Latham 1991; Shiber and Lars on 1991; Burchiel 1995). Different practices of nursing develop where technological ad vancements alongside differing care models become the norm (Peters and Laxford 1995). Thus we see in tersecting technologies affecting practice where society defends itself to ensure that pra ctices are in place to meet societal health related concerns and po litical imperatives. Social Issues Aside from technological issues intersecting with caring, social differences (such as differences in gender, race, class, age, cultur e, ethnicity, etc.) are meaningful in terms of how we identify ourselves as members of a so cial whole, and of collectivities within it (Bradley 1999:23). When gend er is viewed as a social construct (Siegfried 1989:71; Bradley 1999:21) differences between gender ca tegories are also identified as relevant for caring (Siegfried 1989:65). These have been link ed to history, status and the activity of women (Miers 2002:70). The concept of gender, about relations b etween 'men' and 192 'women', determines how we divide society's members up into two sexes and allocate them to different social roles and attributes (Bradl ey 1999:22; Miers 2002). Gender relations affect all aspects of social and cult ural life (Bradley 1999:28) and the different characteristics of men and women lead to segm entation of social ro les and tasks and their assignment to either men or women. As Siegfried claims: We now know enough about the diff erent expectations of and behaviors toward male and female infants and children to realize how large a role socialization plays in the formation of one's sense of self as male or female. We know that human individu als are not simply imprinted, but that from at least birth on, if not before, they actively respond t o and reject such environmental constraints in unique ways (1989:6 4). Traits therefore should not be regarded as specifically male or f emale but are mutually constructed in interaction between individuals and their social milieu. There are sets of circumstances that can produce similar responses in rega rd to traits, and variability in human development contributes to variability in traits (S iegfried 1989:64). This notion of development may go some way to explain why men do take up nursing, but s uffice to say that there is a difference in the numbers of men and women in nursing and in the areas that they seek nursing experiences. Gender differences are particularly diffuse, but they include such economic inequalities which derive from the organisation of the sexu al division of labour both within the home and within paid employment (Bradley 1999 :22). Women and men in employment often develop distinctively 'gendere d' work cultures (Rushing 19 96:158; Bradley 1999:24), with preference for work roles identified as lear ned gender related factors (Anker 2001:130). 193 We often find for example, men employ ed in technological, management or administrative areas of nursing. Cultural defi nitions of the appropriate ways to practise femininity and masc ulinity (Bradley 1999:24) affect both men and women. How we exist in the world as individuals is then as Bradley claims: ...influenced by our position at the c onjuncture of meanings of gender, class, age and ethnicity\u2014and by the material constraints that memb ership of a particular gender, class age-gr oup, ethnic origin impose on us (1999:24). Historically, this division of labour is linke d socially and culturally to the different reproductive roles of men and women (Iphofen and Poland 1998:150; Miers 2002:70), and gender theory makes a valuable contributi on to explaining occupational segregation by sex. That is, the characteristics of fema le occupations mirror the common stereotypes of women (Anker 2001:139). Pr oponents of gender theory and views argue that women's disadvantaged position in the la bour market is caused by, and is a reflection of, patriarchy and women's subordinate posit ion in society and the fami ly (Anker 2001:138; Buchan and Calman 2004). We see this occurring in nursin g roles that predominan tly attract one social group more than another. In contrast to the a bove, ideas from neo-classical fe minism proclaim that women may rationally choose occupations that allow for temporary withdrawa l from the labour force, including occupations which are flexible in terms of entry and working hours, and occupations that assist with responsibilities in the home. Women toda y are still identified as the gender almost exclusively respon sible for housework and childcare (Anker 194 2001:132). There continues to be a strong se nse of the separateness of men and women's tasks (Bradley 1999:29). Continuing with this notion, on e of the most enduring aspe cts of labour markets world wide is the occupation al segregation by sex (Anker 200 1:129), and it is predominantly women who are the nurses thro ughout the world (Milligan 2001:8). This segregation is viewed as a major source of economic inefficiency, especially when on e considers it to be as wasteful of human resources, increasing la bour market inflexibil ity and reducing the economy's ability to adju st to change (Anker 2001:129). Segregation can have a negative effect on how men view wome n and on how women view themselves (Anker 2001:129- 130). This in turn negatively affects women's status, income and cons equently other social variables (poverty, income , etc.) (Anker 2001:130) . Nursing is still perceived as a relatively low paid occupation. Our society continues to undergo profound change, and in this proc ess of transformation, especially in regard to the na ture of family, cultur e, politics, economics and the world of work, the respective roles of men and women are changing; nonetheless, gender inequalities continue (Loutfi 2001: 4). Women enter into caring occupations because from an early age they are socialised to focus on traditio nally female responsibilities. Furthermore, women may face a double bind in that the gains from choosing a non-traditional occu pation may be affected by co untervailing loss es in access to male income (Badgett and Folbre 2001:338). In effect, women's circumstances (responsibility for child care, family commitments, etc.) often const rain them to take less 195 well-paid jobs (Iphofen and Poland 1998:149) and female labour is used to lessen costs. Consequently, there is a lower value plac ed on women's work (Bradley 1999:29). Employees in occupations such as nursing are typically paid less th an others, even when other personal and job characteristics are co nsidered (Badgett and Folbre 2001:328). Thus we see women socialised into caring (Siegfried 1989:68), a role that is associated with women's work (Reverby 1987b:1) and as an occupation it is deva lued by our society (Benner and Wrubel 1989:368) even while it is romanticised and subject to nostalgia or idealisation. When we take on board the idea that nurses position themselves to view 'caring as being', as involving presence, a relationship, is intrinsic, essential and part of development (the elements of the discourse) an d we contrast this with the views from the discussion around social issues we can see the ideological mis-match th at occurs for these nurses. The literature relating the histor y of nursing tells us that nursing has always been identified as women's work or the core practices of women (Reverby 1987b Badgett and Folbre 2001) caring is described as an intrinsic mo tive for performing nursing. That is, there is a sense of emotional attachment an d connection to the persons being cared for. The constructs of gendered behaviour in soci ety in regard to women's caring tendencies portray caring as a socially imposed altruism or a gender biased system of coercive socialization (Benner and Wrub el 1989:367; Badgett and Fo lbre 2001:333). This comes about through the development of gendered no rms of familial obligation. Western social norms create strong pressures of differentiation of roles by gender (Badgett and Folbre 2001:333). In this light then, these nurses are held hostage by care itself, because most 196 forms of bargaining are based on the threat to withhold something valuable. However, because these nurses are motivated by intrinsi c concerns and have internalised caring as being, they then find it diffi cult to withhold their care (B adgett and Folbre 2001:335). This is evident in the fact that there are few times when nurses have actually called a strike in Australia; even then the strike was modifi ed to ensure skeleton staffing for patients within their care. It would be interesting to know if the nurses who provided the skeleton staffing are those nurses who see themselves within this discour se. Moreover, the humanist discourse (Fjelland and Gjengedal 1994: 8) is an available tool or weapon for use by hospital administrators or an aggrieve d public\u2014to be used in the form of the accusation that to go on strike is to be 'uncaring'. In this situation we see that power becomes enabling and controlling, through cultural, social an d personal values and norms because of socialised expectations cemented in a discourse of caring a s being (Lupton 1994:112). Within this context of the discussion, there are important implications for the quality of care provided by those nurs es who hold the view of 'caring as being'. The emotional element of caring is viewed by some femini sts as emotional labour and is consequently viewed as exploitation in the nursing work fo rce (Badgett and Folbre 2001:330). In many different cultures, being female is associated with care for others, and associated with this is the actuality that women carry the greater bu rden of domestic responsibilities (Iphofen and Poland 1998:144). For example, nursing, which is identified as a fema le occupation, is seen as an extension of household activities . However, people are no t defined solely by their work, nor is it possible to ignore factors outside the workpla ce on a person's status at work (Loutfi 2001:5) and the self surveillance modes in operation. Moreover, gender has 197 far reaching influences on the nurses of ou r society, not only for those within this discourse, but for those situated within the other two discourses as described within the body of this work. Gender is, of course, inse parable from questions of power and it is from the Foucauldian pe rspective that I now tu rn to discuss power. Power Foucault argues that knowledge and truth ar e produced out of power struggles (between fields, disciplines and instit utions) and these are used to authorise and legitimise the workings of power (Foucault 1988a:153; Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:64). Ultimately, we cannot exercise power except through the pr oduction of truth and there can be no exercise of power without a certain economy of discourses of truth which operate through and on this basis of association (McHoul and Grace 1993:59). Power therefore is used in \"analyzing, controlling, regulati ng and defining the human body and its behaviour\" (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:64). It functions in terms of the relations between different fields, institutions, bureau cracies and other groups within the state (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:71) and can fl ow from one point or area to another, depending on circumstances or alliances. It isn' t a thing that is either held by, or belongs to anybody (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:7 0). Consequently, power is viewed as mobile and contingent; it moves around and through different groups, events, institutions and individuals, as constructed, but nobody owns it and it is not imposed. People themselves are produced by, and sub ject to, the forc es of power (Danaher, Sc hirato et al. 2000:72-74). 198 Although power acts on people in a non-eg alitarian way (that is, some groups are dominated, exploited by and abused by the work ings of power), at th e same time it acts on everybody\u2014the dominant as well as th e dominated\u2014by producing self-regulating subjects (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:74). By this Foucault means that our bodies and minds have been formulated in ways so that we take it upon ourselves to make sure that w e f u n c t i o n i n p a r t i c u l a r w a y s i n o r d e r to remain good, healthy subjects (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:75). Esse ntially an d Mahon 1994:143; Beatti e, Cheek et al.) portraying how the caring nurse must be defined. We can see this through the manifestation of self surve illance and docile bo dies (Rabinow 1984:182; Rudge 1997) in nursing (for example, the rise of self-hel p programmes, personal development and allied health practices, and conformity to standards of practice). Techniques permeate caring and for nurses internalised within this discou rse, unique forms such as self surveillance work to effect knowledge and to govern the conduct of nurses. Po wer is, first and foremost, productive in the sense that it brings things into being (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:77). Power, its institutions and discourses, produce an almost infinite variety of categories of people and behaviour which compete with one ano ther to regulate and control populations (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:78). Thus, do minant discourses become normative. As mentioned above, truth is a fundamental notion of power for Foucault (Foucault 1981). He challenges the conditions necessar y for the production of truths (McHoul and Grace 1993:58; Rouse 1994:103; Fox 1997) an d claims that power produces knowledge, and that power and knowledge directly impl y one another (McHoul and Grace 1993:59). 199 Working from the Foucauldian concept of power, the discourse of 'caring as being' produces the caring nurse, one that is subject to the forces of power (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:74) and a discourse where humanism , human development and human elements produce a nurse who is controlle d by what she or he views ca ring to be as a dominant discourse. Consequently, this discourse has become integrated int o regulations of nursing practice and behaviours (Cook and Cullen 2003:195). Institutional practices (such as models of care, time constraints, staffing levels and mechanisms) compete with the nurse's internalised meanings about caring. We can see a situation in nursing where professional nursing bodies, political groups an d institutions, are now trying to find ways to keep nurses in the system (nursing) using several differe nt mechanisms and strategies such as child care friendly wo rkplaces, self-rostering, etc. (Advisory Board 2003:7). While these mechanisms relate to institutional prac tices, political initiatives and gender issues, and may provide strategies for competing discourses, they still do not prov ide the space for the nurse who has internalised the discourse 'caring as being' to practise according to what she or he believes are norms within what they view as a dominant discourse. That is, the ability to care as they believe caring in nursing should be. As mentioned earlier, one of Foucault's mechan isms for power is that of self-surveillance, and he speaks of docile bodies where there is a production of self-regulating subjects (Rouse 1994:95; Danaher, Schirato this discours e\u2014'caring as being'\u2014 we see nurses who come from the view that caring is intr insic to them an d is the essence of their practice, and accordin gly this affects how they func tion. That is, they have an expectation of caring practice, one that th ey believe is shared by their peers, the profession, the institution that they are working in, and that patients have this perception 200 of care delivery also. However, these nurses become burdened through their own self- regulating caring behaviours, especially when they find that the y are unable to care according to expected standards and when they feel that institutio nal practices do not support their efforts to be 'good' caring nurses. The notion of power, its instit utions (for example, health care facilities, bureaucratic processes, professions of nursing etc.) and di scourses (for example, 'caring as being') produces an infinite variety of people (peo ple who come to view their situation from many perspectives, such as institutional values and positions of p ower within an institutional hierarchy) who can be deemed to be caring nurses . As a result we see nurses competing with one another in order to regula te and control the practice of nursing. For a ward in a health care facility, these nurses may be supervisory nurses, the nurse unit manager, the nurse educator, permanent or casual nurses who are implementing direct patient care delivery. Each of these persons uses different mechanis ms to regulate and control caring. For example, power may be controlled through the use of a particular model of care or the imposition of a nursin g theory. Control may be afforded in the mechanism of consultancy before a procedure is undertaken. Then again, the nurse unit manager may effect control th rough the mechanisms associated with rostering. This Foucauldian notion of power is on e that influences all three discourses in this thesis and it is particularly relevant to the third and final discourse for this thesis ('caring as knowing'). Therefore I return to the concept of power at a later stage, in chapter 5. Conclusion The discourse 'caring as being' is one of three discourses within the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'. For those nurses who have internali sed this discourse, they view caring from a 201 particular viewpoint that sign ificantly influences how they care for patien ts. We can see how influences of other discourses, institutio ns, practices and intersecting technologies can affect these nurses in their role, cont ributing internal stre ss and conflict. The discussion offers an understanding as to why nurses situated within this discourse may leave the nursing profession, and why they are experiencing dissat isfaction with their ability to provide care. This is further mani fested by the current worldwide shortage of nurses, which has resulted in attempts by nu rsing organisations and employers to focus on recruitment and retention of nurses (Bucha n and Calman 2004:32). Furthermore, when we see that some nurses operate from the exp ectation that 'caring is being', it provides part of the answer as to why there continues to be a debate about the defining of caring when nurses view caring differently. Three discourses of caring are delineated for the 'Archive of Caring in Nursing' in this thesis. There is overlap, they do intersect, but as identified in the in itial description of this discourse, multiple statements over 30 years contribute to the discou rse 'caring as being'. It is in conflict with the other two discourses \u2014'caring as doing' and 'caring as knowing' and in agreement with the stat ements generated about the discourse, 'caring as being' is the least discussed and verbalised discourse within the Archive. 202 I started off in this chapter outlining an anecdote that presented the picture of a le cture I give to nursing studen ts; in essence, a sess ion that would aim to cover some of the nuts and bolts of nursing. But what is it that I should really say to these students of nursing? Should we begin to examine their ideas to see if they themselves are positioned within this discourse 'caring as being? Are any of th ese nurses the ones we will lose in the future to other occupations? Are any of these stud ents the nurses who will work in the health care arena but then become disenchanted with their caring practices and change to other professions or occupations? How can we suppor t and nurture these stud ents of nursing so they are not crushed in their caring practi ces? How can we keep their optimism for caring alive? 203 Chapter 4: Caring as Doing THE SECOND DISCOURSE IN THE AR CHIVE OF CARING FOR NURSING: CARING AS DOING It was early in the shift. I was in the anaesthetic bay setting up equipment in preparation for the morning operating theatre list, when the buzzing of th e intercom signalled that my first patient had arrived. I w a l k e d o v e r t o t h e reception desk and cross-checked the operating theatre list. I had learned not to rely on my memory for the details of my patient and their operation. I reread my patien t's name and the site of the operation and I also mentally oriented myself to the age and gender of my patient. I surveyed the room for her. Thes e details in concert with our theatre schedule (eye surgery) made it an easy task to immediately recognis e my patient, because of the eye drops on her trolley. I glanced over to her and noticed that her left eye was already more dilated than the right. Oh, I thought, one of these days. I walked back to the de sk to cross-check the operation site on the list ag ain. It certainly stated that Mrs Emma Jones was to have her right eye operated on. Mmm, now le t me see if I have Mrs Emma Jones, I thought. I walked over to the patient re sting on the trolley. She was a frail elderly lady like so many of today's patients on the eye list wo uld be. While she was resting quietly, I could see the telltale signs of nervousness in her shaking hands and in the rapid movements of her eyes. On my way to her trolley, I h ad picked up a blanket from the warming cupboard and as I came closer , I said hello, introduced my self and my role. \"Hello, I'm Sharon Bourgeois, the Registered Nurse assigned to care for you duri ng your operation today.\" (She let out a small sigh and responde d to my salutation). \"You look a little cold. Would you like me to pl ace this warm blan ket next to you? It's a little colder inside also\". The smile extended and I ca refully placed the warm blanket under her 204 other blankets\u2014she immediately snuggled in. I informed her that I would be asking her a set of questions before we mo ved into the theatre, a similar set to those she had already answered in the ward, and sh e nodded her head in response . The first ques tion I asked was for her to tell me her full name an d date of birth. \"Emma May Jones, 7th of June, 1930,\" she replied. I smiled my thanks and cross-checked all the available information. My thoughts raced; so far we have the patient we were ex pecting. I asked Mrs Jones if she would tell me in her own words what operation she was to have today. She responded carefully \"Removal of a cataract from my left eye. I had th e other eye operated on last year, so now it's this eye's turn\". I asked her if the op eration last year had been successful and she responded in the positive. She was looking forward to getting this eye fixed too, but stated that she was still a li ttle apprehensive even though she couldn't remember the details of the la st operation. Aah, I thought, the magic of the drugs they use in anaesthesia these days. I had a look at her consent form and noted that she had consented to the cataract remo val and lens insertion for her left eye. I asked her if she was going to have a lens inserted into the eye as well, to which she replied affirmatively. I continued working through the en tire check list to ensure al l details were accurate and complete, and then with assistance, I took Mr s Jones to the anaesthetic bay to await the commencement of her procedure. After ensuring that Mrs Jon es was aware of where she wa s, and what we would be doing over the next few minu tes, I excused myself to pass on the information that was incorrect on the theatre booking list. I knew the scrub nurse was goin g to be miffed about this piece of information. Th e change from right eye to le ft eye meant that the nursing staff had to move all the large equipment agai n after they had set up the room, including the telescope, monitor and catara ct machine. All of these piec es had to be placed on the opposite side to where they were now. It was one of the reasons wh y patients scheduled for 205 eye operations were ordered on the theatre li st. That is, so that nursing staff can avoid changing the heavy equipment after every pati ent. No doubt someone had done the wrong thing. I walked into the operating room and everythi ng was set up for our first patient as per the list. The list identified three patients sched uled for cataract operations on the right eye and then two patients on the left eye. I info rmed the scrub and scou t nurse together that Mrs Jones had arrived and showed them her ch arts. I informed the team that Mrs Jones was scheduled for a left cataract and IOL (intraocular lens) operation and not a right one as the theatre list stated. The groan from the team was audible\u2014in fact a few other choice words flowed as well . I opened the consent page to show the scrub nurse the medical notes as a cross-check. The scout nurse then followed me out to the anaesthetic bay to say hello to Mrs Jone s and performed her own patient check. I knew they would not be happy with this mistak e so early in the day. When the medical team entered the theatre we informed them of the theatre list mistake. The surgeon reviewed his notes and examined Mrs Jones' eye as a means of validation, and we were now ready to start. We inserted an intravenous infusion line (d rip) into Mrs Jones' arm and administered her medication, a drug I had qu ietly termed 'magic juice' be cause of its effects\u2014a drug that made her less anxious, more relaxed, a little drowsy and facili tated memory loss as another part of its effects. T hen, Mrs Jones was given a series of injections around the eye that blocked all feeling and movement of her eye. During these injections, I stayed close to her, held her hand and assi sted with the anae sthetic as required . I had previously (while we were waiting for the medical team) given her a detail ed step by step account of what the procedure would be so that she was well prepared, but these injections around the eye still bothered most patients (a nd just quietly, my self as well). 206 Following her injections, Mrs Jones was settled on to the theatre tabl e for her operation. I sat beside her during the procedure and offered her my hand, which she gratefully grabbed. She was totally covered by drapes during the procedure, was given oxygen via a catheter to breathe an d she was instructed not to move. Mrs Jones, although medicated, had not fallen asleep. From time to time the surgeon would inform her of his progress and she would squeeze my hand in response. She stayed ve ry still. Her time on the operating theatre table was less than an ho ur and everything went well. I cleaned her skin following the procedure and assisted he r to move back across to the trolley in preparation for her exit to the recovery room. I swapped her hard pillow for a soft one, provided her with another warm blanket and, using a cloth, moistene d her lips before I escorted her to recovery. I introduced Mrs Jones to the Post-Anaesthetic Care Nurse, provided a handover and said goodbye to her. I then walked back to the anaesthetic bay to greet my next patient and to reset the anaesthetic equipm ent back for a right cataract extraction. The above anecdote, drawn from my practice-perspective, illust rates multiple examples of caring that are reflected in the nursing literature. That is, the n urse cares for Mrs Jones through practices such as identifying and acti ng on the operating th eatre list mistake, moistening her mouth and keeping her warm. Although the care for Mrs Jones is from the anaesthetic nurse's perspective, at the same time within this practice context there are other nurses (for example, the scout, scrub and later the post-anaesthetic care nurse) also caring for her. The anecdote describes one nurse' s role within a specific practice arena (the perioperative environment). Howe ver, other arenas will requir e different forms of caring, and instances of practice will involve activiti es and outcomes relevant to the patient's needs (Barrera, Machanga et al. 2003:181). On e of the problems I've encountered in my nursing practice, as mentioned in my introdu ction, is that some nu rses and other persons 207 in arenas outside of my practice context have not recognised or valued caring for patients as a practice of the perioperative nurse. Th ere is a push from other disciplines and management in Australia, and in other co untries, to replace nursing roles in the perioperative environment with technicians (for example, repl acing the nursing anaesthetic role with anaesthetic technicians). This lack of re cognition for caring in nursing practice is not limited to the perioperat ive context, but can be seen to be relevant in other nursing ro les worldwide. Introduction In the previous chapter I provided evidence from the nursing literatu re presenting the discourse 'caring as being', and discussed issues arising from this discourse as they impact on nursing. The nursing literature comprises many examples of statements that show that nurses see, speak and write of other discourses, and by the end of this chapter I will have described and analysed the second of the thre e discourses in the 'Archive of Caring fo r Nursing'. Returning to this second discourse, 'caring as doing' the elemen ts relate more closely to the actions and the visible practices of the nurse than I have identified for the discour se in the previous chapter. When caring is discussed and defined, it is the a pproaches to caring that authors explicate for their discussions. The statements situate and argue for nursing as a discipline and draw in few external disciplines for reference, unlike the previ ous discourse ('caring as being'), which was influenced by such disc iplines as psychology, ontology and human development. Nurses who view their practice according to th is discourse are exposed to a variety of interpretations, ideas and thou ghts about caring. For example, caring is defined according 208 to constructs (Leininger 1986:10; Watson, 19 85, cited in Clarke and Wheeler 1992:10 ), themes (McNamara 1995:381), Greenhalgh , Vanhanen et al. 1998:927), resulting in an internally diverse discourse. Statements of nursin g from within these discussions reflect the 'doing' or practice aspect of caring, and multiple techniques support the proliferation of statements: for example, qu alitative and quantitative research findings (Gaut 1986; Lea and Watson 1996), literatur e analyses (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990; Swanson 1999), definitions of caring (Cook and Cullen 2003:193) a nd the perceptions nurses and patients have abou t caring (Barrera, Machanga et al. 2003:436). From another perspective, there are statements about expertise, competen ce and standards that influence the actions and behaviours of nurses during caring practices. In the following section, I de scribe the discourse 'caring as doing'. Statements are more prolific and diverse in the nursing literatur e for this discourse than for the other two discourses identified.. It is the most politically relevant and the most domin ant of the three discourses identified. The discourse is measurable, visible a nd argued for; caring roles and functions of the nurs e receive considerable discussi on and debate from within the profession. Statements are verbalised by nurses, patients, th eorists, managers and politicians and have been drawn into our everyday attitudes and values , resulting in a normalising effect for this discourse. From th ese statements, the economics of caring can be counted, and staffing levels and mix ca n be substituted to meet caring needs for patients. There is a production of the knowledge 'caring as do ing'. Furthermore, a system of knowledge has been generated in nursing where theory, resear ch and caring practice 209 connect nursing to other disciplines such as medicine, health and manage ment, for example. In describing this discourse I have identified three elements, labelled: caring constructs, caring themes and caring practi ce. The use of elements again follows the structure used in my previous chapter, thus allowing for direct comparison of discourses. The elements for this discourse reflect the Foucauldian use of elements in that they may comprise: objects, concepts, theoretical choices, practices, en unciations, notions and statements (Foucault 1972:182). They are governed by rules of formulation which may include operations from institutions, economic pr actices, political events and ot her processes (Fou cault 1972:162). Following the description of th e discourse, I move on to consider issues such as: the defining of caring, views of caring, time fo r caring, quality and technology. Each issue is politically and professionally relevant for nursing and ca n be seen to influence the development of accepted know ledge, and is thus reflecte d in the description of the discourse. For now, I turn to the first element, caring constructs. Description of the Discourse: Three Elements Element 1). Cari ng Constructs Constructs are one way that caring has been defined, principally by Madeleine Leininger (Clarke and Wheeler 1992:1283). Although sh e does not fully elaborate her use of the term, it appears that her use of constructs is a synthesis of ideas about a complex image. The following quote illustrates the complexity of ideas she associates with caring: ... support, tenderness, touc h, compassion, empathy, stress alleviation, presence, loving acts, comfort, direct and indirect helping behaviors, enabling, facilitating, nurturance, succorance, surveillance, prot ection, restoration, instructive acts, 210 coping, concern, interest in, trusting, and need fulfillment (Leininger, 1978 cited Leininger 1981b:10). We see from the above that many ideas are asso ciated with caring. Some of these ideas are actions, others behaviours, while still others are feelings, or attitudes. Leininger does not advocate that all of these constructs need to take place all of the time in order for caring to occur. They may vary with cultural us age. That is, different terms may be used depending on the culture in which caring is used, or embedded ideas asso ciated with caring will vary and therefore have a diff erent meaning for nurs es across cultures. Alternatively, they may not be present at all. To exemplify this point, as patient need is identified, so are the social structures, wo rld views, and cultural values of people. Therefore, caring provided by nurses vari es transculturally (Leininger 1981b:11). Caring then as culturally derived, requires culturally based knowledge and skills for satisfying and effective nursing (Leininger 1 981b:14). In addition, people from different cultures identify these caring behaviours of nurses (Alexa nder, Beagle et al. 1994:430) and within theoretical writings, ideas associated with caring behaviour s are merged with the discourse of culture (Leininger 1981b:14). Th e culture of caring is deeply embedded and mutually shared among members of a cultural group. Therefore, expressions, rituals and patterns of caring are well k nown by those within the culture, but may not necessarily be known to people outside of the culture (Wenge r 1991:96). The nurse who cares in what is deemed to be a \"culturally sensitive manner\" searches for sameness, while learning about the cultural aspects of patients (Friedemann 1991:171). Leininger's notion of culture ca re theory (Leininger 1991c; Alexander, Beagle et al. 1994; Leininger 1995) asserts that care and culture are inextricably linked and cannot be 211 separated (Reynolds and Leininger 1993:3). Ca ring constructs are seen as essential for nursing (Leininger 1986:10) because of the view that caring is the essence of nursing (Alexander, Beagle et al. 1994: 427)\u2014an ideology for nursing. The constructs when used as a taxonomy (Clarke and Wheeler 1992:1283), work to assist in the understanding of caring in an ordered, sometimes hier archical way, with multiple research studies supporting and validating these ideas about caring throughout the world and contributing statements to the discourse of caring (see the Culture Ca re Theory Group, Transcultural Nursing Society, for more information: www.tcns.org/cctg ). Element 2). Caring Themes Predominant within this discourse are caring themes that are gen erated from the research perspective. Themes are used as a way of understanding and organising caring. For example, eight care themes were identifi ed by Brown (1986) following patients' descriptions of their experiences of being care d for by a nurse. These themes which reflect patient perceptions of needs are: Recognition of individual qualities and needs, Reassur ing presence, Provision of information, Demonstration of professional knowledge and skill, Assistance with pain, Amount of time spent, Promotio n of autonomy and Su rveillance (Brown 1986:58). Each theme has an inherent me aning, and illustrations from practice can be seen. In the above we can see that Brown's research identifi es themes which overlap and intersect with the previous discourse, 'caring as being'. \"Presence\" is one the me that is drawn from patients' experiences, to identify caring. 212 Caring themes have been identified from an analysis of patients' descriptions of interactions with nurses, using a phenomenol ogically bound research framework (Riemen 1986). Conversely, it was the patient's percep tions of noncaring behaviours and attitudes that allowed for the classification of caring themes. Themes that Riemen identified for the noncaring nurse can be contrasted with th e caring nurse, as id entified by Brown. Noncaring nurses were seen as \"Being in a hurry and efficient,\" \"Doing a descriptors of pr actice, three themes emerged for Riemen. These were \"... the nurse's presence, the client's response and consequences\" (Riemen 1986:34). These themes thus afforded a way of organising descriptors developed from the research process. Thematic understandin g of caring developed by Riem en later contributed to an understanding of the effects of caring on patien t outcomes (Shiber and Larson 1991:64). Caring themes continue to be identified and developed. To elaborate, caring themes have been made explicit by nurse researchers McNamara (1995) and Nay (1998). McNamara identified that caring themes can be seen in the practice of pe rioperative nurses, and nurses from the study identified intervention s they perceived to be caring behaviours. These were present in more than 20 themes. Examples of the caring themes identified were: showing concern for patients as unique human beings, commun icating, using touch and being aware of and sensitive to patients ' experiences and feelings. Themes such as communicating by touch and word, being with patients, introducing se lves and roles, and showing sensitivity to patients' feelings and situations, suggeste d that the nurses placed 213 great value on establishing relationships with patients as part of the healing process. Again here we can see an intersection of idea s associated with both the discourses 'caring as doing and being' as well as other discours es of research method ologies, healing and nursing. Nurses in this study (McNamara 19 95) demonstrated concer n with the provision of supportive spiritual and ps ychological environments for patients, expressing themes such as the provision of support , protection and safety, prayin g, and facilitating patients' contacts with the addition of support system s (1995:381). The behaviours that contribute to these themes (such as support) are evid ent in the anecdote from my practice- perspective of cari ng for Mrs Jones. Themes of caring behaviours were developed following an interview by Na y (1993) of nineteen residents in five Australian nursing homes and the seventeen nurses who worked with them. Nay identified four major themes in relation to how nursing was perceived, that is \"... caring, give and ta ke, just a job and ho spital mentality\" (N ay 1993 cited in Nay 1998:402). In this thematic analysis, the desc riptors provided by nurses were consistent with those that resident s viewed caring nurses to be (Nay 1998:402). As can be seen in the above examples, thematic an alysis as a research method has made explicit the caring practices of nurses and contributed to an understanding of caring through outcomes of research. Th ese themes offer nurses a wa y of making sense of a lot of information about caring an d are useful in reducing multip le caring practice instances and examples into meaningful ideas. However, the dispersal of the themes is dependent on the marketing and uptake of the ideas from publication literature. Consequently, this thematic understanding of caring contribute s to the confusion ab out the defining of nursing. That is, there is an overlap of ideas into different themes presented by different 214 authors who use diverse research methods. There is an intersection and overlap of ideas that contribute to both of the discourses mentioned so far for this thesis, and the identification of two different discourses with in the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing' may prove to be difficult for some nurses. Element 3). Caring Practice Caring practice encompasses what is seeable, sayable, doable by and expected of the caring nurse. Through this element, caring be comes visible and significantly contributes to the shaping of this discourse, as reflected in the work of nurses from the 1970s to today. Mapping these ideas shows that they stem from the influent ial work of Watson (1979; 1988) and Leininger (1981b). In 1986, both Wo lf and Gaut drew on these authors' ideas to inform their research ab out actions and behaviours th at make caring visible. When nurses speak of caring, they use expressi ons that depict actions and behaviours that make caring seeable, sayabl Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998). Caring is v i e w e d b y s o m e a s a n o r d e r e d s e r i e s o f actions that begins with go al setting and ends with im plementation (Gaut 1986:79). Actions of caring include: to take care of, or to exhibit concern, as in caring about (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:2). Definitions of caring identifying actions of the nurse significantly contribute toward the shaping of this discourse. Furthermore, caring ac ts or caring as an act are statements that can be identified in the literature from t he late 1970s (Watson 1979; Gaut 1986; Swanson-Kauffman 1986:Fo rrest, 1989 #181; Wolf 1986) to be used today (Nay 1998; Watson 1999a; Bassett 2002). Caring as a set of actions can also be deduced from Watson's theoretical model (1979; 198 5; 1994). In her theory she 215 identifies ten carative factors10\u2014factors that are also stated as principles of nursing (Sithichoke-Rattan 1989). Using this theor etical model, actions performed by the nurse focus on meeting the goals of the patient thro ugh the application of the carative factors (Watson 1979:460). These carative factors have since been changed to reflect nursing in the new millennium; an update d version is now available (www.uchsc.edu/ctrsinst/chc/index.htm ). In addition to the explicati on of actions and behaviours, th e work related to defining caring contributes a significant number of examples to this disco urse. While many definitions of caring are offered, the majority come from the perspective of nurses rather than from the patients (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:7). Essentially, this has allowed different views of caring to surface (Mangold 1991:134) , especially when patients' and nurses' views of caring differ and are not always congruent. 10 The Carative Factors as presented by Watson are: 1. A humanistic-altruistic system of values. 2. The instilling of faith-hope. 3. Sensitivity to self and others. 4. Helping-trusting human care relationships. 5. Expressing positive and negative feelings. 6. Creative problem-solving caring process. 7. Transpersonal teaching-learning. 8. Supportive, protective, and/or corrective mental, physical, soc ietal, and spiritual environment. 9. Human needs assistance. 10. Existential-phenomenological-spiritual forces. (1994:6) 216 In working toward a definition of caring, th ere has been a lot of work undertaken by nurses to examine caring, which has had an im pact on this element, 'caring practice'. An early empirically based measurement tool (t he Caring Behaviours Inventory [CBI]) comprised lists of nurs es' actions that nurses consider to represent caring (Wolf 1986; Watson 2002a). This tool, derived from ca ring literature and Watson's (1979; 1988) Transpersonal Caring Theory, used a Likert reporting meas urement scale adding to the literature what is sayable and doable about caring practice from within a quantitative paradigm. About the same time, a philosophical analysis of caring that described caring as an ordered series of actions was develope d by Delores Gaut (1986). Her analysis identified that the following actions were necessary for any comp lete instance of the nurse caring for the client. The nurse (S) chooses a particular goal or go als, based not only on an identified need for a care in the client (X) but also a goal related to th e general goal of caring\u2014a positive change in X. The nurse chooses tactic s or strategies becaus e they are likely to ac hieve the particular goal chosen. Any activity may be considered a tactic if it is di rectly related to the accomplishment of the particular goal and al so related to the gene ral goal of a positive change in X. The nurse implements th e tactics or strategies by actually carrying out the activities chosen to accomplish both the particular goal and th e general goal (1986:79). 217 Caring is therefore viewed as an ordered seri es of actions, and competent caring arises directly from caring actions that are subsumed into practice. Gaut considers that caring is a principle for a ction (1981:18)\u2014one that is purposiv e and intentional. It is a human action rather than behaviour (1981:23). Her view is that: A set of acts (behavioral descriptio n) entails biophysical operations, movements, or events. A set of actions are the acts in the perspectives of the actors, expressing certain attitudes and expectations and th ereby having social and psycho logical significance or act meaning (Gaut 1981:23 original emphasis). In other words, caring as a visible practi ce is predominantly about action and thus comprises a set of visible operations. Following on from the work of Gaut and Wolf in the 1980s, a variet y of ideas reflecting caring practice can be seen in the literature (Swanson 1999 ; Watson 2002a). Some of these are identifiable actions that can be copied, demonstrated or asses sed and measured. Others relate to a more affectiv e notion of caring and tend to lend support to what I term the 'aura of the nurse'\u2014often represented as behaviours of caring rather than actions. Actions tend to emanate from the notion of 'doing to or for' the patient\u2014sometimes termed strategies or interventions. In an atte mpt to define caring Morse, Solberg et al. presented a content analysis based on the writ ings of thirty five authors. In this meta- analysis, action was subsumed into the content analysis from the pers pective of \"Caring as 218 a therapeutic intervention\" (1990:6). In their view, authors who write from this perspective ... have linked caring more directly than others to the work of nurses. Caring actions may be specific ... or caring ma y include all nursing actions ... (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:6). Their analysis contributes to the idea that cari ng is sayable and doable ; thus it is visible as an intervention. This is supported by the more recent literary meta-a nalysis undertaken by Swanson (1999). Ideas associated with caring practice have be come expansive. For example, caring actions can be identified as comfort (Wolf 1986:85; Mangold 1991:134), taking responsibility for the person, demonstrating knowledge of th e person (Wolf 1986:85), listening (Mangold 1991:135; von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1991:1364), giving honest and clear information, showing competent clinical expertise, moni toring and following through (von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1991:1370; McNamara 1995:380), oper ating through teamwork, demonstrating a professional demeanour and providing a relaxed atmosphere (Parsons, Kee et al. 1993:1113). Other examples of caring can be se en in the different scales for assessment and measurement (Larson 1984; Cronin an d Harrison 1993; 1995; Lea, Watson al. 1998; Watson and Lea 1998; Wats on 2002a). These scales have been used across various dimensions, perceptions and for different groups of people (nurses, patients, educators, students, etc.) in different contexts of practice. Some of the items reflect actions, whereas others are behaviours. 219 Caring behaviours have a tenden cy to be affective in their nature. Identifiable affective caring behaviours include: explaining and faci litating, developing trusting relationships, anticipating and being accessi ble (von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1995: 274). Others, such as being an advocate, encouraging, supporting, s howing positive regard (Jenny and Logan 1996:351) and demonstrating se nsitivity (Mangold 1991:135:135; McNamara 1995:380) all work toward promoting the 'aura of the nurse' . Through these behaviours, caring is made visible and this then contri butes to the subtle character of the caring nurse. The discussion so far point s to the visibility of caring pra ctice, as derived from actions and behaviours. Reflecting agai n on the anecdote about the care for Mrs Jones (at the beginning of this chapter), 'doing for' in volved actions and behaviours to meet the assessed needs of Mrs Jones. Caring included comforting, anticipati ng Mrs Jones' needs, protecting and preserving her dignity and providing competent and skilful care. Within the context of perioperative practice, these caring actions offere d to Mrs Jones were expressed through the holding of her hand, informing her of impending proc edures, keeping her warm and co vered. They also translated to caring from a very fundamental perspective\u2014ensuring everyone involved knew which eye Mrs Jones was to have operated on. My actions and beha viours convey caring in a visible, sayable and doable way, reflecting the 'aura of the nurse' from within the perioperative context of care. 220 Behaviours and actions contri bute to notions of competen ce, skill and expertise of the nurse. When caring, as seen in this discourse, can be assessed and measured, then we begin to see claims a ssociated with st andards of practice bein g made von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1991:1364; McNamara 1995: 384). Standards developed for nurses (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 2001) refl ect caring actions and behaviours, as do nursing codes (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 1993; 1995) and othe r guidelines (Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001). Furthermore, we see these ideas asso ciated with technological advancements, in that nurse ca ring behaviours and actions are measured against technological competen ce where caring is associated with highly technical machines (such as the an aesthetic machine) (McNamara 1995:384). Therefore, technological competence becomes an action of caring (von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1991:1364). The intersection between cari ng and technology is one impediment to understanding perioperative caring practice by my colleagues. The belief that pe rioperative nurses are more concerned with things (t echnology) than people and th at the perioperative nursing role is more technical than caring, impacts on the focus of caring. Due to a lack of experience and knowledge about perioperative caring practice a 'vagueness' exists about caring actions and behaviours undertaken. In addition, the very natu re of the busyness of perioperative practice restricts the ability of nurses to research and publish about caring. In this restrictive research environment, patients' perceptio ns of caring have not been canvassed. These receivers of care are less aware that caring occurs because the majority of patients are affected by drugs, anxiety, or other things, or are in a state of altered consciousness and therefore caring episodes can not be remembere d. 221 Nursing research has been undertaken firstly to identify what caring behaviours and actions are, and secondly to identify how pati ents and nurses perceive these ideas (Morse, Solberg 1990; von 1993; 1995 ; Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998). Primarily, it is the nurses' perspective of caring that is measured rather than the patients' (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:7). Different have surfaced (Mangold 1991:134) and Carruth, Steele et al., see this differentiation as: ... perhaps patients and family members ev aluate the \"quality\" of caring actions and behaviors rather than \"quantify\" them . Therefore, the nurse may be perceived as \"caring\" regardless of the number of contacts made with the pati ent (Carruth, Steele et al. 1999:98). Patients identified indicators of nurses' caring behaviours recog nised qualities of caring and reported their needs for care, providin g yet another way of eliciting appropriate nursing interventions which sign ify caring. Patients also report that: they feel cared for when they are treated as individuals, when th ey receive help in dea ling with their illness experiences, when nurses anticipate their needs, when they believ e that nurses are available, and when nurses appear relaxed and confident. Patients focus more on the instrumental caring behaviours of nursing, whereas nurses focus on involvement and the affectual or expressive aspects of caring behaviours (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:7). Traditionally though, nurses have described the act of administering to patients as care behaviours (Wurzbach 1996:68) . Hence we see an overlap an d a lack of differentiation between behaviours. Von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n examined what constitutes good care 222 (1995:274) and found that staff working in these area s share the same vi ews as psychiatric patients; however, other patients (somatic or physically ill) were not in agreement. Another report differentiated th e care between nurses and pati ents in that \"Patients rate highly the technical aspects of nurses' work while nurses value the psycho-social skills. Physically ill patients stress task-orientated behaviours in particular ... \" (Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998:927). Thus, physically ill patients will stress that caring actions (tasks for example) are important, whereas psychiat ric patients underscore the affective, emotional behaviours (von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1995:254), mirroring th e importance that caring meets patients' needs. Caring as viewed in this discourse may be specific (for example, attentive listening or comforting) or it may include all nursing acti ons and behaviours (procedures, strategies and interventions) that help patients. Competence, skill and standards are seen as important for the nurse to be caring, and congruence between th ese ideas with the patient's perception of need is deemed to be critical to the caring en deavour (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:7). Caring requirements and the way that caring is undertaken are determined by patients' needs, dependent on the patient's condition. Jocalyn Lawler sugge sts that rules relevant to body care and the relationship between the pa tient and the nurse, are paramount for care to be provided (Lawler 1991:147). She coined th e term 'somology' to explain this practice. Thus, for somological prac tice to occur nurses 223 ... help people with the experience of living with and through what is happening to their bodies during illnes s, recovery or dying\u2014times when the body can dominate existence. Nurses are, therefore, centrally concerned with the object body (an ob jective and material thing) and the lived body (the body as it is experienced by living people). They are concerned with integrating the object body with the lived body. This is what I have termed somology, that is, understanding the body as an integration of the object body (the thing) into experience so that it is simultaneously an object, a means of experience, a means of expression, a manner of presence among other people, and a part of one's person al identity (Lawler 1991:29). Nurses tacitly step back as a patient's condit ion improves, to allow the patient to do for themselves as normal. Therefore, somological care is enacted when a series of caring actions are completed by the patient and the nu rse, dependent on the patient's condition, needs and nursing goals. Incidents involving a wide vari ety of actions are seen as pr ocesses of care (Brown 1986). Patients view caring actions as being effectiv e, appropriate, beneficial and congruent when they meet their needs. Here is an example fr om Brown concerning ca re of a patient in pain: Assistance with pain was characterized by two kinds of nursing actions. The first were direct actions by the nurse to reliev e pain including giving medication or modifying a procedure to reduce the pa in. The second grou p of actions was focused on helping the pati ent manage pain (1986:59). 224 In this example, the care pr ocess describes the way in wh ich action is performed and effective caring meets the need s of the patient through the pr ovision of pain management. For the patient to experience care, the action must convey to the patient the nurse's recognition and appreciation of the patient's worth (Brown 1986:61). Therefore, specified actions of care are identified. Patients who are considered to be 'difficult ' or 'hard to care fo r' invoke different approaches of caring from nu rses. In these situations, focus is on actions (tasks and routines, and 'doing to') rather than on behaviours. This approach offers some form of protection for the nurse when the demands of caring seem too great (Forrest 1989:818). We therefore see less of the 'aura of the nurs e' because behaviours are not as evident in the caring process. Patients' views imply that caring involves actions and behaviours. Their descriptors of noncaring nurses reflect words that convey feelings of impersonal task-oriented behaviour (Jenny and Logan 1996:351 ). Of course this criticism of nurses as noncaring is not accept ed by nurses, and discrepancy be tween patients' and nurses' views of caring is evident. Several practices influe nce perceptions about noncaring and I take up the issue later in the discussion section. Noncaring contrasts with the visibility of caring practi ce. Several theori sts claim that caring is hidden or invisible and so it becomes undervalued (Reverby 1987b; Lawler 1991:227). In providing expert care, nurses do not always arti culate what actions they have taken in order to facilitate care. Yet nurses are able to voice that they did care for the patient (Leininger 1986:3). It is for this very reason that nurses claim that caring is difficult to define, and consequently this contributes to an invisibility of practice. For some nurses, 225 providing care means that nurses need to know what it is, how it is described and performed before it can be valued, promoted and recognised (Roberts 1990:69). This still causes some nurses problems. Visible caring practice is challenged for ex ample, when Jean Watson proclaims caring actions and the various ways caring is reveal ed, as approximations of caring and not as caring per se (1988:34). She argues that ... caring is not merely characterized by certain categories or classes of nursing actions, but as ideals, whic h persons desiring care and persons (nurses) doing those actions hold before them (Watson 1988:34). These actions then result in se veral outcomes of caring being identified for patients. To illustrate comfort, when it stated as an ou tcome, it is the ...enhanced feelings of personhood, feelings of being cared for, increased physical comfort, and having expectations met (Jenny and Logan 1996:352). Thus, caring actions contribute to the outcomes of care. The behavioural aspects draw in the 'aura of the nurse' and result in the patien ts feeling cared for. Caring is therefore made visible and can be uniquely distinguished from other disciplines. Furthermore, visible caring practice lends it self to the view that it is tangible and teachable. A curriculum paradigm that was de signed to enable nursing graduates to be (among other things) more caring, was evid ent in the late 1980s (Bevis and Watson 1989:1). This curriculum approach used a new pedagogy for nursing, different from the 226 past behavioural approaches used. Tenets a ssociated with this pedagogy became an influence for the education of nurses, especi ally in the United States. Others also supported curriculum change (Moccia 1988; Diek elmann 1990; Tanner 1990a; Reilly and Oermann 1992) and advocated th at caring must be included in curricula and teaching. One such inclusion was the role modelling of caring actions and behaviours from the nurse to the student as a teachable, social isable component with specific strategies identified for the teaching of caring (Gardner 1992:252). Caring practice is a visible, assessable and me asurable element in this discourse 'caring as doing'. Actions and behaviours reflect skills of the nurse and are illustrative of the way that nurses express caring. Three elements: ca ring constructs, caring themes, and caring practices are evident in this discourse. There are several discourses that influence and shape 'caring as doing', and it is this aspect I now turn to. Influences from Other Discourses Several discourses, including behaviourism, nursing, management and research influence this discourse 'caring as doing'. Elements (as in Foucauldian elements) from these discourses contribute to posit ion caring behaviours and actions within the discourse. For example, Shiber and Larson allege that Research identifying caring behaviors is consistent with Maslow's hierarchy of human needs. There is a physical care requirement tha t must be met before more qualitative aspect s of care can be addressed (1991:64). 227 Linking Maslow's work from the behavioural studies domain, with caring and nursing, draws forth elements that are used to explain caring behaviours in nursing. Maslow's work is a theory based on a heuristic approach to needs and therefore, the adoption of the tenets of his theory formulates that the basic needs of patien ts are met before other needs can be met. Depending on the patient's progression through their continuum of care, both the patients' and the nurses' perceptions of the caring behaviours required will be different. Therefore, as understood within th e discourse of behaviourism, caring for the nurse is based upon the needs of the patient an d perceived priorities of care reflect these needs. In my opening anecdote, caring prac tice was formulated on the assessed needs of Mrs Jones as well as on my experience, competence, willin gness to provide care: in essence, my aura. Aside from the impact of behaviourism, nu rsing and caring overlap and intersect as discourses. Some nurses claim that all nurs ing actions can be desc ribed as nursing care (Nyberg 1990b:80) or that nursing is comprise d of actions that are predominantly caring in nature, and caring is re cognised as the basic core of nursing actions (Mangold 1991:134). In these types of discussions, cari ng is presented as a verb that denotes doing or action. However, not all disc ussions specify exactly what kinds of doings or activities are required and therefore the concept of caring is not alwa ys elaborated, but meaning is assumed (by readers of these specialty publicat ions) with the dominant discourse of caring being favoured. Other statements allude to ca ring actions as being crucial to health and intertwined with social support for nursing (Wolf 1986:84). They are intentional actions that convey physical ca re and emotional concern while pr omoting a sense of safety and 228 security (Larson and Ferketich 1993; Miller 1995 cited in Carruth, 1999:95)\u2014 concepts that are fundamental in nursing. When nurses speak about their practice they address nursing primarily in terms of what nurses do rather than separating out statemen ts of caring and nursing. Examples in the literature are nursing interventions, strategies to meet goals and t he nursing management of care processes and outcomes. Nursing re search seems to derive from the same perspective of what nurses do as well (Gaut and Boykin 1994:96). This is perhaps one of the reasons why this discourse\u2014'caring as doing'\u2014supports the lar gest number of statements contained within this 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'. Tha t is, research about activities in nursing has generated many publications about ca ring in nursing. The influence of the research discourse can be seen in the various methods and paradigms adopted for research into caring (Steve nson and Tripp-Reimer 1990; Swanson 1999; Watson 2002a). Development of research based instruments has contributed to the identification of caring actions and behavi ours. Instruments have included the Caring Behaviours Inventory (Wolf 1986) and the Ca re-Q instrument (Lar son 1984). The Caring Behaviors Inventory (CBI) was de rived by selecting from the literature, words or phrases that represented caring (Wolf 1986:91). These words or phrases of the CBI were identified to be so similar as to suggest the same dimens ion of caring to the nurses that rated the items. Using the Care-Q instrument, an indu ctively developed Vanhanen et al. 1998), Greenhal gh identified that \"... nurses ranked physically based caring behaviou rs higher than affective behaviours...\" (1998:927) with an 229 emphasis on monitoring and comforting beha viours. Gender appeared to have an influence on what caring behaviours are valued . For example, male nurses were identified as being less likely than female nurses to be accessible and to form trusting relationships (Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998:927). Seve ral other research-bas ed instruments for caring contributed to what is sayable and do able in this discours e (Parsons, Kee et al. 1993; Lea, Watson et al. 1998). Different rese arch paradigms continue to influence the discourse Wats on 2002a). The discourse of management influences the way that caring has been ordered, particularly in the way that statements have been clustered together as an outcome. C aring can be seen to affect patient outcomes (Sherwood 1993:251). When measured against caring these outcomes include: nursing actions, patient satisfaction, health status, length of stay, and nursing care costs (D uffy 1993; Sherwood 1993; Pa rker 1999; Schmidt 2003). As an illustration, the outcome of patient sati sfaction positively correlates with caring behaviours (Sherwood 1993:251). Comfort as an outcome of nursing actions is identified as enhanced feelings of personhood, feelings of being cared for, increased physical comfort and having expectati ons met (Jenny and Logan 1996:351). Satisfaction with caring appears to be based on the perception of the nurse toward the patient and of the way that nurses meet patients' physical care (Sherwood 1993:252). Thus we see caring intersecting with the management discou rse as a formal measurement of patient satisfaction. 230 Caring has in itself been considered an ou tcome (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990; Shiber and Larson 1991; Jenny and Logan 199 6); one that is fraught with difficulties. Particularly, Shiber and Larson state that The ability to attribute patient outcomes to certain caring behaviors suffers from the same difficulties and constraints as outcome assessment in general; that is, outcomes have multiple \"cau ses\" and an outcome rarely can be directly linked with specific processes of care (1991:64). Therefore, the ability to link caring behavi ours and outcomes is difficult. Much of the work related to researching caring and identi fying outcomes stems fr om the professional need to define caring in nursing. This in turn reflects the prac tice of nursing, the profession, and ultimately know ledge, which I will describe and discuss in the following chapter as the third discourse within 'The Archive of Caring for Nursing'. I have to this point concentrated on descri bing the three elements that make up the discourse 'caring as doing'. It is a vast discourse where nurses write, speak, and practise caring. Actions and behaviours are used exte nsively to describe caring. Constructs and themes are utilised as organising structures for statements within the discourse. Discussion\u2014Implications for Nursing The statements that contribute to this discours e 'caring as doing' are varied and arise from many perspectives. They have been derived using different research approaches and methodologies. Many of the statements cont ribute to the defining of caring and are essential for knowledge development in nursin g. Some of the statements are exact and specific, while others are more general in natu re and allude to the caring practice of the 231 nurse. Several issues emerge in this discours e that have implications for today's nursing practice, and it is these issues I now take up in discussion. So me of the issues pertinent to this discourse include the way that patients an d nurses view caring, or the time that is available for nurses to care. Others are abou t the technological advancements and quality issues in nursing practice. It is these issues that I turn to discuss now. They are reflective of ideas that arise from the discourse and co ntribute an understanding of the elements within the discourse. In Western culture caring nurses are made subjects resulting from the very nature of their nursing practice. That is, specialty nursing contexts (periope rative, intensive care, emergency, surgical, medical, rehabilitation, mech anism of \"dividing practices\" (Rabinow 1984:8). These contexts allow fo r a division arising from procedures and techniques within the practice area. Dividing practices become \"modes of manipulation\" (Rabinow 1984:8) and allow, in a spatial sense, the practice of exclusion. This can be seen for the perioperative nurse identified in the preface section, wher e the 'caring nurse' is not readily identifiable from outside of their pr actice context (Rabinow 1984:8; McHoul and Grace 1993:52; Davidson 1994:118). The caring nurse has increasingly been treated as a thing; a commodity, influenced by an \"...interplay of intentional action, socioeconomic changes, part icular interests, and accidents\" (Rabinow 1984:10) . For example, the very nature of perioperative nursing practice restricts open access to other nurses, and therefore practice occurs behind clo sed doors. Access is further limited to personnel who must wear special attire. This practice setting is not viewed externally and in the main nurses (i.e. perioperative) remain socially isolated when compared to other nurses in different practice contexts . Consequently, the 232 caring practices of perioperative nurses are perceived rather than known, and technological advances become the focus of nurse practice for these perceivers, rather than the intentionality of human interactions (w hether conscious or unconscious). Nurses therefore are in a passive and constraine d position resulting from processes of objectification and dividing practices (Rabinow 1984:11). Defining Caring This discourse\u2014'caring as doing'\u2014has seen the creation of a prolific number of statements that have been used by nurses to define caring. The discourse offers definitions of caring that complement the knowledge base for the nursing profession. However, definitions of caring do not readil y translate to the practice of all nurses. Competing discourses (for example, manage ment, psychology and culture) each modify the meaning of caring and quint essentially, statements that make up the discourse, 'caring as doing' compete for position within this discourse. This may contribute to the reasons why nurses have not reached agreement about how they define car ing (Huch 1995). From my own experiences, caring is not ea sily viewed from outside one's own nursing practice context and it is not easy to in tegrate practice beha viours with caring. Contributing to the competitio n between statements in this discourse are the multiple research methodologies utilised (qualitative, quantitative, crit ical, etc.), th e philosophical positions taken by authors (edu cational, sociological, psycholog ical), the different nursing context arenas where caring is made sense of (community, intensive care, perioperative care, etc.), and the defining of caring fr om various perspectives (patients, nurses, managers, etc.). 233 With so many statements circulating about caring, the repeatabili ty of statements, the restating of earlier wo rk, and with nurses applying other nurses' work to their practice setting or replicating or validating earlier re search, these all contribute to the different ways that nurses are defining caring. Eminen t nurse theorists who have well established positions (for example, the equivalent of Professor of Nursing) in higher education institutions\u2014by nature of thei r role in these institutions\u2014publish and supervise research students in the area of their expertise. This has the effect of perpetuating research in specific areas of study contributi ng to the defining of caring (see for example, the web site for the Center for Human Ca ring established by Dr Je an Watson, and the list of publications by Faculty members at www.uchsc.edu/ctrsinst/chc/index.html ). Specifically, ideas that have been propagated this way relate to the theoretical developments of caring (as supported by Watson and Leininger for example). The discourse takes as its starting point the nurse who undertakes caring acts or behaviours. According to Foucauldian though t these acts or behaviours are multiply repeated processes of different origin, th at overlap, are repeated and supported or diminished until a blueprint for practice is generated (Rabinow 1984:182). Subjects such as the caring nurse and the cared for patient are positioned within the discourse (McHoul and Grace 1993:91), which provides for th e subject position of the noncaring nurse through the omission of acts or behaviours, or because of pe rceptual differences. Other subject positions that are evid ent from the statements includ e the competent skilled nurse. This is a nurse who must meet standards of practice as deemed by an authority (Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001) or as expect ed by the profession (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 2001). Patients believe that they should receive their treatment as ordered (Irurita 1999:89); however, the contradiction identi fied is that nurses' contribution to care 234 is becoming increasingly burdened and the ability of nurses to fulfil thei r obligations through practice can not always be met. Several factors influence how nurses practise . These factors can include, among others, the perceived importance of requests (by patients and senior mana gement personnel), emergencies that arise, and co mplex care requirements. If these factors form a part of public policy, then decisions should be made explicit, and quality exp ectations revised for caring (Bowers, Lauring et al. 2001:491). This is difficult to achieve given the various definitions of caring, but also difficult when we consider that nurses may have internalised only one discourse, as opposed to the other two discourses identified for this thesis. Changes in caring practice are adopted in re sponse to needs. Some of them may arise from innovations and new technol ogy, others from political and industrial decisions. They gradually, through processes of repetition, overlap; imitation and support become inscribed as general and esse ntial practices transforming caring (Rabinow 1984:183). We see not only a diverse prolific discours e in operation, but one that is internally fractured and competitive. The splits evident in the discourse incorporate a practice split such as the everyday caring actions and behavi ours of the nurse (perhaps even personified by the mundane elements of caring in that the actions and behaviours are hidden and not visible, even to the nurse) and a conceptual sp lit, one that is identified from the theoretical developments about caring. Therefore, what it is that constitutes caring depends on the players in the discourse and their practice contexts. These play ers include nurses, theorists, patients and others intereste d in or affected by caring. 235 Nurses do commit themselves to caring for their patients, and codes g uiding nurses formalise this commit ment. However, as Spitzer identifies: ... there is a conflict between the nu rses' commitments to the institution and to the client. Such a conflict detracts from the ability of nurses to practise all that is stat ed in their ethical code. In general, the limited authority held by nurses is contradictory to the great amount of responsibility that they take upon caring for their clients and the commitment endo rsed by thei r ethical code ... (1998:168). This paradox influences the profession of nu rsing in that codes identify behaviour and actions expected of the nurse. It has implic ations for how society views the caring nurse and how nurses view themselves as carers. Pa tients enter health ca re facilities with an expectation and a perception of caring associated with nursing. Furthermore, nurses have their own ideas about caring for patients. Th e profession of nursing also has espoused definitions of caring. When there is no co ngruence between these ideals then we see a blaming discourse of the 'noncari ng nurse' put into pr actice. That is, ther e is an inability of nurses to care and a diminishment of st andards related to caring. Thus we see the opposite of caring: as neglect and ' not doing'. Within the profession of Nursing, nurses define caring from the perspective of constructs, themes, acts, behaviours an d outcomes of caring (B rown 1986; Leininger 1986; McNamara 1995; von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1995). The nature of th e nurse\u2014that is a caring nurse\u2014personifies the professional nurse, a su bjected position that is enacted in different ways within the profession (such as profession al nursing standards, position statements of nursing and codes for nursin g) (Australian Nursing Counc il Inc. 1993; 1995; 2001). Institutions that benefit from the 'caring nurse' or the 'profes sional nurse' are those 236 facilities where patients are cared for (for example, hospitals and clinics), and these facilities develop their job descriptions and ro le statements for the employment of nurses. Recent credentialling initiative s in Australia may br ing about advertisin g and marketing of these caring nurses to entice future business (patient admissions)\u2014a practice that may be especially relevant for the mark eting of private health care facilities, which is already seen in advertising in the USA. Credentiallin g measures an individual's performance against the relevant practice standards for nurses. It usu ally takes the form of a peer review process where the individual nurse presents evid ence for meeting a pr escribed level of competence (Griffiths and Biro 2001:188). It allows for a process whereby the discourse 'caring as doing' can be used to market high quality nursing and accountability. In this discourse, we see then that caring is measurab le and definable more than for the previous discourse discussed ('caring as being'). Ma rkers in the discourse make it visible and quantifiable, thereby contributing to the ma nagement discourse for nursing practice. While we can see this discourse intersecting with management, research also plays a significant part in the realisin g and forming of statements in this discourse. Statements drawn from nursing research highlight the differences between the nurse's perceptions and the patient's perceptions of care (von Essen and Sj \u00f6d\u00e9n 1991; 1995). Patients and nursing staff do not always agree over the im portance of certain nursing care behaviours (von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1995:266) or the ranking of effective care behaviours (Mangold 1991:135). Comparisons of patients' and nurses' perceptions of care reveal discrepancies between the two perspectives, although caring in this discourse h as been identified as therapeutic interventions\u2014comp etent clinical expertise (Mor se, Solberg et al. 1990:6). The focus of caring behaviours differs for nurses and patients. For e xample, patients focus on instrumental behaviours of nursing practice whereas nurses f ocus on involvement and the 237 affectual or expressive aspects of cari ng actions (Morse, Solberg et al. 1990:7). Furthermore, the perception of caring held by patients and nurs ing staff differs, depending on the nursin g specialty (as an illustration, me ntal health nursing or surgical nursing) and nursing behaviours (for example, affective type behavi ours versus physical based behaviours) (Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998:928). When patients view caring differently from nurses, this discussion can be seen as an influence in the statements of the discourse, as contributing to the defining of caring and to discussions about noncaring by nurses . Patient-satisfaction measurement studies provide results that are not consistent with care measures that nurses believe are important. Therefore, caring by nurses is sometimes incongruent with the expectations of patients. Yet the work of the nurse and caring are inextricably linked, and include actions and behaviours within what should be the nursing interventions f or assessed patient needs. Nurses explain the differences between pati ents' and nurses' perceptions of important caring behaviours from where they are situated within the discourse. Their aim for caring is quite different to the aims or requirement s of patients (Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998:928). Perceptions of important caring be haviours vary because nurses and patients perpetuate a variet y of ideas about caring that can be seen in the statements of this discourse. Consistently with the above, ther e appears to be an underlying 'need' for the position that all nurses must come to the same point and realise that when they utter the word 'caring', it should mean the same to all nurses. However, what can be seen thr ough the literature 238 are multiple ideas, different research method ologies, different perceptions about caring and different contexts of care in which research is taking place. C onsequently, many definitions, ideas and points of view surface ab out caring in nursing. Foucault deems these to be techniques and each defines a certain mode. Some of these techniques obey economics; others reflect coercive strategies which contribute to the functioning of this discourse (Rabinow 1984:183). Nurses are doing themselves an injustice by tryi ng to define caring; essentially a definition is redundant for nursing. Defining caring in nursing is not the an swer for advancing the profession of Nursing or for identifying th e knowledge required for nursing. Instead, because of the multiple diverse statements th at contribute to each of the discourses of caring, as presented in this thesis, it is not di fficult to realise that the position in which we as nurses individually situate ourselves in terms of our caring ideas, o pinions and values, is how we will view caring regardless of a defini tion espoused by nurse leaders or arising from research. Caring should be recognised as multifaceted, with many technologies that reconfigure caring knowledge (Rouse 1994:92). It is not a basic concept that can be elaborated or defined. Any deba te that labels caring in an es sentialist way is unproductive. Recognition of the discourses of caring as I have de scribed for nursing wi ll assist nurses to understand caring in knowledge construction, nursing practice and being in the world as a nurse, that is knowledge (as savoir) which shapes knowledge as empirical content (connaissance ). This leads to the discussion poi nt about who should be dete rmining what caring is, or how it should be thought about or interpre ted within this discourse. In the nursing literature, it is from the nurses' perspectiv e that most of the statements arise, and 239 therefore nurses assume the authority to speak. The platform from which the majority of statements emanate is by and large the academic institution, and this educational site gives credence to statements. Therefore, we have a discourse that is prim arily a contribution of statements by academic nurses, rather than from 'bedside' pract itioners of nursing. In Western nursing society, there is still a divide between those nurses w ho access further education and those who receive their qualification (as in Register ed Nurse in Australia) and continue as a practising 'bedside' register ed nurse. Therefore, we receive statements from nurses who have attained a particular level of education and knowledge and have been subjected to different ideas, culminat ing in new infl uences on, and changes in nursing. By contrast, when patients speak of caring, what is legi timised are the patients' voices from within projects. The projects are influenced by nurses undertaking the research, consequently patient statements an d ideas are influenced through the research process. A technique that is comp ounding the issue of patients' perc eptions of caring behaviours is the length of time that a patient spends in hospital. Caring has been critiqued from the viewpoint of a patient's stay. A short length of stay in hospit al affects patients' perceptions of caring (Parsons, Kee et al. 1993:1113). Ex posure to caring in such cases is limited purely by a time constraint and the available contact with the nurse. Thus, caring actions and behaviours for the patien t are minimised. Patients who spend a long period (or r e p e a t e d s t a y s ) o f t i m e i n h o s p i t a l a n d a r e cared for by nurses (for example, patients undergoing palliative care) eval uate caring differently to pa tients who remain for short hospital stays only (for example, care following pre-booked surgery). As Carruth, Steele et al. express: 240 Because many patients with cancer require repeated hospitalizations, they get to know the nurses on the unit. Thus, patients and family members have more opportunity to appr eciate caring attributes of individual nurses (1999:98). Time influences a patient's perception of ca ring and consequently the way nurses and patients speak and know of caring ultimately differ. As our heal th care system continues to evolve and Australian reso urces become even more limited, caring perceptions will subsequently change. Within the Australian health care system there is a daunting challe nge to manage the strain between financial goals and societal values, to ensure health care equity. The health care system is constrained by federal and state budgets, and pub lic health is compelled to look for inventive ways to provide services when financial resources a re lacking (Drevdahl 2002:162). Thus, systems devised to accommodate constraints (such as managed care and early discharge schemes) impact on caring technologies by nurses. These systems are a means to limit health care expenditure wh ile providing access to medical care and resources and they have a tremendous impact on what nurses do and how they do it (Irurita 1999:88; Dr evdahl 2002:166). Time for Caring The above systems influence the time nurses have for caring. Time is id entified as an important element for caring, one that affects how a nurse works , how work outcomes affect patients and how a nurse feels about hi s or her work. Nurses identify insufficient time to care as a significant barrier to providing care (Bo wers, Lauring et al. 2001:490), one that negatively impact s on nurses (Irurita 1999:89) who have internalised the discourse 'caring as doing'. Patients identified that some nurses give t he impression that 241 they do not have time to stop and talk with them, when they view caring as a process where nurses sit and talk with them. The most common reasons fo r nurses not talking with patients relates to their being too busy, as well as a lack of continuity of staff. Both of these reduce the time available for nurses to develop effective cari ng (Irurita 1999:91). In the context of their practice, nurses are subjected to surve illance by patients and their visitors, peers, managers, me dical practitioners and allied health workers. They are constantly viewed, and consequently an impo sition of constraints and obligations that exercise subtle forms of coercion is posit ioned on them by an infinitesimal power McHoul and Grace 1993:63; Armstrong 1997; Eckermann 1997). This power im plies a supervision of the processes inherent in caring rather than of the outcomes partitioning time, space and movemen t. Consequently, such domination allows for a more obedient caring nurse be ing formed (Rabinow 1984:181)\u2014 one who operates within the institutional and bureaucratic systems. This domination acts on the nurse, manipulating behaviours so that the caring nurse behaves with techniques, speed and efficiency as deter mined by institutional practi ces. According to Foucault (1977) ... discipline produces subjected and practiced bodies, \"docile\" bodies. Discip line increases the forces of th e body (in economic terms of utility) and diminishes these same forces (in political terms of obedience). In short, it diss ociates power from the body; on the one hand, it turns it into an \"aptitude,\" a \"capacity,\" which it seeks to increase; on th e other hand, it reverses th e course of th e energy, the power that might result from it , and turns it into a strict relation of subjection. If economic exploitation separates the force and the product of labour, let us say 242 that disciplinary co ercion establishes in the body the co nstricting link between an increased aptitude and an increased domination (Rabinow 1984:182). Form Foucault's perspective, caring nurses are vi ewed as subjected and \"practiced\" docile bodies (subjected, used, transformed, and impr oved) that operate automatically, through procedures that individua lly and collectively coerce (Rabinow 1984:181; Rudge 1997). These mechanisms then effect changes to caring practices through subtle forms of infinitesimal power. Systems within the health care system constrai n and contribute to high patient turnover of staff, reduced staffing levels , a lack of consistency and continuity in nurse and patient movements to different units or areas (as disc ussed in 'caring as being') (Irurita 1999:94). These are attributed to the lack of time availa ble for caring. Staffing levels and the mix of nursing staff relate to economic and resourcing factors, with these factors being identified as reasons for \"omissions of ca re\" (Irurita 1999:88), for the lack of health promotion and for the reduction of holistic caring (Bowers, Lauring et al. 2001:490). Several authors (Forrest 198 9; Williams 1998; Irurita 1999; Bowers, Lauring et al. 2001) demonstrate how too little available time affect s caring. They discuss strategies that nurses adopt when time constraints impact on their caring practices. Thes e strategies create a flow-on effect for other nurses who follow in the next shift, and have the effect of promoting nurse dissatisfaction with their role . As an example, mechanisms that nurses may use include: prioritising care and leaving interventions for the following shifts, selecting caring requir ements for the most demanding or vocal patients, as opposed to the quieter patient, and meeting wh at they would deem to be minimum caring requirements 243 per shift (Bowers, Lauring et al. 2001:487). With the current worldwide shortage of nurses (Fagin 2001; Young 2003; Buchan and Calman 2004), nurses are redefining their work responsibilities in order to keep up, catch up, and, through the use of time markers during a shift, to redefine responsibilities (Bowers, Lauring et al. 2001:487). No wonder it is so hard for nurses to speak about their caring pr actices if they constantly change their role requirements to meet changing needs and to c onform to managerial and system practices. Techniques of caring\u2014whether they be behaviours, actions or processes of caring\u2014serve as supports for what Foucault deems power and knowledge relations, investing and subjecting humans bodies by turning them into objects of caring (Rabinow 1984:176; Rouse 1994:95). Power ex ercised on the body is conceived as a stra tegy, where its effects can be attributed to techni ques, functions and procedures (Rabinow 1984:184). It is invested, transmitted and exerts pressure at all levels of society, producing knowledge (Rabinow 1984:174). In essence \"... power and knowle dge directly imply one another ...\" (Rabinow 1984:175). Thus, the processes and struggles that traverse and make up power-knowledge determine the forms and possible domains of know ledge (Foucault 1977:27; Rabinow 1984:175; McHoul and Gra ce 1993:59). Therefore, the technology of power is the principle of knowledge (Rabin ow 1984:171; McHoul and Grace 1993:71) and examples provided in this chapter identify mechanisms, techniques, institutional and bureaucratic practices that contribute to the formation of what becomes caring knowledge. Power relations give rise to a body of caring knowledge that extends and reinforces power through a process of subjectio n of the caring nurse (Rabin ow 1984:177). Caring belongs 244 to a political technology of the body where rese arch activities have identified behaviours, actions, outcomes and processes of caring as techniques. Noncaring by nurses has found its way into nursing texts from patients' voic es. What we see from research is the very materiality of caring as an in strument and rector of power. It is a technology of power over the body\u2014 one that is a tool for educ ationalists, clinicians, theoreticians and researchers for nursing. Quality Nursing is a political target. The concern about how to do more with less, and several mechanisms of economy and or der (i.e. government) have pe rmeated all facets of the social reality of nursing. Contemporary issues for nursing in Australia include workforce planning and strategies to address retention and recruitment issues (see \"reconnect program in NSW\"(NSW Health 2006), differ ent models of care, diagnostic related grouping and different levels of carers for nursin g. It is these types of categories that have become the \"...object of sys tematic, sustained political attention and intervention\" (Rabinow 1984:17). Co-dependent with the obj ect of the caring nurse as a mechanism of what Foucault terms \"biopower\" (Foucault 1977:21; Gast aldo 1997:114), procedures and strategies come together to forge the caring nurse as one who can be used, changed and modified (Rabinow 1984:17) and yet one who ha s indirectly been constructed through the exclusion of the noncaring nurse (Foucault 1988b:146). Time constraints, organisational factors and the redefinition of responsibilities contribute to an undermining of the vision of nursing as a professional endeavou r (Bassett 2002:9); that is, to provide high quality care (Irurita 1999:86; Thorstein sson 2002:32), which is 245 considered to be the right of all patients and the responsib ility of all nurs es (Idvall and Rooke 1998:512). Lauring et al. the idea of \"should do\" work for nurses: Nurses' definitions of quality are encapsulated by the notion of sh ould do work. Adequate staffing is that which allows nurses time to complet e not only the must do work, but the should do work as well (2001:490). Yet nursing is encountering critical questions regarding its relat ive contribution to health care. A critique by Spitzer is that The analysis of the state of nursin g suggests that the current clinical paradigm fails in consolidating the ec onomic and quality issues into the core of nursing, in representing the multiple paradoxes, and in understanding complexity inherent in health-related situation s. Furthermore, the current paradigm does not promote the solving of central professional problems and emerging dilemmas (1998:170). These professional problems and dilemmas in clude such issues as the inadequate world- wide supply of registered nurses (Fagin 20 01; Young 2003), compound ed by retention and recruitment issues for most health care faci lities and a change in staff mix (Idvall Lawler 1999:141; Mason increasing numbers of less-educated and less-skilled persons are caring for patients. This consequently affects th e role of the registered nurse wh o has internalised this discourse, 'caring as doing' so that it now encompasse s the role of superviso r of care requirements provided by less skilled and knowledgeable persons to meet patient n eeds. Staff mix can be interpreted as a criterion for quality care. The registered nurses per patient ratio is viewed as an indicator of qua lity. However, this ratio changes per health 246 care facility, type of facility (public versus private) an d within individual units (high dependency versus medi cal ward). Thus to identify staff mix as a measure of quality of care is extremely problematic, but it continue s to be used as a management and staffing tool in health care facilities aff ecting the caring practices of nurses. Inherent in this striving for quality is an increasing pressure on nurses to make their work more transparent, observable, explicit and costable in economic terms (Lawler 1999:141), thus contributing to the relevance and contin uation of this particular discourse more so than the previous one\u2014'caring as being'\u2014bec ause actions, behaviours and outcomes are more readily visible. In this same context, health care systems are facing increasing pressure (Spitzer 1998:167; Bolton, Aydi n et al. 2003:607; Yellen 2003:783) and consequently, interest in cost -containment and efficiency factors outweighs considerations for health care equity (Drevdahl 2002:16 6). Pressures include demands for cost- containment, rising expectations for quality , and patient-centred health care services. Health care systems are charac terised by competition, dema nds of high quality, serious economic constraints (S pitzer 1998:167) and cheaper nurs ing services (Lawler 1999:141). Economic and cost-containing measures are viewed negatively by n urses in the caring situation. That is not to say that these measures are not acknowledg ed as necessary, but they are seen to contribute toward nursing sta ff shortages, which in turn contribute to an extinguishing care (Bassett 2002:13; Buchan and Calman 2004). Spitzer believes that 247 Without a clear understanding of nursing's relative contribution and in need of choosing the most efficient and cost-contained work force , provider organisations asking the very same questions are not necessarily finding nurses to be the best care so lution in the radicall y changing health care system. The hard data on the in creasing numbers of nursing positions being absorbed, and the harsh comp etition among nurses and various allied health professionals (Pew Heal th Commission 1995), are indications of the acuity of the problem (1998:168) . At a conference that I attend ed in Perth (3/10/2002), Jean Watson voiced the opinion that nurses must reclaim caring for nurses. She alluded to the reduct ion of caring because of various health professionals who seek to ma ke caring their own, as sisted by changes to the boundaries and discipline of health profes sionals. Thus as a model of health, nurses should consider a caring-spiritual model. Th is idea is about keeping hold of nursing and not allowing tech nology to overcome the caring in nursing (Watson an d Foster 2003:363). Making visible the notion of healing using the framework of her early ideas about the carative factors (1979; 1985; 1988; 1994), Wats on presents a situation where nurses can utilise and hold onto caring modalities, such as 'touch to care' and to effect a healing situation for patients. Within the economic co nstraints of health ca re, expressed by the medical profession as one of cure, there is now competiti on from other allied health professionals (e.g. aromatherapi sts, massage therapists). Given the funding differences for allied health professionals as compared to nu rses, this claim for caring is slowly being legitimised in private practices, through bene fits associated with private health funding and fee payment for service. These changes affect quality caring practi ce and contribute to the reduction of the nursing role. Increased demands for the cont ainment of costs and 248 rising expectations for quality care are two forc es responsible for changes that are taking place (Spitzer 1998:168). Technology Technology, conceived variously as dehumanising and humanising or as an entity or force as opposed to nature (Barna rd and Sandelowski 2001:371) has attrib uted many 2001:38) to nursing over the period sele cted for this thesis. Running parallel with these changes, caring has been devalued by society (Reverby 1987b ) and has been upstaged by medicalised techno logy (Falk Raphael 1996:40). Technical nursing skills have been identified and linked to caring (Lea and Watson 19 96:15) and the nurse's role now includes the requirement that technical skills provided must be delivered competently in a caring manner (Shiber and Larson 1991:64). Nu rses identify with the responsibility for maintaining humane care in technological environments (Barnard and Sandelowski 2001:372) and with the controlling of the technolo gy (a role I closely relate to through my work as a perioperative nurse). However, in our dynamic society, technology is something nurses must work with, work around or wo rk hard to make compatible with caring practices (Barnard and Sandelowski 2001:368). Thus, when nurses speak of a loss of caring or of noncaring , they suggest that care must go beyond the technical (Mor se, Solberg et al. 1990:7; Ga vin 1997:695). Patients rate highly the technical aspects of caring in relation to nurses' work (Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998:927), especially in emergency depa rtments of health care systems, where the technological competency is ov erwhelming and frightening (Jenny and Logan 1996:352). The expectation by patients is that nurses are competent in this technology\u2014peers expect no less. 249 Conclusion The discourse 'caring as doing' is essentially made visible through the actions, behaviours, outcomes and processes of pr actice. It comprises many diverse statements that have arisen and developed as a result of theory, ed ucation, research and practice endeavours. This chapter has described the (Foucauldian) elements that determin e the discourse, identifying examples of specific statements that re late to constructs, themes, actions and behaviours as presente d in the nursing literature. The at tempt to define caring is the preoccupation of much of the literature for this discourse, and discu ssions about caring behaviours and actions form the basic core of nursing interventions. However, many nurses find it difficult to collectively de fine these actions and behaviours (Mangold 1991:134). Reflecting upon conver sations that I have had in the past with fello w nurses about caring in the perioperative context, and identifying where I am positioned within nursing and this discourse, assi sts me to understand why we would never collectively agree about caring. The discourse is influenced by technologies, mech anisms, institutional practices, et cetera and therefore caring as spoken, actioned and thought about by one nurse may not necessarily be the same caring that is in the mindset of another. The nurses with whom I spoke about caring , who eventually infl uenced me to work through this study, could discuss some statements about caring according to their practice area, but could not readily transfer these idea s to my role as a perioperative nurse. The challenge is for nurses to forgo the futile attem pts to define caring an d to come to realise the multifaceted nature of caring for nursing and the statements that contribute to this discourse\u2014caring as doing. 250 This discourse impacts significantly on nurs ing, not only how we speak about caring but also our perceptions and the way we use caring for nursing. Understanding caring from within this discourse opens the door for an examination of nursing p ractice. A starting point would be the examination of how caring at the unit or ward level is viewed (by all persons involved)\u2014that is, the statements persons generate within their context of nursing practice, before quality and management issues are formula ted. I started this chapter with an anecdote draw n from my context of practice, demonstrating caring as doing via the case of Mrs Jones. The anecdote contributes a story of nursing practice and although it also highlights as pects of caring from the perspective of the previous discourse, 'caring as being', it wa s the caring behaviours and actions for Mrs Jones that I focused on for elaborating th is discourse. Many of these actions and behaviours undertaken are seco nd nature for the experien ced nurse and fo r some nurses may not even be articulated as forms of caring. Reflecting on my practice from the perspective of caring has allo wed me to identify the statem ents embedded in practice. Furthermore, I also acknowledged that caring is not confined to the role of one nurse. Caring in the perioperative context should be vi ewed as a segment of time associated with the admission for the patient. Caring, from t he perioperative perspect ive, dovetails with caring that patien ts receive from nurses wh o precede and follow this context of practice. The discourse 'caring as doing' can be descri bed according to a vast array of literature, but there is little written fr om the context of perioperative caring. Thus, understanding the discourses of caring from within different contexts will remain an issue for some time. On another note, technicians are entering the arena of perioperative care, and there is a 251 push from medical officers who claim the tech nicians under their control and locate them within the medical hierarchy in health care facilities (as opposed to nursing). Therefore the standards and qu ality of caring that guide nursing are now different for the patient. My experience of caring for patients while pe rforming the role of an aesthetic nurse is one where nurses care for patients, as well as for the te chnology associated with the needs of the patient, whereas I see the technicians placing machinery ahead of patients. Thus the care of technology and equipment becomes th eir priority. For example, as a nurse, in order to care for my patient, I escort my pa tients with the anaesthetist to the Post- Anaesthetic Care Unit. I see th e technicians leave the anaesthe tist to take the patient to the unit and remain in the empty theatre to clean and care for the machinery. As a nurse, after I have ca red for my patient, I subsequent ly attend to the machinery on return from handover of the patient. While t hese are subtle difference s in practice and are probably invisible to most, caring fo r patients remains the focus for nurses. 252 Chapter 5: Cari ng as Knowing THE THIRD DISCOURSE IN THE ARCHIVE OF CARING FOR NURSING: CARING AS KNOWING Caring for a patient is inextricably linked with competence an d the application of knowledge into practice that is bounded by policies, procedures, knowl edge and legalities. During a field visit to a large city hospital operating theatr e for the purpose of observing nursing practice, I made several observations where I believed that caring for the patient can be linked to the policies, procedures and standards that are in place in the operating theatre. As an everyday occurrence, possibly many of these practices would go unnoticed as caring for patients. However if we examine them in the negative, that is, if they are not carried out, then caring for a patient would be in question. To illustrate, a brief glimpse into some of these practices that culm inate in care for the patient can be gleaned from the following two exampl es. Firstly, the policy that determines the wearing of operating theatre attire and t he associated procedure that details how nurses entering the suite should maintain compliance to this policy is one that was clearly on view in the female nurse change room. The correct wearing of attire into the operating theatre is a requirement that ensures that patients ar e not exposed to microorganisms that are potentially harmful (for exampl e, tuberculosis spores that ca n be found on the soles of shoes) and therefore must be kept out of t he perioperative environment. The procedure outlining the correct removal of scrub attire is another subset of this policy and works to ensure that patients are protected from cros s infection of microorganisms from another patient or from a previous pa tient in the operating theatre. A second observation relates to the procedure that is undertaken as a nursing event in the case of handling accountable items, such as swabs, sponges and instruments. Whilst this again may be 253 viewed as an ordinary proced ure in the operating theatre fo r nurses, this procedure also translates to caring as undertaken by scrub and scout nurses for thei r patient. Knowledge associated with legal issues, standards of pr actice, competence in performing the counts (for example, as prescribed and in the ma nner determined) and an integration of the patient needs, all translate to caring for th e patient through the ap plication and synthesis of knowledge, adherence to policies and procedures and the maintenance of standards. Consequently, failure to comply with these policies can be justly equated with a lack of duty of care by th e nurse and subjected to inquiry by peers and nursing boards. The above anecdote illustrates ju st two procedures that are ev eryday actions performed by the nurse within the context of the perioperative environment. They are recognised by perioperative nurses as standards of nursing practice and are routine practices expected of nurses in the perioperative context. In my ex periences, of conversations with nurses, they do not equate these routine practices with caring for patients. How ever, an absence of them would be subjected to inquiry and their ca ring ability would be called into question. Caring is linked with knowledge, standard s, legalities, policies and procedures and consequently, much of the work of the perioperative nurse may have become 'ordinary' (see Taylor (1994) for ideas about the ordinarine ss of nursing) and when nurses consider caring, these ordinary procedures are no longer discussed as ca ring but comprise practices. Introduction The immediate preceding two chapters have of fered two of the discourses ('caring as being' and 'caring as doing') that contribute to what I have termed, 'An Archive of Caring for Nursing'. I now turn to my third and fina l discourse that makes up this Archive of Caring, aptly labelled 'caring as knowing'. Th e discourse was already evident in the nursing literature in the early to mid 1970s and is now made up of a plethora of statements that 254 link caring and knowledge. Idea s within this discourse have worked their way through the literature, following work by such influent ial authors as Carper (1978), Watson (1979), Leininger (1981b), Swanson-Kauffman (1986) an d the often-cited work of Patricia Benner (1984), who explored the practi ce of the nurse from novice to expert nurse. Firstly, I provide an archaeological description of the discourse by elaborating two essential elements arising from the statements and discursive formation (Fo ucault 1972), which confirms that 'caring as knowing' exists. Following this description, I take time to consider the discourse from two perspectives. Both of these perspectives arise from the discourse, and translate meaning and relevance to the discours e. The first discussion point is the highly relevant and topical perspectiv e of the profession of nursing, which will enable the reader to gain an understanding of how the profession o f nursing works to shape caring in the practice of nursing. Following on, the final discussion section considers this discourse within the contex t of the Foucauldian concepts power and knowledge, particularly conc entrating on mechanisms of power and disciplinary power. Examples will be drawn from the description of the discourse to illu strate how these mechanisms are working. Description of Discourse: Two Elements Element 1). Cari ng for Nursing As mentioned earlier, Foucault views that el ements are formed in a discursive practice which may comprise objects, concepts, theore tical choices, practices, enunciations or notions (1972:182). Formulating these elements are statements of the discourse that are governed by the rules of formation (1972:16 2) (these may include institutions, political events, economic practices and other processes) operating du ring the development of the discourse. I now turn to discuss the element, c a r i n g f o r n u r s i n g , a s i t a r i s e s i n t h e discourse from the perspecti ve of statements, objects , concepts and things. 255 Specifically, caring has been identified as the knowledge base for nursing (Leininger 1981a; Watson 1985; Watson 1994) and there is mu ch discussion in the nu rsing literature to favour this claim (Rodgers 1989). For those nurses who identify and support caring as the knowledge base for nursing, several key views are illustrative of this discourse. Phrases such as \"Caring is the essence of nursing\" (Leininger in Huch 1995:38; Sadler 2003) and the claim that caring is the overall concept and the central dominant domain of nursing (Morrison 1991:4) feature prominently. Other ideas include that the prime aim of nursing is to care for patients (Hogg 1994 :465) and that cari ng is viewed as an \"... essential component of nursing, [however] nursing in the full sense cannot be separated from caring\" (Euswas 1993:323). In an earlier chapter, I discussed the di scourse 'caring as being', and I identified that essence contribute d to that discourse from the perspective of the identity and presence of the nurse, in part icular from a perspective of being. It is possible for statements to traverse more than one discourse, t o intersect and overlap and also to belong to more than one element within a discourse (Fouca ult 1972:160); thus, statements undergo regular modification. This formation and tran sformation of statements contributes to the formation of the discourse. In th is discourse under discussion, when nurses express this notion of essence, they use it in a way that shows that there is a strong drive for owning cari ng as the body of kn owledge for nursing and the phrase\u2014caring as the essence of nursin g\u2014has become an oft repeated and iconic phrase in nursing across the world. Nurses speak of nursing in a way that illustrates an ownershi p of caring (Morse, Bottorff et al. 1992:72) from th e viewpoint of the ar t of nursing (Benner 1995) or as it was expressed for 256 the 37th Biennial Convention for the Honor So ciety of Nursing (Sigma Theta Tau International); 'The HeArt of Nursing' (Wendler 2002). The art of nursing is depicted as the human skill of caring and is described as a core activity of nursing (Tanner 1990a:71; Clifford 1995:38), one that is a necessary condition for quality care (Janhonen 1993:164). The art of nursing encompasses creative, indi vidualised caring fo r patients (Gendron 1994) and reflects the individuality of a nurse's practice and the ability a nurse demonstrates when working within constraints. At the disciplinary leve l, a model of caring calls for art (Watson 2003) to be reflected in nursing practice; an art that is considered to be a philosophical foundation fo r nursing, embracing and inte rsecting other dimensions and disciplines (for example, spiritua lity, the humanities and medicine). Contrasting with the notion of art is the idea of a caring science (Watson 1979; Dunlop 1986; Watson 2003), which in some way legi timises nursing by the authority of science (Benner and Wrubel 1989:402). Science as a body of knowledge is acquired through observation (Barker, Reynolds et al. 1995:388) . For nursing to capture this notion of a science of caring, as in the traditional sense (t hat is, from the perspective of the positivist paradigm) (Gavin 1997:695), th is capturing involves the use of validating mechanisms such as measurement tools and ways of proving scientific knowledge. When nurses use definitions from this scientific perspective to validate caring as nursing scientific knowledge we see an intersection of discours es (science and caring ) (Traynor 1996:1160) which can be illustrated by di alogues between care and cure (van Maanen 1990:915). Within the framework of science, Jean Wats on presents a model of caring as a human science (1979; 1985; 2003) that includes scientific values and principles related to patient care (Raatikainen 1989:95; Keogh 1997:302). Th e term 'human science' as expressed by 257 Watson (1995), arises from the philosopher Wilheim Dilthey, who challe nged the positivist perspective for generating k nowledge (Mitchell and Cody 1992:54). Watson (1999a) continues to use this term today to elaborate her ideas, as is evident in her publications titled: Nursing: Human Science and Huma n Care. A Theory of Nursing . She avoids arguments concerned with the positivist idea s of science through th e adoption of the term 'human science of caring' and her work is one that \"...seeks to develop caring as an ontological and theoretical-philosophical-e thical framework\" for nursing (Watson 2003:10). Working from the perspective that nurses claim that they own car ing, then this element 'caring for nursing' is influenced by several institutio ns and disciplines that construct 'caring as knowing'. Feminism (Cook an d Fonow 1990; Millen 1997; Leight 2002) for example, has been an important influence on the formation of th e discourse. One such feminist, Carol Gilligan (198 2), an often-cited source about women's development (Knowlden 1991:201), contributed signific antly to the knowle dge development of understanding women when previous research had focused on men. She claimed that care and caring in women's development is important because it shapes their behaviour. Later work by Virginia Knowlden, on nurse caring as constructed know ledge, related to women's views of reality. She asserts that \"Nurse-p racticed caring is knowledge construed from personal experiences in nurse education and practice \" (1991:201). These authors' views make the claim of caring knowledge fo r females and point to difference in the development of understandin g between men and women. Wo men's ways of knowing can be seen to be actioned through processes such as storytelling, which is used as a means for establishing truth in the nursing literature and is therefore in contrast to men's experiences of truth as portrayed by scientific knowle dge. Women's voices reveal the contextual, 258 phenomena-centred knowledge th at focuses on personal ex periences (Leight 2002:109), thus forging a link between the experiences of women, the art of nursing and the aesthetic ways of knowing as identified by Carper (1978:44) (Sorrell 1994:61). Discussions that reflect gender differenc es in knowledge development and expression are influences in the formation of this discourse even though they are open to scrutiny from several philosophical viewpoints. Discourse attributed to theoretical developments and claims that car ing is the knowledge base for nursing arise from the ongoing wo rk of nurse theorists (such as Watson, Leininger, Benner and Swanso n) who have generated many ideas that link caring to nursing and consequently claim caring as the special knowledge for nursing (Bottorff 1991; Olson 1993). These claims are more overtl y seen in the literatu re coming out of the United States of America and can be traced to the professi onalisation of nursing around the world. For example, ideas generated by Madeleine Leininger regarding cultural care and Jean Watson's ideas in regard to caring scie nce, are especially evident. To illustrate: Contemporary nurse leaders have rallied around the idea of caring, claiming this is the essence of nursing and thus the field' s \"special knowledge\". Consistent with professionalisation theory, identifying, de veloping, and successfully laying claim to special knowledge is viewed as crucial to establishing nursing as a full-fledged profession (Olson 1993:68). One of the most consistent strategies to achieve professionalisa tion in nursing has been the attempt to acquire a unique knowledge base. The possession of such knowledge is seen as one of the essentia l traits of a true professi on (Olson 1993:72-72; Keogh 1997); thus, those writers who claim th at caring is the knowledge of nursing categorise nursing immediately as a profession, one that affords status, a professional ro le and an identity. 259 This value that caring is important for the pr ofession is supported by Allmark's statement. That is: If one cares about something one sees it intellectually as of value, c oncern or interest to you, one sees some good in it (1998:467). The formation of the discourse\u2014'caring as knowing'\u2014has not been easy, and this discourse continues to devel op (for example, Watson's recent work on her theory of caring shows evidence of changes to the statem ents (enunciations) that have meaning in the discourse (Watson 1999b; 2002a; 2003)). Caring is still not ac cepted as the special knowledge for nursing by all nurses. We can co unt as evidence the continuing debate in nursing about what the definition of caring for nursing should be (Huch 1995) and the debate about whether nursing is or is not a profession (Olson 1993; Keogh 1997; Chiarella 2002). A formal debate about caring occurred in 1993. This debate involved five nursing theorists at a nursing conference in Toronto, Canada (Huch 1995). Tr anscripts from this session signposted that nurse leaders (theorists) individua lly proclaim different ideas about what constitutes the knowledge base for nursing and not all nurses agree that caring is the special knowledge for nursing. In addition, we can include as ev idence developments associated with the metaparadigm of nursing (see Chapter 1 page 40 for a discussion of the metaparadigm of nursing) where caring has not been included as one of the concepts11 within this framework and ther efore has not been elaborated as a proposition overtly in many theoretical de velopments in nursing. An additional set of evidence arises from th e different theories developed for nursing. The majority of these theo ries do not support the idea that caring is the special knowledge base for nursing. How ever, despite these 11 The concepts of the metaparadigm of nursing are nursing, env ironment, person, health. Fawcett, J. (1989). Analysis and Evaluation of Conceptual Models of Nursing . Philadelphia, F.A. Davis Company. 260 denials of caring as nursing's special knowledg e, the claim for caring as the knowledge for nursing continues (Bottorff 1991; Watson 1999a; 1999b; 2003 ). The non discursive practice of research has contribu ted to the formation of this discourse. When nurses use research to support the knowledge developm ent of caring for nursing, nursing is viewed as a discip line of knowledge and as a profession (Boykin, Parker et al. 1994:159; Keogh 1997:302). Nurse researcher s have used various methodologies and paradigms and have certainly contributed to the identification of carin g as knowledge for nursing through a process of legitimising caring as an area of scientific inquiry or as a way of knowing (Carper 1978). Diffe rent research paradigms (for example, critical inquiry, qualitative and quantitative approaches to research) give suppor t to the development of this body of knowledge rela ted to caring (Bottorff 1991; Ira 1992; Pearson 1992; Dyson 1996; Lea, Watson et al. 1998; Watson 2002a). The motivation for nurses to continue this development using research has been influenced by directives espoused by ca ring theorists (Leininger 1981b; Watson 1990a) and from recommendations as serted by nurses following their research activities. To illustra te, Leininger (1984) is quoted by Kyle as stating that ... nurses must collectively value care , and continue to expand knowledge in this area through research, in orde r that care will 'prevail as the essence of nursing' (Kyle 1995:506). The support for research into caring can be trac ed to the many initiatives that have been undertaken by Jean Watson (nurse leader an d theorist), her staff, associates and the students under her leadership at The Universi ty of Colorado. Arising from the initiatives of these and other researchers are recommendations and identification of areas for further research. Thus, continuations of research acti vities have subsequently contributed to the 261 expansion of knowledge and ideas and have translated into the formation of this discourse\u2014'caring as knowing'. In describing this first element 'caring for nursing', I have shown th at statements make it obvious for some nurses that caring is the knowledge base for nurs ing, and a concept owned by nurses. That is, there are several in stitutions that have supported the formation of the discourse, as evidenced through the generation of particular statements. Several examples of these institutions have been iden tified and these includ e; the institution of research in nursing and academia, and the disc ourses of nursing and feminism. I now turn to the second element identified from the nu rsing literature, labell ed 'caring knowledge', and I shall discuss this elemen t under the headings of imparting knowledge, theories, research, and publication processes; again emphasising the discursive formations in operation to enable the formation of 'caring as knowing'. Element 2). Caring Knowledge Imparting Caring Knowledge Nurses recognise that caring is important, but also that it requires nurturing and fostering. In the nursing literature, we see caring pres ented as a concept in curriculum development (Bevis and Watson 1989), from the perspective of modelling an d for teaching at the unit or subject level (Reilly an d Oermann 1992; 2000). The imparting of caring knowledge is significantly represented in the literature through the movements associated w ith what has been termed the 'curriculum revolution'. A resoluti on on caring in nursing education was passed by the National League for Nursing (NLN) in 1990 in the Un ited States (Dillon and Stines 1996:113). This organisation operat es in a similar way to the State Nurses 262 Registration Boards in Australi a\u2014that is, the regulation of practice and the approval of educational programmes. For the first time in nursing history, a resolution on caring required that nursing educati on recognise caring as a valu e (Beck 1993:28) and undertake a transformation of the nursing education process (Wilson, Siler et al. 1993:461). Caring was actually one of three conversations\u2014cari ng, dialogue and practice\u2014that were central to the curriculum revolution (Diekelmann 1 990:300). Consequently , in the American context of nursing, caring was to be nurtured and fostered as a conc ept essential for nursing education and the imparting of caring knowledge. In other parts of the world, caring was also included in nursing curricula (Hughes 1992 ; Beck 1993; Wilkes and Wallis 1993; Clifford 1995; Hughes 1995; Hans on and Smith 1996; Sumsion 2000) but on examining the literature, it is not as clearl y identifiable that a national approach for incorporating caring in nursing occurred in these countries as had o perated in the United States of America. Following the resolutions concerning the cu rriculum revolution and caring by the National League for Nursing, a change was evid ent, from the use of the term 'training' (as was used to describe past hospital nursing programs) to the use of t he word 'education' as now professed in nursing academic institutio ns. The idea of education as opposed to training emphasises the shift away from the Tylerian Curriculu m Framework developed by Ralph Tyler in 1949 (Bevis and Watson 1989:2). This dialogue is evident in several countries including Australia, where the word 'training' has been us ed less and less in favour of the word 'education' of nurses. My experiences are tha t the use of the statement, 'the training of nurses' has now been replaced by the phra se that 'nurses are educated rather than trained' and I am aware that ov er the years, within my academic teaching responsibilities, I have made concer ted efforts to use this phrase. 263 The approach by nursing to use the word 'edu cation' rather than 't raining' is in direct contrast to political movements op erating here in Australia. That is, it is in co ntrast to the institutional and educational reforms that have impacted on the tertiary sector of education. Governmental Departments (such as the former Depart ment of Education, Employment and Training) have implemente d the use of compet ency standards for professions, which allows for an articu lation of knowledge be tween members of a professional group. Furthermore, the recent reviews of nursing in Australia strongly recommend articulation measures that su pport educational processes for nurses (Department of Education Science and Training 2002d). Within this context, training is the approach taken in governmental docume nts. However, the nursing literature and the recent reviews into nurs ing in Australia continue to recognise and use the word education. This preference for use of the word educat ion as opposed to training has been an influential development for nursing in regard to professional identity and in meeting the criterion of education th at is required for a profession. (It is these professional issues that I will take up later in the di scussion section of this chapter as they dr aw out many of the concepts, thoughts, beliefs and ideas associated with 'caring as knowing'). Caring knowledge can be seen to exist in the methods used for teaching and learning about caring, and these are varied and complex. In curriculum development, caring can be seen to be a component of the legitimate, ill egitimate and hidden curriculum processes. As a part of the legitimate curriculum process, caring is sanctioned b y the registering authority (such as the NSW Nurses Registration Board). In this form, caring is an overt component of the curriculum and is seen translated, for exampl e, into units of study or into key concepts that are es sential for the teachi ng-learning process. In this format, 264 caring is seen as required and necessary and is formally recognised as a part of the curriculum process. To remo ve a formally approved co mponent in the curriculum document requires the educational institution to make application to nurse registering authorities for approval (i.e. NS W Nurses and Midwives Board). When caring contributes to the illegitim ate curriculum process (as in, a basic understanding that may be difficult to operation alise) it can be seen for example, to be evident within the curriculum implementation phase, but may not be a concept that is given space in formal units of study. In this format it may be included as a part of a session but does not necessarily become th e focus of the session . An example is the teaching of nursing theories, where the objectives are formulate d to require the student to understand nursing theories; within this se ssion, caring theories would be used as illustrators of theories of nursin g. Caring is not necessarily ov ertly taught in all schools or faculties of nursing, but it may be implicit within a subject such as n ursing therapeutics, where nursing care is incorporated into the session (see for examp le, the Bachelor of Nursing Accredited Course Document November 2001 , for the School of Nursing, Family & Community Health at the University of Western Sydney). Caring is not a mandated element of the curriculum process governing nursing curricul a in Australia, and therefore is not an essential component, but standards and codes as sociated with practice must be evident in some way within the formal curricular docu ments, and it is within these codes and standards that ca ring can be iden tified (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 1993; 1995; 2001). When considered as a part of the hidden curricu lum, caring can be seen to play out in the relationship between students, teachers and other nurses, which they encounter during their educational process (Bevis and Watson 1989; Dillon and Stin es 1996). As an 265 illustration, the hidden curriculu m process is at work in the clinical practice arena when students observe the caring practices performed by their role models during their clinical practicum. Teaching students how to think and feel like nurses, the teacher-st udent relationships and the various ways that students may learn caring, are also illu strations that highlight some of these hidden components in a nursin g curriculum (Bevis and Watson 1991; Dillon and Stines 1996; Hanson and Smith 1996). Important elements for teaching caring identified in the literature include \"The way faculty teach, the priorities they set, the methods they use, and th e subtle messages of how to think and act like nurses ...\" (Dillon and Stines 1996:114). In addition, the re are suggestions that caring should be a crucial el ement, introduced into the first year of a nursing education program (Maltby, Drury et al. 1995:44) and this can then be carried as a thread throughout the curriculum (Bevis and Watson 1989). In other discussions, the teaching of caring is presented as a translat ion of theory into practice within a curriculum (Bevis and Watson 1989; Allan 1996). No ag reed upon approach is evident and these ideas emphasise the different opportunities for how caring could and h as been incorporated as part of the education process for nurses. Learning about caring in nursing begins wi th students knowing that they are cared for (Hanson and Smith 1996:106). To illustrate, th e publication Toward a Caring Curriculum: A New Pedagogy for Nursing (Bevis and Watson 1989) offered for curriculum development, focuses on relationships rather than content. The aim of this curriculum idea was to create a new curriculum-development paradigm for nursing education, des igned to enable nursing graduates to be more caring. These authors claim that 266 In an existential sense, nursing's awareness and commitment to huma n caring and its responsibilities help us to awaken to our own knowledge and our own unique service to society. Therefore, the deve lopment of anticipatory teaching and practice of expert human caring knowledg e, knowledge that is values driven and placed in philosophical and moral context, calls for alternative educat ional curricular pathways (Bevis and Watson 1989:43). The authors draw on the work of Noddings (1988 February) and the concept of moral education, an education pr ocess that involves modellin g, dialogue, practice and confirmation (also identified as part of the cu rricular change process, as determined by the National League for Nurses, as mentioned earlier). From this educational perspective, curriculum implementation must include th e human dimensions of experiences and needs, not just behaviours, skills and kn owledge (Watson 1989:55) ; this again adds emphasis to the earlier discussio n issue\u2014whether nurses are educated rather than trained. Drawing again on the American curricular ch ange process and the curriculum revolution phenomenon of the 1990s, the go al arising from the passing of a resolution on caring in nursing education was to ensu re \"... support and enhancement of a climate in which faculty care for students and each other and students care for their peers\" (Dillon and Stines 1996:113). Since this resolution, re search studies have contributed to the development of this issue for nu rsing, which appears to have been taken up by nurses in the United States of America (Hanson and Smit h 1996; Simonson 1996). In my experiences here in Aust ralia, a climate that supports nurses caring for each other does not seem to be this evident as in the American perspe ctive. One phrase that punctuated conversation in my past practice endeavours is that 'nurses eat their young', 267 implying a lack of caring for the newly grad uated nurse in the hospital social setting. Further, my involvement in social justice disc ussions concerning issue s for nurses, such as horizontal violence, provides an example of a la ck of caring for fellow nurses. This issue is now considered relevant to the problems a ssociated with nurse retention (Linegar May 2003:15) and perhaps the recruitm ent of nurses back into nurs ing positions. I believe this difference between my experiences and the liter ature arising from the American context is partly due to the proactive stance that has been taken by nurse academics, leaders and nursing bodies in the United States of America, to ensure that caring is overt in their teachings and practice and to ensure that it forms a foundation for all nurses. This same approach has not been undertaken here in Australia, although caring can be seen as a component of the fo rmal codes and standards developed by nurses for nursing practice. However, a national approach similar to that taken by the National League for Nursing has not occurred in Australia (note that Nursing Registra tion Boards in Australia are State based and they are no t national nursing organisations, although the Australian Nursing Council has been active in promot ing these standards and codes which validate nursing) (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 1993; 1995; 2001). The standards and codes form guidelines for nursing practice and for learning. Recall the ane cdote at the beginning of this chapter. In this anec dote, I provided two examples from practice that identify standards which are implicit within policies an d procedures and can be specifically related to the domain \"Profession and Ethical Practice\" as directed in the ANCI National Competency Standards for the Registered Nurse (2 001; Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council 2005) . 268 Importantly, the curriculum revolution phenomenon acknowledged th at caring for the student and being cared for during the process of learning was recognised as essential for nurses to become effective care-givers (Hanson and Smith 1996:105). The quality of staff interactions with students, the existence of healthy interperso nal environments for learning, the commitment to valu es congruent with caring, were seen as important for the teaching of caring. Historically , those who enter the caring pr ofessions express a desire to be caring (for example, as the students ex pressed in the anecdote for the discourse \u2014 'caring as being') and role mo delling of these behaviours woul d nominally be an expected criterion of nursing school members. A typica l example of the belief in caring arising from school staff and st udent interaction comes from Dillon and Stines: ... faculty members taking time to meet the needs of the individual student, sharing of self in terms of emotion and experience, attentive listening with a non-judg mental attitude, concern for the individual's well- being, and treating the student wi th respect and equality (1996:116). We see here that a climate for caring is id entified as one where staff acknowledge and actively respond to the feelings that are expe rienced by students (stress and anxiety) where they provide opportunities for students to ex press their concerns in a safe environment, and where the needs of the student are a committed priority (Hughes 1992:63). Turning now to the teaching of caring in nursing, there are different examples presented about how nurses are taught caring. While it is viewed as fundamental to nursing, caring is considered to be difficult to teach (Allan 1 996:42). Some claim that caring is a concept that can be learned but not taught and that wh ile learning takes pla ce formally or through exposure, caring is learned through interaction wi th others (Hughes 1992:60). For other authors, and as mentioned earlier, caring is a theme taught through the curriculum, is 269 incorporated as a concurrent unit, or is ela borated as a specific unit (for example, those units that address caring theories ) (Maltby, Drury et al. 1995:45). In other examples, care studies were used that contributed to the development of caring knowledge, or there was the sh aring of stories told by stud ents, which relived the caring relationship and allowed the st udents to be the role models of caring (Beck 1993:32). Continuing with examples, another approach refl ects the use of entire units (or subjects) to explore issues and philosophi es of caring from several pe rspectives. (See for example, the teaching/learning opportunities on the web site for Dr Jean Wat son, www.uchsc.edu/ctrsinst/chc/index.htm and GHS 9842/H.M Graduate Nursing Studies 1: Caring in Nursing, Monash Un iversity, Australia). Some of these units (subjects) have focused on theories of caring which have been used to examine and t o consolidate learning about caring and nursing (Allan 1996:44). There are no agreed upon methods how caring should be taught or learned, an d many examples illustrate different practices being conducted. These of course are cont extualised by the curriculum processes in operation; the type of institut ions and their philosophy, mission and goals; the educational background of the teachers and students, to name some of the discursive practices occurring. In elaborating this discursive formation furthe r, caring is presented from the educator's perspective in the nursing literature and again we can see influences (such as education, practice area of nursing) impacting on and influencing their teachi ng practices. This perspective provides evidence of how teachers of nursin g understand and learn about caring and how their conceptualisation of cari ng is transmitted to students. Paterson and 270 Crawford (1994) assert that in formation about this perspective is lacking in nursing, and in support they cite Beck (1991) who alleges that If teacher competence is essential to the transmission of caring to students, nurse educators need a body of k nowledge regarding the teaching of caring based on the results of research rather than on the personal caring philosophy of the teacher (Beck in Paterson and Crawford 1994:170). There is evidence of this research no w being established (Hanson and Smith 1996; Simonson 1996) as well as rese arch that confirms conceptua lisations of caring (Rodgers 1989; Solberg et al. 1990; Morse, Miles et al. 1994; Le a and Watson 1996). In this discussion about the discourse 'car ing as knowing' I have discussed that the 'imparting of caring' is one such object that contributes to this second element\u2014caring knowledge. The shaping of the discourse results from the discursive formation associated with the educational practices of nurses ( teaching, learning philo sophy) and has been extended through developments associated with curriculum design and implementation (legitimate, illegitimate and hidden curricula ). Climates associated with education are a component of this discourse, with resear ch progressing ideas and thoughts. From a different perspective, we can see the formatio n of this discourse influenced by such institutional practices as policies, processes and standards associated with nursing. To elaborate this element further I now turn to discuss examples of practices (practices as discussed by Foucault, 1972:138) that have co ntributed to the shaping of the discourse (discursive formations) under the label 'devel opment and support of caring knowledge'. Development and Support of Caring Knowledge As mentioned above, practices contributed to the shaping of thi s discourse, and one such practice involves the processes associated with publication. These processes limit the 271 nature of the discourse by the very na ture of constraints imposed on authors. Requirements stipulated for nu rse authors by publishers of refereed journals perpetuate the drawing of conclusions about caring. Jour nal publication processes require a standard format for manuscripts. Ther efore, manuscripts are limited by word length, heading suggestions, formats for tables and figures and the number of references. Part of this format usually requests a liter ature review and to ensure th at the writer can meet the objectives for their paper, a limited amount of information only can be dedicated to the literature section. This process of formulatin g words, ideas, inform ation or statements becomes the process of writing for publication, and consequently adds to the generation of knowledge for caring, but it is also a mechan ism for limiting what is said in a discourse. Regardless of this mechanism, to date, the statements generated about caring are comprehensive both conceptually and in vo lume, and it is not uncommon to see only selected ideas about caring being pursue d in each manuscript published. A point to consider that emerge s in this publication practice is related to who can speak within the discourse and who has the ability to enter into the discours e as an author. High profile nurses such as Made leine Leininger and Jean Wats on are drawcards for journal editors and the number of publications that have been developed by these authors on caring is vast. These types of publications ha ve contributed to the generation of material that supports the conceptual and theoretical standpoints of these au thors on caring, which then become a set of statements that are adopted and continued by other authors in a process of citation (another re quirement by editors of journals and academic institutions). Author citations in the caring literature ar e time located from about the 1980s forward, with earlier refere nces recited (as secondary sources) as a result of reading about the work in another document. These processes suppor t the development of the nursing journal 272 market and the accessibility of material. Accessibility to the ideas presen ted in the nursing literature has increased with recent advan ces in technology (such as changes in the availability of on-line full tex t documents, library subscri ptions, computer literature searching, hypertext developments and document delivery servi ces), which in the future will contribute to an even more complete set of statements av ailable for analysis of this discourse, and to the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'. Publication processes therefore support the proliferation of statements ab out caring. However, accessibility to this information does have a limiting effect, due in part to the uptake of statements through the publication processes. Yet it is clearly ev ident that the generation of caring knowledge has come about through the dispersal and elab oration of information and as a result of applying ideas into practice. The application of ideas into practice can be seen in the literature reviews that focus on caring (see for example, Morse at al 1991; Gaut 1994; Kyle 1995 ; Lea & Watson 1996), and these reviews contribute to and support the knowledge base of caring. What is manifest in these reviews is that caring is presented according to obj ectives defined by the writer and the use of selected quotes and discussions about caring that su pport the aims of the paper being pres ented (i.e. their focus) . Not all the information that is available about caring is ever presented together in the one paper, and in man y instances only certain ideas of caring are focused on, wherea s other issues are not mentioned. Examples are a focus on the ethical nature of caring (Fry 1989); the practical elements of caring (Gaut 1986); past research related to caring (Greenhalg h, Vanhanen et al. 1998) and identified theories of caring (Knowlden 1998) . Literature reviews, which are usually found at the beginning of nursing journal articles, perpetuate earlier statem ents from available 273 literature, which are then reformulated by the author into a new version. Therefore, work by early writers (such as Wolf (1986) and Wats on (1979; 1985) is revi sited many times by contemporary nurse writers and is given status ov er time. As an example, this activity has contributed to the debate in nursing about wh ether caring is the knowledge for nursing or not, to the lack of an agreed definition abou t caring, and to the uptake of caring as knowledge for the discipline. It has also been a contributory factor translated into my need to explore caring as a discourse and to understand why and how nurses view caring differently from each other. While nurse wr iters focus on segregated statements about caring, it remains difficult for a consensus to be achieved about what caring is or is not, thus perpetuating a position that never has ag reement (this is assum ing that nurses do want an agreed position to be identified). Moving on from this discussion about the pu blication processes as contributing to the formation of the discourse, I now turn to ideas in the caring literature set that elaborate on the notion of standards of ca re. In this description of the discourse, for purposes of clarity, I have collated ideas that arise from three collective groups of ideas, that is, standards of care, expert care and expertise. Expert care, expertise or standards of care (Benner 1984; Gaut 1986; Miller 1995; Austra lian Nursing Council In c. 2001) form a set of statements that work within the struct ures and processes whic h are a component of today's health care and political decision making, therefore contrib uting to the generation of knowledge about caring. Examples include the movements associat ed with competency developments, vocational requirements, accred itation bodies and changes associated with the accrediting of facilities. These changes im pact on the professional role of the nurse (Gavin 1997), the evaluation of caring where bureaucratic requirements include measurable clinical outcomes (Miller 1 995), and the judgment of competent or 274 incompetent caring (Gaut 198 6; van Maanen 1990; Australian Nursing Council Inc. 2001). My anecdote at the beginn ing of this chapter identifies tw o examples where the role of the nurse is bound to procedures based on standards of practice and duty of care requirements. Issues associated with standards include how to measure caring and determine from what perspective caring should be measured (Gaut 1986; van Maanen 1990). For example: If caring can logically be considered an ordered series of actions, then to judge caring as competent or incompetent based on only one activity, such as communicating with the client, is unreasonable. Although skill in the particular activity chosen to meet the goal is required for competent action, o ther considerations must be made before statin g that in a particular instance the nurse was competently caring for th e client (Gaut 1986:79). In this above citation by Gaut, competent ca ring should not be determined according to one instance of caring (as in behaviour) or from a narrow skill set (e.g. observing behaviour) and therefore a more global perspe ctive of competent caring is required. (Here we can see transference of statements (behavio urs and actions) that apply to this discourse but were also instrumental in shaping the previous discourse\u2014'caring as doing'). Ideas associated with competent caring draw in the issues connected to expert caring, for example, in the way that expert caring is viewed as one that liberates and facilitates, allowing nurses permission to care. It is Patricia Benner's seminal work (Benner 1984) on expertise and caring that is often cited. This theme of expertise is th en taken up by other authors, and examples seen in the literat ure include discussions about health care bureaucracies (Parker 1999) and the place caring is (or perhaps is not permitted) to have in 275 nursing. To illustrate, \"The individual nu rse can no longer be held accountable for ensuring a caring relationship in the abse nce of educational, organisational, and professional structures that cr eate a milieu in which caring is possible\" (Shiber and Larson 1991:65). Reflecting on my own practice within th e operating theatre, I can identify several structures that imposed on my practice and which I belie ve detracted from my ability to be caring and consequently to practise according to stan dards within my professional role. As an exampl e, I can relate stories concer ned with a lack of resources such as equipment and human personnel, plus the overbooking of t heatre lists, which limited the time availabl e to ensure accountable safe caring practice. Elaborating the above point further, nursing expertise is influenced by the discourse on technology in nursing practice: for example, technological advanc ements and equipment in technologically demanding environments such as perioperative and emergency and intensive care units (Locsin 1995 ). Questions arise in the literature as to whether the nurse is an expert because of the care he or she provides or because of his or her ability to manage the complex and advancing technology. That is, is the nurse a n expert in caring for the patient or an expert in handling the technology? Discussion centres on the specialist or expert nurse, in an environmen t such as the Intensive Care Unit or the Operating Theatre\u2014who works in a technolog ically demanding environment caring for the patient\u2014and on how caring in this envir onment is defined. To refer to my opening chapter, remember that the very impetus for th is thesis came about because my role as a nurse who was working in the technologically demanding en vironment of the operating theatre, was not seen as a caring role by colle agues in ward-based contexts of practice. The standard and expertise of my practice was never questioned, but the caring element became the focus. 276 Ideas contributing to this element thus far ar e that discursive practices associated with publication processes and standards of care have influenced the formation of this discourse. In the next section, I present what I believe has been a ver y influential component of this discourse: the develo pment of caring theories and subsequent knowledge generation, support fo r and promotion of caring. Caring Theories Caring knowledge has been enhanced by th e work of nurse theorists whose caring theories have contributed significantly to th e generation of knowledge for nursing and to statements within this discourse. Different types of caring theori es can be identified within the nursing literature. Examples include gran d theories, as presented by Jean Watson (1979; 1985) and Madeleine Leininger's (1981a ; 1985) theories of caring, and midrange theories, as developed by Kristen Swanson (1 991), Virginia Knowlden (1998) and Vera Irurita (2000). The development of caring theories supports nursing's position that caring is the knowledge of nursing. Furthermore, enhancing this position are the examples that identify the relationship of theories to different rese arch and practice problems, and the analysis and comparison of theories (Leininger 1991a; Lea, Watson et al. 1998; Irurita 1999). The development of grand theori es which became evident in the mid 1980s, and later midrange theories, came about with questions that endeavoured t o portray caring as a knowledge base for nursing and the research associated with the definition of caring, (Condon 1996:79; Condon 2000). 277 Some of these different caring theory developments came about f ollowing influences from the National League of Nursing, wh ich advocated that nurses use a range of research methodologies to investigate cari ng and for research in nursing generally (Condon 2000:103). Other developments can be related to problems an d issues that were identified in nursing. Some re searchers tested or applied th eories in practice (Swanson 1991; Hogg 1994; Watson and Lea 1998). However, this is not evide nt for all theories identified, and while there are examples that sh ow the application of theory into practice, this is not as widespread at the practice leve l, given the amount of publication material associated with caring theories. For my own sp ecialty area only a fe w accounts of the use of caring theories have been adopted into this area of nurs ing (Parsons, Kee et al. 1993; Parsons 1995). A dominant theme is the shift from conceptualising caring as a theory (e.g. Watson's theory) to one where theories are developed from research and ther efore contribute to the development of caring knowledg e (for example, grounded th eory and the work performed by Virginia Knowlden (1998) and Vera Irurita (2000). The discursive practice of research has significantly impacted on the development of caring theory, the defining of caring, as well as the identification of caring as know ledge for nursing since the late 1980s (Forrest 1989; Swanson 1993; Wa tson and Lea 1998). Developing alongside the research movements are several research tools that have been accepted in the literature to assess and measure caring (Watson 1990a; Watson 2002a). Examples of these research tools include th e Caring Behaviours Inventory, (Wolf 1986), the Care Q (Larson 1984; Komorita, Doehring et al. 1991; Greenhalgh, Vanhanen et al. 1998), the Caring Behaviours Assessment T ool (Cronin and Harris on 1988; Parsons, Kee 278 et al. 1993), and the Caring Dimensions Inventory (Lea, Watson et al. 1998) among others. Each of the instrument s contributes to the examination of caring as a concept by providing an elaboration of the concept and the generation of practice exemplars as illustrations of caring. This ha s contributed new idea s to this discours e and has led to a more complex understanding of the caring statements for nursi ng. In addition to these tools for researching caring, various other p aradigms and methodologies of research have been utilis ed to investigate it and contribute an understanding of caring via multiple B eck 1999; Bassett 2002). Further, research into caring has been undertaken within diff erent contexts of practice (for example, involving, patients with cancer, followin g myocardial infarcti ons, and those who are admitted for surgical issues) and within these contexts some projects are replications of previous research findings (Mayer 1986; von Essen and Sj\u00f6d\u00e9n 1991) a llowing for the validation of theoreti cal ideas (Watson 1990a ; Parsons, Kee et al. 1993; Watson 2002a). Nurses are encouraged to research this largely unknown terrain of caring (Watson 2002a:248). In fact nursing organisations, professional groups and nurse theorists challenge nurses to take up the impetus and to research caring. Researchers challenge their peers to undertake additional re search into an issue when they identify areas for further research or identify gaps in knowledge arising from literature rev iews (Harrison 1990). Other practices encourage the answering of nurses' practice questions through the use of research methods. All these initiatives co ntribute caring knowledge for nursing, knowledge that is primarily generated by the academic based nurses who inform the literature in this discourse 'caring as knowing'. 279 For this discourse, 'caring as knowing', my aim has been to describe it using the results of my archaeological analysis, from the pers pective of statements and the discursive formation, as outlined by Foucault (1972). In doing so I have presen ted two elements\u2014 imparting knowledge and caring knowledge\u2014th at are constituted, modified and organised through the discursive formation (Foucault 1972:173) and arise fr om a series of formulations about caring in nursing. I have shown that the many statements, concepts, themes and ideas that contribute to the re ality of this discourse arise from various perspectives. Thus this third disc ourse 'caring as knowing' is seen to exist in the nursing literature and is the final discourse to be co nsidered within the 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'. In the remainder of this chapter, I examine is sues that are relevant and pertinent to the profession of nursing and to this third discou rse. They are particular ly applicable to the acceptance of nursing as a profession and to the professional identity of the nurse. Throughout nursing's history, nurses as a grou p have invested considerable effort into ensuring nursing is recognised as a professi on. To this end a lot of energy has been invested into the educational requirements for nurses and the iden tification and acceptance of a definition, knowledge and para digm for nursing. Follo wing this discussion and adopting a completely different perspective, I then turn to discus s the dual concepts of power and knowledge as view ed through the lens of Foucault. Both these concepts are critical Foucauldian concepts (Foucault 1972) that were detailed in Foucault's later work on genealogy, with the nursing literature refl ecting the use of this later work (genealogy) for analysis more than it has used the work of Foucau ldian archaeology (Street 1992; Heslop and Oates 1995; Parker 1995). My plan in this following sect ion is to critically analyse this discourse using these concepts of power and knowledg e as they apply to 280 caring, drawing in examples from the description of the discourse in order to understand some of the implications that this discourse has for nursin g from a differe nt, informed perspective. For now my immediate task is to discuss the discourse and the profession of nursing. Discussion The Discourse and the Pr ofession of Nursing Caring is inextricably bound to the profes sion of nursing and this section analyses the influence of professional ideas inherent in nursing in relation to the discourse 'caring as knowing'. For nursing, there is concern abou t whether or not nursing is a profession. Different assumptions about what constitute s a profession influence nursing's claim for professional identity and status. Several writers immersed in the discipline of nursing have identified the characteristics of a profession (van Maanen 1990; L eddy and Pepper 1993; Bernhard and Walsh 1995; Ke ogh 1997). However, because a variation within these characteristics occurs (Evans 1991:314), this has render ed acceptance and definition of nursing as a profession difficult. One characteristic advocated for a profession is that it should have a body of knowledge that is unique to the profession, and this knowledge should be derived fr om experience and research. Other characteristics of a prof ession include an ethi cal code, professional authority, a professional cu lture and community sanction (van Maanen 1990; Bernhard and Walsh 1995:2; Keogh 1997). The defini ng of a profession is subject to many influences apart from a set of characteristics including thos e arising from disciplines and discourses. We see that several disciplines have influence over the defining of a profession (Bruni 1991; McCoppin and Gardner 1994; Hayes 1995). One such influence arises from trait discourse (Bruni 1991:174) from with in the psychology disc ipline (McCoppin and 281 Gardner 1994:67:222), and anot her comes out of sociology. From these disciplines, differing core criteria are advocated that prof essions should meet in order for the process of professionalisation to adva nce. Consequently, these differe nces have had the effect of blurring what is deemed to be a im portant for a profession (Hayes 1995:179). A recognised body of knowledge about the cari ng nurse is manifested where a collection of techniques, procedures, instruments, levels of application and target s, reflect a type of power that is exercised throug h institutions (for example the profession), capable of using them for a particular end where authorities re inforce and reorganise internal mechanisms of power (Rabinow 1984:206; McHoul and Gr ace 1993:69). From this perspective, there is an infiltration of power serving as an inter mediary or link, making it possible to bring about effects of power (Rabinow 1984:207). In order to portray nursing as a profession, multiple methods such as co mpetencies, appraisals, codes (conduct, ethics) boundaries (professional practice), supervision and cultur al practices insidiously objectify the caring nurse, forming a body of knowledge about nurses making them useful as well as controlling them in a professional body. Sociologists are credited with creating an ever changing set of characteristics that identify what constitutes a profession (Wicks 1999:7). Nursing, when a nalysed according to these sociologically based criteria, does not me et the requirements fo r recognition as a profession, yet when referenced against other sets of criteria, professional status is claimed (Chiarella 2002:2; Department of Educat ion Science and Training 2002d:205). One particular area where writers co nsider that nursing falls shor t of being a profession is in relation to the educational criterion. A reason for this proclaimed shortfall lies in the variability of the length and type of nursing education programs available. In its favour, 282 nursing has encompassed theory (and caring th eories contribute here), specialty nursing content and the possession of a professional subculture (Bernhard and Walsh 1995:7). The shortfall of this educational criterion, when analysed from a worldwide perspective, occurs because of the variability in the length of a nursing degree, which can be within a time frame of between 3-5 ye ars (Bernhard and Walsh 1995 :3). Furthermore, not all countries have a baccalaureate degree as a uniform standard of educ ation for nurses. By contrast, in Australia the nu rsing program is a uniform 3 year undergraduate degree program situated in a university. Therefore, Australian nursing programs have achieved a consistent standard educational program from the perspective of length of degree and educational institution. In addition, the Australian nursing curric ula are scrutinised by registering authorities and, although this is not a nationally based appr oach, it is governed at each State level with the adoption of Au stralian Nursing Council codes and standards (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 1993; 1995; 2001). As mentioned above, on e of the criteria for a professi on is education, and educational change subsequently alte rs the social standing of occupational knowledge and the extent to which a group is occupationally subor dinate or independent (Chandler 1991:83). Nursing has emphasised that academic progre ss is the key to prof essional recognition (McCoppin and Gardner 1994:43) and an im portant factor that has influenced the transition of nursing from a vocation into a profession has been the evolution of nursing training from hospital-based courses to nu rsing education programs situated within independent colleges and universities (van Maanen 1990:916). Thus, the transfer of nursing education to the higher education sect or has been an importa nt part of nursing's professional advancement stra tegy and a university degree has enabled nurses to gain 283 control over the nature and conditions of their work (Stevens and Crouch 1998:159; Department of Education Scie nce and Training 2002d). Attr ibutes such as a university education (as opposed to training), a disciplina ry base, standards and codes of practice (for example, ethics and conduct) have all worked to determine occupational status, privilege and recognition (Short, Sharman et al. 1993:190). This situating of nursing education within the tertiary sector has resulted in changes whereby academic education has provided grounding for the developm ent of nursing research through knowledge development about th e research process, the identification of research projects and the stimulus to engage in studies. The requir ement of role change from nurse educator to nurse academic ha s also stimulated nursing research, and consequently caring has been thoroughly immersed in these research endeavours. Research and the derived caring theories it produces (Swanson 1991; Euswas 1993; Williams 1998; and political power (Greenwood 2000:84). Incl usive with the development of these caring theories is the contribution of knowledge to the debate about the defi nition of caring for nursing, whether nursing is a science, an art or both, and knowledge generation about the multiple facets of caring, which has signific antly contributed to th e development of the nursing profession. The pathway to professional status that en hances professional autonomy, status and educational change is through intellectual learning and practice experiences (Chandler 1991:84). Specifically, it is the generation and ownership of a unique , discipline-specific body of nursing knowledge that is seen as critical for the profes sion (Bruni 1991:171) and to this end, many contemporary nursing leaders have rallied around the idea that caring, as 284 the essence of nursing, is the field's sp ecial knowledge (Leini nger 1986:10; Moccia 1988:31; Alexander, Beagle et al. 1994:427). This special knowledge is viewed as crucial to establishing nursing as a pr ofession (Olson 1993:68). In the development of nursing knowledge, it is ca ring theory that is being used as the vehicle for professionalisation and which has co ntributed to distinguis hing the discipline of nursing as a domain of enquiry (Newma n et al. 1991 cited in Olson 1993:68). The growth of the discipline of nursing can be as sessed by the development and explication of caring as a body of knowledge that is unique to the profession of nursing (Gray and Pratt 1991:6). This formal body of th eoretical caring knowledge (formal, informal, overt, covert, experiential, etc.), derived from the disciplin e of nursing, through research and theory development, is seen as essential for the ed ucation of its nurses and is clearly evident within its sphere of practi ce (Gray and Pratt 1991:6). Whereas a formal body of theo retical knowledge is seen as the pathway to professional status, for some nursing leaders, caring is the core of its profess ional ideology (Stevens and Crouch 1998:160) and as such, nursing possesses this unique body of knowledge (Olson 1993:72). By theoretically examining wh at it is that nursin g is concerned about, caring theory has served as a framework for the development of know ledge, and again in this way has contributed to the discipline of nursing as the statements of the discourse. Caring theories have been used to describe, understand and predict what nurses do and have allowed for the continued generation an d production of nursing-specific knowledge (Short, Sharman et al. 1993:62). Furthermore, the development of caring theory has contributed to the advancement of professional nursing becaus e it has generated research, helped the profession to defend and define its role, allowed nursing to be perceived as a 285 discipline and has endorsed th e synthesis of caring knowledg e with knowledge from other disciplines (Emden and Young 1987, cited in Short, Sharman et al. 1993:66). The consequential merging of schol arship, research and theory about caring has worked to consolidate nursing as a profession (van Maanen 1990:917). The workplace of the caring nurse is the ma terial form of the exercise of power in establishing a nursing profession. It allows surveillance, observation, security, knowledge, individualisation and totalisation. These procedures (reflecting panoptic 1984:217; McHoul and Grac e 1993:68) are systems that regulate the exercising of caring practice. Nu rses not only know that caring is paramount to nursing but need to apply it in terms of established regulations (such as Nurses and Midwives Board requirements) that make it possible to transform a body of knowledge that effects caring as requir ed for the nursing profession. Unfortunately, professiona lism has been something assum ed but often misunderstood (McCoppin and Gardner 1994:37) or deri ved from different perspectives. The achievement of true professional status recognised by all nurs es (and others) continues to be a global goal (Bernhard and Walsh 1995:13 ). The history of nursing as a profession appears to arise with Florence Nightingale, to whom an interventio n in the organisation of nursing is attributed (Stevens and Crouch 1998:158). Nurse leaders of today have been influential in the development of nursin g as a profession in the belief that professionalisation is important, necessar y and positive (Kermode and Brown 1995:10). Identified nurse leaders (Watson, Leininger, etc.) have advocated c aring through theoretical development; they have also been instrumental in o ther ways\u2014such as scholarship\u2014and have been influential leader s involved at the professional level. For 286 example, Dr Jean Watson has influenced polic ies through her leadersh ip as president of the National League for Nursing (Watson 1999b; 2002a). In realising their identity as a profession, nurs es are able to commandeer the prestige and status that being a profession has brought to other professions such as medicine and law (Bernhard and Walsh 1995:2). Therefore, nu rses meet other health professionals on a more equal footing. They have arguably attained respect for th eir increased level of functioning, and have achieved intellectua l and academic respec tability commensurate with their expertise (Short, Sharman et al. 1993:63). In support of the notion of a professional identity for nurses, White and Chiarella12, in the recent review into nursing education in Australia, proclaimed nursing as ... an international profession with a nucleus that binds it as a single entity across national borders; it is also a profession so diverse that its social status, remuneration, career patterns and work condition s can vary (White and Chiarella 2000:2). In these discussions, nursing stakes the claim that it has succeeded in establishing its identity as a profession (Moc cia 1988:30; Department of Ed ucation Science and Training 2002d) and one that does not necessarily fit the same pattern. Nursing is also identified as a profession in which caring is central to practice (Woodward 1997:999) and in which nurses identify with caring as the essence of nursing, as an integral part of their professional identity (Moccia 1988:31). This identity and image of nursing as a caring, helping profession is exemplified by accoun ts of expertise (Benner 1984; Stevens and Crouch 1998:160). Mary Chiarella was the appointed Chief Nurse, NSW Health Depar tment but resigned this position in 200412 287 In today's society, professi ons are viewed as the desirabl e occupations of our time and this perception significantly influences how young people are attracted to them. The profile of professional grou ps is increased as discussi on about them becomes more evident and open, and television series ar e dedicated to them (Kermode 1993:103; Bloomfield 1999). This profile raising is of particular importance to nursing in the current climate, which reflects a wo rldwide shortage of nurses (Sullivan and Reading 2002:24; Buchan and Calman 2004); one th at has not been overcome fr om a political perspective. Recruitment of students into ed ucation programs for nursing in Australia is one issue that is being addressed, as is the retention and recruitment of registered nurses (Trossman 2003:65; Linegar May 2003:15). In the period 1991-2000 in Australia, nursing student enrolments dropped by approximately 1,000 st udents across Australia in the later years (Department of Education Science and Traini ng 2002a:275). Advertising campaigns by New South Wales Health and local universities , and nursing programs on television that portray popular images of nursing practice (such as All Saints ) are newer influences that should impact on recrui tment of new students. Similarly, the issues associated with studen t recruitment into education (Linegar May 2003:15) affect the recruitmen t issues of registered nurs es, which remain politically relevant, but we see evidence that nurses are placed low on political agendas. Nurses lack power, visibility (Short, Sharman et al. 1993:6 3) and role identity, and the relevance and value of caring for nu rsing is not overtly known (McCo ppin and Gardner 1994:31). Their professional voice is diminished among th e voices of other pr ofessions, especially medicine. The Executive Director of the College of Nursing, Professor Judy Lumby, in her call to the Australian Fede ral Government to face up to what has become a national crisis in Australia's health care system, stated that ou r Federal Government ignores 288 nursing. She provides as an example the diffe rences in allocated support to nurses and doctors (for example, support mechanisms fo r education and in-service) to validate her claim (Lumby 2003:1). From a political perspective, in any health bu dget, nurses comprise a large component an d as a professional group they are ac tually a resource that is viewed as politically unaffordable. In the climate where nurses are placed low on political agendas and have a diminished voice, autonomy and co ntrol in the work setting, associated with recognition as a professional, is difficult to achieve (Kermo de 1993:104; Short, Sharman et al. 1993:63). However, if the recommendations ar ising out of a recent review into nursing education in Australia are adopted, we may move slowly toward this (De partment of Education Science and Training 2002d). An important point to consider is that recrui tment and retention issues for nurses are not an overnight phenomenon; these issues have dominated nursing over many years. I pause here in my discussi on to provide a few illustration s from my own experiences. In 1975, as a newly 'trained' registered nurs e in New Zealand, I was unable to secure a nursing position in a local hospital due to policies associated with what was termed the 'staff freeze on positions' (positions were left unfilled in nursing because of political decisions). Several months late r, and after securing casual employment on a fruit farm, the freezes were lifted and I gained employment in the operating theatre as a Staff Nurse. Later, I encountered the same situatio n when I arrived in Sydney, Australia, in 1978 and I found that positions were frozen and employment was agai n difficult to find in public health systems. By contrast, private hospital employment continued and I gained work in the operating theatre of a la rge private hospital. In my later experiences of working within the public sector of the he alth care system, I again encountered several situations of the 'staff freeze'. Even though th ere were nursing positions that were vacant 289 (because of nurses who had resigned), these positions and other new employment were not able to be taken up. This was not because there were no nurses availab le, but because policies determined th at employment was restricted fo r these nursing positions. Along with my colleagues, we all felt compelled to take on the additional patient care load of our missing colleagues. Today the opposite is occurring and positions are available but there are no registered nurses who are taking them up. While differen t initiatives for this issue of retention and recruitment are now op erating, my friends who left the nursing arena at the time of the staf f freeze claiming overwork, feel ing uncared for and unable to control their own work environment, are now working outside of nursing. Moreover, they continue to tell me they do not want to return to nursing no w that they have established careers in other direct ions and when not enough staff translates to additional work pressures. The difficulty associated with being able to re cruit qualified nurses co ntinues to be one of the challenges for employers today. Issues that can be se en to affect recruitment and retention include a redu ced growth rate of employment into nursing when compared to other occupations, with the employment of nursing workers stea dily declining over time. Additionally, nurses have shifted to working a shorter week from what was once termed a normal week. There is a tendency today for nu rses to work betwee n 16-24 hours. These issues affect both the demand for nursing and cari ng and for the quality of care that is able to be provided by nurses (Shah and Burke 2001:43). In this climate of an unmet demand for care and the intrusions placed on being able to provide quality care, the nurse finds it difficult to meet professional responsibilities . Such responsibilities may include meeting continuing professional education needs and bein g able to take up i ssues and problems in nursing from the perspective of research and higher education. 290 I should point out that not all nurses agree that nursing is a profession, and therefore nurses continue to view their position from different perspectives. My experience has been that when nurses view that nursin g is a job\u2014their paid employment\u2014then the notion of professional responsibilities such as continuing education and research is discounted, and there is a tendency by thes e nurses to take up obligatory in-service sessions as mandated or they attend only those sessions that are allocated time release. By contrast, for those nurses who recognise that nursing is a profession, another dimension exists. For these nurses, professional responsibility weighs he avily on their minds and issues such as quality caring and intrusions into their caring prac tice create dilemmas not known to the nurse who views their employment as simply a job. To elabor ate, in comparison to other professions, nursing suffe rs from a lack of support and educational opportunities and in the clim ate of global nursing shortage s, other factors such as an increased workload, work res ponsibility and limited career advancement opportunities potentiate professional issues and the ability of the nurse to provide quality caring (Sullivan and Reading 2002; Duffield 2003). Professional issues for nursing as a whole are fragmented. In Australia, although a national managed approach has been recommended, it still remains elusive (Department of Education Science and Tr aining 2002d). Nursing's ability to function as a politically active professional group is inhibited by what appear s to be the divisive nature of professional groups. As a consequence this potentiates the ability of governments to ignore nurses and the crisis in nursing because nurses are not working from a unified position. While heterogeneity among nurses could be identifi ed as strength that builds expertise and experience, the \"... divers ity is frequently refle cted in a lack of unity and an inability of the profession to speak with one vo ice\" (van Maanen 1990:920). This I believe is an issue for 291 nurses in Australia. The recent court ca se between The Royal College of Nursing Australia, which was identified as the national body for Nurses in Aust ralia, and the NSW College of Nursing, now identified as The Co llege of Nursing, emphasises the inability of nursing to speak as one voice. The court ca se about a name change for the former NSW College of Nursing came about for several reasons. One reason was their desire to reflect a new focus, which incorporating a national and international persp ective. Nurses like myself, located in New South Wales, feel obliged to be members or fellows of both organisations because of the professional rela tionships required for our role development. I personally have always viewed the Royal Colle ge of Nursing Australia as our connection with the global nursing body known as the International Council of Nurses, primarily because of its membership an d affiliation to this organisa tion, and therefore from my perspective the Royal College of Nursing Australia is our national voice in the international arena. However, as a result of political developments between the two Colleges of Nursing, I believe our political an d professional position, both nationally and internationally is now eroded. The Colleges and other identifiable professi onal organisations have a responsibility to promote research and education, which contribu tes to the professionalisation of nursing. In Australia these organisations relate to state and national orga nisations as well as specialty affiliated organisations (for a list of Associations affiliated with the College of Nursing see www.nursing.aust.edu.au ). Contributing to this expanse of research are the nursing regulatory and union bodies that prom ote professional nursin g. In my description of this discourse\u2014'caring as knowing'\u2014I referred to the National League for Nursing, which has contributed and mandated ideas about caring and research. C ollectively, these organisations have in place an infrastructure that supports nu rsing research and 292 scholarship, and the development of caring knowledge has benefited (Worrall-Carter 1995:61). In addition, the International Council of Nurses (the world peak nursing body) promotes nursing as a professi on and has set out guidelines for 'member national nurses associations' in order for them to devel op professional regu lation and to provide purposes for standards in which order, co nsistency and control can be brought to a profession and its caring pra ctice (Chiarella 2002:41). One particular nursing organisation in Austra lia, the Australian Nu rsing Council Inc. was established as a result of change affecting nursing, and worked to d evelop codes and standards for Australian nurses that assist regulatory bodies t o work towards the same goals (Percival 1995:11). Th is development has contributed to the identity of the profession in that standards are establis hed and published and used for regulation. Furthermore, nurses are directed by the Nurses Act 1991 (NSW) to be registered in order to practise nursing, with the primary reas on for professional registration in nursing identified as the protection of public heal th and safety (Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001:3). \"Nurses are expected to prof essional conduct\" (NRB in Nurses Re gistration 2001:4). Professional misconduct and unsatisfactory professional misconduct respec tively, mean that the nurse has committed an offence; in the latter case the nurse's na me is removed from the register or roll (Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001:16) . In cases of misconduct, caring is one of the elements that is viewed as essential for the practice of the nurse (Nurse s Registration Board NSW 2001:5) and about which complaints are investigated (Fox-Young, Quinn et al. 2003). In these regulatory mechanisms, we can see that caring has infiltrated into the role requirements of the prof essional nurse, sometimes as subtle statements within documents or as expectations of practice endeavours. 293 The nurse who views their practice from with in this discourse\u2014'caring as knowing'\u2014may be threatened by the interference of technology (McCoppin and Gar dner 1994:31). Nurses have been delegate d and have taken on, more and more complex medical functions that have arisen from technological advancements. If nurses lose sight of their caring identity then these advancements ha ve the potential to lead to tec hniques and skills that then renders nurs ing a highly skilled trade rather th an a caring, helping profession (Olson 1993:68). Recognising that the discourse 'caring as knowin g' exists, it is essential for nurses to overcome the threat of nursing being labelled technically skilled rather than caring and therefore devaluing of the professional status of nu rsing. It therefore remains important for nursing to articulate the discourses of caring; otherwise, the caring nurse as a professional identity and nursing as a profession may be take n over by skilled technicians (Sims 1991:53). Nursing's history shows several examples where the registered nurse roles and functions have gradually been subsumed into skilled technician positions and other allied health professi on roles. These have come a bout sometimes as a result of resourcing issues in nursing and political and managerial efforts to overcome resource constraints. Nursing as a profe ssion and role is again threatened today with the worldwide shortage of nurses and attempts by political and managerial groups to staff health care facilities and to provide essential services. Over the years, nursing has seen many change s to the role of the nurse. Contrasting my nursing roles over the years, in the 1970s, my role was one that included preparing the dietary requirements for my pa tients, including serving their meals as required for their medical condition (low fat, or low salt, or meals prepared for the diabetic patient). The role involved for example, chest percussion, to assist the patien t to breathe, and working 294 with patients on small craft projects to assi st their fine motor movements. Today these functions of my role have been taken over by specialists in, for exa mple, dietetics, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. My role in caring for my pa tients has now become one of referral to these persons and wi th the issues of recr uitment and retention paramount for nursing worldwid e (Sullivan and Reading 2002:24), I believe future changes to the nursing role will modify statements for the discourses of caring in nursing. Changes to the employment ratios can be seen to ha ve affected registered nurse roles to the advancement of other nu rsing roles such as enrolled nurs es, personal care assistants and nursing assistants (Shah and Burke 2001:44). Thus, the ability of the nursing profession to define, claim an d to expand their professional territory is under threat (Kermode and Brown 1995:11). Retention and recruitment issues illustrate the depletion of nurs es in the health care system and consequently others (technicians, assistants, lower level nurs es, other professions and the persons involved in the practice of natural therapies) are broug ht in to fulfil functions no longer able to be carried out within the role of the registered nurse, resulting in fewer registered nurses being available to care for patients (Shah and Burke 2001:44). As a consequence, members of the profession decl ine and the territory once claimed by the profession is diminished. An ex ample of this can be seen in the context of the nurse's role within the operating theatre, where there is a claim for the role of the anaesthetic technician as opposed to the anaesthetic nurse. The techni cian role is supported by the medical officer and is a position that is direct ly answerable to the medical management (as opposed to the nursing manageme nt when a nurse is employed). It is a position that is preferred by finance sectors because it is chea per to hire a technician than to employ an expert, knowledgeable, caring nurse. From my perspective, the issue is the employment of 295 nurses as carers for patients not technici ans to support anaesthetists; however, human resource constraints are a fact or for staffing requirements. But I still hold firm with the view that quality patient care is derived from caring anaesthetic nurses, as opposed to the employment of technicians who function ac cording to the requirements of machinery, technology and service to anaesthetists. The discourse 'caring as knowing' is made up of examples that illustrate caring as a body of knowledge known to nurses and patients. Th e discourse intersects with the profession in multiple ways, including the professional standards that determine c ompetency for the registered nurse in Australia. Inclusive are the measures of caring (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 2001; Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council 2005), examples of expertise (Benner 1984), and codes of conduct and ethics for nurses (Australian Nursing Council Inc. 1993; 1995; Aust ralian Nursing and Midwifery Council 2005). Thus, this discourse has become embedded as an entity critical for nurses and nursing. In this section, I have disc ussed ideas and practices associated with the profession of nursing as they apply to this discourse 'car ing as knowing'. Profes sionalisation agendas and current developments in nursing contri bute to, intersect with and influence this discourse from various perspectives, and for nu rses who view themselv es from within this discourse the profession is particularly releva nt to their practice. As a final discussion issue, I now enter in to a discussion about power and knowledge from the perspective of Michel Foucault's work. In this discussion, I use ideas and concepts that illustrate power and knowledge and apply these to the descript ion of the discourse, 'caring as knowing'. 296 Power and Knowledge Discourse, as conceived by Foucault, is indisp ensable to an understanding of the role of 'power' in the production of knowledge (McHoul and Grace 1993:57) and p ower through the active body (for example, the effect s of training, or subtle coercion through mechanisms of movements, attitudes, gestures) (Fouca ult 1977:138; Rouse 1994:94). Foucault's concept of power is dynamic and highlights the essential link between power relations, their capacity to 'produce' the truths by which we live and the conditions necessary for the production of truths that are generated by systems of knowledge and connections to social relations (for example, economics, medicin e, and the human sciences) (McHoul and Grace 1993:58 ; Rouse 1994). Knowledge undergoes transformations and reorganisations and concepts and objects wit h which these knowledges deal have historicity (McHou l and Grace 1993:58). These transformations and reorganisations of knowle dge constitute new forms of power and knowledge (Rouse 1994:93). Specifically, knowledge and truth are produced out of power struggles (between different fields, disciplines and institutions) th at are used to authorise and legitimate the workings of power (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:64) so that bodies of knowledge become intelligible and authoritative (Rouse 1994:93). This can be seen in examples from the previous section where the profession and the discourse\u2014'caring as knowing' exhibit power struggles. In Foucault's work on archaeology (1972), prior to the full develop ment of his concepts of power and knowledge in his later work: hi storical studies of prisons and sexuality (Foucault 1972; Foucault 1977; 1980; 1988b)\u2014 he argued that \"... bodies of knowledge became intelligible and author itative\" according to the structure by which statements were organised, counted as important, and empowered the speaker (Rous e 1994:93). Rouse 297 discusses Foucault's inquiry in to the structure of formations of discourse and significant changes in the organisations of a field of discourse. He states: ... it might be that what counts as a serious and important claim at one time will not (perhaps can not) even be entertained as a candidate for truth at another. Statements can be dismissed (or not even considered) n ot because they are false, but because it is not clear what it would amount to for them to be either true or false (Rouse 1994:93-94). In other words, the statements that are meanin gful at a specific time in a discourse (for example, particular ideas about a theory of caring or the definition of the profession of nursing) may be very relevant to the discourse but at a later time they may not be as important and may not count as knowledge for the field. We can see Jean W atson's (Watson 1985; Watson 1988; 1994; 1999b) development of the ca rative factors as an example to illustrate this point. In her early theory developments, t he ten carative factors were listed as statements that were important for her theory. At a conference that I attended in Fremantle, in 2002 , Jean Watson presented a diffe rent set of carative factors to the ones that were published in her earl ier work (Watson 1979; 1985; Watson 1988); these not only incorporated ideas and developmen ts of her theory over the years but also included ideas from other theorists and refle cted changes in nursing, politics and health care as well. Her previous se t of carative factors no longer count as the language for her theory and we must now look to her more contemporary revised set for meaning and interpretation of caring (Watson 1999b; 2003). Thus, in this ex ample important shifts in what counts as serious di scussion become evid ent and changes in the discursive formations can be seen to govern the serious possibilitie s for talking about things. 298 Power, as defined by Foucault, can be seen in this discourse\u2014'caring as knowing'\u2014as a concept that is integral to the practise of nu rsing. Power is not wielded from the top down but is power as relational. It is not imposed but comes about because of the relations, the systems of knowledge and connect ions between social relations in nursing. Such systems of knowledge include research, theory developm ent and practice guidelines that have been generated and connect to other fields and di sciplines (such as medicine, physiotherapy, profession and management ). Transformation and the reorganisation of caring knowledge, plus the historicity that exists for these concepts and objec ts affects changes in power and knowledge. Essentiall y, this thesis has used archae ology to understand caring; however, there is 'slippage' toward genealogy. Indeed Foucault's a rchaeologies slip toward genealogies where the boundaries between archaeology and gene alogy have become blurred and Foucault himself be comes self reflexive in his ge nealogies. To draw examples that illustrate this perspective fr om my description of the disc ourse, we could refer to the use of different research tools, paradigms an d methods to research caring (Fawcett 1984; Wolf 1986; Komorita, Doehring et al. 1991; Lea, Watson et al. 1998). What becomes evident, as knowledge is produced, are changes in the practice of nursing (for example, the inclusion of caring in the code of conduct, and the prescribed use of caring as a measure for safe nursing practice (Australian Nurs ing Council Inc. 1995; Nurses Registration Board NSW 2001; Australian Nursing and Mi dwifery Council 2003; Fox-Young, Quinn et al. 2003). These changes are taken up by th e profession and the re gistering authorities who convey to nurses a 'truth' by which they must practise. The connection between power and knowledge becomes even more evident when we examine the reorganisation of knowledge from the social position of the carriers of that knowledge (Chandler 1991:84). Nurse leaders ha ve used mechanisms of power that have 299 been effective in producing what is consider ed a truth for nurses. In this sense, power functions in terms of relations between fields, institutions, bureau cracies and other groups and flows from one point to an other, making it mobile and contingent (Danaher, Schirato et al. 2000:71). The historical conditions (t he instruments and procedures that produce knowledge) (McHoul an d Grace 1993:90) are effective in producing this truth, and although power acts on people in a non egalitarian way, at th e same time it acts on all persons. We see these effects in this discours e in the way that theo ries of caring, as espoused by influential nurse theorists, have produced a fo rm of truth for some nurses and at the same time have provided nurses a mechanism for claiming caring as a special knowledge for nursing that supports one of th e criteria for a profession. In some ways, this has worked to counteract the cure discours e that is dominant within medicine, in that some nurses believe that care is owned by them. In contrast however, we can see a claim for caring as knowledge be ing voiced by other health professionals, who beli eve that caring is relevant to the establishment of their disciplines (Petersen and Bunton 1997; Cluff and Binstock 2001). Du ring the conference I attended on caring in Fremantle, as mentio ned above, this idea was presented by Jean Watson, who then prescribed what nursing m ust do to counter the power relations in order for nursing to become re-established (o ne example provided was for nurses to again use therapeutic touch\u2014a construct of caring in practice) and to ensure that caring remains nursing's special knowledge. Adding to th is recognition of caring, as the special knowledge for nursing, is the claim for heal ing (as opposed to cure) as knowledge for nursing (Watson 1999b). This argument supports the position of nursing as a field by claiming not only caring, but also healing, an d works to limit the en croachment by allied health disciplines and alternati ve therapies into nursing. 300 The nurse is immersed within what Foucault terms power relations through knowledge of caring, nursing, health and practice and th rough other disciplinary fields (such as management, administration, culture and the profession). While on one hand, nurses are required to care according to standards that deem them to be accountable, professional and ethical (Australian Nursin g Council Inc. 2001) there are other political strategies operating within our society; mechanisms that coordinate power according to procedural techniques, technological advanc ements and a scarcity of resour ces. To some extent this is articulated in the way that nurses have put considerable effort into defining caring and into identifying constructs of caring (such as themes, behaviours and actions), not to mention theoretical and research developm ents. Mechanisms of power (Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:190) allow for time and labour to be extracted from nu rses by means such as surveillance (structures that enhance visibi lity) and by material coercions (Foucault 1980: 104) thereby producing wh at Foucault would term a real ity, domains of objects and rituals of truth (Foucault 1977:194). Examples that illustrate th ese ideas in regard to the nurse include wearing attire that identifies an expected level of know ledge from the nurse (uniform requirements for the registered nurs e) and therefore contributes to a judging of the practice of the nurse according to the re quirements of different persons (other nurses, managerial personnel, medical staff, patients). Thus, the behaviour of the caring nurse is constrained through procedures of surveillance, documentation and elicitation. Power and knowledge enable a more contin uous and pervasive control of what nurses do and offers further possibilities for more intrusive inquiry an d disclosure (Rouse 1994:96). Further controlling mechanisms for nurses can be related to the number of registered nurses available to care for patients and the mix13 of nurses available at the practice level 13 Ratio in practice of registered nurses, enrolled nurses and assi stants in nursing on a ward or unit to care for patients. 301 to perform care. We therefore see a means of control operating, and there are techniques in place that enhance the production of the caring nurse and knowledge. Accordingly, power can be understood in the techniques through which it is exer cised, that is, the practice of nursing and the structure of the he alth care system, whic h have allowed for the differentiation of systems of power and the production of specific practices (such as caring) which characterise the ways in whic h power relations function (McHoul and Grace 1993:65). Consequently, caring knowledge itself has become a disciplinary power for nurses and nursing. Mechanisms in nursing have fo rmulated what is im portant for the caring nurse. One such mechanism that I discussed in the description of the discourse is the publication of articles in refereed journals that subsc ribe to a formalised structure. This mechanism, prescribed for nurse writers, academics and to some extent for students within higher degree courses, is considered to be a normal process for publ ication. The prolific amount of material on caring published across the world is testim ony to the mechanism of power operating through publication pr ocesses as a normalisi ng effect (McHoul and Grace 1993:68; Rouse 1994:98). A second mechanism of power in operation is evident within curriculum processes for the teaching of nursing. These proc esses that prescribe learning ensure that concepts, ideas, values and practices that are deemed important for the caring nurse, are transcribed to the teaching-learning processes in the legitimate cu rriculum process. For example, in Australia we see caring knowledge incorporated in the adoption of the codes of conduct, the ethical frameworks and the competencies prescribed for nurses (Aus tralian Nursing Council Inc. 302 1993; 1995; 2001; Australian Nu rsing and Midwifery Council 2005) and integrated into the curriculum documents for nursing. An additional mechanism sees the c urriculum document undergo an approval process by nurse registering authorities. We can find a third mechanism of power a ssociated with research training and the requirement of higher educat ion qualifications for nurses. We see evidence of nurse leaders promoting research into caring in va rious ways, such as the provision of support for nurses interested in these research endeav ours (for example, in the way of supervision, or by providing courses for nurses in cari ng\u2014see for example Jean Watson's website at the University of Colorado for a li st of courses available for nurses: www.uchsc.edu/ctrsinst/chc/index.htm ). All the examples above illu strate what Fo ucault terms mechanisms of power: these wo rk to effect a normalisation fo r nurses and subtle form of coercion in operation throughout complex social networks within the fields of both caring and nursing (McHoul and Grac e 1993:68; Rouse 1994:98). The mediation by Professors of Nursing (suc h as Madeleine Leininger, Jean Watson) has afforded the caring nurse a process of active \"self-formation\" (Rabin ow 1984:11). This is a process whereby a self -understanding of the caring nurse has occurred through a variet y of operations. There has, for example, been a vast proliferation of discourse about caring since the 1970s, in part because caring was seen by some nurses as ce ntral and essential to Leininger 1980; Hu ch 1995). It was linked to notions of good practice and perceived need s. There are also pointers in the literature where caring is used as a claim for the know ledge base of nursing (Moccia 1988; 1995; Kyle 1995). Thus, caring and nursing are joined in a common set of conc erns where the caring 303 nurse is a mode of subjec tification (Rabinow 1984:11 ; McHoul and Grace 1993:22; As a mode of subjectification, the caring nurs e is subjected to processes that allow for a collection of techniques (or power) that flow through all of nursing as a social body (McHoul and Grace 1993:22; Ingram 1994:235 ). That is, strategi c relations between individuals and groups, mechanisms, processes, structures and strategies work to effect knowledge and to govern th e conduct of nurses (Davidson 1994:119). These work to effect a process of \"normalisation\" where techniqu es such as the direction of conscience, application of standards and professional expect ations, permeate practi ce as a unique form of self-surveillance but more significantly, po rtray how the caring nurse must be defined. Another, fourth form of power operating according to Foucau lt is disciplinary power. In applying this concept of disciplinary power to this discourse we see norms of behaviour that have arisen from connections between the techniqu es of power and the forms of knowledge that have developed alongside th em (McHoul and Grace 1993:70) therefore subjecting the disc ourse\u2014'caring as knowing' to di sciplinary power (Foucault 1977; Dreyfus and Rabinow 1983:194). Techniques associated with disciplinary power have produced what is known as the caring nurse an d it is from this pers pective that I believe most nurses view caring. Base d on my analysis of caring, di sciplinary power has produced the nurse who views caring as knowing (my previous chapters have identified that two other discourses exist alongside this discourse and are subject to disciplinary power). In this discourse however it is more the object of the caring nurse that is visible rather than the subject, the caring nurse. The caring nurse is an object of kno wledge and a target for 304 the exercise of power, located in a political field, invested with po wer relations that render it docile and productive, and therefore economically useful. As we see from Rouse (below), knowledge development occurs not only from what is said bu t also from many other dimensions. Knowledge is established not only in relation to a field of statements but also of objects, instruments, practi ces, research programs, skill, social networks, and institutions. Some elements of such an epistemic field reinforce and strengthen one another, and are taken up, extended, and reproduced in other contexts; others remain isolated from, or conflict with, these emergent \"strategies\" eventually become forgotten curiosities. The configuration of know ledge requires that these heterogeneous elements be adequately ad apted to one another, and that their mutual alignment be sustained over time (Rouse 1994:110). In other words, caring statemen ts, concepts, skills and practice s, in the way that they are used, and increasingly connected to other elements over time , have become epistemically significant and have formulated the knowledge of caring. That is not to say that this development has not seen difficulties and conflicts with other emerg ing epistemic practices, (for example, caring ethics and nu rsing) but these conflicts have allowed for the continuing development and reorganisation of this knowledge. Conclusion The discourse 'caring as knowing' is pr imarily an academic based discourse and significantly impacts on the profession of nursing as played out through Foucauldian concepts of power and knowledg e. The discourse 'caring as knowing' is well established, not only as a set of statements, elements, concepts, objects, themes, et cetera, but identifiable from the discursi ve practices such as research programs, skills, and through 305 social networks, bureaucracies and institutions . There is a strong articulation of caring within this discourse and as a professional strategy, caring is pr esented as the special knowledge for nursing. As a nurse working in the academic conte xt of practice, this discourse 'caring as knowing' is one that is particularly relevant and meaningful to me (not that I discount that other discourses are also operating). Th is view I believe can be attributed to my current role in nu rsing. As a nurse academ ic, I'm involved with the teaching of nursing theory to first year undergr aduate students and working with them to develop their conceptual understanding of not only theory but of how nurses use theory, work with it and develop it for their practice, has always been a stimulation for me. Now I can add to my teaching this generation of knowle dge and contribute an understanding of the discourse 'caring as knowing'. This will I' m sure, provide for stimulating debate and critique and hopefully a dawning of understan ding. This is one of my new ways forward! 306 Chapter 6: Conclusion CONCLUSION Caring in nursing has been the central concern of this thesis\u2014a conc ern that has been embraced, and is valued by nurses. Permeati ng boundaries worldwide, caring has never been fully conceptualised in its entirety, and conclusions made abou t caring have remained diverse and elusive. Caring has been described, researched, and owned by very influential nurses such as Jean Watson, Madeleine Leininge r and Patricia Benner, as well as by nurse researchers, academics, studen ts, clinicians, myself and my peers. It has indeed been a contested site for nursing. I came to realise that caring had been se t up as a monument in the Foucauldian sense; that is, elements that are grouped and made r elevant, placed in relation to each other form three discours es of caring capable of description. Caring has been understood from differing contexts and perspective s and nurses have taken up diverse positions in explaining and de fending it. Particularly , nurses have viewed caring as a phenomenon, when in reality nurses understand and speak about caring differently. In this thesis, my aim has not been to reiterate what caring is or is not, because a vast amount of literature has already contri buted to this perspecti ve. Nor have I taken a position in debating caring. What I have done is to reconceptualise ca ring for nursing. My primary aim has been to utilis e Foucault's archaeological tools (statement, discursive formations and discourse) to make sense of cari ng in the nursing literature. This discursive approach provides a new perspective, starting at the statement and the discursive formation level to understand caring in contrast to ca ring as essential that is portrayed in the contemporary nursing literature. 307 This thesis then provides an interpretation and critique of caring as presented in the nursing literature, through th e lens of discourse analysis (Foucault 1972). Drawing from Foucault's (1972) Archaeology of Knowledge I have shown that 'An Archive of Caring for Nursing' exists. This Archive, as an organisi ng system determines wh at is possible, what can and cannot be spoken about caring for nursing. It should not be regarded as a finite entity but one that is subject to change over time. Within this or ganising system, three discontinuous, well-bounded discourses of cari ng have being' , 'caring and 'caring as knowing'. Each discourse is distinct; however, it is al so possible to see that they overlap, intersect, compete and together they provide a world vi ew of caring for nursing. The tenets of Foucauldian archaeology have provided a mechanism to understand the organisation of the discursive field of cari ng. What counts as serious and important and can be claimed as truth, governs the possibili ties of what can be counted as a serious discussion for caring. The use of archaeology as a methodology has allo wed me to display the structural differences represented and to do cument the shifts in this discursive field (Rouse 1994:94), resulting in the identification of these three discourses of caring. This approach, furthermore, has provided the mechanism for understan ding which concepts and statements together are intelligible, or ganised thematically, empowered to speak seriously and be taken as truth (Rouse 1994:93). The aim of this thesis has not been to prop ose a division and separa tion of the discourses of caring, even though three di stinct discourses have been identified. What is offered is that, rather than there being one discourse of caring, three discourses comprise an Archive 308 of Caring for Nursing. That is, there are th ree divergent ways in which nurses position themselves to speak about, action and unde rstand caring. These I have presented as individual discourses. I contend that by and large the individual nu rse will understand them selves predominantly through one or other of these discourses. That is, if we we re to suggest that nurses come from different practice-perspectives, such as the research nurse, the theoretical nurse or the practising \"bedside\" nurse, the theoretica l nurse will actively propagate one view of caring\u2014one that is self reflective, underst ood politically and one that she or he will propel. The practising nurse is more likely to be working with one paradigm than the other\u2014self understanding (carin g as doing). This is less poli tical and less self conscious but is commonsensical, arises from a Western heritage and perhaps also incorporates the notion of 'caring as being'. It is just as strongly felt in that it is intuitive and is a concept of others, although there may be education bias operating. Any one nurse can accommoda te statements from a numb er of discourses. The statements may conflict, may not be in harm ony; however, a nurse may understand his or her practice according to a particular discours e. Through a series of processes this nurse may move from one perspective to another and change his or her understanding of caring. These processes could be further education (such as un dertaking theoretically based courses) or commencing wo rk in a unit that utilises a particular caring theory, or where a nurse moves from an area of practice that is quite different to another (such as the nurse who may work within the perioperat ive context and moves to a field such as palliative care nursing perhaps). 309 This thesis supports proposals by Watson (2002) in the ways that she looks to the future of nursing and proposes a merging of ideas. Before this can ha ppen, recognition and understanding that there is an 'Archive of Caring for Nursing' an d that there is more than one discourse of caring, is essential. Throug h the utilisation of knowledge derived from this research, nurses can strive to unite and combine knowledge about caring to drive nursing's future through education, practice, reference to the profession and through an understanding of health care practices. While nurse writers frequently focus on segregated statements a bout caring, it remains difficult for a world view of caring to be ac curately portrayed. The aim of this thesis has been to take up caring and to examine it not from within but by steppi ng back and examining caring as a practice obeying certain rules and has been co ncerned with defining caring discourses in their specificity and as Foucault (1972) states\u2014as a monument. Nurses continue to speak of caring in the sing ular \u2014an entity which th ey believe that they recognise or know of in one glance, but whos e limits they still ha ve some difficulty in defining. However, caring has undergone chan ge as new statements have been added. What has individualised each of the three discours es identified in this thesis is the rules of formation for all its objects, a ll its operations or concepts and theoretical notions. Each discourse comprises a set of re lations which define and situa te it among other discourses \u2014social, economic, and political (Foucault 1991:54). These three dis courses diverge, they are different, but they are contributory in a complex relationshi p of displacement. 310 The three discourses described in this thesis have been ch aracterised through description of statements from text. Therefore, a collation of difference ha s occurred, with a description of clusters of relations, in or der to define as carefully as possible the transformation constituting change from the si ngular of caring as stated above, to the diverse caring discourses nested within th e 'Archive of Caring for Nursing'. These discourses are described for nursing, and stat ements utilised within nursing texts comprise the data. Changes that \"... affect its [the discourses] objects, opera tions, concepts, theoretical options\" (Foucault 1991:56) tute characteristics of the discursive formations and the discourses are a \"... space of differentiated subject -positions and subject-functions\" (F oucault 1991:58). The impetus for this thesis was a concern about caring from the perioperative nurses' perspective, a question about reasons why my colleagues viewed caring differently. Therefore, what I have analysed is the existence of statements th at have rendered the discourse possible, and to describe the deve loped Archive\u2014the set of rules that defines \"The limits and forms of the sayable . What is it possible to speak of? What is the constituted domain of discourse? What type of discursivity is assign ed to this or that domain?\" (Foucault 1991:61 origin al italics). These discourses have been considered in the practical domain of nursing in which they are deployed. The three discourses in the Arch ive of Caring for Nursing identified in this thesis show what is said about caring an d the regulated practi ces of each domain (Foucault 1991:61). Each discourse has a status in nursing, fu nctioning as well as institutionalised with, conditions of use and exercise (Foucault 199 1:65). The research has shown that nurses 311 position themselves within these discourses of caring. When nurses speak of caring it is not each of the discourses that is exemplified, but facets of one or more. Therefore, we see incongruence in conceptions of what the cari ng nurse is about, what they do and what they know. Incongruence contributes to the frameworks of practice being disrupted. Multiple statements comprise the three discou rses (\"caring as as know ing\") and nurses are unaware of which discourse they have internalised. Therefore nurses have not been self-reflexive, nor can they speak with confidence about caring. As a consequence, the culture of the nurse as a caring subject has been denigrated because of numerous contra dictions in theorising and because the diversity of discourses has prevented the de velopment of an eff ective unified voice. Nurses are positioned differently within the discourses of caring because each nurse's knowledge of statements is different. Several problematisations therefore have become apparent, and examples of these have been discussed within the bo dy of this thesis. Some examples of the problematisations discussed include retention an d recruitment for nursing, technologies, expertise and noncaring. Powerful institutions value discourses. Nurses have resisted some inst itutional meanings, and this thesis itself attests to such resistance. Constru ction and restriction of discourse w ill always continue (for example, through the contribution of research). This research has contributed an identification of the discourses of caring in the \"Archive of Caring for Nursing\" and an an alysis of practice through textual analysis, recognising the competing discourses (management, politics, society, and other inters ecting technologies) that create reactions to cha llenges (problematisations). The thesis places itself within 312 nursing knowledge and opens th e way for new research possibilities offering nursing a way to construct meaning for itself while taking into consider ation conflicts and resistances. Nurses should be provided the opportunity to understand how they are positioned in relation to the discourses of caring. They can become more self reflexive, more confident and begin to understand and re solve conflicts between differing understandings of caring. Positioned within new interdisciplinary nursing knowledge, this thesis points to possibilities of archaeological research for other nursing concepts. The concept of nursing lends itself to such an examinati on through archaeological analysis. 313 References Advisory Board (2003).
