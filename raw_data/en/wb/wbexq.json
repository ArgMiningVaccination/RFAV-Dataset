It is founded on evidence-based medicine and ancient western medicine based on the four elements. To this it adds an anthroposophic understanding of the human being and the world. It was initiated in 1920 by the physician Ita Wegman and the founder of anthroposophy Rudolf Steiner PhD, and has since then been continually developed throughout the world.

Health is a matter of balancing the whole human being: physical, vital energy, mental-emotional and spiritual. This balancing can be achieved via life-style and supplements, art, cultural expression and spirituality. For medication, anthroposophic medicine uses homeopathic remedies derived from plants, minerals, and animals. It also involves a range of therapies such as: eurythmy, counseling and psychotherapy, speech therapy, rhythmical massage, art therapy, and specific nursing techniques such as external compresses and a hands-on approach called rhythmical einreibung. \"When we bring body, soul, and spirit into harmony, we make our peace with destiny: we have learned to accept and love it.
