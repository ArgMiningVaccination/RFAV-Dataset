How to get there (flights, airport transfers, buses, trains) Welcome to India, a developing country, where travel experience can be challenging but exciting! So, be prepared, as a true traveler and adventurer, to go through all the difficulties of visas, airports, flights, and finally, a bumpy road journey from the airport to the best yoga ashram in India. Visa stuff Please be aware that all foreigners must have an Indian Visa to land in any Indian airport, without which you will be deported back. We recommend our clients to apply for a Tourist Visa, which is easier to obtain, than a student visa and medical visa which requires a lot of paperwork and has restrictions on where else you can travel within India. Travel insurance suggestions We recommend to buy travel insurance that covers covid-related travel interruptions. Bhavya JainPosted 2 years ago on BookRetreats Honestly, this is the best, most peaceful and blissful Ashram I've ever been to! The Ashram is full of greenery, nature, has a river side view (so calm) and everything else you could've asked for. The people here are so sweet, courteous and warm that when you leave, you'll for sure leave with a heavy heart as everyone here becomes like a family. It is completely natural and an eco-friendly ashram with the most beautiful scenery there, everything here is top-notch, starting from people to services to food to treatment and what not! Starting with Krish and Lilly, they both are the sweetest people you'll ever meet, so calm and composed. Helped me throughout my journey and fulfilled all of my needs without a hiccup. Thank you so much for having me you two, it was a pleasure meeting you guys. Sajji managed everything perfectly and helped me whenever I needed anything, he was always just a call away! Dr. Amrita was so sweet, caring and loving that she genuinely treated me like a younger sister. Anything and everything I didn't want to eat or wanted to change in my treatment, she was all ears and supported me throughout. I was completely satisfied with everything and I still managed to lose my desired weight within such a short span of time (without being starved!!). Beena and Akhila were my therapists and did all my treatments, with them I was completely comfortable and the way they took care of me made me feel at home. They were just so sweet and calm with me and pampered me so much! Danesh and Sanjay taught me the most peaceful and amazing Yoga and Meditation throughout my journey, it gave me so much peace and helped me calm myself so much. Vikas, Sanam and all the other members took care of every little detail like food, laundry and what not! They made everything so easy and approachable. Last but not the least, how can I forget the cute pets that are there (3 cats and 2 dogs), especially my Momo (the male dog) who literally just put a smile on my face at any time of the day! Thank you so much everyone for giving me such a memorable experience that I can never forget, I wish to be back again very soon! JJ van ZonPosted 2 years ago on BookRetreats I can actually say that i've never been as close to me as I have been during those last weeks at the AyurYoga Eco Ashram. The first weeks were hard though, not because of the ashram, but because of letting go of my own expectations and surrendering to the program, but the last weeks I felt the alignment of my Koshas and it truly broadened my perspective. I took their advice and immediately searched for a job as a teacher, and I was so spiritually aligned that I immediately found a great position at a fab yoga studio where now, 6 years later, I teach a variety of (at least) 10 classes weekly. I love that I followed my heart and went to India to this ashram. It created a solid foundation for my journey as a teacher. Inga FresserPosted 2 years ago on BookRetreats Wonderful place created by great people! Very well organised, always helpful - personal, friendly, respectful communication. Authentic experience, safe environment, wide knowledge. Highly recommended!! Deborah GallagherPosted 3 years ago on BookRetreats I would definitely recommend AyurYoga Ashram. I had been self taught through youtube videos as I was working in places where it was not possible to attend a yoga class, however I did not feel out of my depth and the focus on meditation and the mind body connection was taught beautifully. I feel the true essence of yoga is what you understand most deeply after your time here. Best price guarantee.Hosts must offer the lowest price to be listed on our site.
