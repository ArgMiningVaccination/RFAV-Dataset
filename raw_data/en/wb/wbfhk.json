Characteristics The increase inVietnam era veterans from 3toimillion inthe past year influenced anumber of the changes evident inthe characteristics ofthe VA patient. D~lring 1968, Vietnam era veterans com- prised 3.3 percent ofadmissions tohospital care. In 1970, the proportion Ilad risen to10.0 percent, numbering some 66,519 admissions to hospitals. Changes bro[]ght about by the presence ofincreas- ing numbers inthe patient characteristics, are discllssed below. Age\u2014The average age ofall patients discharged from VA hospitals in1969 \\vas 52.7 years\u2014a slight decrease fronl the 53.1 average for the prior year. This decrease resulted from the combination of two factors both operating toreduce the average age, namely -nlore 01tl~e younger Vietnam era pa- tients 65+ 30- \\./ 10-------------------------------- 0 I llosl~ital also.

Psychiatry plays an important part in the out- patient program. Over one and aq~larter million visits I\\Tere made for psychiatric purposes. Increases occurred psychiatric clinics, and exanlinations for compensation and pension purposes, Experience has sho}rn that the Vietnam Era vet- eran isnlorc a]>t oftreatment before itscompletion. To best nleet the needs ofthis veteran, programs have been created using younger staff members as therapists, tllercl~) ilnlJro\\ill~ cf)llllll[lllic:ltiotl. Tl~e complicated factor of drug mis[lse has in- creasingly identified and newer todeal there were many {Iemancls for treatment Ivith this drug long before itrras released bythe Foocl and Drug ,Aclministration and long before suppliesofthe were available. Inresponse tothis stimu- lus, alimited type ofstudy program was instituted with the help ofseveral VA consultants and the aid ofadrug manufacturer. The study was con- d~lcted atten VA hospitals. The experience with this program provided the background needed for the treatment programs now getting tinder r\\ray following release ofL-DOPA. Inthe early treatment, detailed inpatient evaluation and supervision will berequired. This must befol- lo~ved by careful supervision and frequent dosage adjustment on an outpatient basis over aperiod ofmany years. Psychology-Through atreatment technique in- volving economies, ne~~' l~ope isbeing given tomany process, self-confidence isstrength- ened, faith intl~e environment increased, and op- timism about the future developed. The value of the approach has been substantiated. Patients with many years ofcontinuing hospitalization are de- ~eloping behavior patterns that permit them to leave institutionalized settings or function with greatly increased freedom and self-responsibility. The Vietnam era veteran has been viewed asa major challenge by VA psychologists. Several im- portant factors and social changes inthe American society; the prolonged and inconclusive nature ofthe Vietnam conflict; and the fact that agreater portion nave sustained, and survived serious physical disabilities and emotional trauma from combat experience. Of critical importance isthe need tobegin the rehabilitation process assoon aspossible after ad- mission tocounteract the psychological shock of being disabled and todevelop apersonally mean- ingful plan for the future. Pathology and Allied Sciences\u2014The continued increased demand for clinical laboratory support reflected the <greater reliance on laboratory proce- dures indiagnosing disease and monitoring therapy, the introduction ofnew procedures, the spreading use ofbattery testing and the establishment ofmore sl~ecialiled ]Iledical services.

In fiscal year 1970, atotal of4,050,000 examinations of inpatients and outpatients ~vere performed and ap- proximately eleven million x-ray films were l>rocessed. Because ofthe acceleration has been inmuch greater demand. The Veterans Aclrninistration has made every effort toupdate radiological facilities and thereby permit the hospitals tomeet the increasing demands placed llpOIl them. Inthe field ofx-ray therapy, supervoltage therapy has become amajor treatment modality for cancer and related disorders. This type oftreatment isthe preferred method ofx-ray therapy for deep seated malignancies and refers totherapy inthe multi- Inillion volt range. The equipment used includes cobalt units, betatrons and linear accelerators. Nine- teen such units are now inoperation. Dentistry\u2014Hospital dental staffs continue tocon- tribute tothe early recognition and control oforal malignancies through routine dental examinations ofall hospitalized veterans. During the year 485 oral malignancies were initially recognized by VA dentists. Inan effort toimprove health care delivery VA dental facilities continued tobeupgraded. Thirty- four VA hospitals ~vere providecl equipment with operatories for of 4-hancled (sit-down) dentistry. As a byproduct ofthis upgrading, the facilities are made more attractive torecent dental school graduates.

Social Work-The trend toward shorter periods of hospitaliza~ion has increased the demands on social work.

The use offoster homes and surro- gate homes forgroup living isbeing tested atseveral ofthe VA Ilospitals ~i'ith spinal cord services. For the patient, the ofpa- tient care otltsi(le [Ile llosl~ital has I)eetl ino~~eration since 1951. Each year the numbers have increased. Illfiscal year 1970, 17,829 improved psychiatric pa- tients o~vn ~lnder the nledical, surgical, and neurological pa- tients 17,135 patients were placed from the hospital into community care homes during fiscal year 1970. \"I-he majority ofthe patients, 9,020 were placed in VA paid placement homes. Inaddition tothis 17,135, there were another 5,515 already in community care homes and receiving supervision. Thus, atotal of40,479 veteran patients, con- sidered byVA hospital staff asable tolive outside the hospital but not completely equal toorready tocope with full independence, were enabled tolive inthe communit~' inhomes other than their own dtlring fiscal year 1970. VA social workers engaged incovering large geo- graphical areas toprovide direct services tonon- l~ospitalized \\eterans.

Medical Education andTraining VA hospitals and clinics participated significantly inthe education ancl training ofhealth service per- sonnel. Such education ancl training constitutes an essential element inthe triad ofpatient care, re- search and education. Simultaneously, through its training acllievcnlents on behalf ofveterans' medi- cal care, the Veterans Administration helps meet ,4merica's acute health manpower shortages. Inits1970 \"h~anpo~ver Report ofthe President,\" the Department ofLabor stated that \"in some of the allied health occupations, the personnel short- age can be tracecl tolimited training facilities.\" Itisprecisely inmeeting this national deficiency that the Veterans Administration has great capa- bility. In this regard, President Nixon, inastate- ment on veterans' medical care, made on April 2, 1970, said: Fuller reliance onthe VA's system of166 hospitals for medical education purposes would not only improve the VA's position\u2014as aconsumer of health services personnel-but would also help the entire nation meet its requirements inthe health manpo~ver area.

Trainees are provided var>'ing portions\u2014in some cases all-of the clinical instruction needed for certification orother recognition intheir assigned in\"witl~out compensation\" status.

During fiscal year 1970, VA hospitals and clinics provided training to49,051 persons. Supplementing tile \"reg~]lar\" V,AI progranls received novice health service training and \\\\'ork experience under VA auspices. The present shortage ofhealth manpower inthe Nation has been estimated atabout 482,000, while the shortage by 1980 has been estimated at about 725,000.

For one, industry isnow using four times more silver than the country produces.

The Veterans Administration was the recipient oftwo large donations during the year.

More than 50percent ofthe Agency's outlays are accounted for by compensation and pension pay- ments. The growth ofthis program over the past few years, both interms ofrecipients and dollars expended has been rather startling, In fiscal year 1960 less than 4million cases were on the rolls ata cost of$3.3 IJilliono In1!)65, over 4.5 nlillion veterans and their survivors were receiving just slightly over $4billion. Atthe end ofthe current fiscal year over 4.7 million ~eterans and their survivors received compensation and pension benefits ofalmost $5.4 billion. The dual programs, compensation for disabled veterans ancl the survivors ofthese veterans, and pension for needy veterans and their dependents varies inmagnitude clepending upon the period of service the veteran was engaged in. While pro- grams under one period ofservice may beincreasing others are declining. Vietnam EraService One ofthe most significant reasons for the growth ofthe colll~~ensation program has been the Vietnanl era Veterans. Ayear ago 95,000 such veterans were drawing com~}ensation. Today 1970 the number was 38,200, anet increase of10,200. The status ofthe conflict, even atalo~ver level ofactivity, will continue to produce casualties that can result ineventual com- pensation payments. The average age ofthe Viet- veteran-25.5 years foretells aconsi~lerable period oftime. The other part the pension pro- gram, islittle inflllenced todate bythe Vietnam era veteran. Onl}r 1,400 veterans with Vietnam era serv- ice were on the pension rolls and only 3,300 de-VIETNAM ERACOMPENSATION CASES tso 100Living 01969 1970 ceased age ofthe Vietnam era veteran, I\\ToLlld inmost cases preclude him from being inneed and qualifying for pension payments.

Since June 30, 1955 the number ofthese veterans on the rolls has increased by 55 percent. Korean conflict veterans receiving pension payments have likewise continued toincrease over the years, although itis still only aslnall ofdeceased conflict veterans whose dependents tvere receiving compensation, seems tohave peaked inthe past few itflrol~ 0[ successive year such atrend ~vas reported.

Inaddi- tion, certain i}eacetime veterans receive compensa- tion payments. Disability compensation ispaid toboth wartime and peacetin~e ~'eterans. Disability compensation ~>aynlents resulting from peacetime service are 80 percent oftile wartime rates. Wartime rates range from $23 for a10percent disability to$400 for a100 percent rating. These basic rates can beincreased rates for loss attendance 50 percent orgreater dis- :Ibility are increased by:~llo~vances for dependents. The concept of compensation for survivors of veterans was substantially changed by Public Law !11-96, effecti~e December noadditional amounts for children except under certain condi- tions. Under the new la~v, aspecified dollar rate is paid based on the pay grade ofthe veteran ranging from $167 nlonthly for awidow ofaveteran in E-1, to$426 for atvidow ofaveteran in grade O-1 O.Anew provision also provides for an additional $20 nlonthly for each child. There is also aprovision for an additional $50 monthIy l~enefit payable to a~vidow receiving service- connected death when she isapatient ina nursing hon~e, or inneed ofregular aid and at- tendance. Itisestimated that about 160,000 widows arc receiving increased monthly payments asare- sult ofthe provision ofthis new law. Several minor pieces oflegislation were adopted during the year. They included the liberalized rec- ognition ofan adopted indemnity compensation payments incertain circumstances where an in-service waiver was in force on his government life insurance and amore equitable adjustment inthe method ofrecouping severence pay. Guardianship One oftile programs that continues togrow sig- nificantly isthe guardianship program. For the men- tally incapable ofadministering their affairs, close supervision toestate adminis-tration, coupled ~t'ith personal contacts toassure the beneficiary's wellbeing. For minor beneficiaries, the approach, ~vllile protective in nature, ispri- marily directed toward assurance ofadequate pro- vision for immediate needs and continuation ofedu- cation through high school. Inthe past four years 184,000 beneficiaries have been adclecl tothe program; 40,000 inthe pieces oflegislation enactecl into la\\v during fiscal year 1970 was the Veterans Education and Training Amendments Act. Signed bythe President inlate hiarch itopened the \\vay rent ofspecial assistance for educa- tionally veterans.

Participation Education and training\u2014Since the current educa- tion program began inJune 1966, through the end ofJune 1970, more than 1,859,000 veterans and servicemen entered training. At the completion in June 1970 offour years ofthe current GI Bill, one offour veterans ofthe Vietnam Era haspartici- pated. Itisexpected that, asinthe World War II program, one oftwo veterans currently returning from service eventually will take training under the current program. When comparing the over-all participation rate \\ritll previous programs, two key factors must be considered: one, the current eligible population in- cludes those~vhor~'ereseparated from service longbefore the program wasenacted prior toenactment) andfor aslong these older ~'eterans are less likely toenter training now. And two, the total includes recently discharged veterans Jvho have not completed their plans toenter train- ing, but who will later enter insubstantial numbers. By far the most popular type oftraining has been higher education. Nlore than amillion veterans and servicemen, nearly 55percent ofall trainees, have used their entitlement tostudy atthe college TYPES OFTRAINING POSTKOREAN VETERANS ANDSERVICEMEN JobTraining A~rerttb OthrI I /////m/m/el///fa////a //////fl/fl/////m I I The most popular courses atboth the college and below college level were inthe field ofbusiness and commerce. About 18percent ofthose taking college work have been inthis field and nearly 25 percent ofthose below college level. Another popu- lar field ofstucly atthe below college level has been electrical and electronic courses. Over 150,000 vet- erans and servicemen took some training in this area. Flight training, only available since October 1967, has attracted more than 60,200 veterans and servicemen todate. Over 138,000 servicemen have entered training in the four year period ofthe current education bill. 35The vast majority of these servicemen have en- rolled incorrespondence courses, almost two out ofevery three. ln fact, servicemen accounted for 39 perce]lt cotlrse enroll- ment under tl~e program. Likewise, 75percent of the servicemen are pursuing courses below the college level, compared to31percent for veterans. Educational assistance for clependents assists both children and wives and widows. During fiscal year 1970 nearly 45,400 children, ofdeceased ortotally disabled veterans received training, an increase of 2,100over fiscal year 1969. To date nearly 151,000 have trained under this program. Educational assistance for ~vives of 100 percent disabled veterans and wido~vs ofdeceased veterans, only available since December 1968, has shown a steady increase inenrollment. Through June 1970, over 7,600 ~vives and widows had entered training. Of this number, 55 percent ~vere in college and university level courses. Another ofthe changes enacted by the Veterans Education and Training .4mendments Act was the computation ofeducational assistance allowance for the rate ofpayment was inmany cases, l~igl~er than salaries earned byskilled professionals inlaw, banking and medicine. Vocational Rehabilitation Casualties from the war in Vietnam have in- creased tl~e nunlber ofveterans receiving vocational rehabilitation training. In fiscal year 1970, 24,457 veterans trained under this program, 29 percent more than infiscal year 1969. Nearly 94percent of these tvere Post-Korean veterans, and more thantwo out 01 three Tt'ere Vietnatn era veterans. Asarule, veterans under tl~is program train ona full-tinle l]asis. However, since JLIly 1968the law was Almost 3,200 oftile veterans intraining ~vere on apart- time basis during fiscal year 1970. Counseling Vocational and educational counseling isdesigned toassist VA l)eneficiaries inchoosing avocation prepare them for ~vork in their chosen vocation. Itwas first introduced inthe vocational rehabilitation pro- gram, toenable each disabled veteran tobenefit from tl~e advice ofaskilled counselor, The veteran isguided to~vard an occupation compatible with his disability and inaccord with his interests and abilities, Then lleisaicied inplanning acourse of training preparing him for ~vork inhis chosen field. Whenever possible this counseling isgiven inmili- tary hospitals todisablecl servicemen awaiting dis- charge. This often helps tofree the serviceman from undue anxiety about his future disabled veterans received vocational counseling during the fiscal year. The success ofcounseling inguiding disabled veterans toaproductive civilian life led toits in- troduction into the other VA education programs. Counseling isnolv required for prospective trainees ~lnder tile ~v;ir educational assistance program. O\\'er ZA,000 ofthis latter group received counseling during the year, along with 22,000 sons and daughters and wives and widows. 36Housing Assistance Loans toVeterans During fiscal year Private lenders loaned $3.68 billion toover 186,000 veterans tobuy or build ilomes, tvith VA acting asguarantor ofthe loans. Inaddition, 8,500 bought homes with the assistance ofdirect loans lrom VA totaling al]ollt $11'1 l~~illion. These direct loans are made toveterans living in rural areas where private capital for guaranteed loans isnot generally available. The younger post-Korean veterans continued to obtain alarger ~~crce~ltage ofVA IIonle loans. l)ur- ing fiscal year 1970, 73percent ofthe loans made went topost-Korean veterans and servicemen, up fronl 68percent the previous year. Nleanwhile, loans 67 66 69 70 FiscalYoorImpact ofCapital Market Conditions The VA loan guaranty program was operating llnder very adl'erse capital market conditions of credit stringency and high interest rates during the year. Competing demands for capital exerted strong pressures onthe availability offunds for investment inresidential mortgages. The strong demands were reflected inhigher interest rates and yields on U.S Government, municipal and corporate bonds, and VA, FHA, and conventional mortgages throughout n)ost of the year. These increases rendered the ~naximurn permissible interest rate on VA guaran- teed loans-7 l/Qpercent-uncompetitive and ineffec- the VA in- creased to81/z percent the maximum permissible rate. Conc~lrrently, the interest rate on VA direct loans and on vendee accounts wasincreased to81/2 percent. lnspite ofthe adjustment inthe VA loan rate, however, the scarcity and high cost ofmortgage funds brought about aclecrease inthe number and amount ofg~laranteecl loans. The 186,000 guaran- teed loans closed during fiscal year 1970 represent adecrease of33,000 from fiscal year 1969. The ag- gregate value ofguaranteed loans dropped $334 million. The amount ofdirect loans also de- creased noticeably infiscal year 1970. The 8,500 direct loans disbursed during the year and their aggregate value ofabout $114 million are both more than 20percent below the corresponding figures for the previous year. VARoleinDisaster Relief During the weeks immediately following hurri- cane Camille, the Veterans Administration extended several kincls ofhousing assistance tovictims ofthe storm: (1) victims atnominal rates; (2) vet- erans whose homes were totally destroyed became eligible for new GI loans; (3) forbearance was ex- tended toborrowers who were temporarily unable tomeet mortgage teed loan cases; (5) supplemental loans were made for emergency repairs not covered byinsurance, and pri~ate lenders montl~s the Veterans .Administration gave similar assistance to~ictims oftl~e Lubbock tornado.

PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT Employment ofVeterans ByExecutive Order, authorization has been given toFederal Agencies tomake Veteran Readjustment appointments for Vietnam Era veterans. The Vet- erans i4clministration played aleading role inef- forts that led tothe development and issllance of this order. This new authority represents an im- provecl method for providing employment oppor- ttlnities, coupled ~vith training oreducation for re- turning veterans who need special assistance inmak- ing the transition from military life tosatisfying civilian careers. During the year ending June 30, 1970 the Veterans Administration appointed 327 \\'ietnanl Era veterans uncier s[lcll special a(ltllorities. Adminis- tration continued high.

Equal Employment Opportunity .~ffirmati~e action inthe area ofEqual Employ- ment Opportunity has enabled the Veterans Ad- ministration tomaintain minority employment at about 30 percent ofthe work force, with Negro employment inexcess of26 percent. Through re- design ofjobs, and various training programs, em- ployees ~t'ere given the opportunity toperfect their ones. Asaconsequence, inthe past t~ro and ahalf years minority employment at the GS-5/8 grade levels has increased by almost 2,700 employees. Likewise, minority employment inthe GS-9\\ 11levels increased by665 and inthe GS-12 and above levels byalmost 200. Xlinority employees in Wage System positions also benefited from the efforts toward upward mo- bility. During this period the number ofminority employees in the $6,500-7,999 level increased by 3,912, while 1,620 employees achieved the $8,000 and above salary level.

Coordinated Federal Wage System The two-year implementation program of the Coordinated Federal Wage System (CFWS) for VA's trades, crafts, and manual laborer employees was nearly completed atthe close ofthe fiscal year. All except seven hospitals inthe VA system had been converted to the CFWS. This new system alleviates the services toveterans and their beneficiaries, abotlt 42,000 employees received for- mal training (one day ormore) during the year.

Over 200 VA phy- sicians, nurses, ~vard clerks and laboratory tech- nicians received special orientation and training in tile autonlated asl~ects ofclinical laboratory systems incertain VA hospitals. Nearly 200 other employees received training inadvanced systems analysis and design, cost benefit analysis, and other specialized subjects given by other agencies, universities and equipnlent man~lfacturers.

(2) portfolio Loan System\u2014During year 1970, the conversion ofall portfolio loans\u2014about 308,000\u2014to aninterim system for maintaining loan accounting records was completed. This system automatically generates the nlonthly bills for bor- ro~vers and provides accounting reports and de~relopnlent oftl~e pernla- nent system Tvhich ofthe interim system isproceeding ac- cording toschec~ule. (3) Veterans Assistance Discharge System (VADS)\u2014This automated system inoperation over t~ro years uses comptlter toinform advantage ofthe educational oppor- tunities open to them. Through the end ofthe fiscal year, the system has produced over 1.8million letters and, 1.4 million packets containing informa- tion on the continuation ofservice life insurance. (4) ADP Allotment Operations\u2014The objective ofthis project istoconvert the Government life insurance reporting system between the Service ele- ments ofthe Department opera- tion toamagnetic tape system. The U.S. Coast Guard, Air Force and Marine Corps accounts have been successfully converted tothe new system. The changeover of the Army and Navy accounts is awaiting further action bythose Service arms. The new operating process isfaster, more accurate andgenerally nlore efficient than the one itreplaced. (5) Automated Hospital Information System (AHIS)\u2014Several phases of this system de- signed toredtlce tl~e paper~~-ork involt\"ed inl~andling J.arious patient care functions were operational by the end ofthe fiscal year. These phases are patient admission and discharge, patient census and bed control, ~)rocessing requests and scheduling ofX-ray examinations and the reporting ofresults, schedul- ing and controlling dental examinations, and re- porting various laboratory test results. kfany other subsystems are inthe process ofdevelopment. (6) Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data Pay System. (PAID)\u2014This system, ~vhich auto- matically processes the payroll and personnel ac- tions for over 165,000 VA employees and performs many subsidiary functions, was utilized toaccom- modate the 1969 and 1970 Federal pay increases. Itwas also modified during the year tohandle the con~'ersion of3,000 VA canteen employees tothe centralized payroll system and the conversion of 35,000\" \"per hour\" employees tothe new Coordi- nated Federal Tlrage System. (7) Computer Relative Allocation of Facilities Technique (CRAFT) \u2014This technique will assist VA architects in the preparation ofblock plans sllo~ring tile size and placement ofdepartments, lo- cation ofcirculation rotltes and the placement of entrances. Progress continued inthe development ofseveral other systems and tecl~niques: (1) Clinical Laboratory Data Processing Systems \u2014Efforts are well underway inseveral VA hospitals todevelop .4DP systems tocope with the data- handling problems associated with constantly in- creasing laboratory ~rorkloads. These automated systenls }rill accelerate the flow oftest result data betlveen the laboratories and the hospital wards, substantially recluce record keeping ancl accomplish other laboratory functions far more efficiently and more quickly than under the former systems. (Z) Bio-Physical Monitoring System\u2014This infor- mation processing system isbeing developed to monitor critically ill patients placed in intensive care units. Special instrumentation will transmit the physiological activity ofpatients toacomputer and after processing, back to display devices at monitoring stations and the bedside for prompt ac- tion bymedical personnel.
