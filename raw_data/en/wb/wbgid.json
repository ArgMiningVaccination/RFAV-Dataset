It is designed to help frontline clinical staff provide 'on the day' efficient and safe COVID-19 immunisation. Summary of recent changes to guidance Post vaccination wait reduced to 15 minutes. Extended post vaccination wait times still apply for those at higher risk of anaphylaxis (page 7). Age for vaccination reduced to from 12 years (page 5). Spacing between COVID-19 vaccine doses extended for most people (page 5). It is recommended but not essential to maintain spacing between COVID-19 and other vaccines (page 5). Review requirement for vaccine preparation quality assurance/ error prevention (page 3). Updated resources now available to reflect changes above ( covid.immune.org.nz ). Updated COVID-19 chapter published in the Immunisation Handbook 2020 (tinyurl.com/7sjhm5d5). Clarification on recording expiry dates into CIR off the vaccine box not the vial (page 6).

Each shipment contains detailed instructions on managing these loggers. North Island deliveries will have a logger with a flashing light. Check that this is flashing green. DO NOT press any buttons on the logger. If the light is flashing red, quarantine the Credo-Cube in your vaccine fridge and contact: covid-19.logistics@health.govt.nz or call 0800 335 778. South Island deliveries will have a logger that will show a symbol if the cold chain is intact. If there is a X symbol, quarantine the Credo-Cube in your vaccine fridge and contact: covid-19.logistics@health.govt.nz or call 0800 335 778. Cold chain documentation REMINDER: All cold chain documentation must be kept safely for 10 years. If paper documents are scanned onto a computer, ensure the file is backed up by an external server or cloud-based IT system. 1 32Initial actions when cold chain breaches arise within a clinical setting Clearly label the vaccines 'NOT FOR USE'. Inform clinic staff.If the refrigerator is NOT within the +2\u00b0 to +8\u00b0 range, look for obvious reversible causes (e.g. door open, power interruption, ice buildup). Download your datalogger and inform your Clinical Lead and contact your local IMAC COVID-19 Facilitator or Regional Advisor.The next step may include packing labelled vaccines into a chilly bin, with a temperature monitoring device and transportation to your backup refrigeration provider (details are in your cold chain policy). DO NOT discard any vaccine without written advice from IMAC.COVID-19 IMMUNISATION CLINICAL TOOLKIT | SEPTEMBER 20213 IMAC06/2021SECTION 2 | VACCINE PREPARATION (1) See Instructions for multi-dose vial Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine: preparation and administration (tinyurl.com/e78bm3jr). Keep the vaccine preparation area free of dust and distractions . Prepare vaccine as needed, including the syringes, needles and saline that will be used immediately. Ensure appropriate time is allocated for vaccine draw up. Keep a log of staff roles for vaccine preparation and checking. At least two appropriately trained staff need to work together and independently check each other's work. Do not interrupt the vaccine preparation process until all vaccine is in the syringes and appropriately labelled. Never dilute a vial that has already had the top removed. To prevent errors, reject vaccine, deface the vial and start preparing with a sealed vial. Finish this process before handover to the next shift. Keep records identifying the time each vial has been out of the cold chain prior to dilution, and to confirm it has been used within max 6 hours post dilution. It is recommended that vaccines are prepared as needed and used as close to vaccine preparation time as practical. Ensure that every used vial is defaced and removed from the vaccine preparation table. Keep records identifying the number of doses per vial is within the expected range as per guidance. Reconcile the number of doses administered against the number of vials used. Labelling the vaccine: - Each vaccine needs to be supplied with a label with vaccine batch number and expiry date (from box, not vial) and time of expiry (6 hours from the time of dilution). - Also provide the diluent type and expiry date. - Initials of individuals who checked and who prepared the vaccine. - If several syringes have been drawn up from the same vial you could group them together in a sealed box or plastic bag with one label but do not combine more than one vial's worth and if splitting up doses each must be labelled. Larger patients will need 21-25G x 1.5\" 38mm length. See here (tinyurl.com/4m2fy46j) for size estimation guidance. Each vaccinator should have at least one longer needle available. Utilise safety huddles. These are a brief ( 10 minutes), focused exchange of information about potential or existing safety risks and any relevant programme updates which may affect consumers, staff and any person accessing the healthcare environment. Put clear processes in place to ensure vaccination staff are not interrupted in their processes, especially during vaccine preparation. Ensure regular task rotation and breaks to mitigate against the risk of fatigue or lapses in process checking. Ensure clear SoPs describe particulars.The following actions are recommended at all COVID-19 immunisation venues:COVID-19 IMMUNISATION CLINICAL TOOLKIT | SEPTEMBER 20214 IMAC06/2021SECTION 2 | VACCINE PREPARATION (2) Supplies Logistics supply syringes and needles. Currently supplies are: Item Number To be used for 25G 25mm Standard Orange 1165011 Diluting 25G 25mm LDS Needle Orange Drawing up vaccine Unifix 1ml Luer 1165013 One use only dilution Longer 38mm needles for larger arms : These are currently only available from Logistics in 21G. For patient comfort, providers are encouraged to source narrow gauge needles from Onelink. Where possible order 23G 38mm but 22G 38mm is also preferable to the Logistics 21G supply. This is a temporary problem, with an expected shipment of LDS 23g 38mm needles expected toward end of September or start of October. IMPORTANT : Remember to use the Orange standard needles for diluting the vaccine NOT the 21G larger needles or you may end up with rubber debris in the vial and the vaccine being wasted.COVID-19 IMMUNISATION CLINICAL TOOLKIT | SEPTEMBER 20215 IMAC06/2021SECTION 3 | PRE-VACCINATION INCLUDING SCREENING AND CONSENT (1) See Pre vaccination screening, guidance for regulated vaccinators (tinyurl.com/vdfbm6). Pre-booking screening Age 12+? From the 18/08/21 those aged from 12 years can be vaccinated Had a COVID-19 vaccine either in NZ or overseas?Is this their first or second vaccine? 2nd dose spacing is recommended to be at least 6 weeks [42 days], OR a minimum of 21 days if needing earlier protection. Day 0 is the vaccination day. Vaccination at less than 21 days is not recommended and would be off-label use (i.e. unapproved by Medsafe). Currently there is no maximum spacing although people are advised not to delay their second dose. If they have had vaccines abroad see Immunisation Handbook guidance on whether further doses are needed. Other vaccines and COVID-19 vaccine REMINDER: There are no safety concerns giving mRNA-CV vaccine even if other scheduled vaccines have been given in the last two weeks. Other medical conditions? Anaphylaxis to a previous dose of mRNA-CV vaccines, or any component of it, is a contraindication. There are no medical conditions that exclude someone from having the vaccination. Patients with a history of allergies/ anaphylaxis need to discuss this with the vaccinator at the vaccination appointment. See Screening and guidance (tinyurl.com/vdfbm6). Immunosuppressed patients may wish to discuss with their specialist to establish any spacing requirement to gain best benefit from the vaccine. Defer the second dose if myocarditis occurs after the first dose of mRNA-CV. Seek further advice from IMAC. Previous COVID-19 disease? For people who have had COVID-19 disease, vaccination is recommended to be given from 4 weeks after recovery, or from the first confirmed positive PCR test if asymptomatic, and when cleared to leave isolation by a clinician. See 5.5.3 of Immunisation Handbook. There are no safety concerns. It is not known how long protection from having the disease will last so vaccination is still recommended. Other questions? Check out IMAC Frequently asked questions (covid.immune.org.nz/faq) Pre-vaccination screening Important updated information for all vaccinators in Screening and Guidance (tinyurl.com/vdfbm6). Please download for regular reference. This form supports vaccinations with screening, consent and post vaccination advice. Note new content: Includes updates on screening questions and guidance plus information on consent for those aged 12+, post vaccination advice re: myocarditis risk, and blood sugar management for diabetics.COVID-19 IMMUNISATION CLINICAL TOOLKIT | SEPTEMBER 20216 IMAC06/2021SECTION 3 | PRE-VACCINATION INCLUDING SCREENING AND CONSENT (2) Pregnancy People who are pregnant are encouraged to get a COVID-19 vaccine. For more information, see updated IMAC COVID-19 vaccination, pregnancy and lactation factsheet (tinyurl.com/y9vzv8aa) Second dose following AEFI to first If you have concerns as to whether someone is safe to receive their second vaccine, please contact IMAC (0800 466 863) to discuss the AEFI. For further information and guidance on managing and reporting AEFIs, please see: Clinical review of early onset AEFIs (tinyurl.com/5ctt7yan) and/or Clinical review of late onset AEFIs (tinyurl.com/5yt6t298). Informed consent Informed consent is a legal requirement of the vaccination process. Consent can be given by anyone who is deemed to be competent to understand that they have a choice, the reason for the vaccination, its benefits, and potential risks balanced against the risk of the disease. Consent for 12-15 year olds We recommend young people discuss the vaccination with their whnau or a trusted support person. They can find more information about how the vaccine protects them and answers to questions they may have here (tinyurl.com/4wbvdca7). A health professional will discuss the vaccination with the young person prior to giving the vaccine. The health professional can also answer any questions, and if the young person has good understanding, the young person can say yes or no to getting the vaccine themselves. A parent or caregiver can also provide consent. The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is not approved for individuals aged 11 years and younger. Consent for patients who do not have the capacity themselves to consent may be given by: A welfare guardian appointed under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 An attorney under an activated enduring power of attorney in respect of care and welfare. If there is no welfare guardian or attorney under an enduring power of attorney, then: - The treatment must be in the best interests of the patient; and - Attempts were made to find out what the patient would have wanted if s/he were competent; or - If it is not possible to find out what the patient would have wanted, the views of people interested in the patient's welfare have been considered. See more on Section 2.1.2 of the Immunisation Handbook 2020 (tinyurl.com/4jn5atet). Vaccine hesitant For practices engaging with people who are hesitant to be vaccinated, see The Workshop guide How to Talk About COVID-19 Vaccinations (tinyurl.com/98mjzprd).

Locating correct injection site Clinical leads: Please check all vaccinators are aware of how to identify correct location to avoid administering the vaccine incorrectly. The vaccinee should be seated with their arm removed from their clothing and relaxed at their side. 1. Find acromion process (the highest point on the shoulder) and the deltoid tuberosity (the lower deltoid attachment point). 2. The injection site is central to these two landmarks in the bulkiest part of the muscle. 3. Administer intramuscularly at 90-degree angle to the skin plane. 4. Inject the vaccine smoothly, pause before needle withdrawal to prevent tracking of vaccine.Needle size and guide Standard needle size is 25G x 25mm (orange in both LDS and standard). These are suitable for most of the population including those aged 12+. Bunching the skin helps in those with very thin arms . Those with very large arms may require a 38mm needle if pulling the skin taught does not reduce the depth of the adipose tissue enough. The COVID-19 vaccine is not licenced for subcutaneous injection . It is important to select correct length of needle to ensure appropriate uptake of vaccine and to minimise localised reactions. If a longer needle is required then the vaccine must be drawn up using the 38mm needle so the needle hub contains vaccine. If needles are swapped the dose administered is lessened due to the volume of vaccine lost in the needle. Change in time for observation period after vaccine The observation period after COVID-19 vaccinations is now a minimum of 15 minutes instead of 20 minutes. Other countries also use a minimum 15-minute observation time, such as United Kingdom and United States. Post COVID-19 vaccination advice Reminder of need to stay for at least 15 minutes for observation. Anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to any product in the past must be closely observed for 30 minutes. Discussion of possible expected side effects and advise use of paracetamol or other analgesia for pain, fever, or discomfort and how and where to seek help including Healthline and use of GP, 111. Seek medical advice for any unexpected concerns including chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. For those who have insulin-dependent diabetes, discuss the need to closely monitor blood sugars for next few days, as high or low sugars can occasionally be a side effect of the vaccine. Supply information on how and when to make a second appointment. Axilla lineAcromion Process Deltoid TuberosityInjection site This method avoids the subacromial bursa, the axillary nerve and the humeral artery located in the midpoint which can lead to vaccine injury. If deltoid administration is not indicated due to medical reasons, the vastus lateralis (thigh) can be used by an experienced vaccinator. Contact 0800 IMMUNE for more guidance.COVID-19 IMMUNISATION CLINICAL TOOLKIT | SEPTEMBER 20218 IMAC06/2021SECTION 5 | ADVERSE EVENTS Those who have had a previous anaphylaxis allergic reaction to ANYTHING should wait 30 minutes post-vaccination.
