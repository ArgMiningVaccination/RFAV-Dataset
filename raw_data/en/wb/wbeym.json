Since then, impr oved transpor t options and incr eased wealth have led to a decline in their use, but with the launch of Mobik e in Tianjin last month, the number of people pedalling the streets of the cit y are set to incr ease once again. T he popularit y of companies lik e Mobike is par t of a boom in what is loosely called ' the sharing econom y', a term f or a range of online ser vices that connec ts owners of underused assets with others who ar e willing to pay to use them. O f course, riding someone else' s bike for an hour doesn' t have the same r omantic connotations that is implied by K atie's song . Love is one area where sole ownership is still pr eferred, but f or a growing range of transpor t, accommodation and oce spaces , people ar e incr easingly choosing to shar e. The principle is , why pay through the nose f or something when you can r ent it mor e cheaply fr om a stranger online? Ride Sharin g Bike sharing is not new to citie s, but Mobike and rivals of o bik e both intr oduce the convenience that instead of having to collec t the bic ycle fr om and r eturn it to a station, it can be left anywher e legal and accessible to other users . China 's Mobik e said it plans to introduce 100,000 bik es to Tianjin this year . With similar companies pr oviding bik es too , the number hitting the str eets must be colossal. The visible e ect is brightly colour ed bicycles incr easingly littering the pavements of most major cities . Velib, set up in 2007 in P aris, was one the Kto watch golf and play bridge. There's a whole world of things going on ar ound us that w e've discover ed thr ough our guests .\" It's not just the lower price compar ed with conventional hotels that 's attrac tive. Guests get a unique experience, meeting local people who k now about the best r estaurants and places to visit and advice on local amenities . Feedback fr om guests shows they appr eciate the hospitalit y and the time shar ed with the hosts . The personal interac tion allows travellers to get closer and deeper into a local cultur e than would be possible fr om a hotel or a tour gr oup. The hosts too , develop a net work of lik eminded spirits that intr oduce r ecipr ocal experiences . Ms Liu said one of their rst guests was a vegan chef who runs a r etreat in Wales. As a Buddhist herself , Ms Liu hopes to return the visit in futur e. In the sharing economy space has become a commodity , empt y driveways in congested cities ar e being r ented out as car parking spaces . Co-pilot 's seats on private jets can be book ed as super taxis and houses empt y during the day can be used as oce spaces . This is the idea behind a cr op of companies that wants to adapt the Airbnb model to the needs of people look ing for a temporar y place to wor k.

The company has r ecently expanded the same principle to Autolib, an elec tric car sharing ser vice. The Autolib scheme maintains a fleet of all- electric cars f or public use on a paid subscription basis , employing a cit ywide net work of park ing and charging stations . While the use of these cars and bik es is a form of sharing , the bik es and cars ar e owned by the r enting compan y. The ride sharing service Uber allows people to r equest a trip and aler ts the near est registe red driver to the customer 's location. Uber don' t own any cars themselves , the drivers use their own vehicles . Launched in 2011, within 4 years it had completed over a billion rides . Uber is used in many countries , predominantly in large cities , as an alternative to traditional taxis . Similar schemes exist in other countries , including Didi Chuxing in China. Although f ounded While strange at rst, shar ers become accustomed to the idea and the behaviour becomes to f eel mor e normal . As a r esult, the sharing experience is gradually changing attitudes in societ y and this r einforces behaviour . As An Haif eng, a 27-year- old lm school graduate say s, 'Before using Mobik e, I thought only poor people r ode bike s and the richer ones bought cars .

Another change noted by L ee, a r egular Airbnb user tak ing a year out to travel ar ound Asia, is that because many of the ser vices requir e users to leave r eviews , it has made us all into critics .

As well as managing all the book ing and payments , it provides statistics on the attr ibutes of those providing the utilit y and on those wanting to use it.

The review is the stick and carr ot that makes the whole system work . While the r eviews ar e added by r eal people, some attributes lik e response times and cancellations in Airbnb ar e measur ed automatically .

One of the gr eat benets of ride sharing apps is that it 's made getting a taxi much easier and cheaper , particularly at dicult times such as rush hour or late at night when fares can sometimes double. Uber and Didi rely on the idea that there are plent y of people nearby who ar e willing to mak e a bit ex tra money in their spar e time by using their car f or a spot of moonlighting . This is more in the spirit of the sharing economy than drivers who use it full time. A good example is M r Hu who works at the airpor t. His 36-k m drive, commuting to and fr om work ever y day, is an oppor tunity through Didi, to collec t others on the wa y. The app allows mor e than one person to shar e the ride and the passengers split the cost.

Home sharing Another phenomenal sharing success has been Airbnb . This matches people with spare bedr ooms and empt y homes to those needing a place to stay . It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries . It includes luxur y apar tments in top city centr es and beach fr onts, spec tacular accommodation on boats , or in castles , as well as mak e shift beds in shar ed bedsits . A quick sear ch on line shows ther e are nearly 300 listed places in Tianjin, ranging fr om a mattr ess on the floor f or less than 100RMB a night f or two people, to over 3000 RMB a night for a 6-bedr oom detached house.

By song , '9 million bicy cles' was penned in an age when China was k nown as 'the K ingdom of bicycles'. Since then, impr oved transpor t options and incr eased wealth have led to a decline in their use, but with the launch of Mobik e in Tianjin last month, the number of people pedalling the streets of the cit y are set to incr ease once again. T he popularit y of companies lik e Mobike is par t of a boom in what is loosely called ' the sharing econom y', a term f or a range of online ser vices that connec ts owners of underused assets with others who ar e willing to pay to use them. O f course, riding someone else' s bike for an hour doesn' t have the same r omantic connotations that is implied by K atie's song . Love is one area where sole ownership is still pr eferred, but f or a growing range of transpor t, accommodation and oce spaces , people ar e incr easingly choosing to shar e. The principle is , why pay through the nose f or something when you can r ent it mor e cheaply fr om a stranger online?

Sharing the back lash The sharing economy might seem lik e a perfect antidote to envir onmental and economic diculties , but it 's not without its problems and its critics . Velib had at least 3,000 bicycles stolen in the rst year of operation, and by August 2009, 80% of the total bik es introduced into ser vice had been r eplaced due to vandalism or theft. Stolen V\u00e9lib bic ycles turned up in shipping containers destined f or North Africa, and in cities as far away as Braov and Buchar est, Romania. Vandalized c ycles were sometimes thrown in the S eine R iver, or hung fr om lampposts . Sociologist Bruno Marzlo interpreted the vandalism rate as a symptom of r evolt against F rench societ y by the suburban and urban poor , especially immigrant youth resentful of what they per ceive as a privileged , urban, middle class that ar e seen as the principal users of the V\u00e9lib system. He described V\u00e9lib' vandalism as in par t \"a form of rebellion\" against social ex clusion. Most famous ar e the campaigns against Uber by taxi hailing companies ar ound the world. Uber is curr ently involved in at least 173 lawsuits and is banned in several cities , usually on the g rounds of saf ety, but the main concern is about unfair competition.

Velib had at least 3,000 bicycles stolen in the rst year of operation, and by August 2009, 80% of the total bik es introduced into ser vice had been r eplaced due to vandalism or theft. Stolen V\u00e9lib bic ycles turned up in shipping containers destined f or North Africa, and in cities as far away as Braov and Buchar est, Romania. Vandalized c ycles were sometimes thrown in the S eine R iver, or hung fr om lampposts . Sociologist Bruno Marzlo interpreted the vandalism rate as a symptom of r evolt against F rench societ y by the suburban and urban poor , especially immigrant youth resentful of what they per ceive as a privileged , urban, middle class that ar e seen as the principal users of the V\u00e9lib system.

From this perspec tive, embark ing on the journey to become a photographe r, lm pr oducer and cinematographer didn 't seem all that probable. It may have appear ed even less so when he began studying Tourism Management at Tianjin 's Universit y of Commer ce in 2000. Yet his life took a turn while attending college as he discover ed a re al passion fo r photograph y. By the time Vincent graduated in 2004 his career aspirations had strayed a long way fr om tourism. Unlik e most of his classmates who went on to wo rk at hot els, travel agencies or even in the government he loo ked for jobs related to photograph y. He caught his br eak by getting hired as a photo jour nalist for Tianjin 's Metr o Expr ess. He work ed ther e from 2004-2008. While covering the daily grind he discover ed a fe w topics he wanted to explor e more in-depth on his own time. In 2005 he cove red the topic of homosexualit y. He did so by documenting the lives of several homosexuals for about 2-3 years thr oughout the ar eas of Beijing , Tianjin and Hebei. Another Fphoto essay was done during the years of 2006-2007. He documented the telling tale of \"Cancer Villag e\" in Tianjin. These freelance projects helped unlock his potential as a photo journalist. 2008 mark ed another big change in Vincent 's care er.

A year in Hong Kong (2010-2011) did more than just help him earn a Master 's Degree. It provided an oppo rtunity to acquir e extensive knowledge on documenta ry produc tion. It also facilitated study under the leadership of Nanc y Tong a famous Hong Kong lm make r who was involved in the produc tion \"Who K illed Vincent Chin \". The universit y invited many famous lm ma kers as guests to interac t with the study body . For example Ruby Yang, a Chinese American lm make r. One year of study wasn 't enough.

In 2012 alone, appr oximately 30,000 students studied at \"Nine Beats\" through China. Vincent produced a documentar y entitled \"China 's Little Rock Star \".

In 2017 he has been involved in documenting China' s die rent NGOs and working on the CC TV Documenta ry Series - \"China 's Mega Project Season Thre e\". Vincent has come a long way since studying tourism in 2000. He decided to become a dir ector because of his interest in the social landscape of China and wanting to play a pa rt in documenting its change. For him videography is an ideal medium for doing so. He has been work ing fr eelance for years and has established himself a r espec ted cinematographer and di rector. He has yet to setup his own pro duction compan y; but sees this as a natural next step since having a legal entity is mandator y when entering into produc tion contrac ts with other companies.

(Photo pr ovided by Vincent Du) 2728BUSINESS BUSINESS ast month we report ed on AmCham China 's Business Climate Surv ey Repo rt Launch. There AmCham 's Tianjin Chapter Chairman Mr. Mar tin Winchell shared insight on how localization can lead to success despite changes in the investment climate. He stated the f ollowing in terms of foreign enterprises winning in China: \"The quicke r, the faster you can get to a localized pr oduc t and localized se rvice, then localized management. \" Martin went on to shar e: \"Five or six years ago you would talk about localizing a pr oduct or ser vice that you built in the US and now you ar e building pr oduct s that ar e specically designed and researched in China. \" These comments ar e wor th discussing as indeed some expat entr epreneurs may need to entir ely rethink their business strategy . Past vs. Presen t In decades past, China may have found its fame as a manufac turing countr y. This is the r esult of countless pr oduc ts being sold globally with the wo rds \"Made in China \" on them. Really though, China is n't just about mak ing other peoples pr oduc ts anymo re. For one thing , they ar e mak ing their own produc ts for their own consumers . An example of this is Xiaomi. They research, design and manufac ture in, fo r China. Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent also make the list in terms of top Chinese technology companies delivering core serv ices principally made with the Chinese user in mind . This is wher e foreign rms perhaps have the gr eatest challenge. They no longer are competing with other international brands in China, but rather with local brands . These local brands essentially have the home eld advantage. Particularly this is true culturally , linguistically and politically. The cultural barrier is bi g. It shows up in small things lik e drink ing hot beverages instead of cold . Bigger issues arise when tr ying to adjust to taboos and understanding the psychological back ground of festivals. Foreigners struggle to design pr oduc ts for Chinese since they ar en't Chinese. They have n't been raised in China and ther efore lack insight into the cor e cultur e as it happens within the home and thro ughout daily lif e. Even expats living in China are often disconnec ted with the \"real world\" due to being unable to read, wr ite waters ar e even deeper . In many cases politics and business are intermingled in China. Locals have been navigating these turbulent seas since infancy and often due so somewhat subconsciously wher eas expats nd it dicult to grasp wher e the re latively blurr y line exists. Not to mention, ther e are some political par tners that may be eternally out of reach if one is not a Chinese national and active in the Party. Localize via Locals Mr. Winchell there fore brings up a ve ry inter esting point by shining the light on \"localization \". Cultu re, language and politics are what they ar e. No matter how hard an expat tries to close the gap in terms of understanding and master ing these issues , they will still be playing catch up with those born and raised in China. Localization thus becomes a ke y strategy . That is because expats can employ and par tner with locals instead of simply competing with them. That's what Ma rtin's company is doing . He described the company stru cture as f ollows: \"In our company for an example we employee literally hundr eds of people but I'm the only expat in the compan y. I think f or us ve ry early we adopted the polic y that we were going to build for China. We use dierent technology than we use in the US. HR, all the func tions ar e built fo r China. There is nothing that we really bor rowed fr om the US other than some intellec tual pr oper ty and knowledge of our industr y. But everything else we built for China. I think that's been the ke y for our success and most companies that ha ve been successful is they 've learned to build for China and gotten away from trading with China. \" Foreign rms need to think seriously about how they will leverage a largely local team to research, design and build pr oduc ts or ser vices in China, fo r China. That 's a method fundamentally di erent than the old days wher e international brands simply tried to sell the \"same\" produc t that sold like hot cake s overseas to local Chinese consumer s. That model isn 't as prac tical as it used to be. Martin made that clear with this comment: \"I think for most companies now it 's no longer about trading with China but investing in China for the domestic market. \" Keep in mind Mr. Winchell also noted \"Chinese laws , regulations, [and] policies \" are maturing . Theref ore not only should fo reign rms be by Carmen Kingthinki ng about how they will localize produc ts, but also company bi-laws and legal policies . Instead of seeing China as the Wild West wher e anything goes , it is becoming incr easingly impor tant to know well and abide by Chinese la w. This is true especially f or expats . Foreign entr epreneurs should not expec t a \"get out of jail fr ee\" card if failing to meet regulations just because they ar en't Chinese. Even large foreign owned entities ar e realizing how impor tant localization is . Mr. Winchell cited this example: \"You just don' t hear people talk ing about GM localizing a Buick. Now they ar e basically r esear ching and developing cars in China. That's really a major shift in how people think about China. Even people like Nike often r elease their new pr oduc ts in China rst because they don't want them to be copied. They get to the market her e rst and then deal with the rest of the worl d.\" So regar dless of company size, expats need to be China savvy . This means , stop relying on a translator and being driven around by a driver who you ca n't even communicate with fr eely. It is denitely time for foreign owners to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirt y so to speak . They need to ca reful they ar en't tak ing tips fr om so-called exper ts who have never even spent a day in China. R ather , star t living and working in China fo r real. This means less time hang ing out with other expats . Instea d, spend mor e time mastering the Chinese language and collaborating with locals . As William Zarit the Chairman of AmCham China mentioned: \"We have man y, man y, many brilliant Chinese who can contribute to innovation... \" The best way to access these \"brilliant Chinese \" is to be in China. The ne xt best option is to r ecruit and hir e them fo r work abr oad. Neither of those will happen though without a rm grasp of Chinese cultur e, language and politics. Instead of seeing these items as barrier s, think of them as conditions . Like any other condition, if it can be navigated , such as using windshield wipers when it rains , there is no need to get o the ro ad.True L ocalizatio n Localization is a brilliant way to adapt to the changing investment conditions in China. Instead of giving up because of some rain, turn on the wipers by localizing. Scrap the cook ie cutter appr oach that may have worked abr oad but lik ely will fail domestically . Star t integrating with locals. Come to understand the unique charac teristics of Chinese consumers via careful research.

Local brands essentially have the home eld advantage. Huawei, a local brand Wechat, Tencent pr oduc t29BUSINESS BUSINESS ast month we report ed on AmCham China 's Business Climate Surv ey Repo rt Launch. There AmCham 's Tianjin Chapter Chairman Mr. Mar tin Winchell shared insight on how localization can lead to success despite changes in the investment climate. He stated the f ollowing in terms of foreign enterprises winning in China: \"The quicke r, the faster you can get to a localized pr oduc t and localized se rvice, then localized management. \" Martin went on to shar e: \"Five or six years ago you would talk about localizing a pr oduct or ser vice that you built in the US and now you ar e building pr oduct s that ar e specically designed and researched in China. \" These comments ar e wor th discussing as indeed some expat entr epreneurs may need to entir ely rethink their business strategy . Past vs. Presen t In decades past, China may have found its fame as a manufac turing countr y. This is the r esult of countless pr oduc ts being sold globally with the wo rds \"Made in China \" on them. Really though, China is n't just about mak ing other peoples pr oduc ts anymo re. For one thing , they ar e mak ing their own produc ts for their own consumers . An example of this is Xiaomi. They research, design and manufac ture in, fo r China. Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent also make the list in terms of top Chinese technology companies delivering core serv ices principally made with the Chinese user in mind . This is wher e foreign rms perhaps have the gr eatest challenge. They no longer are competing with other international brands in China, but rather with local brands . These local brands essentially have the home eld advantage. Particularly this is true culturally , linguistically and politically. The cultural barrier is bi g. It shows up in small things lik e drink ing hot beverages instead of cold . Bigger issues arise when tr ying to adjust to taboos and understanding the psychological back ground of festivals. Foreigners struggle to design pr oduc ts for Chinese since they ar en't Chinese. They have n't been raised in China and ther efore lack insight into the cor e cultur e as it happens within the home and thro ughout daily lif e. Even expats living in China are often disconnec ted with the \"real world\" due to being unable to read, wr ite waters ar e even deeper . In many cases politics and business are intermingled in China. Locals have been navigating these turbulent seas since infancy and often due so somewhat subconsciously wher eas expats nd it dicult to grasp wher e the re latively blurr y line exists. Not to mention, ther e are some political par tners that may be eternally out of reach if one is not a Chinese national and active in the Party. Localize via Locals Mr. Winchell there fore brings up a ve ry inter esting point by shining the light on \"localization \". Cultu re, language and politics are what they ar e. No matter how hard an expat tries to close the gap in terms of understanding and master ing these issues , they will still be playing catch up with those born and raised in China. Localization thus becomes a ke y strategy . That is because expats can employ and par tner with locals instead of simply competing with them. That's what Ma rtin's company is doing . He described the company stru cture as f ollows: \"In our company for an example we employee literally hundr eds of people but I'm the only expat in the compan y. I think f or us ve ry early we adopted the polic y that we were going to build for China. We use dierent technology than we use in the US. HR, all the func tions ar e built fo r China. There is nothing that we really bor rowed fr om the US other than some intellec tual pr oper ty and knowledge of our industr y. But everything else we built for China. I think that's been the ke y for our success and most companies that ha ve been successful is they 've learned to build for China and gotten away from trading with China. \" Foreign rms need to think seriously about how they will leverage a largely local team to research, design and build pr oduc ts or ser vices in China, fo r China. That 's a method fundamentally di erent than the old days wher e international brands simply tried to sell the \"same\" produc t that sold like hot cake s overseas to local Chinese consumer s. That model isn 't as prac tical as it used to be. Martin made that clear with this comment: \"I think for most companies now it 's no longer about trading with China but investing in China for the domestic market. \" Keep in mind Mr. Winchell also noted \"Chinese laws , regulations, [and] policies \" are maturing . Theref ore not only should fo reign rms be by Carmen Kingthinki ng about how they will localize produc ts, but also company bi-laws and legal policies . Instead of seeing China as the Wild West wher e anything goes , it is becoming incr easingly impor tant to know well and abide by Chinese la w. This is true especially f or expats . Foreign entr epreneurs should not expec t a \"get out of jail fr ee\" card if failing to meet regulations just because they ar en't Chinese. Even large foreign owned entities ar e realizing how impor tant localization is . Mr. Winchell cited this example: \"You just don' t hear people talk ing about GM localizing a Buick. Now they ar e basically r esear ching and developing cars in China. That's really a major shift in how people think about China. Even people like Nike often r elease their new pr oduc ts in China rst because they don't want them to be copied. They get to the market her e rst and then deal with the rest of the worl d.\" So regar dless of company size, expats need to be China savvy . This means , stop relying on a translator and being driven around by a driver who you ca n't even communicate with fr eely. It is denitely time for foreign owners to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirt y so to speak . They need to ca reful they ar en't tak ing tips fr om so-called exper ts who have never even spent a day in China. R ather , star t living and working in China fo r real. This means less time hang ing out with other expats . Instea d, spend mor e time mastering the Chinese language and collaborating with locals . As William Zarit the Chairman of AmCham China mentioned: \"We have man y, man y, many brilliant Chinese who can contribute to innovation... \" The best way to access these \"brilliant Chinese \" is to be in China. The ne xt best option is to r ecruit and hir e them fo r work abr oad. Neither of those will happen though without a rm grasp of Chinese cultur e, language and politics. Instead of seeing these items as barrier s, think of them as conditions . Like any other condition, if it can be navigated , such as using windshield wipers when it rains , there is no need to get o the ro ad.True L ocalizatio n Localization is a brilliant way to adapt to the changing investment conditions in China. Instead of giving up because of some rain, turn on the wipers by localizing. Scrap the cook ie cutter appr oach that may have worked abr oad but lik ely will fail domestically . Star t integrating with locals. Come to understand the unique charac teristics of Chinese consumers via careful research. Then work with a team made up of locals to design pr oduct s and services with these specic traits in mind. Finally, sell in a way that r esonates with locals . Speak the Chinese language literally and metaphorically to o, by pr oducing solutions that solve r eal world pr oblems in China. Good brands cr eate and embrace cultur e.

The Tianjin Jian Hua Autism Rehabilitation Center \u0879 was rst established in 2000, when Ms. Ann Churc hwell came to Tianjin, to help with special needs for children in Tianjin and set up a special education projec t. Thus the Tianjin Jianhua Autism Rehabilitation Se rvice Center pr edecessor was born. Autism spec trum or autism spec trum disord er describes a range of conditions classied as neuro developmental disor ders. There is no k nown cur e for autism, although those who have autism and requir e little -to-no support are mor e likely to expe rience a lessening of sympt oms over time. I t is a complicated rainbow colour ed logo is an often-used symbol for the autism spec trum, as it r epresents the diversit y of conditions and people within it. Over the past ten years , the Center has been adhering to the purpose of helping childr en and families with autism and promoting the development of autism rehabilitation, and strik ing the path of public welfar e, mental r etardation and encourage child development and helping their par ents with training and counseling ser vices r elated to r ehabilitation training and r ehabilitation ac tivities . Today , the Center has been r egister ed as a private non- enterprise unit in Tianjin Civil Aairs Bur eau. The center of Tianjin in 2009 became one of the rst national pove rty and loneliness childr en rescue rehabilitation pr ojec ts. In 2012, it became the rst self- discipline institutions to provide assistance to autistic childr en in need of help . At pr esent, the Center has a stable of professional teachers . In May 2016, in the Tianjin autistic childr en rehabilitation teacher qualication examination, the Center saw 16 of their teachers passing the assessment to obtain their job qualication certicates . The Center ser ves mor e than 100 childr en and families ever y month. Ther e are a variet y of training modules in the Center , such as full-time day car e classes , half-d ay par ent-child classes , one-on-one cognitive training , language training and sensor y integration training , providing a wide range of pr ofessional development assessments and training repor ts and training f or childr en. Daily teaching and ac tivities includes: organizing par ents' autism training and prac tical training courses to help par ents understand the pr ofessional k nowledge of autistic r ehabilitation training and guide parents to carr y out family r ehabilitation by David Wongtraining thr ough par ental and open classes . Each year , the Center organizes childr en to carr y out various social integration ac tivities on a r egular basis . In June each year , the center organizes childr en and par ents to par ticipate in the 61 Parent-Child Games . In September each year, the Center organizes childr en and parents to organize autumn ac tivities . In December , the Center organizes childr en and par ents to hold a Christmas par ty. These activities strive to build a platf orm f or childr en and par ents to show the r esults of training to pr omote ex changes and enhance condence. Future challenges f or the Center ar e several and f oresee encountering some diculties . The biggest diculty comes from the small size of the organization and keeping up to meet their own development needs . The Center is always recruiting new teachers as old experienced teachers face r etirement. Jin Magazine is pr oud to be a suppor ter of the Center continuously since its formation over 15 years ago .

Well, if you ever walk ed into the International School of Tianjin's Qin Building, you would k now that this is denitely not the case f or this outstanding school in one of the major industrial and commer cial hubs of Northern China. F ounded in 1994, the International School of Tianjin (IST ) is a non-pr ot, college -preparator y day school f or nurser y to Grade 12 students of the international communit y of Tianjin, oering thr ee di erent qualit y eate (IB) pr ograms for students in Nurser y to Grade 5 (the PYP), Grades 6 to 10 (the MYP), and Grades 11 to 12 (the Diploma). As one walks thr ough the school , one cannot help noticing that all the inner walls ar e covere d with beautiful and vibrant students ' artwork, drawings and sculptur es. One doesn' t even need to visit the many ar t classr ooms , the computer centers, the green screening video room, the audio r ecor ding room or the ne wly renovated and refur bished state-of-the- art Design Center to understand that this school is truly dedicated to the Science Technology Engineering Ar t and Mathematics (STEAM) education movement, which is now widely accepted as the established path to educate, expand and improve the learning p rocess of students . This Centr e of ex cellence, spanning 2 sprawling floors, is equipped with the latest technology (hardware and so ftwar e) to teach students Desi gn Technology (D T), Information Technology (IT ), and Robotics at world-class standards.ISecondar y students (Grades 6-12) get hands- on education about the integration of DT with IT and prac tically experience f or themselves the r esultant pr oduc ts that they can cr eate with ease with this integration. F or instance, in their D T classes, th ey learn 3D computer modeling in the CAD (computer aided design) Room on one of the many CAD computers and then can send their nished design to one of the 3D printers to see their designed article tak ing shape while the 3D printer prints it out. I n addition to the traditional DT equipment lik e the engineer 's metal lathe machine, drill pr ess, sanding machine, plastic vacuum fo rmer et c., the DT Lab of the IST Design Centr e is now furnished with the stat e-of-the -art laser cutting technolog y, 3D printer s, CAD workstations (all large scr een iMacs) and the latest 84 \" interac tive LED scr eens f or teachin g. The Centre also incudes a green screen studio and an audio re cord ing studio f or students for their lming, video mak ing, music r ecor ding and photography projec ts . The second floor of the D esign Centr e is dedicated to IT education of students from K inderga rten to Grade 12. This also includes teaching them computer coding and sk ills. There are 2 large IT labs f or holding classes, equipped with large iM ac computers each as well as an 84\" interac tive LED scr een f or teaching . There is also a ve ry spacious R obotics Lab equipped with several iMacs which can be used f or 3 stages of the LEGO Robotics Programs by students: Wedo for beginners; M indstorms f or intermediate, and E V3 for more advanced students. NEW DESIGN CENTER AT ISTThere are 50 i Macs on the 2nd floor alone . Needless to sa y, the IST D esign Centre is a ve ry exciting place f or students to be. There is a ve ry inspir ing team of teachers in the Desi gn Centre: M r. Dave Scoly er is the Design Centr e Coor dinator and the DT Teacher, while Mr . Jason Inghram and M r. Geo Diegel teach IT . This is a place where students' creativit y and innovation is nur ture d and their excellence in technology p rojects is honed and polished in the best way possible. The D esign Center facilit y really o ers all subjec t teachers at the school the possibilit y of integrating subjec ts together , so that, fo r example, even when math class is ove r, students are still putting into prac tice the theor y just learned thr ough pr oduc t creation. I t also allows teachers to teach fundamental educational concepts thr ough fun DT projec ts, for instance, r ecently the Grade 1 students under their unit on \"how things move \" learned about the e ect of fo rce on the movement of objec ts by launching their own rockets. The students had to follow instruc tions fr om Mr . Inghram on how to assemble their r ockets, and once they we re completed , they explor ed how using die rent amounts of force (pumping die rent amounts of air into the rock ets to build pr essur e) a ected how far the rock et would fly . They had so much fun watching their ro ckets tak e o . A r eal school of the futur e, IST has shown how k eeping pace with the technological progress that our wo rld is experiencing on a daily basis , can tur n a school into a ve ry interesting place for students to not only increase their knowledge but to get hands- on experience of what they have learned from books, all the while eor tlessly expanding their exper tise on curr ent fundamental disciplines.

F ounded in 1994, the International School of Tianjin (IST ) is a non-pr ot, college -preparator y day school f or nurser y to Grade 12 students of the international communit y of Tianjin, oering thr ee di erent qualit y eate (IB) pr ograms for students in Nurser y to Grade 5 (the PYP), Grades 6 to 10 (the MYP), and Grades 11 to 12 (the Diploma). As one walks thr ough the school , one cannot help noticing that all the inner walls ar e covere d with beautiful and vibrant students ' artwork, drawings and sculptur es. One doesn' t even need to visit the many ar t classr ooms , the computer centers, the green screening video room, the audio r ecor ding room or the ne wly renovated and refur bished state-of-the- art Design Center to understand that this school is truly dedicated to the Science Technology Engineering Ar t and Mathematics (STEAM) education movement, which is now widely accepted as the established path to educate, expand and improve the learning p rocess of students . This Centr e of ex cellence, spanning 2 sprawling floors, is equipped with the latest technology (hardware and so ftwar e) to teach students Desi gn Technology (D T), Information Technology (IT ), and Robotics at world-class standards.ISecondar y students (Grades 6-12) get hands- on education about the integration of DT with IT and prac tically experience f or themselves the r esultant pr oduc ts that they can cr eate with ease with this integration. F or instance, in their D T classes, th ey learn 3D computer modeling in the CAD (computer aided design) Room on one of the many CAD computers and then can send their nished design to one of the 3D printers to see their designed article tak ing shape while the 3D printer prints it out. I n addition to the traditional DT equipment lik e the engineer 's metal lathe machine, drill pr ess, sanding machine, plastic vacuum fo rmer et c., the DT Lab of the IST Design Centr e is now furnished with the stat e-of-the -art laser cutting technolog y, 3D printer s, CAD workstations (all large scr een iMacs) and the latest 84 \" interac tive LED scr eens f or teachin g. The Centre also incudes a green screen studio and an audio re cord ing studio f or students for their lming, video mak ing, music r ecor ding and photography projec ts . The second floor of the D esign Centr e is dedicated to IT education of students from K inderga rten to Grade 12. This also includes teaching them computer coding and sk ills. There are 2 large IT labs f or holding classes, equipped with large iM ac computers each as well as an 84\" interac tive LED scr een f or teaching . There is also a ve ry spacious R obotics Lab equipped with several iMacs which can be used f or 3 stages of the LEGO Robotics Programs by students: Wedo for beginners; M indstorms f or intermediate, and E V3 for more advanced students. NEW DESIGN CENTER AT ISTThere are 50 i Macs on the 2nd floor alone . Needless to sa y, the IST D esign Centre is a ve ry exciting place f or students to be. There is a ve ry inspir ing team of teachers in the Desi gn Centre: M r. Dave Scoly er is the Design Centr e Coor dinator and the DT Teacher, while Mr . Jason Inghram and M r. Geo Diegel teach IT . This is a place where students' creativit y and innovation is nur ture d and their excellence in technology p rojects is honed and polished in the best way possible. The D esign Center facilit y really o ers all subjec t teachers at the school the possibilit y of integrating subjec ts together , so that, fo r example, even when math class is ove r, students are still putting into prac tice the theor y just learned thr ough pr oduc t creation. I t also allows teachers to teach fundamental educational concepts thr ough fun DT projec ts, for instance, r ecently the Grade 1 students under their unit on \"how things move \" learned about the e ect of fo rce on the movement of objec ts by launching their own rockets. The students had to follow instruc tions fr om Mr . Inghram on how to assemble their r ockets, and once they we re completed , they explor ed how using die rent amounts of force (pumping die rent amounts of air into the rock ets to build pr essur e) a ected how far the rock et would fly . They had so much fun watching their ro ckets tak e o . A r eal school of the futur e, IST has shown how k eeping pace with the technological progress that our wo rld is experiencing on a daily basis , can tur n a school into a ve ry interesting place for students to not only increase their knowledge but to get hands- on experience of what they have learned from books, all the while eor tlessly expanding their exper tise on curr ent fundamental disciplines. Mor eover, the cutting- edge Design Centers o ers older students the oppor tunity to get rst-hand experience on the prac tical side of many areas, such as graphic design, lm mak ing etc., inspiring them and p roviding them with ex tra backg round infor mation and experience which would come in handy when deciding on their car eer choices in the futur e. 38Beha ve or Misbeha ve Behavioral and emotional pr oblems ar e the most serious pr oblem of childr en with autism. In other wo rds, behavioral pr oblems lead to emotional pr oblems . All of us ar e very familiar with the wo rd behavior , but its denition may be less clear . Behavior is how we behave, but why we behave li ke we dor emains a puzzle. As teachers of childr en with autism, we have to dene the wo rd behavior cor rectly. In general , behavior is the ac tivities of living beings . Behavior is a way that childr en with autism negotiate the outside worl d, since they ar e weak in language and cognitive abilities . When they ar e unable to expr ess themselves thr ough language, they communicate with their gestur es and body language. Childr en with autism may at times display age -inappr opriate behavior . A lack of pr oper inte rvention in early childhood will impac t the r est of their lives . For example, when facing r ejection, they may cry and scr eam, and even smash things;they may even lie on the gr ound in pr otest; or to take another example, when they see a stranger holding their favorite things walk ing on the str eet, they may rush towar d the stranger and grab the item. Or , seeing someone wearing their favorite color on the street, they may heedlessly touch someone else's clothes;or , attrac ted by adver tising in a shopping mall, they may walk ar ound her e and ther e in the shop touching this or playing with that. Or in a re staurant, seeing his favorite dish or favorite k ind of f ood on someone else's table, he may grab it; or , when unable to nisha favorite task but r equir ed to stop , they will nd itunacceptable, hur ting themselves or attack ing others; or , to ta ke another example, when check ing out in a line andunable to wait, they may th row things and cr y. These ar e the pr oblematic behaviors of childr en with autism.These ac tions will prevent them fr om living normal live s.Autism rehabilitation educators need to learn behavioral analysis f or this re ason, in or der to help childr en with autism live mor e normal lives in the futur e. Attack ing others, hurting themselve s, damaging things , escapism and s hand , repeating commer cials or yelling) ar e all behavioral pr oblems . As pr ofessionals, we must analyze their behavior . First, we must dene the behavior . Then, we must JIAN HU A investigate the r easons f or this behavior carefully to understand the back ground: when does this behavior usually occur?Wher e does it occur? Who is ther e when it occurs? What happened when the behavior occurr ed? Did someone else say or do something when it occur red?Then we must see what happens after the occur rence of the behavior : what happened after the occur rence?What did the people nearby , the parents or the teacher do? Was ther e a change after the behavior? Was the child avoiding something? Finally, the func tion of the ac t must be analyzed by summing up the recorded data.Then ther e can be an inter vention to address the child 's behavioraccor dingto the analysis , helping the child to establish good behavior , or re ducing the fr equenc y of and cor recting bad behavior . Analysis of behavioral pr oblems and inter vention require a highly professional appr oach. The teachers of the Jian Hua Autism Rehabilitation C enter ar e all work ing hard to study and apply this science. As learning gr ows deeper each semester , the teachers will analyze, discuss, and impr ove together to formulate targeted plans f or each child in or der to help the childr en and their parents better .

It promotes the development of bone and brain tissue. Secondly , milk is rich in vitamins that have pr oven eective in pr eventing illness and str engthening the immune system.

The word is used in the article as a joke . \u001b Language Tip: \u001b First Zh\u00f2uPARENTING s a farm k id gr owing up in the 80s and 90s , my enter tainment consisted of playing outside or reading books in the house. Our 13-inch black and white television only got thr ee channels since we lived outside the cit y limits . With a librar y-loving mom and plent y of books that came as hand-me -downs fr om my family friends with older k ids, it seemed only natural that r eading became a favorite pastime. Eventually we got a slightly larger color televison, but still had just thr ee channels . Fast fo rward a couple decades and technology has changed our lives so much, even since the bir th of my son in 2008. The year bef ore his bir th, I got my rst phone with a camera and a fe w years later I had an iP od that let me captur e his sister right after her bir th. Our technology isn' t limited to our phones; our smar t TV lets us watch on-demand shows and movies , we have an iPad, two computers and a few old phones that func tion as music playing devices . These days it tak es some intentionalit y to not be suck ed into the digital worl d. Reading a good old-fashioned paper book is a gr eat way to disconnec t, for both our k ids and ourselves . One way \u0842 Amade sur e that books we re in sight and on our minds was to buy a floor-t o-ceiling bookshelf that spans one whole wall in our living r oom. It sits behind our sofa so we can easily grab a book and delve into a great stor y. Even bef ore we had this , and when the k ids we re little, I placed their books down low so that they we re free to grab them and r ead at will . In my college Education courses , our professors instilled into us the impor tance of re ading aloud to k ids so even though my son is able to read on his own, I read to him and his sister ever yday . This usually happens during br eakfast, dinner or at bedtime. Nathaniel also r eads to his sister and now that she's learning to r ead, he'll help her as she tries to mak e out the Chinese charac ters or letter sounds in English. Nathaniel has to r ead on his own f or at least thir ty minutes a da y. Although he does enjoy books , we often buy books that relate to ar eas he's inter ested in, as they come up: dinosaurs , space, airplanes , and most re cently , biographie s. A set of 22 of them that include people he wanted to learn mor e about. We're happy to indulge in his re quests f or mor e books . Most of these books ar e in Chinese, and ar e easily available on sites lik e DangDang , TaoBao and Amazon. F or English language books we mostly buy second hand fr om online friends (check Facebook and WeChat gr oups) or bring them fr om the USA. Having a K indle (or the app) is a gr eat way to have a whole librar y of books at hand , in your pr eferred languages , without tak ing up much space. I'm on several email lists that aler t me to daily deals on K indle books so that I can build my digital librar y; sometimes I do pay full price f or new books that I want to r ead immediately . We limit television to the week ends when we usually watch a movie as a family , or the k ids will watch a Chinese car toon. My son wants to be a pilot, and he understands the harmful e ects too much screen time has on his friends . Many of his classmates ar e already wearing glasses in grade thr ee of primar y school . We try to help the k ids understand that the better qualit y information they tak e in, the mor e they'll know and school will be easier and more enjoyable .by Charlotte Edward sINSTILLING A LO VE OF READING IN THE INTERNET AGE Reading a good old-fashioned paper book is a gr eat way to disconnec t, for both our k ids and ourselves . 39Beha ve or Misbeha ve Behavioral and emotional pr oblems ar e the most serious pr oblem of childr en with autism.

Today we will introduce thr ee popular pic ture editing apps . The rst is Meitu. The second is Beaut yCam and the thir d is F aceu. In the Meitu app ther e is a \"settings\" section. Ther e users can change the image qualit y. The choices ar e high, medium, or standar d. There are also a number of camera settings which can be turned on or o. One option is to the \"Save Original Photos \". The app o ers thr ee language choices . They are traditional or simplied Chinese and English. Meitu r equir es the user to allow access to the devices photo librar y. After doing so users can edit their photos . The app also r equir es user permission to access the camera. After taking a photo , you can change the color tone of the photo mak ing it either warmer or cooler . Then you have a choice of die rent \"face e ects\". These have thr ee classications of subtle, moderate, or strong. Within each ther e will then be a range of e ects. Ther e is a \"skin\" option to smoothen, whiten, or tone. The \"acne \" option can be used to either automatically or manually r emove blemishes . Ther e is even an option f or \"slimming \" the face. face editing choices to ar ticially enhance one 's appearance. An intense photo altering option is \"Hand-Drawn \". This can either edit an existing photo or use a photo tak en in real time to \"transf orm it into what appears to be something hand drawn \". A collage option is also available. Beaut yCam is lik ewise pr oduced by Meitu. The app will begin by pr ompting the user to selec t either \"Girls \" or \"Boys \". Again either existing photos of one tak en in real time can be used . A wide variet y of \"templates \" are available f or download; these become the back drop for the phot o. After tak ing the photo ther e are tons of dierent e ects that can applied totally changing the look of face. Ther e are a whole host of \"makeup\" options to dr ess up one's face. The \"SeleGacha \" option lets you create an animated version of the phot o. It adds audio , caption, back ground and e ven some motion to what would be an other wise still phot o. Faceu also uses existing or r eal-time photos . It can add tex t to a photo . Or various stick ers can be applied to the photo . After pick ing a stick er you can drag and dr op it wher e you want it. You can also use a pen to fr ee-hand draw over a phot o. When tak ing a photo you can selec t from by Carmen KingAFTER TAKING A PHO TO, YOU CAN CHANGE THE COLOR TONE OF THE PHO TO MAKING IT EITHER WARMER OR C OOLER. THEN YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF DIFFERENT \"FACE EFFEC eshaping tools available. Instead of editing stills , you can hold down a button and it will tak e a video . After taking a video clip you can use the text, stick ers, and pen f eatur es to edit it. Plus add back ground music. Of the thr ee apps , Faceu was less clutter ed and mor e straightf orward to use. The downside in terms of privac y though is that all thr ee apps need full access to the device 's photo librar y and camera.

Some traditional prac tices, I have hear d argued , like using urine f or chilblains , have some merit.

Many involve prac tices that, while not traditional , have ideas that would be familiar to Chinese people today and considere d not ver y alternative to western culture s of the past. Power of plants and belief Use of plants fo r medicinal purposes , or dietar y supplements , date back thousands of years. They were used by the Egyptians, Greeks and I ndians as well as the Chinese. But in China, the prac tice has been elevated to a much higher level compa red with other culture s. There is a system of belie fs behind it that explains how the body works and how illness and tr eatments interac t. The theories comprise of mysterious energies (qi) that flow I'through channels in the body , concepts of balance and opposites , of maintaining harmon y. The principles ar e not unlik e those underpinning eastern r eligious belie fs and this similari ty provides a systemic qualit y that intuitively feels corr ect because it cor responds with the believe r's worldvie w.

The belief was they treated the symptoms of the disease, but the underlying causes wer e spiritual . Mystical energies and the pow er of the past Recently ther e has been a g rowing distrust of science, a move away fr om chemicals and a pr eference f or natural ingredients . This has led to an explosion of alternative appr oaches to health, some borrowe d from other culture s, some repack aging old ideas and some just fads . The more resilient tend to have underlying belief systems that explain why they work . Many ar e based on concepts of supernatural energies which ar e channelled, or transfe rred, thro ugh touching, or through the use of char ms such as magnets , ionised jewelle ry or cry stals. The myster ious energies involved ar e very impor tant. When ingesting a plant, you can imagine it contains some a ctive ingr edient that causes a change inside the body . But without an invisible f orce it's dicult to explain how the pr esence of a r ock, the incantation of a spell or prayer , or the pro ximity of hands or charms to the body can cause any physical eect. The ideas about energy were also believed by the ancient Gr eeks and Egyptians who thought that disease r esulted fr om an imbalance of natural f orces. Hippocrates called them the f our temperaments and Humours . Similarly , Homeopathy , rst pr oposed in the late 1700s , has the phenomenon of ' miasms ' which ar e used to explain illness .

Strangel y, neither the antiquit y of pre -Christian Sax on magic , nor its naturalness , has made leaches and bloodletting a more appealing cure for a hangover than an aspirin.

I remember the rst time I was faced with the squat toilets . I went to visit a friend in the countr yside and was desperate to use the facilities as I had drunk a lot of water . However on being faced with a hole in the gr ound with no door to protec t my privac y, something strange happened - my bladder dried up completely and I no longer needed to use the toilet. That 's when I r emember think ing that China was r eally under developed . Of course ther e are many inconveniences to being in China, but do you not think that one of the r easons is because you ar e in a f oreign countr y? I have a Chinese friend who lives her e and she has just got back fr om China, having spent t wo months ther e. Although she loves England and is glad to be back her e, she told me that it was such a r elief to be back in China because of the convenience. She does not speak English, which obviously mak es getting things done ver y dicult. I n comparing the t wo countries , she f elt that China was much mor e comf ortable f or her , even though she acknowledged the fac t that she loves the weather her e, par ticularly the blue sk ies. I love China too , but ther e are some things that ar e ver y precious to me her e. For instance I can turn the tap on and drink the water as it is ver y clean. M y Chinese friends don' t believe this and still buy bottled water fr om the shops . I remind them that though water is not drink able dir ect from the tap in China, it is her e. However old habits die har d. I love the fac t that I have never been bitten by mosquitoes her e. They cannot sur vive the rain and the cold , so that is ver y convenient f or me as I got bitten to death in China. CHINA HAS THE INTERNET TOO! However I must say that once I could speak Chinese, I f ound lif e in China ver y convenient and inter esting . One aspec t of life in China that pr obably surpasses many countries is that of the internet economy . Recently on a talk show in Taiwan, this ver y aspec t was discussed . One panellist made an impassioned speech and aske d the others \" Mainland China is no longer a back ward countr y, aren't you afraid?\" I found the way the question was phrased a little strange and def ensive, as it was almost as if she expec ted the rest of the panel to disagr ee and to argue with of the other panellists became ver y excitable in her defence of the Mainland and stated , just as passionately as the rst lady , that China was over taking the world in one aspec t. She said a little pr over b which basically meant the one that was behind is now rst. So what on ear th was mak ing ever ybody so full of emotion? Well it maybe something you ar e already awar e of, or this may be news to you. As far as the internet economy is concerned , China is becoming a force to be r ecognised . The second panellist said that out in the Chinese countr yside, which is largely consider ed to be a bit back ward even by Chinese citizens , you can nd farmers with the latest smar tphones who ar e able to converse on a wide range of subjec ts, including international news such as what was happening in the American elec tions . Why would a Chinese farmer be inter ested in this , surely he has better things to do with his time rather than think about Western politics? The reason he is inter ested is simply because he now has the means to inf orm himself via his phone. Why should he not be inter ested in international events? Maybe he r ealises that some of them will indeed have an impac t on his own lif e. I never r eally thought about it in this way bef ore, but let's just say this farmer g rows watermelons that ar e sold in Eur ope. One day he checks the farming news on his phone and nds out that watermelons ar e being g rown in Spain and sold at a much cheaper price than the Chinese ones . His life will denitely be a ected, and having been informed , it may be that he can tak e steps Fto aver t what could be a potential disaste r. For many people these days having a smar t phone means having their whole lif e laid out in their phone, they use it f or everything and Chinese people ar e no die rent in this r espec t. F or a technophobe by choice like me, I don 't feel comf ortable having so many personal aspec ts of my lif e in a gadget that could be lost or stolen and which could open me up to numer ous pr oblems . Unf ortunately the truth of the matter is if I f orget it at home or it runs out of batter y I can 't conduc t my usual business. NEXT ST OP, THE WORLD On the pr ogramme pr eviously mentioned , ther e wer e two other panellists who wer e visibly shock ed at the vehemence of the second lad y's asser tion that as far as the use of smar t phones and APPs are concerned , China is alr eady ahead of eve ryone else. I don 't know why they should be surprised , after all if most of the rest of the world is alr eady doing this , why should China lag behind . This reminds me of the fac t that one of the biggest technology rms in the world was accused of ignoring Africa, only f or that Continent to become one of fastest g rowing smar t phone mark ets in the world . The company that spotted the gap in the mark et has corner ed that gap and the situation in Africa is much the same in China, with people who live in r emote locations able to access the r est of the world thr ough their phone. The f ormer mentioned company has lost out and now has no chance of breaking into the mark et. The moral of this stor y is if you snooze As far as the int ernet economy is concerned , China is becoming a force to be recognised.

In general , salads ar e serv ed raw but nothing says you cannot cook the ingr edients and serv e them chilled with your favorite dr essings . Speak ing of dr essings , ther e are probably as many di erent dr essings as ther e are dierent t ypes of salads . These can be separated into basically two types: Vinaigrette, which is oil and vinegar and spices; the other is Creamy and usually a base of mayonnaise or other dair y produc t and added spices . The most popular dr essing is pr obably Thousand Island, which was invented , in the late 1800' s in a region called Thousand Islands on ARE SERVED RAW BUT NOTHING SA YS YOU CANNOT C OOK THE INGREDIENTS AND SERVE THEM CHILLED WITH YOUR FAVORITE DRESSINGS.Add: 2 Changde Dao, Heping Distr ict (near Minyuan Stadium ) 2 Tel: 022-23329966 : 400RMB Remember to take your time and enjoy your meal, tu rn o your smar tphone and don 't be distrac ted from your busy ever yday life and escape into the natural plate of fr esh vegetables and healthy food for your body . Instead of being immersed in the multi media, updating your moments and sending constant messages , try to have a face -to-face conser vation with a loved one and enjoying a healthy salad . The key to any gr eat salad is fr esh ingredients , clean and colorf ul plates and served cold with a nice dr essing and br ead and condiments. The good thing about salads is they can be leftover by wrapping well and refrigerated . Don't keep dr essings past the expiry dates and if you ma ke your own cr eation from dair y produc ts such as mayonnaise, yogu rt or cr eam, tr eat it just lik e milk and don' t keep it out too long because it will spoil easily .

So, in the article today we 'll discuss what some say are the benets of milk and how some vehemently r eject it. In the States the daily r ecommended amount of dair y for adults is 3 cups a da y. This can tak e the fo rm of milk , yogu rt or cheese. M ilk is highly r ecommended because of its nutritional value. Calcium, potassium and vitamin D ar e all f ound in milk . Calcium is touted f or its bone strengthening pr oper ties. We all want strong bones right? It is also associated with re ducing blood pr essur e and diseases like type-2 diabetes and car diovascular disease, accor ding to choosemyplate.go v.

What could possibly be bad about all this nutrition in a glass? Let's tak e a look . First of all , ther e is always pr essur e on the farming industr y to pr oduce mor e and more milk. While farming technology has come into the modern centur y and has done a lot in itself to pr oduce mor e milk , accor ding to bodybuilding .com, drugs have also been heavily involved in the increased pr oduc tion. Cows ar e given a hormone called rGBH. rGBH stands for, recombinant bovine gr owth hormone. This is given to cows specically to incr ease milk pr oduc tion. Fr equently injec ting the cows with this hormone leads to inf ections which, in turn, leads to the need to administer antibiotics . Mo re drugs . The drugs given to the cattle, no doubt, nd their way into the milk . Still others adamantly deny that these drugs enter into the milk in any amount that is ac tually harmful to humans , and whatever trace amounts of drugs ar e in the milk ar e destroy ed by the digestive system once we have drunk en it. You will nd , as I have, tr ying to investigate milk leads to a dizz ying path of each par ty saying the other is false. Ther e is, though, one fac t about milk that all seem to agr ee on. Some people ar e lactose intolerant and simply cannot drink milk . So f or those of you out ther e that have no option but to drink a milk alternative, ther e is good news f or you. Or for those of you who can ac tually drink milk , but choose not to , ther e are other options . Lik e what? Ther e is rice milk , almond milk , coconut milk , lactose soymilk . Be awar e, soymilk is yet another topic that has extreme opinions on both sides . So what we have lear ned? We just have to do our own r esear ch and decide whether or not we want to drink milk . In the end , we alone will bear the consequences of our decision. Happy researching! THE VARYING VIEWS ON MILK Mby Kate KingMilk is highly re commended because of its nutritional value. 59SHOPPING xpats in China need to get up to speed on locks . Not all locks ar e created equal . Some ar e extremely easy to pick! Thieves in China ar e very savv y. Do not under estimate them. Sadly , not only may the existing lock be a cheap one, but the landlor d or even the pr evious tenant may have a copy of the key. Before signing the contrac t for a r ental get the landlor d to agree in writing to allow you to install your own lock in addition to the existing one. Be awar e many doors in Tianjin have a lock system wher eby the door can be \"lock ed\" from the inside using a ke y. If so, anytime you ar e at home it is advisable to lock the door using the ke y and not just close the door . Sometimes it seems lik e the door auto locks when it is shut. In most cases though the lock isn' t truly lock ed unless you use the key from the inside, lock the safe ty lock below the handle, or with some systems turn the handle up . Be sure you know how yours wo rks. You must double check if after lock ing the door with the ke y from the inside someone else fr om the outside can still use a key to unlock the door . This is impor tant if for example one person is home and locks the door , while another r oommate has yet to retur n. Oddl y, some locks if lock LOCK ISN' T TRUL Y LOCKED UNLESS YOU USE THE KE Y FROM THE INSIDE, L OCK THE SAFET Y LOCK BEL OW THE HANDLE, OR WITH SOME SYSTEMS TURN THE HANDLE UP . the inside cannot be unlock ed fr om the outside even with the key. So again, carefully check befo re unk nowingly lock ing a roommate out! The other issue is , to be sur e you leave a key near the door after lock ing it fr om the inside with the ke y. That's because the only way to unlock the door will be with the key. Same thing goes f or those lock ing the door fr om the outside with a ke y. Be absolutely sur e if a person is left inside, they too have a key to unlock the door and you didn 't tak e the only ke y. Or else, they will literally be lock ed in. This could be lif e threatening if a r e star ted and they don 't have a key to use fr om the inside. Even crazier , is that some locks if lock ed fr om the outside, can 't be unlock ed fr om the inside even with a ke y. The bottom line is , test the locks and all ke ys bef ore unintentionally trapping someone inside. When installing a lock , consider paying ex tra and getting a better lock system. Some ar e cheap and easily pick ed. Others have mor e advanced ke y systems oering gr eater securit y. Another option is to install an elec tronic lock . These may use a pass- code or car d-swipe system to open. Be ex tremely cautious though as these usually run on batteries . When the batteries die you can get lock ed out. Only buy an LOCK IT UP by Carmen King Eelectronic lock that has a manual ke y override or has terminals f or using a batter y from the outside to unlock the door in the even the inside batteries fail . Bringing an electronic lock fr om overseas may pr ovide even a better level of securit y in thwar ting the e orts of local thieve s. When moving out pr epar ed to either leave the locks behind or buy some sor t of cover f or the lock holes in the door . When it comes to installing locks , only use a r eputable company or friend . Other wise, they may be connec ted to some shady charac ters setup you up f or getting r obbed . A better lock system is y will tak e a little more self- critique.

First, there is the privac y issue. Private user data inside the phone must be erased completely be fore getting rid of it or face a serious securi ty risk, perhaps even identity theft. Second , phones contain toxic items such as batter ies which cannot be indiscriminately th rown. How can we deal with these concerns and dispose of a used phone? Better yet, could we possibly even get some money for our device? A few expats will r ely on person to person selling . In the case wher e a trusted friend or family member is in need of a phone, this may be the best option. While this may \u082a \u082a\u0835 monetar y return, giving or selling the phone to a known and trusted individual dramatically re duces the risks of data misuse. Those with tech sk ills can wipe their phone of data and then sell it to a classmate, or other associate. This may give a little higher economic re turn. Howeve r, it is highly recommended to double check all private content is deleted without the oppor tunit y for recove ry. In addition to the above rather manual options , ther e is now an app called \"\" which can expedite the entir e process. After installation, upon opening the app it will prompt f or allowing \"location ser vices \" to be enabled . In which case it will auto locate the by Carmen KingHOW TO DEAL WITH A USED MOBILE PHONE?city in which the device is being used . A manual city selec tion can also be done. Most major cities lik e Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Tianjin all have company ser vice centers . After selec ting the cit y, the app will auto detec t key details of the phone such as mak e, model , and storage capacit y. It then pr ovides two options: \"sell this phone \" ( )or model \" ( ). After selec ting \"sell this device \" the option of \"begin testing \" (\u085f) will be pr esente d. They are quite handy in identifying what is and isn 't working on the device. A series of tests will begin such as playing a sound to check the speak ers, asking permission to access the micr ophone, mak ing a phone call to 112, covering over the motion sensor , and lling in blocks on the scr een. Another test will mak e the display all black , then all white; each time asking if the user sees any spots . After all the diagnostics have completed , the app will provide a quote for the phone. The user can choose to accept or r eject the o er. If you do accept it, they guarantee in-person conrmation of all data being wiped clean before tak ing the phone. The phone can be taken to the near est ser vice center and payment will be made. HOWEVER, IT IS HIGHL Y RECOMMENDED TO DOUBLE CHECK ALL PRIV ATE C ONTENT IS DELETED WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNIT Y FOR REC OVERY . 62 DISC OVERING TIANJIN DISC OVERING TIANJIN e have all done it! Through all the trials of the winter we have pr evailed , to be r elieved by a rapidly warming spring. As the heat picks up, now is the per fect time to head out on adventur es around the beautiful cit y of Tianjin without having to be blasted by fr eezing winds. The spring and fall seasons happen to be some of my favorite times in Tianjin as the cit y feels more alive than usual . The dark days of winter tend to shut down oppor tunities f or exploration as citizens r etreat indoors to escape the unbearable cold and during the lengthy summer days , many people tr y to avoid the heat over trumped up fears of heat stroke. Fall and spring ar e the fleeting seasons wher e the weather is just per fect. It's neither particularly hot or cold and the change in weather brings in a sense of r elief that we will have a brief r eprieve fr om the ext remes of summer and winter . The flowers ar e blossoming , the cit y shrugs o the dr eary winter br own landscape for an explosion of green. When it comes to exploring the cit y, the dierent modes of transpor tation o er var ying levels of convenience. I f you 're trying to mak e your way fr om point A to point B in the quick est manner , the subway will always be your best bet wher eas walk ing will be the most time consuming . Howeve r, if your intent is to explo re, you have ever ything to lose by taking the subway . Sure, you get to a specic destination faste r. Although, most of us don 't measur e our lives by how quick ly we move from bir th to death, it is the experiences in between our bir th and fading back into the void that constitute our existence. What we do, what we see, and how we interpr et events around us on the way to our destination is what lif e is truly about. So if you ar e out with the intent to explor e Tianjin, using the subway is perhaps the gr eatest disse rvice to that cause. Walking may be the best way to get a feel for the cit y but you end up contesting Wwith your physical abilit y and time constraints . If you live in a house or stay at a hotel , ther e's only so far that you can r ealistically walk in one day bef ore you need to r eturn back to your base. Bik ing may be the best way to experience Tianjin, not only do you have freedom that taxis , busses , and subways don 't oer but you have an added speed that walk ing lacks . A str oll from the Eye of Tianjin to JieFang bridge immediately outside of the Tianjin R ailway Station may be a 1.5-2 hour journey depending on your pace. A leisur ely bike ride k nocks that down to 30 minutes all while getting the same sights and sounds as walk ing. With bik ing though, it has a number of physical constraints . One, you need to purchase a bic ycle, secondly , you need to lock that bik e up when you ar e not on it. Then you need to r eturn to the same location of the locked bik e to continue your journey . Pulling over o the bik e and going f or a walk may seem daunting as you need to mak e sur e and you must inevitably r eturn to that same location to retrieve the bik e. That's extremely tedious . Many of us who ar e on the way to work and school chose to catch a ride on the busses for their convenience, even with trac dragging out the transit time. Bik ing o ers a much gr eater fr eedom and r eliabilit y than the subway or busses tend to . Recently , biking has made a huge comeback in China as millions are signing up f or online bik e rental ser vices like ofo and Mobik e. These r ental bik es o ers the abilit y to pick up a bik e wher ever people exist and to dr op them o at almost any destination. Those of us who come fr om cities and towns outside of China that do not even hold a flame to the metr opolises of Beijing , Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenzhen; we may have a di erent idea of ownership . We each have a plot of land , a pool that we seldom use, and a car that's r equir ed to traverse the suburban hellscape. Coming to China, you gr ow to appr eciate the communities . We don 't need 100 separate lawns when thousands of communit y members can all appr eciate the same parks that ar e maintained by sta . We don't all need a bic ycle that we only use an hour or t wo a day at the most when we can just shar e bik es that will be wher ever we need them. Living in the cit y, sharing is a must. Ofo and Mobik e are two of the largest companies operating in this booming industr y right now and perhaps you have alr eady seen the bright yellow of o bik es and the sleek silver Mobikes with their orange accents . Signing up for accounts to use these ser vices ar e relatively pain fr ee as the applications ar e entir ely in English. After r egistering , sending a passpor t photo to conrm your identit y, and putting down a deposit of 100-300RMB , you're ready to hit the r oad. In order to ride a bik e, you will need to also load your account with mone y. At the moment, both of o and Mobik e are oering deals wher e if you put down 100RMB , you receive an ex tra 100RMB of fr ee cr edit attributed to your account. To get the most out of the r ental bik e experience while the weather is per fect, we have compiled a f ew classic locations f or tak ing bik e rides in Tianjin. Our rst r oute is along the Hai River as the str etch fr om the Eye of Tianjin all the way past the DaGuangM ing Bridge mak e a scenic ride that enjo ys some of the g reatest views of the cit y. This ride is beautiful during any time of day and it's almost r ecommended that you tr y exploring Hai R iver in the morning , evening , and at dusk to get the fullest experience .

WHA T WE DO , WHA T WE SEE, AND HOW WE INTERPRET EVENTS AROUND US ON THE WAY TO OUR DESTINA TION IS WHA T LIFE IS TRUL Y ABOUT . by Bryce Cristiano Explor e the cit y with a sharing bike . Skyline of TianjinDISC OVERING TIANJIN DISC OVERING TIANJIN e have all done it! Through all the trials of the winter we have pr evailed , to be r elieved by a rapidly warming spring. As the heat picks up, now is the per fect time to head out on adventur es around the beautiful cit y of Tianjin without having to be blasted by fr eezing winds. The spring and fall seasons happen to be some of my favorite times in Tianjin as the cit y feels more alive than usual . The dark days of winter tend to shut down oppor tunities f or exploration as citizens r etreat indoors to escape the unbearable cold and during the lengthy summer days , many people tr y to avoid the heat over trumped up fears of heat stroke. Fall and spring ar e the fleeting seasons wher e the weather is just per fect. It's neither particularly hot or cold and the change in weather brings in a sense of r elief that we will have a brief r eprieve fr om the ext remes of summer and winter . The flowers ar e blossoming , the cit y shrugs o the dr eary winter br own landscape for an explosion of green. When it comes to exploring the cit y, the dierent modes of transpor tation o er var ying levels of convenience. I f you 're trying to mak e your way fr om point A to point B in the quick est manner , the subway will always be your best bet wher eas walk ing will be the most time consuming . Howeve r, if your intent is to explo re, you have ever ything to lose by taking the subway . Sure, you get to a specic destination faste r. Although, most of us don 't measur e our lives by how quick ly we move from bir th to death, it is the experiences in between our bir th and fading back into the void that constitute our existence. What we do, what we see, and how we interpr et events around us on the way to our destination is what lif e is truly about. So if you ar e out with the intent to explor e Tianjin, using the subway is perhaps the gr eatest disse rvice to that cause. Walking may be the best way to get a feel for the cit y but you end up contesting Wwith your physical abilit y and time constraints . If you live in a house or stay at a hotel , ther e's only so far that you can r ealistically walk in one day bef ore you need to r eturn back to your base. Bik ing may be the best way to experience Tianjin, not only do you have freedom that taxis , busses , and subways don 't oer but you have an added speed that walk ing lacks . A str oll from the Eye of Tianjin to JieFang bridge immediately outside of the Tianjin R ailway Station may be a 1.5-2 hour journey depending on your pace. A leisur ely bike ride k nocks that down to 30 minutes all while getting the same sights and sounds as walk ing. With bik ing though, it has a number of physical constraints . One, you need to purchase a bic ycle, secondly , you need to lock that bik e up when you ar e not on it. Then you need to r eturn to the same location of the locked bik e to continue your journey . Pulling over o the bik e and going f or a walk may seem daunting as you need to mak e sur e and you must inevitably r eturn to that same location to retrieve the bik e. That's extremely tedious . Many of us who ar e on the way to work and school chose to catch a ride on the busses for their convenience, even with trac dragging out the transit time. Bik ing o ers a much gr eater fr eedom and r eliabilit y than the subway or busses tend to . Recently , biking has made a huge comeback in China as millions are signing up f or online bik e rental ser vices like ofo and Mobik e. These r ental bik es o ers the abilit y to pick up a bik e wher ever people exist and to dr op them o at almost any destination. Those of us who come fr om cities and towns outside of China that do not even hold a flame to the metr opolises of Beijing , Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenzhen; we may have a di erent idea of ownership . We each have a plot of land , a pool that we seldom use, and a car that's r equir ed to traverse the suburban hellscape. Coming to China, you gr ow to appr eciate the communities . We don 't need 100 separate lawns when thousands of communit y members can all appr eciate the same parks that ar e maintained by sta . We don't all need a bic ycle that we only use an hour or t wo a day at the most when we can just shar e bik es that will be wher ever we need them. Living in the cit y, sharing is a must. Ofo and Mobik e are two of the largest companies operating in this booming industr y right now and perhaps you have alr eady seen the bright yellow of o bik es and the sleek silver Mobikes with their orange accents . Signing up for accounts to use these ser vices ar e relatively pain fr ee as the applications ar e entir ely in English. After r egistering , sending a passpor t photo to conrm your identit y, and putting down a deposit of 100-300RMB , you're ready to hit the r oad. In order to ride a bik e, you will need to also load your account with mone y. At the moment, both of o and Mobik e are oering deals wher e if you put down 100RMB , you receive an ex tra 100RMB of fr ee cr edit attributed to your account. To get the most out of the r ental bik e experience while the weather is per fect, we have compiled a f ew classic locations f or tak ing bik e rides in Tianjin. Our rst r oute is along the Hai River as the str etch fr om the Eye of Tianjin all the way past the DaGuangM ing Bridge mak e a scenic ride that enjo ys some of the g reatest views of the cit y. This ride is beautiful during any time of day and it's almost r ecommended that you tr y exploring Hai R iver in the morning , evening , and at dusk to get the fullest experience .

Skyline of Tianjin 6364 TRAVEL TRAVEL n previous JinMag Travel ar ticles, we have identied SuZhou the second largest cit y in Jiangsu province \u087e just 100 k ilometers northwest of Shanghai and one of the top ten economic centers in China with over 10 million population. You can see that Suzhou is rich, as reflected by the clean, spacious str eets and abundance of gr eener y and parks . Suzhou also has a rich histo ry being established in 514 BC and on the r oute of the Grand Canal . Suzhou is also the ancestral home of I.M. P ei Bei Yu ming who is a famous modern American Chinese architec t. Mr. Pei designed many of the Bank of China buildings , John F . Kennedy Librar y and the L ouvr e Pyramid in Pa ris. This ar ticle will f ocus on Suzhou Embr oider y, which is famous thr oughout China and worldwide. Emb roidery was originated in China about the 5th to 3r d centur y BC. T here are several di erent sty les of embr oider y that developed in China over the past 2500 years . In Hunan called I SOME OF THE WORKS TAKE FROM ONE TO TWO WEEKS TO MONTHS DEPENDING UPON THE COMPLEXIT Y OF THE PROJEC T. \"Xiang Xiu \" () , Guangdong ,called Xiu \" (/) , Sichuan called \"Shu Xiu\" ()and what we will discuss her e is Suzhou \"Su Xiu \" (). Suzhou embr oider y is famous f or its beautiful patterns , elegant colors , variet y of stitches , and consummate craftsmanship . Its stitching is meticulously sk illful, coloration subtle and r ened . Suzhou ar tists are able to use mor e than 40 needlework and a 1,000 dierent types of thr eads to ma ke embr oider y, typically with nature and environment themes such as flowers , birds, animals and even ga rdens on a piece of cloth. There is also special subset of Suzhou embr oider y that is double sided stitching and there is a completely di erent pattern or picture on the t wo sides . The ends of the stitch ar e not k notted but woven into the back, which tak es a ver y special sk ill and makes this t ype of embr oider y ver y scarc e and expensive. Embroide ry shops by the hundred sThe distr ict to visit in Suzhou is Zhenhu to see an inc redible variet y of embr oider y. There are over 100 shop s, displaying eve ry design that you can imagine. Many shops had women mak ing the embr oider y on site and did not mend to have tourists tak ing photos and ask ing questions . Most of the art isans wer e from the local area and star ted doing this handcraf t from a very young age. Some of the works take fro m one to t wo weeks to months depending upon the complexit y of the pro ject. I aske d if this t ype of work was har d on the ngers as I assumed that constant needlework would result in ar thritis I was surprised when the middle aged lady indicated that the big pr oblems is the eyesight and as she gr ew older , needed stronger eyeglasses and would p robably have to stop doing this because of the strain on her eyes. It was amazing to me that these wonder ful works of ar t were created f rom copying photos , drawings or paintings . I guess I was think ing that they would f ollow a designed pattern or almost paint by numbers canvas , but all this is completed by fr eehand and truly is a unique handmade masterpiece. Each of these ar tists specializes in cer tain types of st yles. Some only do por traits , the typical large lif e size embr oider y of Chairman Mao and Chairman Shi could be seen in many window s. But what intrigued me most was some embro idered pieces wer e made from photos of family or family pets . What a lovely piece to have as a memor y rather than a common studio photo po rtrait. I ask ed if the embr oider y would fade over time but was told if the embroider y is made fro m high qualit y silk and framed pr operly with glas s, it will last a longtime, just do n't display it in direct sunlight. Pi eces of Chinese embr oider y have been discove red from 300 BC. So your piece should last. The other common pieces were the typical shes , dragons and the 12 Chinese zodiac cre atures representing the Chinese lunar year . This year being the rooster . Fishes were abundant as it is a homonym for the Chinese wo rd \"Yu\" means surplus or abundance and sh \" Yu\" has the same pronunciation. These sh ar e usually in g roups or 6, 8 or 9 again these numbers in Chinese are homonyms f or 6 \"Liu\" to flow (good f or business), 8 sounds lik e \"Fa\" prosper, and 9 \"Jiu\" for long lasting or longevit y. Machines With the advent of computers, many embr oider ed patterns and logos ar e machine made and even complicated designs and portraits can be machine made. So one has to be car eful to mak e sur e your work of a rt is actually hand made. I was told that an easy way of telling the true hand made item, is looking at the back of the embr oider y, and the handmade one will have irr egular kn ots by the machined one will be ver y even and uniform. Conclusion One thing that was ver y strange during my visit was the str eet and shops wer e almost empty and ver y few customers w ere seen. I aske d some stor e owners and they indicated that a f ew y ears ago ther e was a huge expansion of new stor es but business has dropped considerable due to the economic down turn but the ar ea is still flooded with tourists during major holidays and the summer time due to the pr oximit y of Lak e Tai which is nearby and is Chin a's third largest f reshwater body of water .

I guess f or anyone that goes to a foreign countr y, getting sick is a big issue, par ticularly with the language barrier . Another complaint was about the lack of public ser vice notices in fo reign languages , however I think this is a plus as it pushed me to lear n charac ters. And ther e is absolutely no reason to r equir e another countr y to accommodate us . How many notices in Chinese ar e there in your cit y? One teacher fr om Wales who has lived in Tianjin since 1998 and is pr eparing to go home commented that what he r eally loved about Tianjin was the people, so hospitable and friendly - me too (I 'm not hospitable and friendly but I agr ee Tianjiners ar e). Another aspec t we pr obably could all agree on is that most fo reigners f eel that Tianjin is r eally saf e. I have been to a lot of countries but I can honestly say that my time in Tianjin was the saf est I have ever f elt in my life. Out of all the ocial statistics re garding foreigners ' reasons f or going to China, I was most inter ested in the 1.72% \"who to go nd another lif e\". That is my categor y. How about you? I did achieve my aim, I did nd another life and I learned things that ar e benetting me still , even though I have alr eady been back in England fo r 3 years . How many foreigners ar e ther e in China? A lot and you ar e one of them! And do you know what? I really en vy you.Photo by You Sihang by Paula TaylorI HA VE BEEN TO A LO T OF COUNTRIES BUT I C AN HONESTL Y SAY THA T MY TIME IN TIANJIN WAS THE SAFEST I HA VE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE . SO "}
