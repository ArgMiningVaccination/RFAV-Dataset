Zinc supplementation can improve immune function and reduce morbidity. Objective To assess the effect of zinc supplementation on infants' anti-HBs titer after hepatitis B vaccination. Methods A double-blind randomized control trial of 66 healthy infants in Pustu Dauh Puri, Denpasar Barat was conducted. Subjects were followed from birth to three months of age and were placed into two treatment groups using block randomization. One group received zinc supplements with a standard hepatitis B vaccination (zinc group, n=33) and the other group received placebo supplements with standard hepatitis B vaccination (placebo group, n=33). The serum zinc levels were measured at baseline and at three months. The difference in levels of anti-HBs titer between the zinc and placebo groups was the primary endpoint of this study. Results The serum zinc levels were significantly higher in the zinc group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.017), with a mean difference of 18.76 miU/ml (95% CI 3.45 to 34.07). Regardless of baseline serum zinc levels, the mean anti-HBs titers were significantly higher in the zinc group compared to the placebo group (P <0.0001; mean difference = 495.8 miU/mL; 95% CI 362.32 to 629.44). Multivariate analysis showed that zinc supplementation was the only variable that influenced anti-HBs titer levels (P < 0.0001). Conclusion Regardless of their initial zinc serum level, infants receiving zinc supplements along with standard hepatitis B vaccination have significantly higher levels of anti-HBs titers than infants receiving hepatitis B vaccination without zinc supplements.
