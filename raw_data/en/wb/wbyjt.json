In this spirit, Serenity aims to nurture guests with experiences that rejuvenate mind, body and spirit, and instil a sense of harmony. The Datai Langkawi's well-being experiences incorporate Ramuan in its different forms: - The Malay Wellness Journey.

A wide selection of nature excursions are paired with education on the rainforest's floral and faunal inhabitants. - Nutrition.
