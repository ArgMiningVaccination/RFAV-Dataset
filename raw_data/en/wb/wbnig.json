This series responds to the many questions raised as conventional health care practitioners encounterwidespread and increasing use of complementary and alternative thera- pies. Each publication in the series high- lights one or more of the key issues facing health professionals today\u2014in- cluding assessing information, safety,and efficacy; appreciating alternative healing concepts; and effectively inte- grating conventional, complementary,and alternative health care. Safety Issues in Complementary & Alternative Health Care explores issues related to the safe use of complemen- tary and alternative therapies, the com-parative risks of complementary and conventional care, and the specific safety concerns that emerge when con-ventional and complementary and al- ternative health care practices converge.PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 2004PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 2004Safety Issues in Complementary & Alternative Health Care foreword Not many years ago, the use of complementary and alternative therapies in the United States was assumed to be an infrequent occurrence. Consequently, conventional health care practitioners had little knowledge of these practices and even less understanding of safety considerations related to their use. But research in the 1990s revealed extensive and rapidly growinguse by Americans of a wide range of complementary and alternative therapies. In fact, a large percentage of patients receiving conventional medical care now also use complementaryand alternative care. For the conventional practitioner, this finding raised two immediate questions: \"How safe ar e these therapies?\" and \"What risks are involved when patients combine the use conventional and complementary therapies.?\" Safety Issues in Complementary and Alternative Health Care was written in response to these questions. Ironically, this task was undertaken at the same time that research was revealingserious safety issues confronting conventional medicine. Thus,the following discussion examines complementary and alternative medicine's safety not in isolation, but in the context of a conventional medical system that itself poses high risks topatients, and is increasingly interacting with a variety ofcomplementary and alternative therapies. The primary purpose of this publication is to assist health care providers\u2014alternative as well as conventional\u2014to understand the safety issues that arise when their practices meet.CONTENTS The Safety of Conventional Health Care ............. 3 The Risks & Safety of Complementary & Alternative Medicine ................................ 6 General Safety Problems in CAM ................. 7 Diagnosing & Testing Safety Concerns ...... 11 Ensuring Clinical Competence ..................... 14 Ensuring Product Safety ............................ 16 Safety of Three Commonly Used Complementary Therapies ....................... 20 Safety, Pediatrics & Complementary Medicine ............................................... 21 Shared Safety Issues: Conventional & Complementary Medicine ............................. 22 Communicating About Risk & Safety of Complementary & Alternative Medicine .............................. 23 Increasing Safety in Complementary & Alternative Medicine ............................. 26 Summary ..................................................... 28 References .................................................... 29PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 2004Specifically, the objectives are to assist readers to: understand the risks and safety issues that arise from the convergence of conventional, complementary and alternative medicine; identify safety problems specific to complementary and alternative medicine; be aware of issues related to credentialing and professional monitoring of complementary and alternative health care providers; and communicate effectively about these safety issues with patients. Finally, a note about the terminology used in this publication. In recent years, the term \"CAM\" has come into common usage to describe, in the words of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, \" a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine .\" Despite its convenient brevity, the acronym CAM has some unfortunate implications. It suggests, for example, a homogeneity among the practices included under the umbrella term\u2014something that is not at all true. It also implies a clear and complete distinction between conventional and CAM systems of care. That alsois inaccurate. Therefore the term CAM is used sparingly, and only as shorthand for that \"group ofdiverse medical and health care systems. . .\" where the emphasis is on the word \"diverse.\" Susan Gaylord Sally Norton Peter Curtis Series EditorsSAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20041 Safety Issues in Complementary & Alternative Health Care \"You medical people will have more lives to answer for in the other world than even we generals. \" \u2014Napoleon Bonaparte One cannot examine the safety of complementary and alternative therapies in isolation. They are components of a larger, complex system of health care and their safety must beconsidered along with that of all health care services and products. A widespread public belief is that non-mainstream therapies pose a higher risk than con- ventional treatments. In fact, adverse effects of complementary and alternative therapies are rela-tively infrequent compared to those of conventional medicine. The perception persists, nonethe-less. Paradoxically, the public's assumption that the safety of conventional medicine is assured by regulations and the education and training of health professionals also may be a misperception(see box, below ). Certainly the incidence of deaths resulting from medical error and adverse pharma- ceutical effects should raise serious questions about the safety of conventional medical care. Inaddition, new research continually uncovers dangers of accepted treatments that were once thoughtto be highly safe and beneficial. A case in point is the widely publicized study of over 16,000 postmenopausal women concluding that hormone replacementtherapy (Prempro\u00ae) significantly increases the risks of coronaryartery disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism after five yearsof treatment (Writing Group for the Women's Health InitiativeInvestigators, 2002). These findings contrast dramatically with theguidelines and clinical practice in treating menopause over the last15 to 20 years: that this therapy protected women from thesesame health risks. Thus, to fully appreciate the safety issues relatedto complementary and alternative medicine, it is important to takea balanced view of the risks and safety of all forms of medicaltreatment. Equally important is the understanding of the safety im- plications of a health care system where complementary and con-ventional practices intertwine. It is clear that not only are many NUMBER OF DEATHS BY SELECTED CAUSE IN 1 999 Medical errors ................................................ 44,000 Medication errors ............................................. 7,000 Motor vehicle accidents .................................. 43,458 Breast cancer & Donaldson (Eds.), 2000THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20042 people using complementary and alternative therapies, but most do so in combination with conventional care (Eisenberg, et al., 2001). Different systems of health care do not simply co-exist, but in-teract\u2014usually without guidance from their respective health careproviders. This complexity is compounded by widespread prod-uct marketing on the part of both pharmaceutical and comple- mentary and alternative companies directly to the public throughthe television and Internet. Risk and safety issues in health care may thus be exam- ined from three perspectives. First, there are the issues of safetyin conventional medicine; second, there are safety issues particu-larly relevant to complementary and alternative therapies; and,third, there are the issues arising from overlapping care that pa-tients may receive from both types of practitioners. defining safety, assessing risk It would be helpful in day-to-day clinical practice if it were pos-sible to define a standard level of acceptable risk or safety thresh-old for all medications, herbal and nutritional products, and pro-cedures, including surgery. This is an unrealistic goal, because anassessment of risk and safety depends on combinations of many factors ( see box, above left ). Patient factors that affect outcomes in- clude age, gender, race, the severity of the disease, its course and progression, the individual patient's response to the intervention, and the patient's ability to pay forcare. These combine with a variety of clinical factors, including known adverse effects of theintervention, the delivery system of treatment, the relative effectiveness of the treatment, and theclinician's expertise. For example, the Physician's Desk Reference contains a vast array of pharmaceuticals\u2014both single agents and combination products\u2014that are associated with a wide range of side effectsoccurring in from less than 1 percent to 15 percent of patients. Therefore, advising the patient isnecessarily a highly individualized and complex exercise for the health professional. In conven-tional medicine, effectiveness and safety of treatment are closely linked as part of the formation ofstandards of care over time (Cohen & Eisenberg, 2002). Although these standards are continuallyevolving, when counseling the patient or family, the clinician must always consider whether the testor treatment is: Effective and relatively safe (for example: a conventional hypertensive medication; acupuncture for pain or nausea; massage for low back pain; saw palmetto for benign prostatic hypertrophy). Effective, but with some potential or recognized adverse outcome (for example: anti- biotics causing allergy; ginkgo John's wort or kava kava affecting liver function). Effectiveness is unclear (insufficient evidence) but relatively safe (for example: short course of steroids for acute low-back pain; Echinacea for viral influenza; mind-body techniques for anxiety).FACTORS TREATMENT SAFETY PPPPPAAAAATIENT FTIENT FTIENT FTIENT FTIENT F ACTACTACTACTACTORSORSORSORSORS Age, gender, race Severity of disease/illness Course of illness (speed of progression or variability) Individual responses to the intervention or medication Other clinical factors or co-morbidities Ability to pay for care CLINICAL FCLINICAL FCLINICAL FCLINICAL FCLINICAL F ACTACTACTACTACTORSORSORSORSORS Known adverse effects of the intervention/ medication The delivery system of treatment Relative effectiveness of the treatment Clinician's level of knowledge, expertise, skill, and fallibilitySAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20043 Effectiveness and safety are unclear or questionable (for example: hormone replace- ment therapy for menopause (Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative Inves- tigators, 2002); surgery for chronic low-back pain; Panax ginseng for multiple sclerosis). Ineffective with potential or established harmful effects (for example: chaparral). Good clinical judgment requires knowing the toxicity, quality, and cost of the procedure or product; careful monitoring of the diagnostic test or treatment; and assessing the benefits versusthe risks. The clinician's responsibilities also include communicating openly about managementoptions, demonstrating professional competence, and ensuring ethical behavior. Potential harm to patients comes not only from direct risks, but also from 1) financial loss due to payment for ineffective treatments, 2) indirect damage due to delay in diagnosis or treat-ment, or 3) misunderstandings due to biased or incomplete information. All can lead to undesiredoutcomes. A well-informed clinician with good listening and communication skills can help pa-tients avoid adverse effects. the safety of conventional health care In conventional medicine, safety is generally assured by societal agreements that the federal gov- ernment is responsible for monitoring the development and safety of pharmaceuticals and newtechnical procedures, and that professional organizations and other government agencies will overseemedical training and safe and ethical medical practice. The main agency in the government respon-sible for safety is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Health professional societies andtraining organizations are responsible for the ethics and competence of practitioners, and hospi-tals are responsible for the safety of patients and professionals working within their confines.Certifying boards operate in all states to re gulate various health practices while protecting the welfare of the public. State medical boards, for example, have been required to license and moni- tor the quality of conventional medical practitioners since 1912. Nurses have been licensed understate nursing boards since 1903, and nurse practitioner licensing went into effect in North Caro- lina in 1974. Although widespread, these monitoring systems are not al ways effective or adequate, and failure of practitioners to comply with standards and regulations often goes unreported. Recentstudies have shown that HMOs and hospitals rarely report incompetent physicians as required bylaw and that the quality of conventional health care needs substantial improvement (Chassin &Galvin, 1998; McCormick, Himmelstein, Woolhandler, Wolfe, & Bor, 2002). There have been recent improvements. As of January 2001, federal law requires that Medicare patients be allowed access to their medical records if there are complaints about theircare ( New York Times , Jan. 1, 2001). Additionally, information on disciplinary action against physi- cians can now be requested through the Federation of State Medical Boards website(www.docinfo.org). Information on incompetent physicians is also maintained in the NationalPractitioner Databank; similar information is available from the Board of Nursing (www.ncbon.com)about impaired nurses. Still, despite the many mechanisms developed to protect the public and insure quality of care, problems remain. In fact, there is evidence that some patients have turned to complementary and alternative therapies because they fear the to xicity or side effects of modern drugs and treat-THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20044 ments and because they mistrust medical provid- ers and their institutions or means of providingcare (Astin, 1998). the iceberg of safety problems The structure of the health care system itself leads to safety problems. Research shows,for example, that improved health outcomes cor-relate with well-organized primary care; but theUnited States has a poorly developed primary caresystem (Starfield, 2000). The reliance on healthinsurance as the principal way of regulating ac-cess and the constant changes in those deliverysystems create numerous safety and quality assur-ance problems. Social and income inequalities re-sult in delayed, inadequate, and discriminatory pa-tient care. Additionally, the structure of the deliv-ery system results in discontinuous and poorly co-ordinated care by generalists and specialists andpoor communication among practitioners. Theparticularly high reliance on technology, tests andprocedures often leads to indiscriminate and costlytreatment\u2014with the accompanying potentialharms, such as unjustified procedures and treat-ment arising from false-positive results (Starfield,2000; Fisher & Welch, 1999). Perhaps most significant is the power and influence of what might be called the \"medical-industrial complex.\" This term describes the per-vasive and dominating relationships between the pharmaceutical industry, health care practitioners and hospitals, medical schools, and governingagencies\u2014including the NIH and the FDA. Because of these entangled relationships, health careproviders are enmeshed in the pharmaceutical industry's efforts to research and promote its estab-lished and emerging products. For example, there is good evidence that systematic reviews andmeta-analyses of therapeutic interventions (often funded by pharmaceutical companies) focus mainlyon reporting effectiveness data and give little information on safety (Ernst & Pittler, 2001) Thispractice tends to downplay safety issues in favor of boosting the marketing of the drug (Angell,2000a&b; Angell, 2004). Analyses of the types of adverse effects in conventional medical care occurring in west- ern countries reveal significant problems in many areas, including operative errors, medicationerrors, and adverse pharmaceutical effects (Alberti, 2001). Indeed, medical errors ( see box ) are the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer ( Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 2000). This is not a problem confined to the United States. Worldwide, there is increasing aware- ness of the dangers of conventional medical practice occurring in hospitals, pharmacies, physi-cians' offices, nursing homes, and home care programs. The Australian government reports, forHIGH-RISK MEDICINE The organization of conventional medicine, coupled withits emphasis on pharmacological care, creates a high-risksystem. Recent examples of the dangers include: Wolfe et al, estimated there were 103,000 serious gastrointestinal complications and 16,500 deathsrelated to NSAIDs in patients with arthritis, costing over$2 billion annually (Wolfe, Lichtenstein, & Singh, 1999). The Kellogg Foundation examined 30,195 patients in the United States and reported a 3.7 percent medicalerror rate. A 1998 JAMA meta-analysis of 39 prospective studies reported adverse drug reactions (ADR) occurring in 6.7percent of hospitalized patients. The authors estimatedthat, in 1994, 10,600 fatal adverse drug reactionsoccurred (Lazarou, Pomeranz, & Corey, 1998). A 1999 Institute of Medicine study estimated that 225,000 iatrogenic deaths occur each year in the United States. Ofthese, 12,000 deaths are associated with unnecessarysurgery. The study also reported that of 106,000 adverseeffects of correctly prescribed drugs, 50 percent werepreventable (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, (Eds.), 2000).SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20045 example, that preventable medical errors in hospitals are responsible for 11 percent of all deaths in Australia. In the United Kingdom, medical errors are the third most frequent cause of death, withone in 14 patients suffering adverse events such as drug reactions and diagnostic or surgical errors(\"Medical Error,\" 2000; Sunday Times (UK), Dec. 19, 1999). pharmaceutical safety While there has been important progress in recent decades in developing reliable, effective medications, the emphasis on and enthusiasm for effectiveness has often overshadowed issues ofsafety. Thus, despite federal drug regulations, use of clinical trials, and the application of chemo-therapeutic principles, there remain serious issues of safety related to pharmaceutical products andtheir applications. In clinical settings, safety concerns include prescription and dosage errors, patient compli- ance, side effects, polypharmacy, and drug interactions. For example, 69 percent of medical injurieswere judged to be due to errors in management while 19.4 percent were due to dosage errors inwriting or preparing prescriptions (Bates, et al., 1995). A number of factors contribute to these problems. It appears, for example, that clinicians often are not sufficiently aware of the potential side effects of the vast array of available drugs. Intheir busy practices, they neither have nor take the time to read about them in detail. Furthermore,a practitioner cannot always rely on the medical literature to clarify the risks. A few examplesillustrate the magnitude and complexity of the problem. In a study of outpatient prescriptions, involving 11 ambulatory clinics in Boston, patients reported an 18 percent complication rate (although this was recorded in only 3 percent of clinic charts). Significant correlates of these complications were failure toexplain side effects and situations wher e patients had multiple medical problems (Gandhi, et al., 2000). In 2000, the FDA used a fast-track process to get alosetron (Lotronex)\u2014used to treat irritable bowel syndrome in women\u2014approved and into pharmacies quickly. Clinical trials had shown that ischemic colitis occurred in 1 of 970 patients. After the drugentered the market, a number of patients taking this drug were hospitalized for severeconstipation, bleeding, and ischemic colitis, some requiring surgery. Over all, the drugproduced a therapeutic gain of only 10-15 percent over controls. It is of note that thedrug was pulled from the market and is now being re-released. Seventy-five percent of U.S. patients receive a prescription for a pharmaceutical prod- uct from a doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant. One in five patients experiences side effects, mainly from antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-inflamma-tory drugs. And, in 20 percent of cases, the adverse effects last more than three months(Gandhi, et al., 2000). Three out of four adverse drug reactions are dose-related. This is largely because manufacturers develop dosage levels to prove significant effects, although there are many patients who respond well to lower dosages. For example, the recommendeddose of hydrochlorthiazide has dropped over the years from 100 mg per day to 6.25mg. People who are sensitive to caffeine, alcohol, and over-the-counter antihistaminesoften respond well to smaller doses of medicines ( Pharmacist's Letter , 2001). As these examples reveal, many medical safety problems relate to pharmaceuticals in spite of an apparently rigorous evaluation and testing process monitored and regulated by the FDA. TheTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20046 problem may lie partially in the sheer size of the agency's responsibility. The FDA monitors about one trillion dollarsworth of products annually and, in the last 10 years, morethan 500 products have been approved for public use. In the past, bringing a drug to market involved four stages of clinical evaluation required by the FDA. In 1997,the Food and Drug Modernization Act (FDMA) streamlinedthe drug approval process to help get drugs to market. Thus,only one clinical trial and surrogate end points were deemedenough to move a new drug through the approval process tomarket. This change has been severely criticized for lower-ing the standards of approval. Of the products approvedthis way in 1998, several were eventually removed from themarket because of adverse effects\u2014including mibefradil forhypertension, dexflenfuramine for obesity, and terfenadinefor allergies (Lipsky & Sharp, 2001). the risks & safety of complementary & alternative medicine The evidence shows that conventional medicine has major problems in terms of patient safety and that the causes andsolutions are complex. However, there also are issues ofsafety in the practice of complementary and alternative medi- cine about which the public and clinicians should be aware. We know, for example, that health foodstore staff readily give consumers information, but that this information is often incorrect ormisleading and staff often advocate unproven products (Gotay & Dumitriu, 2000). As more andmore people use botanicals and nutraceuticals alone as well as in combination with other supple-ments and conventional drug therapies, health professionals need to know about adverse effectsand interactions that can occur. They also need to know where to seek this information. Four major kinds of issues are related to the safety of complementary and alternative therapies. The first are those resulting from the unique regulatory status of CAM products andpractitioners. For example, because herbs and supplements are regulated as food rather than medi-cine, they lack the mandated efficacy and safety assurance mechanisms that are required of phar-maceuticals. A second area of concern relates to the many different approaches to testing anddiagnosing illness taken by complementary and alternative practitioners. The variety in the under-lying theories of illness makes standardization of clinical practices much more difficult. Third,issues of clinical competence are raised by the substantial variability in the training and/or stan-dards of practice of these practitioners. Finally, there are a number of safety issues related to thestandardization and biological efficacy of specific products and techniques.STAGES OF FDA DRUG APPROVAL PROCESS Phase 1: Establish pharmacological actions and safe dosage range. Phase 2: Conduct controlled studies in animals and volunteers to assess effectiveness and safety. Phase 3: Conduct clinical trials testing larger numbers of patients in clinical settings who havethe condition the drug is intended to treat. Phase 4: Conduct \"post-marketing surveillance\" studies after FDA approval and marketing ofthe drug. This important stage may revealadverse effects not shown in Phase 3. Manythousands of people are monitored while takingthe drug\u2014both actively (using survey andclinical evaluations) and passively (by voluntaryreporting of adverse effects). Fast-track drugs: This is an accelerated approval process for drugs for patients with seriousdiseases who are not able to receive effectivetherapy.SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20047 general safety problems in CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM In the early 1900s, state licensing laws came into effect to regulate the training and practice of conventional medicine and protect the public from fraud and abuse. These regulations, in conjunc-tion with the rise of biomedicine and the pharmaceutical industry, essentially marginalized otherhealing systems, often making them illegal. Legislation also played an important role, setting the stage for the environment in which complementary and alternative therapies are practiced today. In 1906, the Pure Food and DrugsAct was introduced because of widespread food production scandals and deaths from bacterial contamination (Nadakavukaren, 2000). At that time, the act required only truthful labeling ofproducts. Subsequently, the 1938 federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act) required drugs to be tested for safety (composition, quality, labeling, and directions for use), but effectiveness ofdrugs was not addressed (Lewis & Strom, 2002; Burdock, 2000). In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the 1938 FDC Act required for the first time that stringent testing be used to prove that drugs were effective (Kauffman, 1995). (Homeo-pathic remedies have been exempted from safety testing since 1938, perhaps because the remediescontain minimal amounts of biologically active compounds.) However, in 1994\u2014partly in re-sponse to lobbying by the dietary supplement industry and partly because of personal belief in thereported health benefits of supplements\u2014members of Congress passed the1994 Dietary Supple- ment Health and Education Act (DSHEA) (Burdock, 2000; Lewis & Strom 2002; Dietary Supple-ment Act of 1994, 1995). Dietary supplements under DSHEA are clearly defined and include \"an herb or other botanical\" as well as vitamins, minerals, metabolic extracts, and amino acids. Manufacturers ofdietary supplements must provide the FDA with evidence the product is \"reasonably expected tobe safe\" (Lewis & Strom, 2002). The requirements for determining safety are not as stringent as arethose for food additives and pharmaceutical drugs. Herbal product manufacturers need not submitresults of clinical trials to substantiate safety claims; in fact, herbal substances in common use priorto the enactment of the bill are \"grandfathered;\" i.e., they are marketed lawfully without FDAapproval (Burdock, 2000). Thus, under current law, it is the government's responsibility to showthat an herb or supplement is unsafe (Burdock, 2000). Only then are vendors forced to stop sellingtheir product. Manufactur ers now strive to follow the FD A 's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and report this on their labels. In contrast, the German government regulates herbal products and pharmaceuticals in a similar manner in terms of safety and efficacy. The standards for approval of herbal 'drugs' aremore lenient than those for pharmaceuticals, however (Blumenthal, 1998). The limited regulationof complementary and alternative products and treatments and the increasing number of patientswho use CAM and conventional medicine concurrently, has led to a number of broad safety con-cerns that deserve special attention, including labeling and mislabeling, misrepresentation, misap-plication, misdiagnosis, substitution, interactions, double-dosing, and adverse effect reporting. labeling & mislabeling Since 1999, federal regulations require that food and dietary labels be more comprehen- sive, showing all ingredients and the daily reference value in the label box. Minerals must be uni-formly listed and herbs and herbal extracts must be listed with their common name and Latinname.THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20048 Labeling problems often have to do with the \"other ingredients\" noted on the label. These usually consist of additives that help construct the product delivery vehicle\u2014fillers (to add bulk),binders (for tablets), lubricants (to help manufacturing), coatings (to aid swallowing), and colorings.Some of these products can cause allergies or biological effects or reduce absorption\u2014and areoften given disguised names. For example, \"glaze\" (natural, confectioners, pharmaceutical) is aeuphemism for shellac. As in conventional medicine, potential reactions may occur with foodcolorings, various gums, preservatives such as benzoates and propionates, and lubricants (stearates,vegetable and castor oil). The supplier may have added other ingredients without informing thepurchaser. Mislabeling occurs when the product does not contain the items listed on the label, or contains ingredients with incorrect quantities/concentrations. For example, studies have shownthat the amount of ginseng in most commercial ginseng products is highly variable and is generallyless than indicated on the label (Cui, , 1994; Feifer, Fleshner, & may not deliver the magnetic field strength (gauss) claimed by the manufacturer.Labeling also often fails to identify pharmaceuticals and toxic agents (heavy metals and pesticides)contained in herbal products (Straus, 2002). In response to labeling concerns, since March of 2003, the FDA has drafted Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to \"ensure that the identity, purity, quality, strength, andcomposition of dietary supplements are accurately reflected on the product label\" (FDA, 2003b).These new guidelines should significantly improve the quality of dietary supplements, althoughthey will not address underlying issues of the safety of the botanical ingredient (Kroll, 2003). misrepresentation Therapies or products may claim effectiveness using treatments and diagnostic procedures that have yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Such misrepresentation may not cause harm and theproducts or treatments may be quite safe. However, the use of these treatments may be unneces-sary and costly while delaying access to existing effective care. An example of such an unproventreatment would be the use of acupuncture to treat diabetes, possibly distracting the patient fromseeking conventional care. misapplication It is likely that inappropriate self-dosing by consumers has led to problems of toxicity or adverse interactions with other medications, but this issue has not been studied systematically.Misapplication may occur because of inadequate training or experience on the part of the practitio-ner. It is not uncommon for complementary and alternative practitioners to expand the scope oftheir practice to include other healing systems. Many chiropractors, for example, offer acupunctureand nutritional counseling. However, while well credentialed in their own field, they may not haveadequate training or certification in the new discipline. The same problem may arise when conven-tional clinicians begin to use complementary and alternative therapies. Variability in training and credentialing among some CAM practitioners may contribute to this problem. For example, the education of chiropractors varies according to the training school,either including or excluding study in the use of nutritional supplements and acupuncture. Naturo-pathic practitioners may be trained by a six-week correspondence course or attend a four-year post-baccalaureate degree program. The possibility of misapplication is clearly much greater for thosewith less training.SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 20049 misdiagnosis by the clinician Risks are incurred when the clinician fails to detect the actual medical problem or assigns the wrong diagnosis to the patient. This is particularly likely when the diagnosis is governed by avery narrow diagnostic paradigm. For example, iridology uses patterns in the iris of the eye, reflex-ology uses patterns on the soles of the feet, and electro-diagnostic instruments (the neuro-calometer developed by chiropractic in the 1930s) are used by chiropractors to recognize diseased organs. Of course, diagnostic problems also commonly occur in conventional medicine, either by missing the diagnosis, making the incorrect diagnosis, or \"over-diagnosing\" the problem (Chassin& Galvin, 1998). Missing the diagnosis\u2014which results from errors of omission, such as not doingan adequate physical examination, failing to do an appropriate test, or misinterpretation of testresults\u2014most often occurs in primary care. Over-diagnosing\u2014which results from errors of com-mission, such as identifying a prolapsed lumbar disc that \"requires\" surgery, or getting a falsepositive test for benign prostatic hypertrophy\u2014tends to occur most often in specialist care. Also inconventional medicine, laboratory errors that may lead to invasive testing and treatment by theclinician are quite frequent (Sox, 1996). substitution for or delay of appropriate therapy Indirect safety risks may result from the substitution of a more invasive or ineffective therapy for the \"appropriate\" therapy. (Of course, in medicine there is always uncertainty aboutwhat is actually appropriate for an individual patient in a given situation.) This problem is oftenseen within conventional medicine, as in a surgeon's being too quick in recommending back sur-gery, before the patient has explored less invasive therapeutic options. This problem may also arisewith respect to CAM therapies: a patient might delay or substitute use of a safe, effective conven-tional therapy so as to use a riskier or unproven alternative; or, the patient who is receiving appro-priate conventional therapy may stop it in spite of health risks, on the recommendation of a CAMpractitioner. An example is the case of a middle-aged diabetic woman whose CAM provider rec-ommends that she stop oral hypoglycemic drugs before starting to use a traditional Chinese remedyand whose diabetes consequently goes out of control. It is important to note that substitution for, or delay of \"appropriate\" therapy may not necessarily pose a safety risk. In fact, the appropriate treatment for a particular patient may well bea complementary therapy or a combination of CAM and conventional treatment. Moreover, harmmay result from conventional providers' dismissing the use of any complementary or alternativetherapy for \"lack of evidence of efficacy,\" thus dissuading patients from using potentially helpfultherapies. It may well be that the evidence for effectiveness exists, but that the clinician is unawareof it. The real issue is one of information transfer and communication. In all fields of medicine, it is essential that communication between clinicians about their respective serious risks may arisewhen one practitioner's treatment supersedes another and the respective clinicians are not in com-munication. interaction between CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM & conventional medicine Of particular concern are problematic interactions between conventional medications and dietary supplements. After all, one in six adults taking prescription drugs also takes at least oneherbal product (Kaufman, Kelly, Rosenberg, Anderson, & Mitchell, 2002). While some interactionsare life threatening, other, more subtle problems may also result. A complementary product orTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200410 treatment might counteract a medication, dilute its effects, or enhance its properties, creating an inadvertent \"overdose.\" And often the effect is not obvious and may thus compound over time.One example occurs in organ transplant therapy when blood levels of cyclosporin and indinavirare significantly decreased when St. John's wort is started, resulting in rejection of the transplantedorgan ( Medical Letter , 2000). St John's wort taken for longer than 14 days also alters the metabolism of other conventional medications by affecting li ver enzyme function (Wang, Gorski, Huang, Lesko, & Hall, 2001). double-dosing Patients often take many different commercial CAM products at the same time. Many herbal and nutritional supplements sold to the public are branded for different health maintenanceand prevention purposes, such as \"anti-aging,\" \"menopause,\" or \"cholesterol defense formula.\"Thus, it is fairly easy to take multiple sets of many of the same ingredients\u2014particularly if labelsare unclear about the ingredients. The mail-order company Bronson, for example, sells Anti-Aging,a \"complete men's formula that contains 12 vitamins, 8 elemental nutrients, and 5 herbs for pros-tate, cardiac, and immune health.\" Based on this form of marketing, patients may take severaldoses of the same herb or vitamin and not be aware of the total dosage. adverse effect reporting In order to understand the risks of diagnosis or treatment and convey this information to patients, there needs to be some evidence of the frequency and severity with which adverse eventsoccur. With many complementary therapies, adverse events may be difficult to identify. First, oneoften does not have adequate information about the potential for a specific adverse event. Second,patients who are using complementary therapies and their providers often fail to report abnormalevents or symptoms as an adverse event (Blendon, DesRoches, Benson, Brodie, & Altman, 2001).Third, many experts disagree on whether an adverse event has actually occurred. Fourth, asidefrom the surveillance system put into place at the FDA's Center for Food Safety and AppliedNutrition (CFSAN) in July, 2003, called the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS),there is currently no organized state or national system for reporting adverse effects of comple-mentary and alternative therapies (FDA, 2003a). CAERS has its limitations. Although both healthprofessionals and the general public can report serious adverse events to herbal products as well asfoods, cosmetics, and vitamins, the FDA does not have anyone on staff with the necessary exper-tise to evaluate a reaction to an herbal substance (personal communication, Dr. Ken Falci, July2003). In any event, a fairly large number of subjects or incidents are needed to establish whether an adverse effect is linked to a particular therapy. Ideally, this information would be gatheredthrough large clinical trials. However, thus far, these have not been undertaken in research oncomplementary and alternative therapies, and practical constraints make it more likely that surveil-lance type epidemiological data will be used to indicate effects (Ernst & Pittler, 2001). International reporting systems do exist, although the classification of adverse effects is in its infancy (Farah, Edwards, Lindquist, Leon, & Shaw, 2000). A study in the United Kingdomshowed that about 26 percent of consumers of herbal products do not report minor or seriousadverse effects to their physicians or pharmacists, although they would do so for a problem withconventional medication. This suggests that there may be future problems in identifying the ad-verse effects of complementary and alternative therapies (Barnes, Mills, Abbott, Willougby, &SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200411 Ernst, 1998). Many CAM therapies are considered \"natural\" and assumed to be without harm (Matthews, Lucier, & Fisher, 1999). This assumption is valid for a number of practices, such asmeditation, spiritual healing, and homeopathy. However, some therapies have potential dangersand should be used with caution. Adverse events have even been documented with psychic prac-tices such as voodoo. Chelation therapy and some dietary supplements can be harmful in certainsituations. Adverse effects from dietary supplements may be related to the botanical ingredientitself or to contaminants; examples include the introduction of steroids into \"natural\" importedproducts for body builders (Wang, Wen, & Shiao, 1997). diagnosing & testing safety concerns Because many complementary and alternative practitioners employ diagnostic procedures and test- ing processes that are quite different from those used by conventional clinicians, there is concernabout the accuracy and therefore the safety of these methodologies. For many of these procedures,although there is no research suggesting they are harmful, neither is there research that establishestheir efficacy. Thus, questions about their usefulness and risk remain. diagnostic procedures In complementary and alternative medicine, certain diagnostic methods are used that are either unrecognized in conventional medicine or have not been validated. The unfamiliarity ofthese methods per se does not make them unsafe or invalid. Consistency, reliability, face validity,and usefulness in determining outcomes may indicate safe and valid practice. Research suggeststhat some CAM diagnostic techniques are valid, reliable, and useful, while others are not. Forexample: Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis of specific problems is generally consistent and reliable (Zhang, Bausell, Lao, Handwerger, & Berman, 2003). Chiropractic uses X-rays extensively, although it has been shown to be of little value in treatment out-comes (Ernst, 2001a). Manual assessment of joint dysfunction has moderate validity and inter-observer reli- ability (French, Green, & Forbes, 2000; Najm, et al., 2003). Reflexology, based on the premise that stimulation of reflexes enhances auto-regula-tion and thus healing, practices palpation of the feet, guided by charts that show representative organs and parts of the body on the foot surface, and is said to revealdysfunctional reflexes in the body, with an abnormal feel in one particular area sug-gesting some dysfunction of the representative organ or a disease state. However,inter-observer reliability studies of reflexology show poor correlations between expe-rienced practitioners (Ernst, 2001a). Iridology, based on the belief that organs and body regions are represented at a spe- cific location on the iris of the eye, assesses the patient's condition by inspection and enlarged photographs of the eye. This system has not been shown to produce clini-cally useful diagnoses (Ernst, 2001a). Conventional practice may view variability in diagnosis as invalidating. However, from the perspective of many complementary medicine practitioners, variability in diagnosis may be quiteacceptable, since diagnosis is based on the assessment of multiple data sources arising from per-sonal, contextual, and physical factors that may be interpreted differently by different clinicians.THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200412 Although certain non-conventional diagnostic techniques may be of relatively little use, they may pose little or no risk to the patient. Even the concern that diagnosis using complementary medicinemay delay the implementation of conventional investigation may be unfounded. There are no datato support this fear. laboratory testing: conventional medicine In general, risk and safety issues are not a problem in conventional laboratory testing because of the very rigorous quality assurance programs dictated by federal authorities. There are,however, always problems of variability, accuracy, and reliability of test results that must be takeninto account by the clinician, especially if the test result seems unusual or does not fit the clinicalpicture (Sox, 1996). Variability in test results in conventional laboratories can occur as a result of: Biological variability : the variability of physiology between patients or in one pa- tient at different times, which involves such factors as gender, race, and age. This is why laboratories provide reference ranges of test results to clinicians. Pre-testing variability : involving such things as food intake, exercise, stress level, medications, and over-the-counter drugs taken by the patient just before the test. Analytic variability : the variability of laboratory measurement (materials, equipment, personnel skills, and procedures). This may be due to inaccuracy or imprecision and is minimized by rigorous analytic method monitoring and quality assurance using stan-dards set out by national (American College of Pathologists) and federal laboratoryregulations. All affiliated conventional laboratories participate in regular proficiencytesting programs. Post-analytic variability comes from errors in reporting (e.g. transcription, identifi- cation) all of which affect a test's sensitivity and specificity. The American College of Pathologists provides regular reports of error rates and quality assurance programs for laboratories all over the country (Rock, 1994). non-conventional laboratories With the growth in the use of complementary and alternative therapies, there has been a parallel increase in the number of laboratories that serve the particular paradigms and philosophiesof those practitioners. In general, these approaches are based on the concept that human health andillness are much more susceptible than has been realized to the toxic effects (metal, chemical,radiation) of our environment and to the intake of synthetic products (including foods and drugs).Theoretically, identification of \"poisoning\" of the body can be rectified by avoiding and removingexposures and with special biological, dietary, and herbal treatments, and by cleansing and chela-tion (removal from the blood) regimens. These different tests and their interpretation do not escapethe quality and accuracy problems identified for conventional lab tests. However, mainstream labo-ratory science remains skeptical about many of these claims of scientific usefulness, and littleresearch has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of what has been called the \"bioterrain ap-proach.\" Consequently, conventional clinical laboratories are concerned with four issues in relation to complementary diagnostic testing: Some conventional clinicians and a variety of complementary practitioners are usingSAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200413 non-traditional laboratories for special types of testing, such as measuring anti-oxi- dant defense levels to assess the patient's susceptibility to cancer. Many non-conventional laboratories perform tests for which there is, so far, little clear evidence that what is measured relates causally with clinical problems. With wider use of herbals and supplements, more incidents of interaction and toxicitymay occur and will expand laboratory investigation. Many conventional laboratories may not possess the technology and trained personnel to evaluate these problems. There is increasing understanding that some of the substances used in complemen- tary medicine, or their metabolites, interfere analytically with routine conventional laboratory tests. NON-CONVENTIONAL LABORATORY SERVICES One example of a non-traditional laboratory certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) is the Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory in Asheville, NC (www.gsdl.com). Its services to 8,000 assessmentGastrointestinal assessmentGastrointestinal assessment: Comprehensive stool analysis, analysis of the ecology of the GI tract, wall integrity, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, presence of yeast, immune function, parasitic activity, intolerances, vaginal health.The usual purpose is to detect GI dysfunction and dysbiosis (incorrect bacterial environment\u2014the leaky gut syndrome). Immunology AssessmentImmunology AssessmentImmunology AssessmentImmunology Assessment: Comprehensive antibody and allergy assessment on serum (immediate and delayed IgG), for 120 different types of food and many non-food compounds. Nutritional assessmentNutritional assessmentNutritional assessmentNutritional assessmentNutritional assessment: Elemental analysis of hair and blood, for 20 elements (such as arsenic, cadmium, nickel copper, tin, amino acids), and 40 essential and metabolic fatty acids\u2014to detect causes of unexplained symptoms,blood deficiencies or normal laboratory values. Endocrinology assessmentEndocrinology assessmentEndocrinology assessmentEndocrinology assessmentEndocrinology assessment: Sex and regulatory (e.g., thyroid) hormones in men and women. Identifying bone resorption (osteoporosis), usually using antioxidant defense, cardiovascular markers. TTTTToxic element exposure profileoxic element exposure profileoxic element exposure profileoxic element exposure profileoxic element exposure profile : In-depth assessment of exposures to a variety of industrial and chemical products encountered in daily life (e.g., aluminum, arsenic, barium, bismuth, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel), usuallytested on hair, blood, and urine. Some clinicians and many patients believe that this type of toxicity may play a role inattention deficit disorder, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, weakened immunity states, increased and gastrointestinaldysfunction. Hair testingHair testingHair testingHair testingHair testing: This has become a common test for these laboratories. It is used to assess nutritional status and toxic element exposure based on the organic substances trapped in the hair, and has been internationally approved as areliable method of monitoring biological exposures if careful collection and analytic procedures are followed. Forexample, in a recent batch of hair analyses at the Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratory, the laboratory techniciannoticed a high level of uranium from a sample from Simpsonville, SC. This level was 50 times higher than consideredsafe for humans. It was discovered that the town drew water from an area rich in natural uranium, and high levelswere confirmed in other inhabitants. The town is now connected to the main Greenville water lines (Asheville Citizen, July30, 2001).THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200414 Non-conventional laboratories specialize in func- tional assessment and in the identification of a variety ofenvironmental \"toxins,\" bacterial or fungal imbalances,and food and organism allergies(www.yorkallergyusa.com, accessed December 2004;Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratories, www .gsdl.com,accessed May 2004). These are extensively used bynaturopaths and clinicians practicing holistic or ecologi-cal medicine and provide testing not offered in conven-tional laboratories. The kinds of conditions for whichthese tests are done include: acne, asthma, cystitis, den-tal caries, depression, autism, ADHD, seizure irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia,chronic fatigue syndrome, and postmenopausal problems.Most of these services are not reimbursable by insur-ance and may cost several hundreds of dollars (Ernst &Hentschel, 1995). If a patient is having tests performed through a non-conventional laboratory, reliability of results can beincreased by checking that the laboratory is in compli-ance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act(CLIA) 1988 and that it is licensed by the state. Thelaboratory should be conducting regular proficiency testsagainst a national standard. This means that the labora-tories are regularly inspected and certified. Of about 200non-conventional laboratories studied recently, 80 per-cent were not participating in the CLIA program. (For afull report see CLIA Regulation of Unestablished Labo-ratory Tests at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-05-00-00250.pdf, accessed December 2004.) The kinds of testing services performed at non- conventional laboratories are shown in the box on page 13. Several factors have an important impact on the outcome of the tests, including sample collec-tion and results interpretation. Samples must be collected carefully. Hair specimens, for example,are often contaminated from sweat, environmental agents, and cosmetics; other samples may beaffected by daily fluctuations in metabolism. Finally, as with many conventional tests, interpretingresults is a complicated process; slightly abnormal results and false positives may be unclear anddifficult to interpret. ensuring clinical competence State medical licensing laws were implemented in the early 1900s to protect the public from abuse,fraud, and mistreatment. These laws were linked to the process of ensuring reasonable and ethicalstandards of practice. This was necessary because the quality of medical practice was highly vari-able and the medical system was in disarray. For example, in those days it was possible to obtain aNURSING AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN NORTH CAROLINA Many licensed nurses in North Carolina practice a variety of complementary therapies with theirpatients. These include massage, therapeutic touch,Reiki, and craniosacral therapy. The North CarolinaBoard of Nursing \"considers it not in conflict withnursing law for nurses with the knowledge and skillto do the various complementary therapies as longas they are in compliance with related state laws.\"Thus, nurses must be licensed in the modality (e.g.,massage, acupuncture) where licensing is required. Where complementary practices are less well defined and regulated, the Board examines cases referredto it individually, to determine if any nursing lawhas been violated (e.g., abuse, boundary violation)and if the nurse can demonstrate that he or she has the knowledge and skill to practice the therapy (e.g., craniosacral therapy). The North Carolina Board of Nursing's policy statement on complementary therapies is posted onits website: wwwwwwwwwwwwwww .ncbon.com/prac-rnfaq.asp.ncbon.com/prac-rnfaq.asp.ncbon.com/prac-rnfaq.asp.ncbon.com/prac-rnfaq.asp.ncbon.com/prac-rnfaq.aspSAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200415 mail order medical degree after only six weeks of home study for a cost of $200. The licensing laws also served to ensure that only those with specific training from certain medical schools couldlegally practice. All others who practiced as healers could be prosecuted and jailed for practicingmedicine without a license. Only religious healers were exempted. Thus, the licensing laws created a medical guild that not only \"protected the public\" but also protected their own entrenched discipline, and thereby reduced public choice in seeking otherkinds of care. In fact, the American Medical Association (AMA), between 1930 and 1970, aggres-sively tried to suppress or prosecute \"unlicensed\" or alternative practitioners such as chiropractors.In 1987, the AMA was convicted by a federal court ruling of unreasonable restraint of trade andviolating anti-trust laws (Wilks v . AMA). The competence of conventional physicians, nurses, and pharmacists is now generally assumed and accepted by the public and government agencies. It is based on a standard of rigorousand well-tested training, continuing education requirements, re-certification exams, the monitoringof practice by professional boards, and the control and punishment of \"bad apples\" by profes-sional organizations. How well this system actually works is unclear, but evidence of problems canbe found in the substantial numbers of complaints, malpractice suits, and disciplinary actions thatoccur annually (North Carolina Medical Board, www.ncmedboard.org). Recent changes in the delivery of health care have resulted in proposals for regulatory reform for all health professionals to provide a more flexible scope of practice (Pew Foundation,1995). Although regulation of health professionals was designed to protect the public, it can createbarriers to access for patients and cause professional \"turf \" problems (Reinhardt, 1996). credentialing practitioners of complementary & alternative medicine In the United States, formal recognition of clinical competence may be a problem for those practitioners of complementary and alternative therapies who have not completed approvedtraining programs and national board exams in their discipline or who practice where there is nostate licensure. The standards of competence and responsibility also relate to the degree of au-tonomy or supervision under which these clinicians practice. For example, an autonomous CAMpractitioner should be expected to have a reasonable amount of medical knowledge to recognizemedical conditions or early warning symptoms (Ernst, 1995; Eisenberg, et al., 2002). Today, most professional organizations for complementary and alternative modalities have requirements for membership that include training, defined supervision, and testing. Licensing ofcomplementary and alternative practitioners, through multidisciplinary or single-discipline state boards, has evolved slowly over the past few years and is in a continual state of flux. In states wherelicensing boards exist to monitor adequacy of training and quality of practice (for example: chiro-practic, acupuncture, homeopathy, and naturopathy), the practitioners can practice legally, thereforeoffering the public some assurance of the competence of local complementary and alternative careproviders. In those states without licensing, the ability to monitor training, competence, and fraud is curtailed, and these practitioners may be subject to criminal prosecution. Referrals to effective andsafe complementary and alternative clinicians may therefore depend more on local reputation andpersonal knowledge than on ascertaining licensing status. To find out whether a certain disciplineis licensed in the state, it is necessary to call the State Medical Board or Health Department, orstudy the website appropriate to the discipline. Most complementary disciplines have national orga-nizations of practitioners and many have referral services.THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200416 This variability in the legal standing of complementary practitioners creates uncertaintyfor all concerned and prevents a more integrativeapproach to health care. Referrals between con-ventional and complementary care providers mayhave malpractice implications in the event of alawsuit (Cohen, 2000). Ethics regarding the bound-ary between conventional, complementary and al-ternative medicine are unclear (Ernst, 2001b). Towhat degree should conventional practitioners beobligated to offer non-conventional treatmentoptions to patients? If conventional practitionersoffer complementary therapies or referral to aCAM practitioner, they must have some under-standing of the therapy's benefits and risks, andof the competence of the practitioner. This un-derstanding should be reflected in their documen-tation of rationale and intended benefits. The establishment of legal and regulatory standards for complementary and alternative medicine is still in its early stages. Conventional clinicians who practice non-conventional, comple-mentary therapies may be at some risk related to the scope of their practice, and also may besubjected to disciplinary action by state medical boards based on prevailing norms. Malpracticerates are significantly lower for licensed practitioners of complementary and alternative medicinecompared to conventional generalist clinicians. ensuring product safety: herbs & nutritional supplements The majority of safety issues in complementary and alternative care arise from the inappropriate or indiscriminate use of botanicals and nutraceuticals. Patients often believe that organic or naturalproducts are inherently safe, and safety is therefore not a concern (Matthews, et al., 1999). Another belief that may pose risks for those who self-treat is that more is better and can produce a speedierbeneficial effect. Safety of supplements thus relates to three issues: first, the possibility of interactions between herbs and conventional medications; second, the possibility of toxicity from supplementsor contaminants (which may be difficult to detect); and third, the possibility that non-conventionallaboratories may theoretically cause \"harm\" through high cost to the client, or through using unre-liable methods for testing that have not been proven to affect health outcomes. Herbals and supplements, like other biological agents, act at multiple sites in the body, producing many effects; some of these effects are not normally detectable on routine clinical ortoxicology testing. Many conventional laboratories fail to successfully identify the active agents ofthese herbals because of ignorance of their metabolism and/or not knowing where to look for theevidence (e.g., urine, liver, or blood). The one exception is that toxicity screening can usually revealcontamination of herbal products by heavy metals. Similarly, it may be useful to monitor certain laboratory values while patients are taking an herbal remedy or supplement, because of potential adverse effects. Details of such monitoringA good resource for quality information about herbal and nutritional products is the website wwwwwwwwwwwwwww .consumerlab.com.consumerlab.com.consumerlab.com.consumerlab.com.consumerlab.com which regularly compares and assesses the quality of products on the U.S. market. Although much of the information is proprietary, a year's subscription to the site is modest. Another excellent source of reliable information regarding dietary supplements is the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database at http://wwwhttp://wwwhttp://wwwhttp://wwwhttp://www .naturaldatabase.com.naturaldatabase.com.naturaldatabase.com.naturaldatabase.com.naturaldatabase.com Although more expensive, the site provides invaluable information to the clinician faced with the necessity of providing counseling to patients using botanicals or other dietary supplements.SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200417 protocols are available in the book, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (Fetrow & Avila, 1999). Interference with analysis of laboratory tests also occurs. For example: Digoxin measurement is affected by Siberian ginseng, Chan su, milkweed, uzara root, and lily-of-the-valley. Chan-su (from secretions of toads) is a major component of the traditional Chinese remedies Liu-Shen-Wan and Kyushin. These substances may in-crease or decrease true level of digoxin. Ephedra (Ma Huang) may affect workplace and athletic urine testing for performance enhancers (cross reacts with amphetamine antibodies). Creatine supplements affect creatinine testing. Herbal weight loss products interfere with catecholamine testing. risks with herbal products Herbal products, although derived from natural substances, are the forerunners of syn- thetic pharmaceuticals. Like medications, they have biological actions, which is why many herbalproducts are regulated as drugs in Europe (Mills & Bone, 2000). Many herbal therapies are quite safe and fall into the realm of foods. Examples include many of the western \"tonic\" herbs traditionally consumed as teas, such as nettles and red clover.Other herbs, termed \"heroics\" have a history of adverse effects well known to traditional herbalistsand have been employed specifically because of their toxic properties (Mills & Bone, 2000). Anexample is the use of bloodroot as an escharotic for treating skin cancers as popularized by FrederickMohs, MD (Alleger, 1999). A number of problems can occur when taking herbal or nutritional supplements. Reac- tions to therapy can be immediate or delayed, often as a result of a main pharmacological action.Between 1997 and 1998, for example, 140 adverse events (hypertension, arrhythmias, stroke, seiz-ures, and death) were reportedly caused by dietary supplements containing ephedra (Ma Huang),usually in combination with caffeine. These products are widely used for weight reduction andenhancement of physical activity (Haller & Benowitz, 2000). Three billion doses of ephedra weresold in 1999, giving an adverse reporting rate of 10 per billion. More recently it was reported thatthere were 12,000 complaints to the company making Metabolife 365 (containing ephedra) withthe result that the FDA stopped the public sale of ephedra (Marcus & Grollman, 2002). Unpredictable reactions also can be associated with short- or long-term therapy. Some adverse events have only been recognized recently, perhaps in part because of differences in theway herbal supplements are now used. In addition, lack of knowledge about the proper dosing ofherbs may lead consumers to take herbal supplements inappropriately. For example, liver damagehas been documented as being associated with the extended use of chaparral or kava kava, herbstraditionally taken short-term. Other unpredictable toxicities occur from accidental or purposefulsubstitution of one substance with another, such as digitalis toxicity from the contamination ofplantain with digitalis glycosides (Escher, Desmeules, Glostra, & Mentha, 2001). In general, however, the epidemiology of adverse events from herbs is not well known. The FDA's CAERS system for reporting adverse events to food, dietary supplements, and cosmet-ics is just getting off the ground (FDA, 2003a). In Sweden, a European adverse-event reportingsystem collects data from 55 countries (Farah, et al., 2000). Adverse-event reporting systems arelimited in their ability to define the true incidence of reactions to herbal products or drugs due totheir inability to define the denominator (the number of consumers using the herbal product orTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200418 drug in question). The systems perform best in capturing acute, serious events (Rodriguez, Staffa & Graham, 2001). contamination Herbal products pose a risk from contamination with pesticides, heavy metals (cadmium, mercury), pharmaceuticals, and micro-organisms (Slifman, et al., 1998). For example, a study ofherbal stores in California showed that 35 out of 251 products had unacceptably high levels ofmercury (Talaly & Talaly, 2001). In Canada, Hua Fo, a Chinese herbal product claimed to enhancesexual function, was recently found to contain Viagra (http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protec-tion/warnings/2002/2002_09e.htm, accessed December 2004). In February 2002, the Californiastate health department found that PC-SPES (an eight-herb traditional Chinese remedy used forprostate hypertrophy and lowering prostate-specific antigen levels) was contaminated hormone) and warfarin (anti-coagulant) (Straus, 2002). potency & bioavailability The strength and bioavailability of herbal supplements may be different from traditional herbal preparations as a result of manufacturers using different extraction processes. This leads topotential alterations in potency for the active compounds or the extraction of new compounds,with their corresponding effects (DeSmet, 1999). Also, seasonal variation in growing conditionsand harvesting can affect the potency of a product (Valli & Giardina 2002). dosing Dosing recommendations for herbs lack uniformity and vary depending how the herb is prepared or on the manufacturer's recommendations. For example, random testing of TraditionalChinese Medicine products in Britain showed continued evidence of banned substances (mercury,arsenic) in products (www.mca.gov.uk, accessed December 2004). allergies Herbs also may produce allergic reactions. These may be allergies either to the herb itself or to excipients\u2014the delivery vehicle in which the product is placed, such as lanolin, propyleneglycol, and binders and fillers in capsules or tablets. direct toxicity Also of concern is toxicity of compounds in the herb. For example, aristolochia fangchi, a Chinese herb used in weight reduction treatments, contains nephrotoxic aristolochic acid, whichcan provoke genitourinary cancers. The incidence of adverse effects to St John's wort is 1-3 per-cent, photosensitivity being the most frequent problem (Schultz, 2000). herbal remedies & surgery A special risk posed by herbal products is their possible impact on surgical safety. It is particularly important to identify whether patients are taking certain herbal remedies when they areevaluated for surgery involving anesthesia, as the interaction between many herbals and anesthesiacan be dangerous. Worrisome is a 1998 study of cardiothoracic surgery patients, showing that,SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200419 while the overall CAM use rate was 44 percent (excluding prayer and vitamins), only 17 percent had discussed this usage with their surgeons (Liu, et al., 2000). Seven herbs\u2014accounting for a large fraction of all preparations sold in the US\u2014have been identified as having potential pharmacological effects relevant to surgical procedures: Ephedra: sympatheticomimetic effects, may affect hemodynamic state Garlic: inhibits platelet aggregation and may increase bleeding tendency Ginkgo : may increase bleeding tendency Ginseng : lowers blood glucose and may increase bleeding Kava : may increase sedative effect of anesthetic and affect liver function St. John's wort : affects metabolism of steroids, warfarin, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and many other drugs Valerian : increases sedative effect of anesthetic Although there is still relatively little research proving adverse effects related to surgery and anesthesia, recommendations are to discontinue use of these supplements five to seven daysbefore surgery (Ang-Lee , Moss, & Yuan, 2001). non-herbal \"nutraceuticals\" Non-herbal nutraceuticals include vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, and animal extract and tissue products. Examples include: blue-green algae, bee pollen, glandular extracts, and proteinpowder. Product quality, including purity, is again an issue, but the main safety problems are: Excessive dosage : Some patients believe that more is better and knowingly ingest too much vitamin A or calcium, for example. Allergies to fish or animal protein are not unusual, and may occur from bee sting or dried (animal) cell therapy. Meats, liver extracts, and ghee (Indian butter) may harbor micro-organisms such as salmonella or Clostridium tetani . Toxic metals (such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) or other contaminants can be purposefully or accidentally added to traditional and homeopathic preparations and cosmetics. For example, L-tryptophan has been advocated for sleeping problemsbut a contaminant caused cases of eosinophilia/myalgia syndrome, resulting in theproduct being pulled from the market. Recently it was reported that Ayurvedic formu-lations contained substantial variations (Itankar,Sakharkar, Diets and vitamins : Over-zealous use of unbalanced diets can lead to nutritional deficiencies, to changes in physiological function, and changes in responses to con- ventional medications. Excessive beta-carotene causes yellow skin; too much vitaminD leads to hypercalcemia and GI problems; and substantial vitamin E doses cause acoagulopathy. Contamination of combination products with undeclared substances: A study by Consumer Lab found that up to 10 percent of mineral supplements in the USA were contaminated with lead; calcium was contaminated with an antibiotic; Chinese dietpills contained fenfluramine; there were excessive amounts of Vitamin A in Metabolifebars; and nettle products were contaminated with lead (www.consumerlab.com/recalls.asp, accessed December 2004).THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200420 safety of three commonly used complementary therapies In addition to an understanding of safety issues related to CAM products, conventional practitio- ners should be aware of the risks\u2014if any\u2014posed by other commonly used complementary andalternative therapies. Three types of CAM therapies\u2014manual therapies, acupuncture, and home-opathy\u2014are highlighted below, because of their widespread use. Of the manual therapies, chiro-practic and osteopathy are among the most widely and regularly used by Americans. For example,11 to 16 percent of the population visits a chiropractor, while 25 percent of patients with low-backpain do so (Eisenberg, et al., 1998). About 30 percent of all visits to CAM practitioners are tochiropractors; and about 65 percent of physicians refer to chiropractors (Meeker & Haldeman,2002). Acupuncture is becoming increasingly popular in the U.S. In 1997, for example, Americansmade more than five million visits for acupuncture treatment (Eisenberg, et al., 1998). Homeopa-thy, in common use worldwide, is used less frequently in the U.S., with approximately two millionvisits made to homeopaths in 1997 (Eisenberg, et al., 1998). Although there may be some risksassociated with these therapies, they appear\u2014over-all\u2014to be relatively safe. manual therapy Manual therapies involving manipulation of joints and the spine have been practiced for centuries and have evolved into the disciplines of chiropractic and osteopathy. There are now manyeducational programs with osteopathic training requiring four years of medical school with addi-tional postdoctoral training in manipulation. Osteopathic physicians are now part of mainstreammedicine. In addition, a number of short courses in manual therapy\u2014ranging from a half-day totwo weeks\u2014are offered to conventional primary care physicians by the American Academy ofPhysicians and schools of osteopathy. Limited manual therapy is also taught in physical therapy. Adverse events from manipulation may occur, but most are mild, usually causing localized discomfort, headache, or fatigue (16 percent of visits). A recent meta-analysis of five prospectivestudies showed that about 50 percent of patients receiving manipulation experienced mild tran-sient reactions (Ernst, 2001c). Other adverse effects can arise out of misdiagnosis (missing canceror metastases) or manipulating joints that are either severely inflamed or affected by other seriousdiseases (rheumatoid arthritis, bone infection, dislocations, myelopathy). However, no serious com-plications have been noted in over 70 controlled trials (Meeker & Haldeman, 2002). Of the serious problems that do occur, most have involved cervical spine manipulation. Assendelft and colleagues reviewed the world's literature (mostly single-case reports) over the past30 years and identified a total of 295 reported complications of spinal manipulation, most per-formed by chiropractors (61 percent) (Assendelft, Bouter, & Knipschild, 1996). There were 39fatalities over a 30-year period. In 165 of the 295 cases, vertebrobasilar strokes from cervicalmanipulation occurred. In 61 cases of low-back pain there was deterioration of a herniated disk orprogression to cauda equina syndrome. A more recent self-report survey of 323 British neurolo-gists found 74 percent reporting complications of manual therapy within 24 hours of receivingchiropractic treatment and identified 35 cases with serious complications (Stevinson, Honan, Cooke,& Ernst, 2000). The reported incidence of complications varies from 1:2,500 manipulative proce-dures to 1:1 million (Klougart, Leboeuf-Yde, & Rasmussen, 1996). Unfortunately, few long-termprospective studies have been done to clarify this issue (Ernst, 2001c). In addition to the directeffects of manipulation, indirect effects include the excessive use of X-rays in evaluating spinalproblems and prolonged manipulation treatment beyond recommended national guidelines.SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200421 To put these numbers in context, one should consider the adverse effects of NSAID use for low-back pain and neck pain. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 3 percent to 20 percent ofpatients. The odds ratio for gastrointestinal perforation (often asymptomatic) is 3.7 for aspirin, 6.7for other NSAIDs, and 1.0 for placebo (Aronson, 1996). acupuncture Most adverse effects from acupuncture are mild and transient. Aggravation of symptoms occurs in about 13 percent of patients (Rampes & James, 1995). Other adverse effects includefainting, increased pain, nausea, and vomiting. Infections, including Hepatitis B and C and bacterialinfections, have rarely been reported, and, when they occur, most bacterial infections have re-sponded to antibiotic therapy. The use of disposable needles has eliminated most of these prob-lems. Needle punctures causing hematomas and injury to the lungs (pneumothorax) have beenreported (Ernst & White, 1997). Electromagnetic acupuncture needle stimulation should not beused if the patient has a cardiac pacemaker. A recent review of case reports of the adverse effectsof acupuncture identified only 202 incidents in 35 years, from 22 countries. Adverse effects havedeclined in recent years because of clean needle techniques and more rigorous training (Lao, Hamilton, Fu, & Berman, 2003; White, Hayhoe, Hart, & Ernst, 2001). homeopathy Homeopathy is based on the use of highly dilute solutions of natural substances. Clinical practice is generally safe: there are no major reports of adverse effects and little evidence of directtoxic effects of homeopathic remedies. One small survey showed that about 10 percent of patientstaking homeopathic remedies reported some adverse effect, which was frequently an aggravationof the symptoms being treated, often perceived by the homeopath as a positive response to therapy(Ernst, 2001a). The indirect risks of homeopathy are the suggested potential \"neglect\" effects where conventional medical care may be withdrawn or access to it delayed by the long-term use of ho-meopathic remedies (since some of these remedies are reported to take several months to producean outcome) (Ernst & Hahn, 1998). The example of delayed conventional care that is most oftencited is the issue of recommending against orthodox vaccinations for infectious disease. All ofthese concerns, however, are based on anecdotal recording, and not substantiated by research.Further, these potential adverse effects are more likely if the practitioner is not well trained or isfrom another discipline and only \"dabbling\" in homeopathy. safety, pediatrics & complementary medicine Increasing numbers of children and adolescents are using complementary therapies and nutritional supplements (Gardiner, Conboy, & Kemper, 2000). Typically, youngsters using complementary andalternative therapies suffer from chronic, usually recurrent conditions such as acne, asthma, sleepproblems, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, premenstrual syndrome, obesity, and urinaryinfections. In particular, chiropractic care for families has expanded, so that in 1993, children madean estimated 20 million visits to chiropractors. Nearly a third of all visits to homeopaths andnaturopaths are by children and adolescents (Lee & Kemper, 2000).THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200422 Other than the safety issues already discussed, two main issues cause concern to conven- tional pediatricians. First, a number of homeopathic, naturopathic, and chiropractic practitioners(probably about 10-15 percent) believe the risks of immunization outweigh the benefits, and willadvise families against the practice (Ernst & White, 1995). Secondly, it is theoretically possible(though not substantiated) that children with acute illnesses might receive delayed appropriatetreatment if the complementary and alternative practitioners persist with their approach too long. shared safety issues: conventional & complementary medicine The recent final report of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (March 2002) advises clinicians and patients to \"become more knowledgeable about thepotential benefits and harms of CAM approaches\" and urges \"physicians and other health profes-sionals [to] make significant efforts to open lines of communication with their patients about theiruse of CAM. . . .\" The reason for this recommendation is simple. Although not integrated withconventional care, complementary and alternative therapies form a major component of the con-temporary health care system and the uncoordinated, ill-informed blending of these systems posessafety risks. In general, risks arise as the result of incomplete knowledge on the part of the clinician, leading to errors in decision-making and therapy. Among the possible problems: Health professionals are unaware that the patient is being treated by other conven- tional or complementary and alternative care providers. Health professionals are not fully aware of the medications, herbal and/or nutritionalsupplements taken by the patient. There is a lack of communication between health professionals, possibly leading toconflicting diagnoses, advice, and therapy. There is a lack of respect between clinicians, based on biases, poor esteem, ignoranceof training and skills, and concern about legal and financial risks. These misunderstandings may result, at least, in reduced benefit to patients or, at worst, in serious errors in treatment decisions. It should be noted that some of these problems are just asfrequent within the conventional health care system, either between different specialties or betweenprimary and specialist care. However, they are likely to be compounded in instances involvingcomplementary and alternative treatment. A number of risks specific to the CAM-conventionalcare overlap may arise for patients, including: Disagreement regarding diagnosis. Lack of knowledge of interactions between herbs, supplements, and conventional medications. Potential for unnecessary health care costs due to duplication of tests and clinicalmanagement. Lack of laboratory and clinical methods to evaluate effects of CAM biological prod-ucts.SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200423 communicating about risk &safety of complementary & alternative medicine Perhaps the clinician's most useful tool to address problems caused by the convergence of comple- mentary and conventional medicine is effective communication. The practitioner who wishes toimprove communication skills should reflect on the following questions: Why is my patient seekingan alternative therapy? Is it my job to discuss the effectiveness and safety of the therapy with thepatient? What is my appropriate approach to this request? Do I listen well? Do I know of anyreliable sources of information on the therapy's safety and efficacy? Are there adequate studies (anystudies?) or texts to tell me about the efficacy of this particular modality? The conventional practitioner should advise patients to be wary of any practitioner who is overtly hostile to or ignorant of conventional medical practice or who cannot supply a reasonableexplanation for his/her clinical method. Other red flags include practitioners who claim to bepersecuted by conventional medicine; who ask for an up-front lump sum payment to cover a periodof treatment; who schedule frequent return visits without justification; or who offer the likelihoodof remarkable and quick results. Any of these cues may suggest that the practitioner involved maynot have the patient's best interests at heart. While this advice applies to complementary and alternative care providers, it should be noted that the same cautions apply to conventional practitioners. Patients should be wary of con-ventional clinicians who do not communicate clearly or adequately with their patients; who urgeextensive testing or therapy without providing sensible and clear reasons; who appear uninterestedin the patients or are rushed; who schedule frequent return visits without good justification; andwho prescribe medications without explaining their action, expected outcome, or adverse effects. guidelines for discussing CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM When talking with patients about complementary and alternative treatments, there are certain principles that should guide the conventional practitioner: Respect the patient's autonomy. Make no assumptions about CAM use, with respect to ethnicity, age, and social status. Inquire about and be open to hearing about CAM use. Be sensitive that the patient may expect the clinician's disapproval or disinterest. Be aware that the patient may not be asking for the clinician's endorsement or belief in a particular CAM treatment, but just wanting facts, including a good diagnostic workup. Advise the patient to weigh carefully any decisions to abandon useful conventional therapy. Inform and advise the patient about any therapies, whether CAM or conventional, thatmay cause harm. Recognize that the patient's choice in therapy can be empowering. Reflect on the ethical duty to facilitate patients' requests for referrals. Be sure that patient is provided with clear treatment goals, reasonable timelines, andcareful monitoring. Similarly, the following guidelines are useful in maintaining a responsible, evidence-based approach to complementary and alternative therapies (Eisenberg, 1997).THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200424 Listen to the patient for a full two minutes\u2014this is the average time a patient needs to explain or report symptoms and state expectations of treatment and outcome. Use patient-centered communication to gain trust and complete information. Use good clinical skills to obtain as clear a diagnosis as possible. Assess patient preferences and expectations. Review safety and effectiveness. Know where to look for reliable information on complementary and alternative medi-cine. Know something about the specific effect of the complementary/alternative modal-ity. Do not use or recommend complementary and alternative therapies without adequateknowledge of their proposed mechanism of action. Learn the magnitude of effect and what possible harm (or good) may be caused by thecomplementary/alternative modality. Identify suitable licensed practitioners of the complementary/alternative modalitiesbeing discussed. evaluating risks & benefits Patients should be aware of the risks and benefits of any therapy. The effectiveness of treatment must be considered in the context of patient safety as well as costs. The risk:benefit ratio,which is often discussed, is the ratio of the chance that an adverse event will occur at a certain doseof a substance to the chance that a beneficial effect will occur. The lower the risk:benefit ratio, themore desirable the treatment. A risk to benefit ratio of zero is ideal (Huxtable, 1998). For example, if the herb comfrey causes liver disease in a very small portion of the people who take it orally and they receive no recognizable benefit from the herb (low risk, low cost), thenit should not be used. On the other hand, cancer patients who receive conventional chemotherapy(high cost, high risk) but suffer side effects including hair loss, nausea and vomiting, mouth ulcer-ation, and low blood counts can also experience great benefit from the drugs, making the risksacceptable for many patients. When there are only few data on effectiveness, risk:benefit ratios often cannot be consid- ered or discussed. On the other hand, there may be adverse events as well as costs that should bereviewed with the patient. The chart below (based on estimates from the literature) illustrates how a clinician with somegeneral knowledge ofcomplementary andalternative therapiesmight think throughthe pros cons interms of costs andrisks for a patient ask-ing for advice aboutusing those therapies.This chart, however,gives no indication of COSTCOSTCOSTCOSTCOST -RISK ASSESSMENT FOR DIFFERENT CAM THERAPIES-RISK ASSESSMENT FOR DIFFERENT CAM THERAPIES-RISK ASSESSMENT FOR DIFFERENT CAM THERAPIES-RISK ASSESSMENT FOR DIFFERENT CAM THERAPIES-RISK ASSESSMENT FOR DIFFERENT CAM THERAPIES minimal High CostHigh CostHigh CostHigh CostHigh Cost Clinical ecology Mud therapy Insulin therapy (Multiple lab tests) for breast cancerSAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200425 effectiveness, which would also need to be factored into the assessment. Because the evidence is still largely incomplete, useful risk:benefit assessments often are difficult to make (Ernst, 2002). It is up to the patient and caregiver to address the issues of effectiveness and safety that relate particularly to the age, gender, race, and health status of the individual patient. Very low-riskcomplementary therapies include homeopathy, guided imagery, most types of massage, spiritualhealing, hypnosis, and meditation techniques. In gener al, the following therapies should be moni- tored: herbal preparations (except teas), patent remedies from the Far East, nutritional supple-ments, dietary regimens, agents given by injection, intravenous infusions (such as chelation), andcervical spine manipulation. framing risks & benefits Discussing risks and benefits can, in reality, be quite complicated and time consuming. This is especially true if a great deal is known about the subject\u2014such as breast cancer; or if theinformation continues to change\u2014as in the case of the effects of hormone replacement therapy inmenopause or the value of mammograms in screening for breast cancer (Mosca, et al., 2001;Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative, 2002). It would seem obvious that the style orapproach in which a clinician presents information to patients and their families can affect the wayhealth decisions are made. This is known as \"framing\" of information. Most studies of how the risk:benefits are \"framed\" have been done in research laborato- ries and actually show that \"framing\" styles can substantially affect how people make their deci-sions (Edwards, Elwyn, Covey, Matthews, & Pill, 2001). Research in clinical settings finds thatMany factors affect how patients receive risk:benefit information. These include: PATIENT FACTORS Duration of consultation Body language Verbal cues Communication process Social alignment with the clinician (gender, race, language skills) Understanding Age Intellectual ability to analyze explanations and simple statistics Reading ability to study informational materials and handoutsCLINICIAN FACTORS Duration of consultation Body language Verbal cues Communication skill Social alignment with the patient (gender, race, language skills) Knowledge of topic (accuracy, up-to-date, comprehensiveness) Practice style in encounter Access to/use of informational materials Delegation of task to others such as a nurse or caregiverTHE CONVERGENCE OF COMPLEMENTARY , ALTERNATIVE & CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200426 these effects are much less obvious than in the laboratory (Edwards, et al., 2001). But we do know that people are more persuaded by positive rather than negative framing. The difference between positive framing and negative framing is demonstrated by the following example: Positive framing: \"With this operation, you will have a 96 percent chance of surviv- ing five years.\" Negative framing: \"With this operation, the five-year death rate is 4 percent.\" relative risk People are more impressed by relative risk reduction than absolute risk reduction, even though the size of the effect is the same. An example of a statement of relative risk might be, \"Thismedication will reduce your risk of a GI bleed by 50 percent.\" (For example, from 2 percent to 1percent of the population taking the drug.) An example of a statement of absolute risk is: \"Only 1percent of the population taking this drug will have a GI bleed.\" In advising patients about the risks and benefits of complementary and alternative thera- pies, it is best to: Reflect on your own biases and try to exclude them from your discussion, unless there is hard evidence to support them. Be open about your biases so that the patient can decide whether the discussion isworth pursuing. If you do not have the knowledge to offer sensible and reliable professional advice, atleast admit your ignorance and help the patient to get information from other sources. If you do not have the time to discuss the issue objectively, fairly and thoroughly,admit it to the patient. Consider asking patients to get back to you in some way, if they eventually find theinformation they need, and tell you about the results of their quest. Consult with a respected CAM practitioner. However hard we try, it can be quite difficult to be completely objective about presenting evidence, risks, and benefits to patients or their families. increasing safety in complementary & alternative medicine The responsibility for reducing risks associated with the convergence of conventional, comple- mentary, and alternative medicine is a shared one. On the one hand, it appears likely that regulatoryagencies will need to assume greater responsibility for assuring standards of quality for CAMproducts. Almost certainly there will be a need for stiffer, more consistent laws and regulationsgoverning production standards and labeling practices. Additionally, there is a need for an effectiveand fair system of reporting the adverse effects of complementary and alternative products andservices. Complementary and alternative care professionals, too, have a responsibility to ensure a high level of clinical competence through their training and credentialing programs. But perhapsmost important is the need to educate all those involved in the health care system\u2014clinicians,patients, hospitals, labs\u2014about complementary and alternative therapies. Conventional practitio-ners and institutions have the responsibility of informing themselves about complementary/alter-SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200427 INFORMATION SOURCES ON CAM ORGANIZATIONS &&&&& LICENSURE In addition to general guidelines for seeking and assessing CAM practitioners, there are good sources of information to help evaluate caregivers in certain CAM disciplines (accessed, December 2004).

CAM professionals have a similar responsibility to become better acquainted with conventional medicine and how their particular disciplines are affected bythe dominant medical system. increasing CAMCAMCAMCAMCAM safety in clinical practice In order to address issues of safety of complementary and alternative therapies with pa- tients, clinicians need to take the following steps: In a non-judgmental way, ask patients if they are taking any herbal remedies or nutri- tional supplements, using any complementary devices, or seeing a complementary practitioner, and for what conditions, symptoms, or other reasons. Record the information in the chart, or ask the patient to bring the products in at the next visit to review these for duplication of ingredients. Other approaches for obtain- ing this information might include providing a form so patients can fill it out at home. Monitor risk level. Check the safety of the therapies and the possible interactions using texts or databases. Many of these sources are listed in this monograph. Before laboratory testing for any clinical evaluation, check on the patient's use ofcomplementary therapies. If referring to a CAM practitioner, document why the decision was made and whatwas the discussion with the patient (i.e., it was a shared decision?). Check what ser- vices the practitioner offers, and that he/she is licensed (Cohen & Eisenberg, 2002).CAM practitioners welcome referral letters or calls, and will often respond in likemanner. Before scheduling surgery with anesthesia, inquire about the patient's use of comple- mentary therapies. summary The convergence of conventional, complementary, and alternative health care systems raises im- portant questions about safety. Not only must conventional clinicians educate themselves aboutunfamiliar therapies, but health care providers generally need to understand the implications of theoverlapping of multiple systems of care. The best way to address these safety issues\u2014for clinicians and patients alike\u2014is to be informed. Health care providers need to learn about the various modalities in use, to understandhow to find and evaluate information sources, and to share information effectively with patientsand colleagues.SAFETY ISSUES IN COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL \u00a9 200429 references Alberti, K.
