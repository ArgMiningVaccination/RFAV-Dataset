Boness, PhD, Mackenzie Nelson, and Antoine B. Douaihy, MD Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), vaccine hesitancy, dened as a behavioral phenomenon whereby individuals neither fully accept nor fully rejectthe COVID-19 vaccine, presents a major health threat in the midst of the current pandemic. Traditional approaches for addressing vaccine hesitancy in health care lack empirical support and, in some instan- ces, have actually increased vaccine hesitancy. Thus, there is an urgent need for approaches that effec- tively address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, especially in health care settings. The current article highlights the need for and importance of motivational interviewing (MI), which emphasizes collabora- tive communication between physicians and patients, in addressing vaccine hesitancy. We describe a 3-step process for addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy that includes using a guiding style, using the MI toolbox, and responding mindfully and skillfully to the individual's degree of hesitancy. The discus- sion concludes with a consideration of possible challenges in implementing these steps when address-ing and resolving COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. ( J Am Board Fam Med 2022;35:420-426.) Keywords: Communication, COVID-19, Motivational Interviewing, Pandemics, Patient-Centered Care, Vaccination Hesitancy Despite approval from the Food and Drug Administration and emergency use authorization of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, there continues to be concern about COVID-19vaccine hesitancy. 1Vaccine hesitancy describes a behavioral phenomenon whereby individuals neitherfully accept nor fully reject vaccination, although ithas been de ned by the World Health Organization and the SAGE Working Group on VaccineHesitancy as the \"delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines, despite availability. \" 2,3Hesitancy is a top threat to global health3,4given the importance of vaccinations in slowing the transmission of pre-ventable diseases such as COVID-19. Yet, recentdata from the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention suggest that just under 65% of the US population has received at least 1 dose of thevaccine (56% fully vaccinated) as of September2021. 5COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy likely plays a key role in this vaccination gap3,6and is there- fore a major public health threat. This articleprovides guidance to physicians on the use ofmotivational interviewing (MI) strategies toaddress COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Reviews have failed to nd strong evidence sup- porting any speci c intervention to reduce vaccine hesitancy. 6,7Nyhan et al8tested whether messaging focused on correcting misinformation, presentinginformation on disease risk, using dramatic narra-tives, or making antivaccination risks more salientwould increase parental intent to vaccinate. None of the messaging interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child. Nyhan and col-leagues observed a decrease in intent to vaccinate among those given information focused on debunk-ing the supposed autism link. Thus, some messag-ing interventions may increase vaccine hesitancy. Some recent unpublished work showed favorableresults with a video intervention for increasingCOVID-19 intention to vaccinate, but only when amale rather than female narrator was used. 9ThereThis article was externally peer reviewed.

Downloaded from is therefore reason to suspect that providing infor- mation in a directive manner may be counterpro-ductive in the attempt to reduce vaccine hesitancy, although there may be preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of providing information through videos. These ndings suggest the need for alternative approaches in addressing vaccine hesitancy, for which MI is particularly well suited. MI is an evi- dence-based approach de ned as \"a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a person 's own motivation and commitment to change. \" 10It is especially useful for addressing vaccine hesitancy given its focus on listening, recognizing, and help- ing patients resolve ambivalence in a nonjudgmen- tal, neutral, and compassionate way.11MI is also practical for health care settings due to its brief na-ture and ndings that a range of physicians can suc- cessfully implement MI across a variety ofsettings. 12,13 The major difference between the guiding MI style and a directing style is the focus on collabora- tion (see Table 3 in Leask et al14for a summary of and comparison between the 2 communicationstyles in addressing vaccine hesitancy). The guiding MI style asks the patient, \"How can we work to- gether to decide? \"whereas a directing style tells the patient, \"This is what you should do. \"When it comes to vaccine hesitancy, which can be under- girded by strong personal values, directing styles of- ten lead to discord in the communication between the physician and the patient. Instead of using in- formation and persuasion to achieve change, MIseeks to understand a person 's position and curi- ously explore ambivalence free from judgment orintent to in fluence one 's decision, an approach called \"counseling with neutrality. \" 11 Some research demonstrates the effectiveness of MI in facilitating vaccinations,14and MI has been recommended for addressing general vaccine hesi- tancy.15-18For example, Gagneur et al15demon- strated that a single-session MI intervention withpostpartum mothers increased intent to vaccinate their children by 15% and the likelihood of com- plete vaccination status by 9% at 2 years of age. Given these and other favorable results across dif-ferent settings, patient populations, and vaccination types, 18it is perhaps unsurprising that health pro- fessionals are attempting to develop MI-basedinterventions for addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. 19These interventions are in their earlyphases, and most have yet to be subjected to evalua- tion. Hence, we aim to provide immediate guida-nce for physicians on navigating COVID-19 vac- cine hesitancy with an MI using a 3-step process (Table 1), derived from the 4 processes of MI, 10as these interventions continue to be developed, tested,and re ned. Step 1: Practice a Guiding Style The physician is encouraged to approach discus-sions about vaccine hesitancy using a guiding and collaborative, rather than directive, style. This interaction should be characterized by neutrality,open-ended questions, af rmations, re flections, and summaries. This collaborative approach allows thephysician to develop rapport, emphasizing a patient 's autonomy and expressing a desire to understand their position rather than change the patient 's mind about the COVID-19 vaccine, which often results in patients feeling comfortableexpressing their hesitance openly. Sample language is provided in Table 1 and case examples are pro- vided in Appendix materials. Step 2: Evoke Using the MI Toolbox Once the patient is engaged, the physician can usestrategies from the MI toolbox to further explore vaccine hesitancy. Evocation often includes asking more targeted, open-ended questions to learn moreabout the patient 's position. However, there are also speci c MI tools for evoking. A thorough dis- cussion of these strategies is beyond the scope of this article; however, we provide a few examples here, including Elicit-Provide-Elicit and decisionalbalance. We provide questions for evoking patients ' positions on the COVID-19 vaccine in Table 2 andcase examples in the Appendix materials. Elicit-Provide-Elicit This strategy rst asks a patient what they already know or are interested in knowing about a topic by asking, for example, \"What is your understanding of ...?\"(Elicit). Next, after asking for and receiving permission to do so, the physician offers informa-tion using short and focused statements that emphasize personal choice (Provide). Last, the phy- sician asks for feedback on the information pro- vided by asking, for example, \"What do you think about what we just talked about? \"(Elicit).

Downloaded from Provide-Elicit is useful when physicians want to correct misinformation in a nonjudgmental way or provide more information about vaccine safety ordevelopment. Decisional Balance This strategy involves weighing the pros and cons of change. The physician seeks to explore the patient 's arguments for and against change while maintaining a position of neutrality. Decisional bal- ance is a nondirective strategy where the physician has no intent to in fluence the direction of the patient 's decision. For some physicians, this might seem counterintuitive, especially if they intend tomove a patient out of ambivalence and toward a de- cision that favors public health. However, taking a position, and therefore violating neutrality, can of- ten push patients in the opposite direction than intended, creating discord and resistance in theinteraction. Thus, we caution against the use of this approach (1) when the physician nds they are unable to stay neutral and (2) with patients who arehighly ambivalent about or outright refuse vaccina-tion, such as instances where people have an over- all lack of trust in the medical system, because in these cases, decisional balance can decrease com- m i t m e n tt oc h a n g e . 11In such situations, physi- cians should favor exploring with open-ended questions and re flections to better understand the values underlying the patient 's concerns and/or using the Elicit-Provide-Elicit strategy to provide accurate information. Step 3: Respond Mindfully and Skillfully Following evocation, the physician must respond mindfully and skillfully to the patient 's position. Here, it can be useful to summarize the discussion,highlighting aspects favoring behavior change (eg,Table 1. Summary of the Three Steps of Exploring Vaccine Hesitancy with Motivational Interviewing Step Description Strategies Examples 1. Practice a guiding styleApproach the discussion using a guiding and collaborative style characterized by neutrality, open-ended questions,afrmations, re flections, and summaries.

You 're feeling really stuck and aren 't exactly sure how to sort through all the information about the vaccine that you 've encountered. You 're worried that the government might not have our best interests in mind. You get to decide what 's best for you. 2.

Regardless of their nal position in the en- counter, it is imperative to continue nonjudgmentally while emphasizing autonomy to reduce the chance of resistance. It can be important to remember that ambivalence may not be resolved in a single interac-tion. For long-term care physicians, such as family medicine physicians, it is often worth scheduling a follow-up conversation to revisit the conversation later. Conclusion This article provides clear guidance and strategies forphysicians navigating patient COVID-19 vaccine hes- itancy that is consistent with an MI approach. Although the application of the central concepts of MI, and speci cally these 3 steps, may seem straight- forward, several challenges can arise in addressing vac- cine hesitancy with MI. For example, the techniques outlined in this article may seem counterproductive to physicians who see the bene ts of patients getting vac- cinated. Patients who feel ambivalent about getting vaccinated may be sensitive to well-intentioned efforts by physicians to persuade them one way or the other. As a result, attempts to persuade may cause discord in the encounter. Thus, using the 3 steps outlined, which focus on avoiding the \"didactic \"approach and step- ping aside from persuasion, is more effective for mov- ing toward behavior change. Such an approach (1) encourages patients to explore their motivations and concerns, (2) helps physicians evoke arguments for vaccination from the patient, and (3) gives physiciansthe opportunity to engage patients in the shared deci- sion-making process. Given the empirical support for MI in addressing general vaccine hesitancy and behav- ior change, the MI approach is well suited to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and promote healthbehavior change. We therefore recommend physi- cians engage with the 3-step process outlined here, which emphasizes core features of the MI approach, especially until there are more data on interventions to address COVID-19 -specic vaccine hesitancy and misinformation.

Step 1: Practice a Guiding Style Physician: You mentioned you 're not sure whether or not you 'd like to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. [reflection] Patient: I feel like I should, but I' m worried about things I have heard in the media, like the government might be using the vaccines to track us. Physician: You 're worried that the vaccine might cause problems for you or be risky. You 're feeling conflicted about what to do. [re flection; focusing on underlying concerns over sociopolitical issues] Patient: Exactly! I was worried you would judge me. I' m not sure what is and isn 't true. There 'ss o much information out there. Physician: You thought that sharing your concerns would lead me to judge you or be upset with you.[reflection] Patient: Yes. And my family is telling me that if I get the vaccine I' m giving into liberal propaganda. I don't want to upset them. Physician: Your family is concerned about the vac- cine, and you are worried that choosing to get the vac- cine could cause them to view you in a negative light. I appreciate you being honest with me. [af rmation; focusing on underlying concerns over sociopoliticalissues] I'm not here to tell you what to do or make you do anything you don 't want to do. You 'll decide if and when you wish to get the vaccine. [autonomy support;neutrality] Patient: Thanks. I appreciate that. Physician: While you 're deciding, perhaps it 's helpful for us to continue exploring your concerns. What are some of the other reasons you feel unsure about getting the vaccine? [open-ended question to explore ambivalence] Step 2: Evoke Using the MI Toolbox Physician: What is your understanding of the COVID-19 vaccine? [Elicit] Patient: Well, I know it 's supposed to protect everyone from the virus, and we have certainly lost a lot of lives during this pandemic, but I' m worried it 's not safe. It usually takes years to develop vaccines andthis one was made way too fast. Physician: You make a valid point that vaccines typically take a long time to produce. You 're con- cerned about the safety of a vaccine produced soquickly and, at the same time, you understand how important it is for everyone to be protected from the virus. [af rmation; re flection] Patient: Yeah exactly! I want everyone and myself to be protected, but I don 'tw a n tt or i s ki t with a rushed vaccine. I 've seen some scary infor- mation on Facebook about the risks of a rushedvaccine. Physician: Would it be all right if I shared some in- formation about how the COVID-19 vaccine wasdeveloped? [asking permission]Patient: Sure. Physician: Earlier you mentioned that vaccines take a long time to produce, often up to 10 years. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic occurred at a time with more resources for vaccine development than any prior period. This includes worldwide col- laboration made possible through advanced commu- nication capabilities, an outpouring of funding, and revolutionary new technologies. [Provide] What do you think about this information? [Elicit] Patient: It makes sense that having extra resources and technology would speed up the timeline. I still think there hasn 't been enough time to understand the long-term effects of the vaccine. Physician: You understand how more resources enabled faster vaccine development and, also, you are concerned there are negative effects we haven 't seen yet. What else makes you unsure about taking the vac- cine? Patient: Aside from the side effects, I do not know if it is worth taking. It is nearly impossible to get an appointment and it seems easier to get a bit sick for a week and get over it. Physician: You are concerned about the inconven- ience in addition to long-term effects. Only you candecide if getting the vaccine is the right decision for you. [re flection; support autonomy] Earlier you had mentioned the immense loss of life this year and that the vaccine protects everyone from the virus. What are some other reasons you see for taking the vaccine? [decisional balance \u2014exploring reasons for change] Patient: Yeah, I know some people just get a little sick, but I know a lot of older people who got really sick or died. It is important to protect them. Physician: You have thought a lot about your deci- sion whether or not to receive the vaccine. You are concerned about long-term side effects and the incon- venience of getting an appointment. At the same time, you really care about protecting older populations from the serious consequences of the virus by protect- ing yourself. [summary] Step 3: Respond Mindfully and Skillfully We offer 2 opportunities to see an MI-adherent response to (a) a patient who has decided to get thevaccine and (b) a patient expressing continued ambivalence. Patient has decided to get COVID-19 vaccine: Physician: How do you feel about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine? Patient: I' ve thought a lot about this, and I' ve decided that protecting myself and others from the vi- rus outweighs any potential risks. [resolution of ambivalence] Physician: You 've done a lot of research and decided that getting the vaccine is the right decisionfor you. What questions do you have right now? [reflection; Elicit] Patient: What side effects should I expect after the rst and second dose? doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2022.02.210327 MI Strategies for COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy 425copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

After the rst dose, many people report muscle soreness at the injection site. The second dose typically has stronger side effects. Many people experience fever, bodyaches, and fatigue for 1 to 2 days. Where does that in- formation leave you? [Provide, Elicit] Patient: I' m glad I asked. I think I' ll schedule my vaccine on a Friday, so I don 't have to skip work. Physician: You are thinking ahead to accommo- date possible side effects given your work schedule.Would you like me to give you a number to call to set up an appointment? [re flection and follow-up consist- ent with patient 's planned next steps] Patient: That would be great! Patient continues to express ambivalence about COVID-19 vaccine: Physician: How do you feel about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine? Patient: I appreciate the discussion we 've had today, and I' ve thought a lot about this vaccine. I like that it could protect me and others from the virus, but I'm still nervous. [ambivalence] Physician: You 've put a lot of thought and research into your decision. You want the protec-tion the vaccine offers, and at the same time, thereare things you remain concerned about. What con- cerns you most after our conversation? [re flection; Elicit] Patient: I' m worried that there might be serious long-term effects. A friend of mine mentioned infer-tility and that scared me. I think I might be more opento the vaccine after more people have taken it. Physician: That does sound frightening. May I share some experiences of other patients who havetaken the vaccine? [validation; asking permission] Patient: Yes, please do. Physician: After the rst dose, many people report having muscle soreness at the injection site. The second dose typically has stronger side effects. Many people ex-perience fever, body aches, and fatigue for 1 to 2 days. Studies support these ndings and have not reported any effects on fertility. What do you think? [Provide; Elicit] Patient: Those side effects seem manageable. I think I' d like more information before making my de- cision, though. Physician: I' m happy to provide you with some handouts on the vaccine. You can take a look at these and then, if you would like, come back to have another conversation with me in a couple weeks. Patient: That works for me. 426JABFM March -April 2022 Vol. 35 No. 2 http://www.jabfm.orgcopyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.
