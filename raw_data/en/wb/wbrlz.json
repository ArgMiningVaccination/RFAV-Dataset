Of course, if you don't sleep well, you'll be tired. But there are other reasons to consider including \"burn-out\", and acute or chronic illness. From an Ayurvedic perspective, however, it is much more interesting. Energy: Prana, Tejas and Ojas Energy is a function of prana, tejas and ojas. It also a function of the rakta dhatu. Have I lost you yet? Hang in there/ Each of these play an important role in modulating energy. Prana is the basic life energy that gives us enthusiasm and the \"get up and go\". Tejas is radiant energy. When tejas is healthy we are radiant! Ojas is the storehouse of energy. Energy is carried through the rakta dhatu. These are the red blood cells, and they invigorate the body. The three doshas can disturb prana, tejas, ojas and rakta and as a result, all of them can create the feeling of being tired. Vata dosha vitiation can reduce the rakta dhatu (the carrier of energy in the body). It can also reduce ojas (storehouse of energy). When this occurs, prana (life force energy) is unsupported and becomes depleted. When all of this occur together, fatigue may become chronic. Pitta dosha vitiation can burn out the rakta dhatu and create fatigue. This takes time. Pitta at first increases rakta and tejas (radiance)! Those pitta vitiation tend to be quite energetic, intense, focused, driven and still quite radiant!. They're on fire! But this intensity level is unsustainable. The heat of pitta burns out ojas. Eventually, ojas becomes depleted and then rakta burns out and becomes depleted. When this occurs, fatigue also becomes chronic. Kapha dosha vitiation does not really cause fatigue. Instead, it causes lethargy. I separate the two. Lethargy is a heaviness and lack of motivation. This is kapha! Kapha increases rakta but when it does, rakta becomes less efficient. In addition, kapha tends to increase ojas. Sounds good right? It is not. High ojas can create excessive contentment and a loss of motivation when it is not supported by enough prana and tejas. This person lacks energy and radiance respectively! There is sluggishness and dullness. Ayurvedic Treatment for Fatigue Ayurvedic practitioners must first understand the cause of a person's fatigue. Which dosha is causing it? How are prana, tejas, ojas and rakta affected? With this information, an Ayurvedic practitioner can use all of their tools to design a specific treatment plan that addresses the individual. When a proper plan is followed, energy returns to normal. For personal guidance, see a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner.
