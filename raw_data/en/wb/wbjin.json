[Boards](/boards) [Kingdom Hearts II](/boards/915410-kingdom-hearts-ii) - Energy Crystal Efficiency Okay, so I'm farming Synth items, and now I've hit a snag: Energy Crystals. The best place I can think to farm them is in the Borough area of HB. Problem is, I can easily get 2 Blazing Crystals, 2 Lightning Crystals, and 2 Lucid Crystals in the time it takes to get 1 Energy Crystal (thanks to the crap drop rate). Which doesn't make sense to me. I have 7LL equipped, yet the drop rate doesn't seem to coincide with 29.96%....in that case, I should be getting one every 3rd, then every 4th one I kill. There are 10 Bookmasters in the Borough, but I only get 1 every second run through the area. Maybe my luck is just crap, but it seems more worthwhile to just farm double the items for the ups than to try and get synth materials. Advice? IMO the only reason to look for energy crystals is to synth the ultima weapon. I'm starting to think so too. v__v Yeah, I am stat maxing right now and am not sure whether the energy crystals are worth it. However, the 30 Akashic Records that I have are VERY useful Okay, so oddly enough, the Shamans in Pride Lands are dropping Energy Crystals at a rate consistent with 29.96% So basically what I think I'm going to do is use Energy Crystals *only* for Magic Boosts, since I'm getting a handful of them anyway. All the materials for Strength and Defense Boosts are so easily farmed, there's no point seeking out or wasting Energy Crystals on them. Blazing, Lightning, and Lucid Crystals are pouring out of all of my orifices. Same with Power Crystals. The only ones that are providing a challenge are Dark and Frost Crystals, but the latter comes with the promise of a small amount of Energy Crystals. Sounds like a good system to me. :) Here we go! are pouring out of all of my orifices ROFLMAO could you state that again but slower? I'm right before pirates of the caribbean about 20 lvl, don't remember since it's 4:15 am now, and I turned it off =D I wanna check that out since probably tomorrow I might rush to beat it Drug abuse solution ----> RPG RPG solution --------------> mmmm Okay, maybe I wasn't clear. AP Boosts and Magic Boosts require the following items: Mythril Gem- Easy to make (buy twilight materials, play reaction games with Gamblers for money) Power Crystal - Easy to farm in beast's castle (bonus: get Energy Stones from hammers) Dark Crystal - Annoying to farm...not enough Air Pirates in one spot to constitute farming - the main reason I've decided to use Energy Crystals Frost Crystals - Slightly less annoying to farm, but comes with the added bonus of killing Shamans for Energy Crystals along the way. Energy Crystal - Pain in the ass to farm, luckily you'll get a few (very few) while hunting down Frost Crystals. Serenity Crystal - Easy as hell to farm. I had like 70 of these buggers after a handful of trips through TWTNW Conclusion: Not worth it to farm Energy Crystals, but just worth it enough to save every Energy Crystal you have solely for Magic and AP Boosts (actually, don't even bother with AP Boosts, the 49 or 50 that you'll get in chests and the +2 you get as Roxas is more than enough to equip everything you want). So why Energy Stones in Beast's Castle? - When you have to make the Mythril Gems and Crystals (ingredients listed at the bottom), You'll need Dense and Twilight Gems (2 each) for every Mythril Gem/Mythril Crystal you make. That's 1600 Munny PER Gem/Crystal and a huge pain in the ass. Cut the cost in half with Energy Stones that drop fairly often. I figure that's a better alternative because there are a LOT of Morning Stars (which drop Power Crystals) alongside Hammer Frames (which drop Energy Stones), whereas farming for Energy Crystals in Hollow Bastion is more annoying because there are exactly 10 Bookmasters (which drop Energy Crystals) and exactly 3 Morning Stars in the Borough area. You'd just be wasting your time farming there, when you could be getting items more reliably in Beast's Castle. Besides, it's better to farm Energy Crystals in Pride Lands while you're also killing Living Bones (which drop Frost Crystals...they cannot be obtained elsewhere). Save yourself the headache and don't kill Bookmasters. Str and Def Boosts require the following items: Mythril Crystals - Read above Blazing Crystals - The Crimson Jazz enemies are ALL over Beast's Castle, as well as Morning Stars (Power Crystals) and Hammer Frames (Energy Stones - for making Mythril). Piss. Easy. Lightning Crystals - It's easy as hell to get between 4 ~ 8 of them per one run through Space Paranoids, which takes like 2 minutes at a time. Lucid Crystals - I don't know why, but I get one of these off every 9 out of 10 Neoshadows. It's ridiculous, I have hundreds of them. Conclusion: As you can see, farming items for Strength and Defense Boosts is WAY easier than farming items for Magic Boosts. Considering how few Energy Crystals you'll get on your trips through Pride Lands, it's best to save them for the item that has the more difficult-to-obtain items. You could easily get 2 Blazing, Lightning,and Lucid Crystals in the time it takes to get 1 Dark and Frost Crystal (and while you're getting Blazing Crystals and Energy Stones, you're also picking up extra Power Crystals for Magic Boosts, which are also easy to obtain as mentioned above). Mythril Gems and Crystals require the following items: Dense Crystal - Easy to farm - Go between Twilight's View and the Altar of Naught. All the Berserkers you kill will hook you up big time.: Dense Gem:- Pain in the ass. Warp Snipers drop them, but it's faster to buy them and earn the money, which is STILL a pain in the ass. 800 Munny a piece. Twilight Crystal - Easy to farm, While you're getting the Dense Crystals, you'll probably get 6 or so of these in the last room before The Altar of Naught. You can kill up to 8 Sorcerers I think. Twilight Gem - Same as Dense Gems. Now, pretend you have the 50 AP Boosts, but 0 Magic, Power, and Defense Boosts. That's 350 Boosts you \"need\" to make, and requires the following: 350 Dense Crystals 700 Dense Gems (uses 2 of these) x 800 Munny = 560,000 350 Twilight Crystals 700 Twilight Gems (uses 2 of these) x 800 Munny = 560,000 1,120,000 Munny is hard to get. Farming the Gamblers for money as quickly as I can, I can make about 3,000 Munny per minute. 1,120,000 Munny / 3000 = 373ish minutes = 6ish hours. By using an Energy Stone every time you make a Mythril Gem/Crystal, you spend half the money. This means you have to farm half as much Munny, and cut your time in half. 6 hours becomes 3 hours. HUGE difference, and probably less likely to make you kill yourself. *bump* I put too much work into my last response to let this die so quickly! =O Scratch that part about the Energy Crystals saving time. I guess last time I farmed them, I had a horseshoe stuck up my ass. They're not dropping worth a damn. Just spend the time earning the money, it's probably way more time efficient once the odds balance out.
