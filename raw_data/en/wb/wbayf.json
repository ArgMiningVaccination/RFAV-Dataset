Chapman Jr. Graduate School of Business at Florida International University are proposing a joint degree program culminating in both a Master in International Business (MIB), and a Master of Science in Finance. Under the joint degree program, a student can obtain both degrees in significantly less time than it would take to obtain both degrees if pursued consecutively. The joint degree program will use existing faculty, courses, and resources. Important criteria relating to the joint degree program are as follows: 1. Candidates to the joint degree program must meet the entrance requirements establis hed by each individual program. 2. Application s for a joint degree will not be accepted from candidates who have already completed either degree. MIB or MSF students must apply and be admitted no later than the second to last semester in which they are expected to complete their original degree requir ements. 3. Candidates must satisfy all requirements for each degree. The two degrees will have four common courses. All courses transferred between degrees must be completed with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher. MSF courses transferred to meet MIB elective credit must be 6000 level courses approved by the University Curriculum Committee. Directors of the MSF and MIB degree programs may adjust these exact course requirements as a result of future changes to the MSF or MIB curriculums. 3.1. To obtain th e MIB degree, MSF students who have finished their core courses, must complete a total of 36 credit hours as follows: In the MIB program (24 credits hours): MAN 6617 Managing Global Production and Technology 3 MAR 6158 International Marketing 3 BUL 6850 International Business Law 3 MAN 6635 International Business Policy 3 MAN 6679 Master's Project in International Business 3 MAN 6601 International Management 3 MAN 6606 International Business Environment 3 MAN 6930A Master's Seminar in Management 1 1 MAN 6930B Master's Seminar in Management 2 1 MAN 6930C Master's Seminar in Management 3 1 From the MSF program (12 credit hours) will be transferred as follows: FIN 6644 Global Financial Strategy 3 FIN 6465 Financial Planning and Statements Analysis 3 MAN 6606 International Business Environment 3 FIN 6XXX Elective 3 FIN 6XXX Elective 3 3.2. To obtain the MSF degree, MIB students who have finished their core courses, must complete a total of 33 credits hours as follows: From the MSF program (21 credit hours): FIN 6406 Corporate Finance 3 FIN 6456 Quantitative Method in Financial Analysis 3 FIN 6246 Financial Markets and Institution 3 FIN 6515 Securities Analysis 3 FIN 6525 Portfolio Management 3 FIN 6465 Financial Future and Fixed Income Investments 3 FIN 6487 Financial Risk Management 3 From the MIB program (12 credit hours) will be transferred as follows: FIN 6644 Global Financial Strategy 3 ACG 6255 International Accounting 3 FIN 6XXX Finance Elective 1 3 FIN 6XXX Finance Elective 2 3 4. Joint degree c andidates will not receive either degree until all requirements for both programs have been satisfied. Students deciding against completing a second degree must satisfy all first degree program requirements as if the student had never been a joint degree c andidate. 5. With the joint degree program students will take a total of 57 credit hours to get both degrees. Without the joint degree program students will need to take 69 credit hours to get both degrees. Thus, MIB students who have taken twelve credits of MSF common courses may obtain an MSF degree with an additional 21 credits. MSF students who have taken twelve credits of the MIB classes, may obtain an MIB degree with an additional 24 credits. Graduate Catalog 201 4-2015 College of Business 357 Master of Science in Human Resource Management/Master of Bu siness Administration Joint Degree Program The Department of Management & International Business and the Alvah H. Chapman Jr. Graduate School of Business at Florida International University have a joint degree program culminating in both a Master of Busin ess Administration degree (MBA), and a Master of Science in Human Resource Management (MSHRM).

Under the joint degree program, a student can obtain both degrees in significantly less time than it would take to obtain both degrees if pursued consecutively. The joint degree program will use existing faculty, courses, and resources. Important criteria relating to the joint degree program are as follows: 1. Candidates to the joint degree program must meet the entrance requirements established by each individual program. Candidates must indicate on the joint degree student contract the i ntention to pursue both programs. Students deciding to pursue the joint degree option after having been admitted to one program will indicate this intention by completing the request to enter a joint degree program. 2. Applications for a joint degree will not be accepted from candidates who have already completed either degree. MBA or MSHRM students must apply and be admitted no later than the second to last semester in which they are expected to complete their original degree requirements. 3. Candidates must satisfy all requirements for each degree: a. To obtain the MSHRM degree, the student will be required to take twelve (12) 3- credit HR courses. This includes the existing HR Strategy course (MAN 6385) - which can replace the Strategic Management course in the core MBA curriculum (MAN 6726) - plus eleven HR courses from the MSHRM program, for a total of 36 credit hours. Four of these eleven MSHRM courses will be used to satisfy the elective requirements of the MBA program. b. To obtain the MBA degree, the student will have to fulfill all the MBA program requirements, that is, three prerequisites (9 credits unless waived), four one- credit seminars, ten 3-credit core courses and four 3- credit electives, for a total of 46-55 credits depending on prerequisites. c. Two degrees will have five common courses. All courses transferred between degrees must be completed with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher. MSHRM courses transferred to meet MBA elective credit must be 6000 level courses approved by the University Curriculu m Committee. Directors of the MBA and MSHRM degree programs may adjust these exact course requirements as a result of future changes to the MBA or MSHRM curriculums. 4. Joint degree candidates will not receive either degree until all requirements for both pro grams have been satisfied. Students deciding against completing a second degree must satisfy all degree requirements for the first program as if the student had never been a joint degree candidate. 5. With the joint degree program students will take a total of 67-76 credit hours (depending on prerequisites) to get both degrees. Without the joint degree program students would need to take 82- 91 credits hours (depending on prerequisites) to get both degrees. Thus, MBA students who have taken twelve credits of M SHRM common courses may obtain an MSHRM degree with an additional 21 credits. MSHRM students who have taken three credits of an MBA core MSHRM course may obtain an MBA degree with only 40 credits.
