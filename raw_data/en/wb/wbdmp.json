Impossible. Learn how resolve conflicts by performing a burning ritual in 5 steps to get over traumatic experiences, painful relationships of the past, and move on.", "sitename": "Andy Seth", "date": "2019-09-17", "cleaned_text": "Not too long ago, a trusted friend and someone I did business with burned our relationship for short-term gain. This person had their own motivations for crossing legal and ethical lines. I'm steadfast about doing the right things, for the right reasons, with the right people. I decided to sever ties immediately and though I left a lot of money on the table, I knew that this was the best path for me internally. The pain and anger sat unresolved within me for quite some time. Every time I saw their company logo, brand color, associates, social media, you name it, I was triggered, pissed, and hurt all over again. It was then that I discovered an ancient method to resolve conflicts: a burning ritual. You might be bogged down by your past in some way, whether it be from traumatic experiences, painful relationships, or situations out of your control. The thing is, all unresolved conflicts are energy leaks, and when you have big goals to accomplish, you need to preserve and use energy wisely. You cannot afford to be burned out or make the excuse that there isn't enough time when in reality, you just don't have the energy. Resolution only exists within yourself, but it's a challenging endeavor without a strategy to process the emotions. Since I've been there myself, I want to share my tried-and-true, five-step approach to finally resolving the pain of the past so you can accept, move forward, and feel energized 24/7.

Starting small is essential to build momentum and help you move to more significant issues. In behavioral economics, this is known as the \"snowball effect\" which says to start with small things, like paying down $100 of debt first before you tackle bigger things like $10,000. Whereas if you start in reverse, paying down $10,000 would take forever, and you might burn out. Step 2: Write a Letter of Fury Grab a pen and paper and start writing down whatever is making you pissed. Get your frustration out for 15 minutes. Say it all. Unadulterated, uninhibited. Cuss, chew people out. Bring the fury. Say how you feel and how you were wronged. Writing down the experience transfers negative energy from your subconscious, through your conscious mind, down your arm, through the pen, and onto the paper. Moving the energy is a release, so you stop being triggered at things that remind you of the issue. Step 3: Light It Up Now that the paper holds all your negative thoughts, start a fire and burn it. Hell, even spit into the fire if you want to. You don't want it to exist anymore, so you have to get it out of this universe. Whatever you do, don't keep your letters of fury sitting around. I personally have a little note pad at my desk, and when I know I'm triggered \u2014 boom, I write it down. When I'm ready to burn those suckers, I stuff them into my barbeque chimney, douse it in lighter fluid, drop a match, and watch it go up in flames. Step 4: Rinse and Repeat After the letters are burned, only part of the problem is cured. You have to keep going until you get it all out. So if you cured 5%, then you have 19 more rounds to go. What you write during round two doesn't have to be the same thing. In fact, you'll be surprised to see the tangents you can go on once you open up the floodgates. Block off 15 minutes every week to sit and purge that conflict. Step 5: Observe Your Progress Keep writing until you notice a change in your tone. After going off on someone for a while, you'll see that your voice and attitude towards the conflict will eventually change. When you observe the shift, that's when you're healing. Your empathy will begin to increase, and you come to a point where you achieve acceptance. That's when you know the conflict is resolved.

All you have to do is accept. Forgetting is impossible, and genuine forgiveness takes lots of time. But acceptance says, \"I accept the situation and no longer get triggered.\" Ultimately, resolving conflicts is not to forgive or forget \u2014 it's to accept and move on.
