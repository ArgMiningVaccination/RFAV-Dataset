COMPLAI The Federal Trade Commission has reason to believe that Warner- Lambert Company (hereafter \" Warner-Lambert\" ), a corporation and the respondent herein , has acquired Parke , Davis & Company (hereafter \" Parke, Davis), a corporation , in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act , as amended (15 V. C. 18); therefore , pursuant to Section 11 of the Clayton Act , as amended (15 V. C. 21), it issues this complaint , stating its charges in that respect as follows: 1. DEFIr-ITIONS For purposes of the complaint the following definitions shall apply: I (a) \"Drugs \" are medicines , both pharmaceutical and biological , in dosage form and are here restricted to those intended for human use. (b) \"Ethical\" drugs are those for which a prescription is required or which, although sold over the counter without a prescription , are primarily promoted to the medica1 profession.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 813 812 CompJaint (c) \"Proprietary \" drugs are those which are promoted primarily to the consuming public. (d) Any reference herein to Warner- Lambert or to Parke , Davis shall be deemed to include all subsidiary corporations unless the context requires otherwisc. 2. ACQUISITON On November I3 , 1970, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated August 25 1970, Warner- Lambert, a Delaware corpora- tion with its principal office at Morris Plains , New Jersey, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Tabor Company, a Michigan corporation acquired ownership of all or substantially all the stock of Parke , Davis a Michigan corporation with its principal place of business at Detroit Michigan. At the time of the acquisition both Warner- Lambert and Parke, Davis were engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton Act , as amended. 3. ACQUIRING COMPANY At the time that it acquired Parke , Davis, Warner- Lambert was a major American industrial corporation and a leader in the drug business. In 1969 Warner- Lambert's total sales were $808 mi1ion and total assets $572 mi1ion , ranking it approximately 138th largest in sales and 165th largest in assets among American industrial corpora- tions. Warner- Lambert has foreign operations , with some 70 owned or leased plants in 47 countries. Warner-Lambert began business as William R. Warner & Co. , later Warner-Hudnut , Inc., the product of a I9I6 merger between a cosmetics company and a chemical company. Its total sales in 1954 were $48 mi1ion. Thereafter , it embarked upon an extensive acquisi- tion program , the most important being the acquisition of the Lambert Co. (Listerine mouthwash) in 1955. There followed acquisitions of the makers of such well- known proprietary drugs as Bromo- Seltzer (effervescent analgesic), Smith Brotbers (cough drops), Sloan (liniment) and others. Warner-Lambert makes extensive use of advertising and other promotional programs in marketing its products. Its domestic advertis- ing and promotion budget now approximates $80 million yearly. Its products are advertised on nearly half of all TV network shows. In 1969, Warner- Lambert's consumer products divisions ranked fourth among all proprietary drug manufacturers in the country, with proprietary drug sales to U. S. drugstores and hospitals of $57 million representing 6. 4 percent of total L. S. sales of about $900 mi1ion.814 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Complaint 87 F. By 1953 Warner- Lambert (then Warner- Hudnut) had also entered the manufacture of ethically promoted drugs through the acquisitionof Chilcott Laboratories (formerly the Maltine Company). Tbis business was gradually expanded by Warner- Lambert. Today about 300 \" detail\" men service the medical profession. During the decade of the 1960' s Warner- Lambcrt's growth as an ethical pharmaceutical manufacturer was partly internal and partly by acquisitions in the dermatological field - Texas Pharmacal Co\" in the biologicals field Elizabeth Biochemical Laboratory, in the medical equipment and instrumentation field - American Optical Co. , and in foreign drug manufacturing, notably the acquisition of the European firm , Vismara Terapeutici Sp. A. In product researcb and development , Warner- Lambert employs approximately 500 persons and spends about $30 mi1ion yearly. Its primary research and development efforts are on ethical pharmaceuti- cals and optics , including medical equipment and instrumentation. Warner-Lambert has been and is now a rapidly growing firm. By I969 (through its Warner- Chilcott division) it had become the 15th largest manufacturer of ethical drugs in the Nation , with sales to drugstores and hospitals of $87 mi1ion , or 2. 3 percent of the $3. 8 bi1ionS. total for that year. In the overal1 hospitals- drugstores drug market, both ethical and proprietary, it ranked 12th among U.S. companies , with about 3. 1 percent of $4. 7 billion total U. S. sales. 4. ACQUIRED COMI'MY Prior to acquisition by Warner- Lambert, Parke, Davis was one of the nations leading old- line pharmaceutical houses. Founded in I866 , it achieved its present market position largely by internal growth. In I969 Parke , Davis' total sales were $274 mi1ion total assets $399 mil1ion. It was the 340th largest in sales and 218th largest in assets of al1 American industrial corporations. It also had extensive foreign operations in 43 countries , including manufacturing plants in 22 of them. Over the years Parke , Davis built up one of the most extensive product lines in the business. Its pharmaceutical and biolo!.rical manufacturing facilities arc among the most diverse in the C'ation. Its catalogue lists some thousand products. It is largely independent of the drug wholesalers on whom most manufacturers must depend by virtue of its unusual nationwide network of 23 warehouses and its sales force of about 1 000 \"detail men \" who promote its products directly to physicians and hospitals , one of the largest such detail forces in the industry. Its research and development laboratories are among the oldest, largest and best qualified in the industry, employing 700- 800WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 815 812 Complaint persons. It spends nearly $20 million yearly on product research and development. In 1969 Parke , Davis' domestic sales of $110 million of ethically promoted drugs made it the 11th ranking domestic seller with 2. 9 percent of the $3. 8 billion hospitals- drugstores market for ethical drugs. In 1969 , Parke , Davis commenced the organization of a new Consumer Products Division. That Division had initial sales of about $27 million. In 1970 Parke , Davis ' articles of incorporation were amended to permit expansion of its activities throughout a hroad health\" field , and it undertook a more aggressive promotional policy to expand its product line and to improve its existing market position particularly in the hospitals- drugstores proprietary drug market where it ranked 44th among all sellers. Among sellers of drugs of all kinds , both ethical and proprietary, to hospitals and drugstores , Parke, Davis ranked 14th , with 2.4 percent of $4.7 bilion sales in 1969. 5. TRADE AND COMMERCE The drug industry is a large and expanding one. The value of shipments by U. S. pharmaceuticals manufacturers rose steadily from about $900 million in I947 to $4. 7 billion in 1967 and the value of shipments by U. S. biologicals manufacturers during the same period rose from about $40 million to about $173 million. Pbarmaceuticals shipments in 1967 totaled $4. 1 billion and were divided between ethical and proprietary drugs in a ratio of $3. 0 bilion to $1. bilion. Long-run the trend in the drug manufacturing industry has been toward gradual reduction in the number of firms engaged therein. The number of U. companies producing drugs decreased from 1 123 in I947 to 791 in 1967. In particular drug industry submarkets , such as those specified later in Paragraph 6 , the top four or at least the top eight sellers in each such submarket commonly control 75 percent or more of the business. Moreover, the top 20 among all sellers of pharmaceutical drugs (SIC 2834) between 1947 and 1967 increased their aggregate market share from 64 percent to 73 percent. Within the top 20 pharmaceutical firms the market position of the top eight after declining somewhat during the late I950' s has since held its ground and shows some tendency now to rise. It was at about the 40 percent level in 1967. Research for and development of new or improved drugs is an important element for success in tbe drug industry. Generally such research, testing and related facilities are expensive and time- consum- ing. Such research , testing and related facilities , together with the control of patents; possession of heavily promoted and successful trade names, and of nationwide distribution facilities , including large and816 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Complaint 87 F. established \" detail\" forces for ethical promotions and the ability to engage in expensive advertising programs for the promotion of proprietary drugs , tend to raise substantial barriers to entry into the drug industry, to limit competition within the industry and in submarkets thereof , and to make the existing drug firms , and particularly the larger drug firms , the most Jikely sources of new competition with regard to particular drug product submarkets in which they do not presently compete. Parke , Davis and Warner- Lambert have each made substantial commitments to research and development , have operated substantial research and development programs in the past , and each stands among the leading U. S. firms in capacity and capability to conduct research and development. In addition , each was , prior to the merger complained of herein , possessed of patent rights , heavily promoted trade names , nationwide distribution facilities , large and established detail\" forces , substantial advertising budgets , and other competitive advantages which made each one of these firms among the most likely to enter or improve its competitive position in drug submarkets where it was not already a significant competitive factor. 6. MARKTS ADVERSELY AFFECTED The acquisition of Parke , Davis by Warner- Lambert tends substan- tially to lessen actual and potential competition in drug manufacturing generally, in the ethical segment thereof and in , among others , the following relevant product sub markets , all of which arc nationwide in geographic scope and all of which are highly concentrated. In some such submarkets substantial existing (\" SE\") competition between the parties and with others has been eJiminated. In other such submarkets where one party ranked among the top four or eight sellers , with a significant or at least not insignificant market share , the acquisition has ended all likelihood that existing, imminent or recent (\" E/I/R\" ) competition by the other , with that other firm s many competitive advantages , would have grown to more substantial proportions. In other such sub markets where one party ranked among the top four or eight sellers , with a significant or at least not insignificant market share , the acquisition has eJiminated the other party as a potential entrant (\" PE\") into competition. With respect to such submarkcts , special circumstances such as marketing of the same product in a different geographic market or of an only slightly different product in the same market combined with the many competitive advantages of the other party served to make such other party one of the most likely entrants into competition.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 817 812 Complaint Aggregate sales in these 55 submarkets in 1969 totaled about $1 800 milion. A. Horrnes Drugs affecting the endocrine glandular system and related compounds constitute an important part of the pharmaceuticals industry. Sold ethically, domestic shipments thereof in 1969 were valued at $497 milion. The following constitute well- defined and significant hormone submarkets: (1) Thyroid Preparations (SE) (2) Anti-thyroid Preparations (PE) (3) Oral Contraceptives (E/I/R) (4) Progestogens , Oral (PE) Combinations (E/I/R) B. Neuropharmaals Pharmaceutical preparations acting on man s central nervous systemand sense-organs constitute the largest single segment of the pharmaceutical market. Shipments of such drugs by U.

Skin PrepamtWns Pharmaceutical preparations acting on the skin constitute a significant part of the drug market. Total shipments by manufacturers of such products in 1969 were valued at $274 million , of which about 40 percent were ethical and 60 percent were for proprietary marketing. The following constitute well- defined and significant skin preparations submarkets: (1) Topical Proteolytic Enzymes (PE) (PE) (6) Hypo-allergenic Cosmetics (PE)WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 819 812 Complaint Vitamins - Vitamin compounds constitute an important segment of the drug market. Total shipments by U. S. manufacturers of vitamins in 1969 amounted to $253 mmion , of which about $246 million were domestic shipments. Ethical sales exceeded proprietary sales about six to four.

J. Medical Elctronic Equipment The recent application of electronics to the practice of medicine has resulted in developmcnt of much new equipment for hospitals and physician s offices , much of it in the fields of cardiac disease diagnosis and patient monitoring. The value of all manufacturers ' shipments of elcctronic medical equipment is now probably of a magnitude of $300 milion or more yearly. The following constitute well defined and significant submarkets for medical elcctronic equipment. (I) Electrocardiographs (E/J/R) (2) Patient Monitoring Equipmcnt (PE) K. Fine/ BuUc Chemicals Fine or bulk chemicals arc those suitable for use as pharmaceuticals either mediately or immediately. Among the well- defined and signifi- cant fine/bulk chemicals sub-markets are (2) Picoline (PE) (3) Niacinamide COMPETITIVE THE ACQUISITION Warner- Lam bert's acquisition of Parke , Davis has at one stroke raised the former s rank among all American drug manufacturers serving the hospitals/drugstores market from 12th to 3rd place and from 15th to 5th place in the ethical sector thereof. It has increased its share of the $4. 7 bilion L. S. hospitals- drugstores market from 3. percent to 5. 5 percent and its share of the $3. 8 billion ethical segment thereof from 2. 3 percent to 5. 2 percent. Concentration of sales in the hands of the eight largest sellers in the hospitals- drugstores drug market has been increased as a result of this merger from about 40. percent to about 41.7 percent , and in the ethical segment thereof concentration has been increased from about 44. 1 percent to about 45. percent. As a result of said acquisition competition may be substantially lessened in tbe nationwide drug manufacturing market , in its ethical and proprietary sq, 'lcnts , and in various submarkets thereof , all nationwide in geographic scope , including, among others , each of the submarkets set out in Paragraph 6 hereof , by increasing concentration as alleged above and also in the following ways , among others: (a) Actual and potential competition between Parke , Davis and Warner- Lambert has been eliminated and actual and potential competition with others has been eliminated or substantially lessened; (b) Parke , Davis, which has long been one of the most significantWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 821 812 Initial Decision firms in the drug industry, in terms of research , distributional and promotional resources and broad resouree flexibility has now been completely and permanently eliminated as an actual or potential independent competitor in eountless product lines throughout the drug industry; (c) Entry or growth of new competition may be further inhibited; (d) The acquisition is likely to encourage a tendency to additional acquisitions or mergers , and to thereby further increase concentration. V lOLA TIO By reason of all the foregoing, the acquisition of Parke , Davis' stock by Warner- Lambert constitutes a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended (15 D. C. 18). INITIAL DECISION BY A1'DREW C. GOODHOPE , ADMINISTRATIVE (IJ On June 30 , I971, the Commission issued its complaint against respondent charging it with violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act as amended (15 D. C. 18). A copy of the complaint and notice of hearing were served upon respondent , and respondent thereafter appeared by its counsel and filed an answer admitting certain of the allegations of the complaint but denying that it had violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act. (2J Extensive hearings were thereafter held , at which time testimony and documentary evidence were offered in support of and in opposition to the allegations of the complaint. At the close of all the evidence and pursuant to leave granted by the administrative law judge , proposed findings of fact , conclusions of law , briefs and proposed orders were filed by counsel supporting the complaint and counsel for the respondent. Proposed findings not herein adopted either in the form or substance proposed are rejected as not supported by the evidence or as involving immaterial matters. Having reviewed the entire record in this proceeding, including tbe proposed findings and briefs , the administra- tive law judge , based upon the entire record , makes the following:822 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Initial Decision 87 F. F'1'DI'IGS OF FACT JURISDICTIONAL FACTS 1 1. Warner- Lambert Company (Warner- Lambert), respondent here- , is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principaJ office and place of business located at Morris Plains , New Jersey. 2. Prior to November I3 , 1970, when it was acquired by Warner- Lambert, Parke, Davis & Company (Parke , Davis) was a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of :vichigan with its principal officc and place of busincss Jocated at Detroit , Michigan. 3. At a11 timcs rclevant to this proceeding, Warner- Lambert sold and shipped , and is now se11ing and shipping, products in interstate commerce throughout the United States and was and is engaged in commerce as \" commerce \" is defined in the Clayton Act.

At a11 times relevant to this proceeding, Parke , Davis sold and shipped products in interstate commerce throughout the l:nited States and on November 13 , 1970 , and prior thereto , w&, engaged in commerce as \" commerce \" is defined in the Clayton Act. 5. On November 13 , 1970, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated August 25 1970, Warner- Lambert acquired ownership of alJ or substantia11y a11 the stock of Parke , Davis in return for 6 600000 shares of Warner- Lambert common stock. RELEVANT MARKET AI', D LI'SES OF COM. ERCE 6. The relevant market within which to view the merger of Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis is the 6; Answer , para. 27). 7. There are a number of Jines of relevant commerce to be considered in viewing this merger. Tbey are as fo11ows: (a) Tbe overa11 drug market. , botb pbarmaccutical and biologicaJ , in dosage form and are limited in this proceeding to those for human use. Included in this market are ethical drugs and so- ca11ed proprietary drugs. Proprietary drugs are not a separate line of commerce relevant for consideration in this case , other than as a part of the overa11 drug market , described above. These are products manufactured and sold by the drug industry and which are promoted principa11y to the consuming pubbc. They may indude products for whicb a prescription may often be written by a physician but which may aJso be soJd over- tbe-counter without a respondent'o.WARNER- 812 Initial Decision (b) Etbical drugs. Tbcse drugs for which a prescription from a physician is required , or which , although sold over- the-counter (OTC) without a prescription , are primarily advertised and promoted by the drug industry to the medical , pharmacy and al1ied professions. These ethical drugs are a relevant line of commerce for consideration in this case. (4) (c) In addition , counsel in support of the complaint assert that there are 20 separate sub markets of the overal1 drug market which are included as either ethical or proprietary drugs which constitute distinct lines of commerce and must be considered individual1y in considering this merger. It is urged that there was either actual or potential competition existing at the time of the merger which was directly affected or eliminated as a resuH of the merger. Each of these relevant markets outlined above wil1 be treated seriatim in this initial decision. ACQuIRI'SG CORPORATIO'S: WAR tR-LAMBERT 8. Warner- Lam bert's history dates back to 1856 , the year in which Wil1iam R. Warner founded an ethical drug business in Philadelphia (CX 43), which was acquired by Pfeifer Chemical Co. in 1908. In 1916 the stock of Richard Hudnut , a New York cosmetics manufacturer was acquired and from I920 to 1955 the combined business was known as Warner- Hudnut, Inc. (CX 43). Fol1owing a merger with the Lambert Company of St. Louis in 1955 , the firm name was changed to Warner- Lambert Pharmaceutical Company (CX l(B)) and in 1970 simplified to Warner-Lambert Company (CX l(B)). 9. Between 1952 and 1970 , Warner- Lambert acquired or merged with the fol1owing companies , al1 of whom were engaged in the broad drug market or closely a11ed lines of products: Date 1952 1955 1956 1962 1964 1966 1967 1967 1969Company Chilcott Laboratories , Inc. The Lambert Company Nepcra Chemical Company American Chicle Company Smith Brothers Texas Pharmacal Company American Optical Company Vismara Tcrapeuticai , Sp. A Elizabeth Biochemical Laoorawry (5) Warner- Lambert, over the years , had also consistently enjoyed internal growth and expansion of a substantial nature. 10. Warner- Lambert employs 40 000 persons worldwide (CX I(T)). The major portion of Warner- Lam bert's research facilities, ethical824 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS InitiaJ Decision 87 F. pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and the executive offices are located in Morris Plains , New Jersey (CX I(W)). Proprietary pharma- ceutical products , Ilinois; and Anaheim , California. and hypoallergenic products are manufactured in San Antonio , Texas, and cough drops are manufactured prineipa11y in Poughkeepsie , New York (CXl(W)). 11. In 1969 , prior to the acquisition of Parke , Davis, Warner- Lambert' s sales were $808 mi11ion and total assets were $572 mi11ion. In 1969, its total domestic sales were $540 mi1ion and its total domestic assets were $366 million (Complaint , para. 3; Answer , para. 3). Its sales were divided about equa11y between professional and consumer products and products sold internationa11y. In 1969 , professional products, a11 products promoted to the medical profession , accounted for 36.1 percent of total sales , while consumer products accounted for 35.9 percent , and international sales 28. 0 percent of total sales (CX I(T)). Approximately IO percent of the total of all sales for 1969 were accounted for by ethical drug sales (RX 2029; Tr. 2638). 12. At all relevant times , Warner- Lambert has manufactured and sold: professional products , including ethical pharmaceuticals , dental specialties , ophthalmic lenses and frames , ophthalmic and scientific instruments , sunglasses , safety products , fine chemicals and biochemi- cal specialties. I3. Warner- Lambert over the years has enjoyed substantial growth in the drug industry, both in the ethical and proprietary portions of the drug market. The primary reasons before this growth is Warner- Lambert's ability to engage in extensive promotion (detailing) to the medical profession , including the pharmacists and related professions of its ethical drugs and the substantial advertising which it puts behind its proprietary or over- the-counter drugs. (6) Its trade name products have become very familiar to the medical profession. The advertising behind such products as Listerinc , Bromo Seltzer , Super Anahist Smith Brothers Cough Drops , Rolaids have made them household names and commonly are among the leading products in their markets (CX 157 , CX 222, CX 2690). In addition , Warner- Lambert has been able to use these popular trade names to sell associated products , such as tooth paste , breath spray and throat lozenges (CX 251 , CX 2698). 14. Warner- Lambert utilizes every conceivable type of print and electrical medium to promote its products. These include direct mail billboard , shelf- talkers displays , television , radio, newspapers , maga- zines and professional journals. In 1968 Warner- Lambert spent approximately $80 million for domestic advertising; in I969 approxi- mately and in 1970 approximately $I26 mi1ion for domesticWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 825 812 Initial Decision advertising (CX 11- , 21, 24). In 1970 Warner- Lambert was tbe largest drug and cosmetic advertiser in the country and the fifth largest advertiser among all companies (CX 24 , CX 289- 292). 15. Warner- Lambert engages in research and development pro- grams. In 1969 it spent approximately $11 million for ethical researcb and employed about 320 persons in this endeavor , para. 3; CX 29; Tr. 2685). likewise engages in research and development work witb its foreign operations and derives benefits in this country from this overseas research and development. Warner- Lambert likewise engages in research and development work in support of its proprietary drug products which amounted to approxi- mately $2 16. Warner- Lambert also employs a highly capable staff of 3 000 sales representatives in the l.nited States serving various markets. It is a highly oriented marketing company with an able promotional staff, ski1ed packaging experts and market planners. 17. Warner- Lambert has been successful over the years in obtain- ing patents on many of its products which have been well accepted in the market. In addition , Warner-Lambert is regularly engaged in licensing drugs from other companies or individuals holding patents on such drugs and at present has approximately 18 products on the market which are licensed for manufacture or sale from such companies. (7J ACQUIRED CORPORATIO?-: PARKE , DAVIS 18. Parke , Davis is a famous ethical pharmaceutical company (Tr. 2724) and one of the most respected names in medicine (CX 276). Since the company was founded , its research and development has resulted in hundreds of major contributions to pharmacy and medicine (CX 419). The reputation of Parke , Davis research for breadth and quality is I840 , 1886- , 2730). 19. 000 persons , () whom about 7300 are located in the United States (CX I (CC)). Parke , Davis executive offices and the largest of its ethical and proprietary facilities are located in Detroit , Michigan (CX 1 (BB)). Research facilities are centered in Ann Arbor , and Detroit , 'Viehigan , while biological products are manufactured principally at Rochester , Michigan (CX I (BB)). Parke , Davis owns or leases distribution centers in 23 major cities in the United States (CX l(BB)). 20. At all times relevant to this case , Parke, Davis has manufac- tured and sold pharmaceutical , biological , medical-surgical and related health care products in the United States and throughout the free world (CX l(Y)). All of Parke , Davis' pharmaceutical products were - 77 - .826 FEDERAL TRADE CO:\\MISSION DECISIONS InitiaJ Decision 87 F. and are ethically promoted. It had and has no proprietary products (CX I(Z)). Pharmaceutical and biological products accounted for 41.7 percent of total Parke , Davis' sales in 1969 (CX l(Y)), while medical- surgical products were I3. 8 percent and international sales were 42. percent of all sales (CX I(Y)). 21. Parke, Davis is one of the country s two \" broad l1ne pharmaceutical companies with a \" standard\" pharmaceutical line designed to meet most of a physician s needs for drugs (Tr. 3581). Parke, Davis, in addition to detailing specialty items to physicians , also sells generic drugs as commodities to hospital pharmacies and drug stores (Tr. 3376 , 3571- 72). In I966 , Parke , Davis supplied over 700 different products in over 100 different sizes and packages (CX 412), while in I970 , Parke, Davis carried more than I200 items in its catalogue (CX 332). (8) 22. In the years just before merger , Parke, Davis planned to expand into proprietary markets using its broad range of consumer products (CX 330 , 332, 333, 339, 363). To this end a special Consumer Products :varketing Department was established in the latter half of 1969 (CX 334 , 339). However , these plans did not materialize into any entry in the proprietary field. 23. Parke , Davis in 1960 had sales of $200 mi1ion and net earnings (after taxes) of $30 37IO). In I961 , sales earnings were $22 million (CX 3710). There followed two years at about the same level as 196I after which both sales and earnings recovered slowly, reaching new peaks in 1965 and I966 (CX 3710). In 1966, sales were $240 million and after- tax earnings were 832 mi1ion (CX 3710). Sales in 1967 , however , remained flat and net earnings fell from $32 to $21 million (CX 3709- 3710). There followed two years of rising sales ($274 million by 1969) with flat earnings ($2I million in I969) (CX 3709). From 1965 to mid- 1970 Parke , Davis' net income fell approximately 50 percent from just under $40 million to less than $20 million with consequent substantial reductions in dividends from $2. per share in I965 to about $1. 00 per share in the twelve-month period ending June 30 , 1970, and to 60 cents in 1970 (CX I(I)). Parke , Davis domestic operations were worse when earnings fell from $26 million in 1965 or I966 to a loss of $3 million in pre- tax earnings in I970 (CX 360).WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 827 812 lnitial Decision INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION AND MARKET SHARES 1'1 fHE OVERALL DRljG MARKET A?\\' D ETHICAL SECTOR 24.

The record demonstrates that Parke , Davis was among the top eight manufacturers of ethical drugs until it dropped to tenth in I964 and never recovered its position until the merger in 1970.

Based on stipu1ated DKK market data , the shares and ranks of Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis in the two years preceding the merger were as follows: 1968 1969Wanwr-LambertShare Rank41 on same industry source , the merged firm s post-merger shares and ranks in 1970 and I971 were in support of the complaint gloss over all of the statistical data in the record as to the market structure and heavily emphasize the 20 sub markets and the concentration statistics involved in each of those submarkets. However , they do request findings thatWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 831 812 Initial Decision there is substantial concentration both in ethical drugs and a1l drugs and that therefore the merger here involved furthered such concentra- tion. The stipulated statistics of record wi1l not support such findings. These tables show that there has not been a constant i.'TOUP of firms comprising the top four and top eight of either the ethical drug or a1l drug lines of commerce. In the ethical drug market , no less than eight firms have ranked within the top four , while 11 different firms have been within the top eight. Similarly, in the all drug market , nine firms have been in the top four , with 12 different firms having ranked eighth or higher. The change in composition of the leadership group reflects substantial risings and failings of individual firms. For example , (14J in the ethical drug sector , two of the top four firms in I969 , '\\erck and Roche , had ranked 11th and 17th , respectively, as recently as 1957. Conversely, American Cyanamid and L:pjohn , which ranked second and fourth, respectively, in 1957 had dropped to 12th and 7th positions by 1969. 31. The industry leaders have not been able to maintain or expand their market shares. With respect to the ethical line , the top four companies collectively accounted for 29. 07 percent of sales in 1957. By 1969, the collective share of these former leaders had shrunk by nearly one-third to 20. 74 percent. The same is true for the a1l drug line , with the 26.22 percent co1lective share of the four I957 leaders having dropped to 18.42 percent by 1969. Moreover , without exception , each of the top eight cthical drug manufacturers in 1957 lost market share during the succeeding years. In some cases , such loss was very substantial. American Cyanamid , for example , dropped from 6. percent in 1957 to only 2. 89 percent in 1969; Upjohn fell from 6. percent to 4. 17 percent; and Smith , Kline & French dropped from 5. percent to 4. 17 percent. Although the percentages differ , the universal Joss in market share by the leading companies was also true in the all drug line of commerce. 32. Parke , Davis is a good example of a once leading firm that was unable to maintain its market share and rank. In 1950 , Parke, Davis ranked second in the drug industry (Tr. 2294- 98). Ten years later , in 1960, Parke, Davis was still an industry leader , ranking third in the ethical drug line with 6. 02 percent of saJes (RX 1806), and fourth in the all drug line with 5. 08 percent of sales (RX 1836). By 1969 , Parke, Davis had dropped to lIth position in ethical drugs and 15th in the all drug line, with a market share in each Jine well below 3 percent. In 1971 , the year after the merger , the Warner- Lambert/Parke , Davis combined ethical drug share was 4. 8I percent (RX 1863 Revised) which is less than Parke , Davis alone accounted for ten years earlier (id. (15 J 33. These statistics in and of themselves establish that there is832 FEDERAL TRADI, COMMISSION DECISIO;'S Initial Decision 87 F. no \"interdependence \" in the drug industry (Tr. 2184- , 3790-92). In fact since the drug industry is characterized by important changes in market share and rank , it cannot be said to fit the oJigopoly theory. Such changes indicate independent rather than interdependent market behavior (Tr. 3791- 93). 34. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that there has been a marked trend towards concentration in the drug industry citing Bur',au of Census data showing a gross decline in the number of firms from 1143 in 1947 to 791 in 1967. Tbis Census information is somewhat dubious as a result of the manner in whicb the Census Bureau classifies companies within an industry according to their principal line of business. There are also stipulated DKK data in the record which show that there were more than 1400 companies in the overa11 drug market and 800 in the ethical sector aJone in 1969 and I970 (CX 727; RX 2028- 44). Consequently, the record contains no credible evidence that a trend toward concentration has taken place in the industry. 35. The cases upon which counsel in support of the complaint rely are not in point 3 particularly in view of the Commission s analysis of these cases in Sterling Dr, 1m. 80 F.C. 477597-98 (1972). In all of these cases there was a finding of a steady tendency toward concentration in the industry involved or that the acquisition noticeably increased the market share of the first or second top firm which already contro11ed more tban 20 percent of the market. As the Commission pointed out , something more than mere \" horizontality must be shown. Even the horizontality of the merger here involved is minimal involving two companies which certainly arc in the \" drug industry. However , Parke , Davis' sales arc limited to sales in the ethical sector of the drug industry (16J and only about 10 percent of Warner-Lambert's sales fa11 into the ethical sector. Ninety percent of Warner-Lamberts sales are in tbe proprietary drug market and none of Parke, Davis' sales were made in this market. In addition , Parke Davis concentrated on drugs sold to the ethical sector of the market on a generic basis while Warner- Lam bert's sales in the ethical market were concentrated on specialty items promoted to that market. Even in the submarkets , hereafter discussed , in which it is c1aimed the substantial existing or potentiaJ competition has been eJiminated serious probJems arise , not only as to proper market definition and the nature of the competition between the companies , but also as to the significance of the totaJ sales of these products by the two companies. It is estimated that total sales by the two companies in these 20 , Al1rUa377 C. Continenwl Can 378 C,S. 441 (1%4); United Stutes Nati!'na! Bank CO. 812 I nitial Decision submarkets couJd amount to no more than 1 percent of total industry sales of all drugs (CX 902 3457, I86220422360). 36. Counsel in support of the compJaint argue that this merger must be examined in the light of the \" powerfuJ\" barriers to new entry in the drug industry. They urge that these barriers consist of the need to undertak\u20ac substantial R&D activity; the burdens imposed by FDA regulation; the exclusionary effect of patents , and product differentia- tion arising from the use of trade names; the impact of anti- substitution laws , and the employment of various ethical and proprietary drug promotional techniques. 37. R&D activity and the necessity for meeting the FDA regulation burdens are closely related since the R&D expenditures and activities are all directed toward an attempt to obtain FDA approval of new drugs. Both Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis recognize the impor- tance of R&D and both expend substantial amounts of money for ethical drug research and development. In I970 , Parke, Davis expended $21 million and Warner- Lambert $14 million on ethical drug research for a worldwide total of $35 mi1ion. Based upon a survey in I970 by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA), $611 million was spent by that Association worldwide. This gives Parke , Davis a 3.4 percent share in 1970 and Warner- Lambert a 2. 3 percent share for a combined share of 5. 7 percent. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that R&D is highly concentrated in the drug industry. For example, based upon Commission Exhibit 3I87 , they urge that the first four companies account for 42 percent of total R&D expenditures in 1970; the first eight , 6I percent , and the first 20 , 9I percent. The (I7J difficulty with these figures is that there is nothing in the record which will provide a basis for a finding that the combination of Parke , Davis and Warner- Lambert had any significant effect upon these figures in I970. New chemical entities (NCE' s) are recognized in the industry as one of the indicators of successfuJ R&D effort (Tr. 232I). During the period 1965 to I972 , Parke, Davis is credited with three NCE' with two (RX 4I9 the Warner- Lambert were deveJoped by other companies (RX 434) and one credited to Parke , Davis was deve10ped by Schering (RX 450). It can only be concluded that Warner- Lam bert' s and Parke Davis' combined share would be insignificant at approximately 3. percent. There is nothing in the record from which to conclude that the combination of Parke , Davis and Warner- Lambert in any way heightened the barriers to entry into the drug industry or any of its product submarkets because of the necessity to undertake substantial research and development work in that industry. 38. Prior to the Food and Drug Act amendments of I962 only theFEDERAL TRAm: COMMISSION DECISIONS Initial Dccision 87 F. safety of a drug had to be proven before marketing and this was done without FDA supervision. The amendments of I962 required that both the safety and efficacy of a drug be proven by tests , supervised by FDA, on humans as well as animals (Tr. 2395- 2752-54). )' ow it is necessary to obtain a claimed investigational new drug exemption , or INDwhich allows a firm to proceed with human studies. Detailed disclosures about the drug and the manner in which the drug is being tested are required. Studies of the drug in animals must be made and studies in humans arc subject to strict regulations and close FDA supervision. All of the information gathered in these studies is submitted to the FDA in the form of a new drug application (NDA) (Tr. 2822). A substantial amount of information is required by the FDA and is very carefully, even stringently, checked by the FDA before a new drug application will be granted. All of this effort is a part of R&D expenditures discussed above. The FDA has established a different method of approval of drugs which have the same chemical composition of drugs which were on the market between I938 and 1962. This is called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). (18) Under this procedure , a new manufacturer of drugs of established efficacy has only to demonstrate the adequacy of his manufacturing facilities, his methods for determining that the proper amount of drug is in the dosage form , and the bioavailability of the drug. This procedure has greatly reduced the cost of obtaining approval for marketing of new drugs , particularly generic drugs. This abbreviated procedure has been widely employed by many companies and hundreds of A:'DAs for numerous products have been awarded (RX 393-4I4; Tr. 2766-, 3581-84). While the new procedures and regulations required by the 1962 amendments to the Food and Drug Act have substantially increased the work and cost of marketing new drugs , there is nothing in the record which will permit a finding that the additional cost and effort was in any way heightened as a result of the merger here involved or that the merger in any way heightened ' he barriers to entry into the drug industry or any of its product submr. rkets. or is it possible to conclude that the new Warner- Lambert, Parke, Davis R&D combination wi11 be in a position to adversely affect any other drug company s R&D programs. 39. Patents play an important competitive role in the drug industry since the holder of a patent on a drug or process for making a drug has an exclusive I7- year right to make and se11 or to license whomever they wish to make or se11 the drug. A patentholder usua11y attaches a trade name to any drug on which he may have a patent in addition to the generic name for such drug. Thereafter . the drug is promoted and detailed to the physicians and pharmacists using the trade name andWARNER- LAMBERT CO. &'5 812 Initial Decision an attempt is made , often successful , to differentiate this drug in the mind of the prescribing physician from any other firm s drug. In this area anti-substitution laws also playa part since virtually every state by law or Pharmacy Board regulation requires the pharmacist to fill a prescription exactly as written by the physician. Consequently, these laws attach a peculiar value to trade names in the husiness (Tr. 2234- , 3471). This is particularly true in the ethical drug market. While all this is true , there is nothing in the record to establish that the existence of these facts were in any way enhanced or changed as a result of the merger here involved. Neither Parke , Davis nor Warner- Lambert can be held responsible for the existence (I9) of the patent laws and nothing in the record will permit a conclusion that the combination of the two has in any way enhanced the effect of the patent laws or product differentiation in the ethical drug market. In addition , as a result of recent pressures morc and more drugs arc being prescribed or purchased under their generic names which permits a pharmacist to fill the prescription with whatever company s drug he has on hand (CX 3688). Parke , Davis had a patent on the drug chloramphenicol which it sold under the trade name chloromycetin. This patent expired in 1966 and other companies are now selling chloramphenicol. However , Parke Davis stil maintains the leadership in chloramphenicol with 94 percent of total sales (CX 4008). This drug accounted for more than 20 percent of Parke, Davis ' total sales as recently as 1967 (CX I (Z)). However this drug had developed serious and oftentimes fatal side effects resulting in adverse publicity and its sales had declined substantially accounting at least in part for the difficulties that Parke , Davis found itself in prior to the merger. There is no other evidence that Parke Davis or Warner- Lambert had any significant patent control of any drug which could be enhanced by this merger. 40. In the 20 submarkets upon which counsel in support of the complaint rely and which are discussed hereafter , patents do not appear to play any significant role. Product differentiation is more a product of drug promotion , particularly detailing and there is nothing in the record which will support a finding that product differentiation was in any way affected by the merger here involved. Anti-substitu- tion laws appear to serve the function of protecting the physician and his patient and are in no way enhanced as a result of the merger here involved. In any event the policy of patent protection for a discoverer of a new drug with the resulting lack of competitive ability by others is clearly an exception to the antitrust laws if the patent is legally obtained. 41. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that the merger has eliminated Parke , Davis as one of the leading drug companies because836 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Initial Decision 87 F. of its ability to promote products ethically to the medieal profession. Promotion to the medical profession which indudes physicians pharmacists and all types of hospitals , is done by means of detail (20) calls by drug company salesmen , advertising in various medical journals and direct mail to the medical profession. Counsel in support of the complaint emphasize that Parke , Davis had 900 men in its detail force and that detailing, journal advertising and direct mail circulation was highly concentrated among the top 20 firms in the industry. The evidence as to the rank and share of the various members of the industry arc contained in the in camera file and arc Commission Exhibits CX 3601- 24. This evidence shows that Warner- Lambert and Parke, Davis were each very small in their percentage rank in all types of ethical promotions even when combined. Their ethical promotions however measured , account for a smaller percentage share in each category than it does of their combined ethical sales with one exception. There is no evidence that anyone or two firms had a percentage in ethicaJ drug promotional activity anywhere approaching 20 percent or that this type of activity was highly concentrated at the four firm or eight firm level. Counsel in support of the complaint again emphasize that the 20 firm level of concentration is quite highly concentrated but there is no firm in any sort of a dominant position. This evidence will not permit a finding that the combination of Warner-Lambert and Parke , Davis will adversely affect the competi- tive situation in the drug industry insofar as it pertains to promotional activity in the cthical sector. In the proprietary sector , Warner- Lambert is a major consumer advertiser of both proprietary drugs and nondrug products (CX Il- , 70). In 1970 , it ranked fifth among the top IOO advertisers according to Adl' ertis1:ng Age data (CX 287- 288). Parke Davis engaged in no proprietary advertising and there is no credible evidence that it would ever become a significant proprietary drug marketer (CX 1 (Z)). Consequently, the merger will have no effect opon promotional activities for proprietary drug products. 42. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that the evidence showing the high level of profitability in the drug industry is indicative that there are substantial barriers into entry into the drug industry. The evidence upon which counsel in support of the complaint rely consists of a number of the Commission s Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR' s) and the testimony of their economic expert (Tr. 2194- , 2207). These annual rates of return on stockholders ' equity in the drug industry range from I6. 8 percent to 20. 3 percent for the drug industry as compared with 8. 6 percent (2Ij to 12. a percent for a1l manufactur- ing on the average (Tr. 2I97- 98). From this , it is argued that entry barriers in the drug manufacturing business must be formidable (Tr.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 837 812 InitiaJ Decision 2200). The problem with the Commission s QFR's is that they fail to deal adequateJy with advertising and R&D costs that are \" expensed\" rather than \" capitalized\" as a part of the stockholders ' equity in the drug industry. The Commission itself has pointed out these deficiencies in its Statement of Purpose accompanying Annual Line of Business Report Program ProposaJ , August 1972 , p. 6: IElxpensing of advertising costs J usualJy results in a measurement of the rate of return on capital which is higher than if such costs were capitalized. . . . As with sales promotion costs , the expensing of R&D costs usually leads to an overstatement of profitability, with the overstat\u20acment increasing with the intensity of R&D effort. As a rcsuJt the argument of counsel in support of the complaint is based upon evidence which is quite unreliable and possibly meaning- less, partieuJarly for an industry with large R&D expenditures and sales promotion costs such as the drug industry. Consequently, the proposed findings of counsel in support of the complaint in this regard are rejected. 43. Contrary to the contentions of counsel in support of the compJaint , there have been a number of successful new entrants into the drug industry both by domestic and foreign companies , many of these entries have been subsequent to the enactment of the 1962 amendments to the Food and Drug Act. Among these are Marion Laboratories (Tr. 3663- 73; 1747- I669-76). Other examples are Reid Provident Laboratories 3700), Rucker Pharmaceutical In addition , E.1. du Pont has entered the drug industry with the purchase of Endo in 1969. Minnesota , Mining and Manufacturing Company has entered the ethical drug business by acquiring the Riker Company in 1970 companies have entered the L:nited States drug market and four presently rank among the top 20 U. S. ethicaJ drug manufacturers , Roche, Ciba-Geigy, Sandoz and Burroughs- Wellcome (RX 1862 Rev. A). There are likewise a considerable number of foreign firms who have entered the United States market recently generally by acquisition of a small American drug firm in support of the complaint have submitted a large amount of testimony and exhibits attempting to establish that the acquisition has had substantial adverse effects in 20 submarkets of the drug industry. These are as follows: ThJToid Preparations838 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIOC'S Initial Dccision 87 F. 2. Anti-Anginal Drugs 3. Cough Remedies 4. Cough Drops and Lozenges 5. Cold Remedies 6. Oral Decongestants 7. Antihistamines 8. Bronchial Dilators 9. Emollient/Protective Preparations I2. Immune Serum Globulin 20. Tetanus Immune Globulin These drugs purport to be defined in terms of therapeutic end use and correspond approximately to 7- digit Standard Industrial Classifi- cation (SIC) categories (Tr. 2357- 59). Counsel in support of the complaint assert that either Warner- Lambert or Parke , Davis was a potential entrant into these product markets or was an existing manufacturer in these markets and was eliminated as either a potential or existing competitor and consequently there has been a subst.antiallessening of competition in each market as a result of the merger. (23) 45. In five of these submarkcts; namely, of the market represented by drugB sold by Parke Davis in each instance accounted for less than one percent (RX I766I664I758; CX 2620 I879) of the products sold in that submarket. As a result , it is concluded that Parke , Davis' market share in each of these alleged sub markets is so small that the elimination of Parke Davis as a potential future competitor of any sibrnificance must be rejected. Parke , Davis had been in these markets for a number of years and had never improved its market position and the record contains no credible evidence that such might occur in the future. In addition , the record contains substantial evidence that there are a large number of companies both large and small in each of these five submarkets whoWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 839 812 Initial Dccision are at least as capable as Parke , Davis of increasing their share of these markets despite the fact that their shares remained small (RX I6651760, 1768177817191716). 46. Three of these submarkets relied upon by counsel in support of the complaint; namely, antacids , cough drops and lozenges and mouthwash , are essentially proprietary drugs since their principal sales are directed to the consumer and require , for effective selling, expertise in media advertising and a developed system of distribution to all classes of trade (Tr. 3208 321536373522). Parke , Davis had none of these qualifications essential to be an effective proprietary drug marketer in the foreseeable future. As found above , the Parke , Davis market share in antacids was about 0. 1 percent. In cough drops and lozenges, Warner-Lambert was among the leading companies with about a 26. 8 percent share (CX 1463- 64). Parke , Davis had less than 3 percent of the market with outmoded products and consequently lacked any significant competitive potential. In mouthwash products Warner-Lambert is the clear leader with about 50 percent of the mouthwash market , accounted for principally 2688). Parke , Davis mouthwash products which in 1970 had de minimis total sales of $29 000 (CX 2688). Again mouthwash sales are primarily a proprietary item and there is nothing in the record to indicate that Parke , Davis could have become any sort of a significant competitor in (24) this market in the foreseeable future. As pointed out above , the Commission s decision in the Sterling - Dru, Inc. case will not permit a finding of substantial lessening of competition upon a mere showing of horizontality between the two firms involved in the merger as is contended by counsel in support of the complaint. The market shares of Parke , Davis here involved are so insignificant that they wil not permit the mechanical application of a horizontaJity rule. Something more must be shown and the record is lacking in this respect. The contentions of counsel in support of the complaint that there could be any substantial lessening of competition in the seven submarkets discussed above are rejected. PRODUCT SUBMARKETS 47. Thyroi.d Davis markets in several grainage doses (Tr. 645; CX 923), and a variation thereof , thyroid strong, which contains 50 percent more iodine per grain than USP (Tr. 646; CX 924). Warner- Lambert product Proloid (Tr. 646; CX 913- 14), and a synthetic T - 4/T -3 combination Euthroid (Tr. 646; ex 915- 16). All of these products are used for the treatment of \" HypothJToidism \" which is the condition resulting from840 FEDERAL TRADE COM ISSIOK DECISIONS Initial Dccision 87 F. undersecretion by the tbyroid gland of thyroid hormone , a substance having as its principal function the regulation of metaboJic processes and rates within the hody (Tr. 629- 30). Complaint counsel urge that a1l thyroid preparations , including both branded and unbranded products comprise a single line of commerce for Section 7 purposes. Respondent disputes this , contending that unbranded and branded thyroid preparations compete in separate economic submarkcts. 48. There are substantial differences in the way the two companies products are manufactured , the customers and methods used in selJing their products , the way tbey are priced , and since they are sold only on prescription of a physician , tbe way they are dispensed to the ultimate user. liSP thyroid is produced by taking the thyroid glands from slaughtered pigs or cattle , removing extraneous tissue and cleaning and drying the remainder (Tr. 63I). Proloid , on the other hand , is obtained from a purified extract of frozen hog thyToid (CX 913). The synthetic brands are synthesized by chemical laboratory processes (Tr. 631). (25) USP thyroid is an unbranded generic product. As such , it is a commodity \" item whose sales effort is directed to the pharmacist and not to the physician (Tr. 3397 , 3014, 3130). This is because the decision as to which brand of USP thyroid wil be used to fil a USP prescription resides with the pharmacist , since physicians do not ordinarily specify a brand when they write USP prescriptions. The pharmacist will generally purchase the USP product with the lowest price, assuming quality is comparable (Tr. 3017- I8). He cannot use either Warner- Lambert's Proloid or one of tbe branded synthetics to fill USP prescriptions (Tr. 3018). Branded thyroid products are promoted to the physician in an effort to secure their brand name specification on thyroid prescriptions (Tr. 3397 , 3130). The prices of the unbranded USP thyroid products are set without any regard to the prices for the branded thyroid products whether natural or synthetic (Tr. 3130- , 3157-58). This is because of the manner in which the products are promoted and dispensed. The prices of branded thyroid products are likewise set without any regard to the prices of the USP products (Tr. 3392- 94). However , it all really depends upon tbe physician and what he prescribes. Natural liSP has been on the market since the 1930' s and many physicians have had experience with this product and continue to prescribe it because it is a good product with which they are familiar. The branded natura! and the synthetics appear to have a small advantage over the USP in that the active components are more exact and therefore can yield a some\\vhat more accurate result in laboratory tests on a patient s blood samples. This advantage is at best marginal and is generally discounted by theWARC'ER- LAMBERT CO. 841 812 Initial Dccision medical profession as having any real sibmificance (Tr. 3368 879 88 I ,335-877 ,3398). 49. The merger in no way strengthens Warner- Lam bert's hand in the alleged thyroid market , since there is no advantage to Warner- Lambert in including in its line a USP thyroid product in addition to its branded products Euthroid and Proloid. USP thyroid competes in the generic commodity market in the retail pharmacy. The Warner- Chilcott Division , on the other hand , is a specialty house which markets its brand name products to the physicians. Had it found the USP thyroid market desirable , Warner- Lambert could have entered long ago, since hog and beef thyroid was readily available to it (Tr. 3397). (26) The record also shows that there are apparently no barriers to entry into the thyroid preparations field and that there are 37 companies in the field with a substantial number of new entrants in recent years (Tr. 874- 75; RX 17I6- 18). 50. It is concluded that there are significant differences between the two types of thyroid products sufficient to preclude the lumping of them together as a line of commerce with any real commercial significance. The thyroid market is highly concentrated with four companies being the leaders with Warner- Lambert ranking third with 20.8 percent of sales in I970. Combined Warner- Lambert and Parke Davis have 25.4 percent of the market and rank number one. However this smal1 increase in concentration in the overall thyroid market must be discounted because of the insignificant impact of the combination in the market found above.51. C01Jf/h Rerrwdws. A cough can be treated cither by removing the foreign particle or curing an infection in the respiratory tract or by treating the cough itself symptomatically. Symptomatic treatment with which we are here involved , can be accomplished by relieving the irritation 10cally or by suppressing the cough reflex in the brain. Materials which act 10cally are demulcents , local anesthetics and expectorants. Antitussives act on the brain or central nervous system to inhibit the cough reflex. Demulcents are soothing, syrupy or sugary substances. Local anesthetics reduce the pain or irritation causing the cough. Expectorants induce secretions in the lung which wash out the irritant, soothing the irritated area making the mucous in the tract thinner so that it can be coughed out. There are three physical forms in which cough remedies are manufactured: (1) liquid syrups , (2) tablets and capsules , (3) cough drops and lozenges. The iiquid preparations can contain antitussives , expectorants , demulcents or any combination of thesc. Tablets or capsules can contain antitussives and expectorants but have no demulcents therein. Cough drops and 10zenges always contain a demulcent which may be accompanied by antiseptics 2J6-C9 O- IT - - 5';FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIO:- DECISIO:-S Initial Decision 87 F. anesthetics or antitussives or any combination of these (Tr. 743- 754 37I3-I6). (27J 52. Cough remedies are marketed as either proprictary or ethical products. Of the ethical products , some are available by prescription only while others can be purchased by consumers , so-called ethical OTC drugs (Tr. 3631- 32; RX 1797). There is a definite distinction between cough drops and lozenges compared to cough syrup. All cough drops and lozenges are usually seH-medication by the consumer. They can be bought cheaply almost anywhere and carricd in one s pocket or purse (Tr. 915). For a persistent cough which requires the attention of a physician , a cough drop or lozenge is virtually never prescribed or recommcnded (Tr. 3632- , 3717 , I70I). A physician would prescribe an ethical product with which he was familiar and this would more than likely be a syrup with more active ingredients (Tr. 905, 3645-46). 53. The liquid cough preparation submarket (induding similarly- acting capsules and tablets) had I970 total sales of $I07 488000. Parke Davis had an 8. 3 percent share in this market in I970 , based on its prescription and ethical OTC cough syrups. Warner- Lambert had a minimis 59 percent market share , based primarily on its cough/cold combination Warncr-Lambert market share dedined to approximately 0. percent by I973 due to the failure of Kilco!. 54. Counsel in support of the complaint contend that all products useful against coughs are part of this submarket. Respondent takes the position that all cough remedies cannot be placcd in onc submarket since there were substantial differences in ingredients , usage, promo- tion, customers and prescription status. Over 95 percent of 'l' arner- Lambert' s sales of cough remedies are of cough drops and lozenges sold as proprietary drugs , while over 83 percent of Parke , Davis' factory sales are of ethical cough syrups , 60 percent being the prescription syrups Ambenyl and Benyhn. It thus appears that it would be improper to lump all cough remedies together as a submarket for Section 7 purposes. In fact , counsel in support of the complaint apparently recognize that there is a distinct. cough drop and lozenge submarket since it is one of the twenty submarkets which they say has been adversely affected as a result of this merger. (28 J 55. In any event , if an overall cough remedy market is recognized , Warner- Lambert had 3. 6 percent. of such market in 1968 and 4.4 percent in 1969 , while Parke , Davis had 4. 1 percent in 1968 and 4.4 percent in 1969 (CX 1461). The market is only moderately concentrated , with four- firm concentration in 1969 at 44. 9 percent and eight- firm concentration at 62. 0 percent (CX 3457). Induded in theW ARNE!(- LA:IBERT CO. 812 InitiaJ Decision market are a total of 188 firms marketing cough remedies in 1969- 1970 including 4I of the top pharmaceutical companies and a11 of the top 20 (RX 1786- 96). The record contains no evidence that there is any barrier to entry into the cough remedy market and the record wi11 not support a finding that the merger of Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis in the cough remedy market wi11 result in any substantial lessening of competition in that market. 56. Cold Rerrdws. Since there is no cure for the common coJd treatment is directed at relieving the unpleasant symptoms 'i. rhinitis. \" Other symptoms may also include a sore throat , fever malaise and cough (Tr. 756- 58). 57. Warner- Lambert marketed five cold remedies in , and 1970: Coryza RX A , Richards CCT tablets and Rhinitis CCT tablets and Cosanyl- DM Cough Syrup (CX I701). In addition , counsd in support of the complaint assert that Parke Davis' prescription cough syrup Benyiin Expectorant and Ambenyl Expectorant arc cold remedies. This claim must be rejected. First, counsel in support of the complaint have previously classified these drugs as cough remedies. Their argument that the fact that these products contain antihistamines make them cold remedies must be rejected. The FDA' s Interim Guidelines on Cough and A11ergy Products state that antihistamines \" alone or in combination L arc) not considered as safe and effective for rciief of the symptoms of the common cold. \" (CX 3235) This confirms a11 the modern teaching on the subject of effectiveness of antihistamines (Tr. 764). In addition , it appears that Benyiin and Ambenyl are promoted solely as cough remedies (Tr. 3308- , 3586; RX 1515- 17). Further , in a later proposed finding (421), counsel in support of the complaint apparently conceded that oral decongestants are the most accepted therapy for the treatment of colds. (29) 58. Warner- Lambert's position in the cold remedies market fe1l from 9th in 1969 to 10th in 1970, although in both years it accounted for approximately 4 percent of the market. Since Ambenyl and Benyiin are not cold remedies , Parke, Davis' share of the cold remedies market is de minim'is. Its Coryza and Rhinitis tah1cts , both over 30 years old had combined 1970 factory sales of $I4 000. Their sales decreased at an annual rate of 10 percent during the four previous years (CX 1652). Its CosanyJ-DM Cough Syrup (Improved Formula), gestant phenylephrine and the antitussive dextromethorphan , was introduced on September 1 , 1970 (CX 1701). Its annual factory sales appear to be approximately $214 000 (calculated from CX I472). DKKFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIO:- DECISIO Initial Decision 87 F. reports I970 sales of Cosanyl- DM gencra11y (presumably including the old nondecongestant formula) of $368 000 (CX 1753). According to DKK, Parke Davis had 0. 04 percent of the cold market in I969 and using the $368 000 figure for Cosanyl- DM - 0.16 percent of that market in 1970 (RX 2046). Even with Ambenyl and Benylin included Parke, Davis' market share would have been only 2. 0 percent in I969 and 2. 3 percent in 1970 (CX 3463). 59. Even if Benylin and Ambenyl were to be considered cold remedies , the combination of Warner- Lambert's four percent and Parke, Davis' two percent share would have no substantial anticompet- itive effect in this market. Concentration in the cold remedies market is at a moderate level and is declining. Four- firm concentration in the market declined from 46. 98 percent in 1969 to 44. 80 percent in I970 while eight- firm concentration decreased from 70. 09 percent to 69. percent (RX 2045). Market shares arc well distributed. In both 1969 and 1970, seventeen firms had more than one percent of the market (RX 2045- 46). Also, the number of firms in the market is both large and constant. In both 1969 and 1970 , 224 companies marketed cold remedies (RX 2045- 59). 60. It is concluded that the acquisition of Parke , Davis wi1 not have the effect of substantia11y lessening competition in the cold remedy submarket. 61. Oral Decongestants. Oral decongestants are Sympathomimetics useful in relieving the rhinitis associated with the common cold. Oral decongestants are swallowed and enter the blood stream through the stomach. They can have (30 J dangerous side effects elsewhere in the body and the dosage must therefore be limited. There are also topical decongestants , such as sprays which arc useful but may not reach as deeply as the oral preparations (Tr. 760- 62). 62. In 1969 , Warner- Lambert ranked 9th in the oral decongestant market with a 5. I5 percent market share. In 1970 it ranked 8th with 19 percent (RX 2060). Smith , Kline & French Laboratories are the leading marketer with 20 percent of the market , the remaining seven of the top eight range from 8 percent to Warner- Lambert' s 5. percent. Parke , Davis entered this market in I970 with sales of Cosanyl-DM cough syrup of S368 000 which represents 0. I8 percent of the market (CX 1753; RX 2061). The oral decongestant market is not highly concentrated with the four- firm concentration at 43. 76 percent in 1969 and 44. 02 percent in 1970 . the eight- firm concentration at 70. percent in I969 and 70. 30 percent in 1970. The record shows that there are a large number of firms in the market - 19I in I969 and 189 in 1970. Barriers to entry must be found to be low and among those firmsw AR\"ER LA:vBERT co. 812 lnitial Decision which, like Parke , Davis had 1css than one percent of the market , were 23 of the top 50 firms and eight of the top 20 firms (RX 2060- 72). 63. Parke , Davis' entry into this market in I970 must be considered de \",ini\",is and in view of the lack of concentration in the market and the large number of firms in this market , the record provides no basis for a finding that the acquisition of Parke , Davis may be to substantially lessen competition in the oral decongestant submarket. 64. Antihistamirws. The primary purpose and single ingredient of antihistamines is to allay the effects of al1cf!:, ric reactions associated witb histamine release in the body, such as high fever , food allergy, animal dander and insect stings. All single- ingredient antihistamines produced by the various manufacturers have a similar effect on the body, serve primarily the same therapeutic purpose , are substantially interchangeable and have the same basic side effects (Tr. 77376). Antihistamines are a proper submarket for Section 7 purposes. (3I J 65. The antihistamine market is highly concentrated with the top four firms accounting for 74. 6 percent of sales in 1969 and 74. percent in 1970 and the top eight firms accounting for 95.4 percent I969 and 95. 3 percent in 1970 (CX 1755). Parke , Davis is the second largest seller of single- ingredient antihistamines , accounting for 21.9 percent of sales in I969 and 23. 2 percent of sales in 1970. In addition to the top eight firms , there are 47 other firms in the antihistamine market, accounting for approximately 4.4 percent of that total market. WarnerLambert no longer markets a single ingTedient antihista mine. Its product was discontinued in I969 when its sales had fallen to 000 (Tr. 3407; ex 180I 02; RX I694). 66. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that Warner Lambert was a likely company to reenter the single ingredient antihistamine market since it had filed five single- ingTedient antihistamine product Abbreviated New Drug Applications (Tr. 3408- , 3516; CX 3626-28). The record shows that many other companies also filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications in the period 1965 to 1970 , a number of which have already been approved , 407-, 2290-9I). The purpose for Warner- Lambert's was to include single- ingredient antihistamines in a so-caned \" pun-back\" system of dispensing drugs in hospitals and extended care facilities. The record does not show whether this new package has been approved but in any event hospital sales of single- ingredient antihistamines in 1970 accounted for only 7. percent of total sales. Consequently, even if Warner- Lambert were eliminated as a potential entrant , it would be de min'imis (Tr. 3473- 74; RX 2423). 67. In view of the fact that Warner- Lambert had dropped out of the single- ingredient market prior to the merger and the lack of any846 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIO\"i DECISIONS Initial Decision 87 F. substantial evidence that it was a potential entrant and the existence of a large number of firms in this market (43 in 197I), many of them among the largest ethical drug houses (RX I695- 99), the record wm not support a finding that the acquisition of Parke , Davis wm have the effect of substantially lessening competition in the single- ingredient antihistamine market. (32J 68. Irritant Laxatives (Ethical). Laxatives are products which stimulate or ease defecation (Tr. 804 , 3360). They are generally self- prescribed (Tr. 3635 , 3359-60) and can be purchased without a prescription (Tr. 817- 18). The physician s usual role is to discourage laxative usage (Tr. 949- 50), except in the case of hospitalized patients or out- patients with specific therapeutic problems (Tr. 804- , 3635). A number of laxatives are promoted directly to the public through the media, while others are ethically promoted (CX 2031- 37; Tr. 3637). Regardless of the method of promotion , all laxatives arc shelved together in retail outlets (Tr. 3636-37). 69. Laxatives contain inhrredients which are pharmacologically classified the exception of simple lubricants , all essentially act in the same way: \" More matcrial comes down to fill the rectum and it stimulates evacuation. \" (Tr. 3361) A number of laxatives comhine ingredients from the different logic n. 2). both market laxatives (RX 1726). 70. Counsel in support of the complaint allege that irritant laxatives promoted ethically constitute a relevant product submarket. They further contend that within this alleged submarket , the merger has eliminated substantial existing competition. Respondent contends that complaint counsel's submarket definition excludes many thera- peutically and economically interchangeable products; that there is no basis in the record for classifying vVarner- Lambert's combination product , Agora1, as an irritant; and that even assuming counsel in support of the complaint were otherwise correct , the merger still would have no substantial anti competitive effect. 71. :'either the industry nor the public recognize irrtant laxatives as distinct from others. Al1 of the evidence establishes that the layman is not aware of the pharmacologic distinctions among laxative ingredients and so cannot distinguish so-cal1ed irritants from others (Tr. 950 36:06). The package inserts do not provide this information (Tr. 3637); in fact , the terms \" irritant \" (33) \" irritant ingredient \" or irritant laxative \" do not appear in any of the package inserts for laxatives which contain irritant ingredients. In every case the product is described simply as a \" laxative \" (CX 3163- , 3171, 3173, 199I-93) orWARNER- Parke documents do the terms \" irritant\" \" irritant ingredient \" or irritant laxative \" appear (CX 2002- 07). 72. While there arc c1assifications for various laxative ingredients based on method of action , these c1assifications do not establish any economically significant peculiar characteristics or uses. They all ultimately act in the same way (Tr. 804 , 3360-6I). It is of interest to note that counsel in support of the complain L single out irritant laxatives (ethical) from all of the other various types of laxatives in this instance , while in other submarkets , such as the antiang;nal drugs they make the c1aim that all the products are competitive since they are all ultimately designed to relieve the pain of an anginal attack despite the fact that Parke . Davis' nitroglycerin works in a substantial- ly different fashion than Warner- Lambert's nitrates. This is likewise true of the approach of counsel in support of the complaint in the thyroid preparations market. Consequently, it is conc1uded that irritant laxatives (ethical) is not a realistic submarket within which to attempt to judge this merger. 73. In any event , even if the irritant laxatives (ethical) is a proper submarket , the record would not support a market of substantially lessening competition. According to the evidence relied upon by counsel in support of the complaint , Warner- Lambert in I969 was ranked eighth in the industry with a 2. 8 percent market share , and Parke, Davis was seventh with a 3. 7 percent market share. The combined share would have given the merged firm a rank of sixth , an advance of only one position over Parke 1969 irritant primarily due to one product , Alophen , with sales of $932 000 (CX 202I). (34 J This product was described by counsel in support of the complaint' s expert witness as an obsolete product (Tr. 954- , 1393-94; ex 2002, 2004). Warner- Lambert's product Agoral was a combination product of irritant and emollient ingredients and did not have the principal characteristics attributed to irritant laxatives (Tr. 809- 951-54). It. is found that competition from oLher laxatives must be considered and this substantially reduces the position of Parke , Davis and Warner- Lambert in the industry with neither of them among the top 12 firms (RX 1726). Laxative products are relatively easy to formulate and many companif;s , large and small , are active in all segments of the laxative field. In 1969 , DKK reported sales by a total of 74 manufacturers in the ethical irritant category (CX 2021- 30). In 1969, DKK reported sales by 1751axaLive manufacturers , 125 of which were promoting ethical laxatives. 74. It is concluded , therefore , that the record will not support a848 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIO:; DECISIONS Initial Decision 87 F. finding of substantial lessening of competition in the irritant laxative (ethical) or any other laxative market as a result of the merger. 75. Prenatal Vitamins. Prenatal vitamins are vitamins formulated to meet the requirements of pregnant women , who require the same vitamins as other adults but in different quantities , therefore calling for a somewhat different formulation. Prenatal vitamins are an ethical submarket since the products are promoted to obstetricians who recommend them to their patients (Tr. 824- , 3420). Parke , Davis is an existing and leading competitor in the prenatal vitamins market aceounting for I4. 9 percent of the total market in 1969 (CX 2349). Its sales in 1969 were $2 I70000 and in 1970 , $2300000. 76. Warner- Lambert no longer makes prenatal vitamins. Its product was introduced in 1953 and only promoted until about 1960 because of its lack of marketing suecess. DKK fibrures show that sales of Warner- Lambert' s prenatal vitamins declined from $378 000 in 1958 to $54000 in I967 and 1708; 3421). Warner-Lambert sales in 1969 and 1970 were $46 000, accounting for 3 percent of the market in both these years. (35J 77. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that Warner- Lambert was capable of reformulating its prenatal vitamin from a six- tablet a day requirement to a once-a- day preparation and consequently Warner-Lambert not only was eliminated as an existing competitor by the acquisition but also was a strong potential competitor in this market. There is little in the record to support this argument since the market was not one 0i consistent and substantial growth and had little attraction to any firm ;;ot we11 established. This is indicated by the fact that in addition to Warner- Lambert, nine other companies left tbis market between 197I (Tr. 3488- 89; RX I705 , 1708). There are no high barriers to entry into this market other than getting your product recognized and prescribed by physicians. Prenatal vitamins are not novel or different from other types of vitamins of which there are more than 250 manufacturers (RX 1704- 07). 78. The record wi11 not support a finding that the merger here involved wil tend to substantia11y lessen competition in the prenatal vitamins market. 79. Antilrotics Useful Against Gram- Negative Bacilli. Gram-nega- tive bacilli are distinbruished from other infecting organisms by a combination of two characteristics: their rod- like shape and the pink color they stain in a common diabrrostic test (Tr. I232- , 2927-28). Gram-negative bacili include numerous organisms , and the infections they cause may be treated either by antibioties or by chemo- therapeutic agents , 812 Initial Decision antimicrobial agents active against gram-negative baeil1i are not active against al1 gram-negative baci1i and are not effective exclusive- ly against such bacil1i but may destroy gram-negative botb gram- positive and gram-negative organisms others , are considered to I3IO- , 2929-31; RX I, About twenty different antibiotics and chemo- therapeutic agents are active against for a specific gram-negative infection wi1l not be just anyone of the antibiotics active against one or more of the gram-negative baci1li; rather , selection of the proper antimicrobial agent requires consideration of many factors , including the seriousness of the patient' s condition , his medical history, the site of the infection , previous drug therapy, and the likcly etiological agent. Clinical impressions must be supplemented hy culture and sensitivity tests in order that the appropriate medication may be chosen (Tr. This is an extremely complicated market and much time was devoted to it during the course of tria1. The medical evidence is clear that the antibiotics of Parke , Davis may have a theoretical overlap with Warner- Lambert' s Coly- Mycin products in that some of Parke Davis ' products are useful against certain gram-negative infecting organisms against which Parke , Davis' polymyxins may also be usefu1.An authoritative document in the record , the Medical Letter Handbook of Antimicrobial Therapy, demonstrates that the use of alternative drugs is not carried out in practice. This letter (RX 1) demonstrates that for \" each pathological organism there is genera1ly one drug or occasiona1ly a comhination of drugs , that is likely to be a better choice than other drugs or drug combination. When the patient does not respond to a first-choice drug or cannot tolerate it , there is usually a preferred order of choice among alternative drugs. \" (RX 1, p. 8) The medical witnesses who testified agreed that this was the fact drug of first-choice and alternatives for the various infecting850 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIO:- DECISIONS Initial Decision 87 F. organisms of gram-negative nature , nowhere is it shown that Parke Davis or a Warner- Lambert drug was the drug of first-choice and any other drug of either of the two (37) companies was recommended as the drug of second , third or fourth choice. In three instances drugs of Warner-Lambert or Parke , Davis are listed as alternative drugs for the same infection , however , in each of these three instances the first of the two companies drugs was listed as the third , fourth or fifth in the order of preference. It therefore appears that the actual competition which existed at the time of the merger was at best minimal. 83. In any event , even if counsel in support of the complaint's submarket definition were adopted , the merger could have no adverse effect on competition. Parke , Davis ranked seventh in 1970 with a 5. percent market share of this market and Warner- Lambert ranked twelfth with an 0. 6 percent market share. Both companies had significant salcs losses in 1971. 84. There is no evidence that Warner- Lambert' s share of the market could possibly expand. Its Coly- Ylycin sales were declining and were in danger of being replaced by a new antibiotic awaiting FDA approval (Tr. 2935- , 3255, 3423- 34961316- 2949-52). Moreover in 1970, DKK reported 11 companies with a share greater than one percent and there were also 14 companies beside Warner- Lambert with shares of less than one percent who were important drug manufactur- ers (RX 1687- 93). 85. The record wil1 not support a finding that the merger of Parke Davis and Warner- Lambert will tend to substantial1y lessen competi- tion in the antibiotics useful against gram- negative bacil1i market as contended by counsel in support of the complaint. 86. A rapiillin. Ampicilin , a broad spectrum , semi-synthetic penicilJin, was patented by Beecbam , and is sold in the united States by Beecham and licensed by Beecham to Bristol Laboratories , Inc. and Bristol-Myers Co. (CX 2520). Bristol has , in turn, sublicensed Squibb- Beechnut and American Home Products ' Wyeth Division. In addition to Parke, Davis, which purchases ampicil1in from Bristol in finished dosage form , Ayerst Laboratories Division of American Home Products and Leder!e distribute ampicillin which they purchase in dosage form from Beecham (CX 2520). (38) A number of other companies also sell ampicillin (CX 2364; RX 1683- 84), apparently without license. The record reveals that the ampicilin patent has been attacked successfully and other manufacturers can now come in with impunity (Tr. 1739). Warner- Lambert has never marketed ampicillin. Respondent has admitted that ampicillin is a relevant product submarket but disputes counsel in support of the complaint' s conten-WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 851 812 lnitial Decision tion that Warner- Lambert was a legal1y or competitively significant potential entrant into the ampicil1in submarket. 87. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that Warner- Lambert was a potential entrant into the ampicillin submarket and that it was eliminated as a potential entrant as a result of its acquisition of Parke Davis. The sole basis for this argument is that in I968, Warner- Lambert approached Beecham to explore the possibility of obtaining licensing or marketing rig-his to one or more of Beecham antibiotics. After some discussions the matter was dropped. Beecham was not interested in the joint venture and Warner- Lambert had deeided that ampicil1in had become a generic product and not a specialty product of the type which Warner- Lambert marketed. In addition , there were a number of competitors in the ampicillin market making this a particularly unattractive market to Warner- Lambert. As a result Warner-Lambert discontinued any efforts to enter the ampicj1in submarket well in advance of ConsequenUy, there is no basis in the record for a finding that Warner- Lambert was eliminated as a potential entrant into the ampicillin submarket as a result of the merger and no finding of a tendency to substantial1y lessen competition in this market is warranted. 88. Anti- Pseudornona3 Drugs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a species of gram-negative bacteria (Tr. 1235 , 2489) which can cause relatively minor infections , such as swimmer s ear (Tr. 3422) or urinary tract infections (Tr. 3249), and also life- threatening infections in a compro- mised host , such as the severely burned or leukemic patient (Tr. 2489 1293). There are presently :Vlycin its otic preparation used for ear infections , such as \" s ear\" Parke a Chloromycetin ophthalmic preparation to which polymyxin B has been aooed in order to reach Pseudomonas infections of the eye (CX 2559- 60). 89. Counsel in support of the complaint contend that all orugs (including biologicals) active against Pseudomonas constitute the relevant product submarket.. At present such drugs are limitco to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents. They are included by counsel within the alleged submarkel whether formulated in injectable , oral or topical form. Counsel in support of the complaint claim the merger has eliminated potential competition in this submarket because Parke Davis is in the process of developing an anti- Pseudomonas vaccine for use in severely burned and cancer patients. Responoenl disputes852 FEDERAL TRADE Cm!MISSION DECISIONS Initial Decisipn 87 F. complaint counsel's submarket definition , and further contends that Parke, Davis was not a significant potential entrant , and, even if it were, the merger can have no substantial adverse effect on competi- tion in the so-ca11ed anti- Pseudomonas drugs submarket. 90. The products manufactured by Warner- Lambert and Parke Davis arc quite obviously altogether for different therapeutic applica- tions and there is no evidence in the record that the industry, DKK or the FDA or anyone clse has ever recognized this group of drugs as a separate economic entity. In any event , accepting this as a proper submarket , Warner- Lambert's share of the anti- Pseudomonas market in 1970 was 9.4 percent (down from 16. 9 percent in 1969) and Parke Davis' share was 0. 5 percent in 1970 (CX 2535). By 1971 Warner- Lambert's share fe11 to 6. 1 percent (RX 1776) since its products now competed against two new antibiotics active against Pseudomonas including gentamicin. The insignificance of Parke , Davis' share of this market makes it evident that the merger would have no tendency toward anticompetitive effects. 91. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that Parke , Davis had filed an application for a new drug which would be used as a vaccine for use in burn patients filed with the Division of Biologics Standards on June 29 , 1970 (Tr. 2473 , 2586). At the time of the hearings , this application was sti11 on file and it appeared dubious as to whether or not the application would ever be granted (Tr. 2604). This original application was limited to (40) claimed usefulness of the vaccine to burn injured patients. A new claim wil be made that the drug is efficacious for leukemia patients as we11 (Tr. 2479 2537-2554). The expert witness had serious reservations as to this vaccine s usefulness because of its marginal and transient protection and severe side effects the application is approved by the Bureau of Biologics (successor to the Division of Biologics Standards), there would be no measurable effect on antibiotics usage or the use of Warner- Lambert s antibiotics since each product is designed for a specific purpose and would not result in the elimination of any of the products. 92. The record wi11 not support a finding that the merger wil tend toward any substantial lessening of competition in the anti- Pseudomo- nas drugs serum globuJin and tetanus immune each admitted to be relevant product submarkets, Parke , Davis produces and se11s each of these products as generic , commodity products to hospitals and emergency rooms. Warner-Lambert does not produce or se11 these or any otber bloodWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 812 Initial Decision fractions. Counsel in support of the complaint acknowledge that therapeutic blood fractionation is a very elaborate process requiring unique facilities , a qualified staff and a Federal license. Although Warner-Lambert possessed none of these prerequisites , counsel in support of the complaint nevertheless , rest their case on the claim that Warner-Lambert was an imminent and desirable entrant. The evidence establishes , however , that Warner- Lambert was not perceived as a potential entrant (Tr. 3001- 02); that it never considered producing therapeutic blood fractions (Tr. 3435- 3439, 3374-76); that it had neither relevant experience capability nor incentive to become a significant entrant into this Warner- Lambert's General Diagnostics Division produces certain diagnostic blood products that are used as controls in hospitals and clinical laboratories does not make it a potential entrant into any of the blood fraction markets here involved (Tr. 3552- 3561- 62). (41) 95. Eli7.abeth Biochemicals , which was acquired by Warner- Lambert in 1969 (CX 284I), has conducted a clinical laboratory and operated blood donation centers (CX 2844). It currently has only one blood center which collects plasma from immunized donors for one of the products involved in this case , tetanus immune globulin. It docs not, however , have a license to manufacture this product (Tr. 3562- 63). Warner-Lambcrt's ownership of Elizabeth Biochemicals did not make it a Jikely potential into human blood fractionating since an owned blood supply has not proved to be advantageous to blood fractionaters (Yr. 3549, 3551, 3555). Parke , Davis has ncver owned any blood supply. Moreover , half of Parke , Davis' raw material supply is secured not from blood centers but from placenta purcbased from bospital delivery rooms (Tr. 3550- 51). Two fractionaters wbo presently own blood banks , Squibb and Merck , arc trying to dispose of them (Tr. 3551 3556). 96. Counsel in support of the complaint urge that Warner- Lambert was a substantial potential entrant into the blood fractionating business since it held a meeting with Squibb in 1969 to ascertain whether Squibb would be interested in a joint R&D program directed at developing blood specialty products which Squibh would manufac- ture for Warner- Lam bert's distribution (CX Yr. 3462). This could well have resulted in Warner- Lambert selling some of the products here involved. It is clear , however , that Warner- Lambert was interested not so much in the blood fractionating business but was interested in developing some joint R&D program directed at future new products. This single meeting with Squibb did not make Warner-FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIOK DECISIONS Initial Decision 87 F. Lambert a likely significant potential entrant into the blood of Warner- Lambert had a single meeting with the president of Cutter Laboratories in April of 1969 to discuss in a verypreliminary manner whether or not Cutter would be interested in selling out to Warner- Lambert (Tr. 2995- 3010). While Cutter is engaged in the blood fractionating business , this single breakfast meeting cannot be construed to mean that Warner- Lambert was interested in entering the blood fraction business.

The record will not support a finding that Warner- Lambert was a potential entrant into the three submarkets here involved or thatthe acquisition of Parke , Davis may be to substantially lessen competition in these submarkets. C01\"CLUSIO?\\S 1. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter involved in this proceeding. 2. The entire United States is the appropriate geographic market or \"section of the country, \" within which to consider the effect on competition of tbe merger between Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis & Company, a corporation , in this case. 3. The drug manufacturing industry and the ethical drug segment of that industry are each appropriate lines of commerce within which to consider the alleged anticompetitive effect of the merger between Warner-Lamhert Company and Parke , Davis & Company. 4. It is concluded that the record does not demonstrate that the challenged merger may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in the drug manufacturing industry or the ethical drug segment of that industry. and the merger , therefore , doesnot violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act with respect thereto. 5. The following constitute appropriate lines of commerce within which to consider the alleged anti competitive effects of the challenged merger: (1) oral decongestants (2) cough drops and lozenges (3) cold remedies (4) antihistamines (5) antacids (6) emollient/protective dermatological preparations promoted urinary antibacterials (10) human albumin (12) immune serum globulin (13) tetanus immune globulin6. It is concluded that the merger is not likely to suhstantialJy lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any of the foregoing lines of commerce , and the merger , therefore , docs not violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act with respect thereto.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 855 812 I nitia!

These sales ($143. 5 million) represented some 3. 1 percent of the overall domestic drug market and made Warner- Lambert thetwelfth largest seller in thc industry for that year. Warner- Lambert had domestic ethical drug sales of approximately $87.3 million in 1969. It ranked fifteenth in ethical sales , with a 2. 3 percent share of the market in that year. Most of these drug sales were made by Warner- Lambert's Warner- Chilcott division , the successor of a firm acquired by Warner- Lambert in I952. Proprietary drug sales by Warner- Lambert amounted to $56. 2 milion in I969. In I970 Warner- Lambert spent some $126 million for domestic advertising (television , newspapers , periodicals , etc.), making it the single largest drug and cosmetic advertiser in the country and the fifth largest among all advertisers. Warner- Lambert's promotional activi- ties have helped place many of its products among the dominant sellers in their respective markets. Several of Warner- Lambert' s brand nameshave literally become household words , such as Listerine , Bromo Seltzer, Anahist, Smith Brothers Cough Drops , and Rolaids. Although there is no evidence that Warner- Lambert's ethical drug management follows the lead of its consumer product management in promotional strategy, some similarity in the marketing efforts of the two is nonetheless apparent. L:nlike many ethical drug sellers (including Parke , Davis), Warner- Lambert sells only trade-named ethical drugs. Such drugs are not sold on the basis of the generic , or underlying (4J chemical , names which competitors may also use. Instead , they are sold under unique trade names promoted through personaJ solicitation of doctors by trained \" dctaiJ\" representatives direct mail contact and advertising in professional journals. Warner- Lambert's management refers to its branded ethical promotional stratcgy as a \" specialty \" approach (Tr. 3375 , CX leT)). THE ACQuIRED COMPAJ\"Y Parke , Davis is an old , well-estab1ished pharmaceutical products company. It operates throughout the world and produced total sales of $273.5 million in 1969 , of which domestic drug sales represented approximately 40 percent. Parke , Davis has empha3ized ethical pharmaceutical products and , as a result , its proprietary sales arc minimal. In 1969 Parke , Davis ' ethical drug sales of $109. 5 million Warner-Lambert s other supp:i\u20ac., athletic products, . upport hose , nutritional and veterinary products and chemicals. Thege acunte for approximately $160 million in s!lle862 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. placed it in eleventh position among ethical drug sellers with a 2. percent market share (CX 873). Its proprietary drug sales amounted to $3.4 milion In overall drug sales , Parke, Davis' $112.9 milion in sales in 1969 constituted a 2.42 percent market share and ranked it fourteenth in the industry (CX 877). The firm manufactured and sold both trade-named and generic drug products. \\Vhereas Warner- Lambert's markct strength was probably most notable in proprietary drugs, Parke, Davis focused almost exclusively on the sale of ethical products. In addition to detailing specialty brand name items to physicians , Parke , Davis also sold generic drugs as commodities to hospitals and retail pharmacies. (5 J Parke , Davis showed mixed financial returns for a several year period preeeding the acquisition. While profitable throughout the I960', the eompany s performance worsened after I966 , the year the patent expired on its antibiotie , Chloromycetin. The drug had also received bad publicity as a result of certain fatal side effects. In 1965 Chloromycetin had accounted for about 30 percent of all Parke , Davis sales (CX 3707). By 1967 , Parke, Davis faced stiff competition from producers of generic Chloromycetin (choramphenicol) and reduced its prices 33 percent across the board. Between I965 and 1970 , Parke Davis' profits had fallen by 50 percent and it had been unable to develop any new high- profit making drug to take the place of Chloromycetin. It appears that at least part of Parke , Davis' problem related to management and marketing. By the time of the merger , Parke, Davis had fallen from its former leading position in the pharmaceutical industry. In terms of sales Parke, Davis had ranked second in I950 and as recently as 1960 was in third place among all manufacturers of ethical drugs. In 1969 , the year hefore the merger , it ranked eleventh in ethical drugs and fifteenth in all drugs. Its board of directors had reduced dividends from $1.45 in 1965 to $1 in 1967 and to $0. 60 in 1970. On the other hand , Parke, Davis was certainly not a failing company. It has never had an unprofitable year. By I968 , the sales of Chloromycetin already had been reduced to a considerably smaller share of total sales than they had been in I966 , and sales of the remainder of Parke , Davis' product line were increasing at an annual rate in excess of IO percent (CX 3707). By the time Parke , Davis was acquired in I970 by Warner- Lamhert, stockholder investment had risen to $2I6 million and the company had no outstanding long- term debt. , A a:ready rnn no , inve.t huge and develop iI wide d: tributian t\u20acm inciuding foo stores in order 3576-79)W ARER-LA)!BERT CO. 863 812 Opinion However, a decrease in the price of Parke , Davis' stock from $24. , its 1969 low, to a low of $13 in ear1y 1970 made that company an obviously attractive acquisition candidate. THE ACQUISITIO;- According to the testimony of Mr. Stuart Hensley, who became President of Warner- Lambert in 1967 , Warner- Lambert s manage- ment had become concerned about the company s ethical drug division Warner-Chilcott. Its growth rate was considerab1y behind the rest of the industry, its products were antiquated , lacked uniqueness and patent protection and \" with the advent of increasing generic types of products, appeared to be quite vulnerab1e \" (Tc. 2640). It had spent $6 to $IO mil1ion annual1y on R&D since 1961 or 1962 without producing any new chemical entity. By 1969 , according (61 to Hensley, it had become clear that Warner- Lambert needed to find \" a partner that would broaden our base and give us a better opportunity of more produet lines in which to do research , increasing our opportunity for discovery of new drug entities , land) that we were likely to be faced with curtailing the basic research of Warner- Chilcott, maybe even cutting it out * * * \" and maintaining only a development group (Tr. 264-43). To Warner- Lam bert' management , Parke , Davis possessed the attributes to be a partner that would broaden Warner- Chilcott' research base and would result in substantial savings in international operations (Tr. 2643-4 , CX 912- 1\"). 1\"ol1owing a review and its recent earnings problem , Warner- Lambert officials believed that the company s performance had largely been due to management shortcomings , outmoded marketing and poor coordination between marketing and R&D (Tr. 2645 , 3085, 3572- , 3676). After preliminary Warner- Lambert offered on July 30 , 1970, to buy a11 Parke , Davis' stock in return for 6 600000 shares of Warner- Lambert common stock. The Parke , Davis board of directors voted to accept the offer , rejecting a competing Revlon Company offer , and the transaction was completed on :\\ovember I3 I970. ALLEGED RJ:. EVANT IvRKYTS The complaint alleges that the acquisition in question substantially lessened competition in drug manufacturing general1y and the ethica1 segment. Respondent does not dispute the propriety of using an overall drug manufacturing market and an \" ethical drugs \" market for purposes of this case. In addition comp1aint counsel argue that twenty therapeutic end-use \" submarkets \" suffered a loss of actual or potential864 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIO DECISIO Opinion 87 F. competition because of the acquisition. The existence of thirteen of these subsidiary markets is not contested by respondent. These markets are: (1) oral decongestants (2) cough drops and lozenges (3) cold remedies (4) antihistamines (5) antacids (6) emo1lent/protective dermatological preparations promoted ampicillin non-sulfa antibacterials mouthwash albumin (12) immune serum globulin (I3) tetanus immune globulin (7) Complaint counsel failed to convince the administrative law judge that the remaining seven markets also exist as separate markets. These markets are: (I) thyroid preparations (2) anti-anginal drugs (3) cough remedies (4) bronchial dilators (5) irritant laxatives promoted ethica1Jy (6) antibiotics useful against b'Tam-negative bacil1i (7) anti-pseudomonas drugs There is ai,'Teement between the parties that as to a1J asserted markets and submarkets , the nation as a whole is the appropriate geographic market or \" section of the country. \" Although the complaint charged that among the asserted submarkets the merger would eliminate substantial existing competition in only five therapeutic submarkets , complaint counsel now claim there are eight such submarkets: thyroid preparations , cough remedies , cold and anti-anginal drugs. The remaining twelve submarkets involve contentions that Warner- Lambert or Parke , Davis was eliminated as a significant potential competitor because it was contemplating entry or already had a toehold position in a market where the other was a leading firm. The administrative law judge dismissed a1Jegations of anticompeti- tive effects with respect to al1 the markets and submarkets. OurWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 865 812 Opinion examination of the record leads us to conclude that a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act has been demonstrated with respect five submarkets: thyroid preparations , cough remedies , cough drops and lozenges (actually a further submarket of the cough remedies submarket), normal serum albumin , and tetanus immune globulin. We find no violation with respect to the other asserted markets and submarkets. In addition to vacating the findings of the initial decision with respect to the submarkets where we have found violations , we are vacating the entire initial decision and substituting our own findings with respect to the remaining markets as well. We do so in order to set forth with specificity the factual underpinnings of our decision since with respect to several submarkets the ALJ did not enter extensive finding-so We will first turn to the two principal markets in this case , overall drug manufacturing and its ethical drug- segment , and then take up the allegations with respect to the twenty submarkets. (8) 1. DRCG MAl\\lJFACTURJNG A;-D ITS ETHICAL SECTOR Preliminary Observations The compJaint in this matter alleges that the acquisition in issue may substantially lessen competition in drug manufacturing generally and in the ethical segment thereof. \" EthicaJ drugs \" are understood to be pharmaceuti. al products for which a doctor s prescription is required or which, although sold without a prescription , are primarily promoted to the medical profession and pharmacists. Ethical drugs , together with \" proprietary drugs \" (drug- products advertised directly to the public and sold without need of a prescription), constitute all of the drug manufacturing market. In its answer to the complaint fiied October 15 , 197I, respondent denied that either drug manufacturing in general or ethical drugs constituted appropriate \" product markets \" or \"lines of commerce. However , on June 19 , 1972, in an amendment to its answer , respondent withdrew this denial.8 At the outset we should note some reservation on our part accepting the manufacture of \" all drugs \" and \"all ethical drugs \" as constituting- product markets for this case. As so defined , these markets include literally thousands of separate , noncompeting phar- maceutical products. :Iouthwashes arc not substitutes for \" In itB brief on appel , reI-()rl!cnt chanlcteriZ\u20ac8 the withdrawal originai at LeatarrJnd the (Ans.

What evidence is in the record at most suggests the existence of an \" a1l ethical drugs \" market hased on commonality of production and distribution techniques - in other words , a market defined in t.rms of interchangeable supply factors. 9 But the promotional ski1ls needed to (9 J advertise successfu1ly and distribute efficiently proprietary drugs to the public are substantially different from those used in promoting ethical drugs to the medical profession. Also , the resources needed to develop and manufacture a product such as new mouthwash are different than those required in the development of new Jife-saving antibiotics. As noted supra , Parke, Davis considered but aban- doned attempts to break into the proprietary field. Eli Lily, which for years has been the leading se1ler of ethical drugs, ranked only I24th in proprietary drugs in 1969 (Comm. Find. 34). Conversely, SterJing Drug which was ranked first in proprietary drug sales that year ranked only 17th in the ethical market (id.

Prior cases striking down horizontal mergers have emphasized the degree of market concentration and the merging firms ' shares. Statistics reflecting the shares of the market controlled by the industry leaders and the parties to the merger are ' , , the primary index of market power.' , ,,, Brown Sho Co. v. United Staws , 870 S. 294, 822, n.88 (1962). The assumption and primary concern is that undue concentration will enhance the opportunity of market leaders to engage in interdependent rather than competitive practices and thereby to control and regulate prices. Although various therapeutic end-use markets (denominated \" submarkets \" in this case) arc highly concentrated , with respect to aggregate drug and ethical pharmaceuti- cal sales there is little douht that concentration is not at a high level. Stipulated DKK market share data!O establishes that four- and eight- firm concentration in the two broad markets in 1969 as are well below the fOllr- firm concen- tration ratio of 31 percent and eight- firm concentration ratio of 48 percent which the Commission in the Sterling Drug case found to be 10 Davee, Koehlein. and Ke3ting statistics were stip\\;lated by the parties tD be aCCl'raUC and reliable for purps of this r.ase (Comm.

Uniwd Brands Co. e. Dkt. No. 8835 (May 14 , 1974), slip opinion at 2I & n. 15r83 F. 16I4 at I709). The administrative law judge in this case was fully justified, therefore , in finding that the record did not support a finding that the overall markets arc characterized by substantial concentration (I.D.30). (I2) )/or has the merger of Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis materially changed the picture. In I969 , the year before the merger Parke, Davis ranked 15th in the overall drug market with a market share of only 2.42 percent while Warner- Lambert ranked I2th with a 10 percent market share. In the same year , Parke, Davis stood 11th in the ethical market , with 2.90 percent , and Warner- Lambert was 15th with 2.3I percent of that market (Comm. Find. 34). Plainly, this merger did not produce \" a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market\" and resulting in \" significant increase in * * * concentration \" held to he prma facie unlawful in Uniwd States v. Philadelphia Nat'wnal Bank 374 t:.S. 321 363 (I963) and later cases. By summing Warner- Lambert', and Parke Davis ' I969 market shares to arrive at a pro forma projection of the merger s effect on concentration , the merger would add about two percentage points to eight- firm concentration in the overall drug market and about one percentage point to eight firm concentration in the ethical drug market. )/0 chang-e would be noticed at the four- firm leve1. In fact , the stipulated market data showed that by I97I , the first full year after the merger , due to countervailing trends in the market actual eig-ht firm concentration was slightly less than it was before the merger in ethical drugs and the increases in other concentration ratios were barely perceptible: 1969 1970 The same data show that in I971 the merged firm ranked 4th in the overall drug market , with 5.27 percent of sales , and 5th in the ethical drug market with a 4. 81 percent market sharel1 In all other cases where effects on concentration were cited as \" By citi!1g 1971 data , we are not suggesting thal he presence of post-merger market share dBta is necs.nry in merger caes.

In Philadelphia National Bank , suprathe merger created a bank having at least 30 percent of the market. In United States v. Al.ttminum Co. 377 U. S. 271(1964), the first two firms had over 50 percent (13 J of the market. In United States v. Contirwnwl Can Co. 378 U.S. 44I (1964) the six largest firms had 70 percent of the market. In Swnley Works v. Federal Trade Commission 469 F. 2d 498 (1972), the four- firm ratio was approximately 50 percent. In Beatrie Foods Co. C. Dkt. 8864 (July I , 1975) (86 F. C. 1J the four- firm ratio was over 40 percent- and climbing- in one market and over 50 percent in another market. In the absence of such concentrated markets , other factors such as a clear trend toward concentration substantially augmented by the merger were present. See Bro'Wn Siwe Co. v. United States , sY.pm 370 U. S. at 345; United Swtes v. Von Grocery Co. 384 V.S. 270, 274 , 277 (I966); and United States v. Pabst Bre'Wing Co. 384 U. S. 546 , 551 (1966) (local markets also highly concentrated). Complaint counsel argue that the drug industry is almost a \" loose oligopoly\" as defined in Kaysen & Turner A ntitmst Pol'u:y (1959), and point out that tbis definition was cited with approval by the Commission in Kenrwcott Copper Corp. 78 r. C. 744, 922 (197I). According to Kaysen and Turner, \" a loose oligopoly \" is \" a small number (less tban twenty) of firms supplying 75 percent of tbe market witb no one supplJ ng more tban 1O- I5 percent and a fringe of smalJer firms supplying the rest.\" Id. at 922, n. 12. The DKK data indicate that the top 20 selJers possessed approximately 70 percent of sales in overalJ drugs and 75 percent of ethical drug sales (Comm. Find. 39 , Table VIII). But complaint counsel fail to observe that in KenrlRcott the Commission recognized that a \" loose oligopoly \" as defined by Kaysen and Turner was not a critical level of concentration.!2 Tbe Commission found decisive in that case the fact that there was (I) a rapid growth trend among the leading firms outpacing tbe rest of the industry and (2) entry barriers already high were becoming more formidable indicating \" that the industry is on the way to becoming highly concentrated\" 78 F.

In view of this rapid trend , the Commission held that it \" cannot stay its hand until the industry has in fact been transformed into a tight oligopoly, id. at 922.

Court of Appeals characterized this trend as a \" phenomenal dispropor- tionate growth\" among the top firms. Kenrwcott Coper v. Federal Trad Commisswn 467 F. 2d 67 73 (10th Cir. 1972). (I4J In the overal1 drug markets , no such disproportionate growth among the top firms has occurred threatening to raise concentration levels to critical heights. What in fact has happened is that fol1owing World War II , medium-sized firms have grown far more rapidly than the industry leaders. According to Census data , companies in the 9- size group increased their market share of total shipments from 20 percent in 1947 to 33 percent in I967 (the latest year prior to the merger in which Census data is available), whereas the share of the four largest firms declined and the next four remained fairly constant (CX 727). Furthermore , the tables based on stipulated DKK data depicting the gains and losses in market rank and shares during the period from 1957 through 1971 for identified firms show that many leading firms have not been able to maintain their position in the markets. (Comm. Find. , Table I). With respect to the ethical line , the top four companies col1ectively accounted for 29. 07 percent of sales in 1957. By 1969 , the col1ective share of these former leaders had shrunk by nearly one- third to 20.74 percent. The same is true for the al1 drug line , with the 26. percent col1ective share of the four I957 leaders having dropped to 18.42 percent by I969. Moreover , without exception , each of the top eight ethical drug manufacturers in 1957 lost market share during the succeeding years. Parke , Davis is an example of a once leading firm that was unable to maintain its market share and rank. In 1971 , the year after the merger , the Warner- Lambert/Parke , Davis combined ethical drug share was 4. 81 percent which is less than Parke , Davis alone accounted for ten years earlier (RX 1863 Revised). In addition to conventional concentration ratios , the degree of asymmetry in size among leading firms is another factor which economists consider in assessing the competitive structure of markets. A given level of concentration measured by aggregate market shares held by top firms may portend different market conditions depending upon whether firms within the grouping are relatively equal or quite disparate in size , with equality of size evidencing a more favorable climate for competition. Scherer , Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance , 5I-52 (1970); Mann, \" Asymmetry, Barriers to Entry and Rates of Return in 26 Concentrated Industries \" 8 Western Economic Journal 86 (I970). Here , the evidence shows a high degree of size uniformity. Looking at the ethical market in 1969 , no firm had as much as a 7. 5 percent share of the market; the difference between the first and the eight ranked firms was only about three percentageWAR!(ER- LAMBERT CO. 871 812 Opinion points. Moreover , there is no sharp drop-off after the top eight , but rather a gradual tapering down in firm size so that the twentieth firm is still significant (Comm. Find. 22 & 34). (15 J Furthermore there has been no significant trend toward concentration in either the ethical drug or the all drug lines of commerce. As we observed in SteTz,:ng Drag, SUpTa 80 F. C. at 597 The 4- firm concentration (based on value of shipments) in a1l pharmaceuticals (SIC 2834) for I966 was 24 percent , a decline from the I958 figure of 27 percent. Similar decline occurred between I958 and I966 in the 8- firm concentration ratio' , , . \" Data for more recent years does not substantia1ly alter the picture. In I970, four-firm concentration was 26 percent in all pharmaceuti- cals (SIC 2834) and eight- firm concentration was 43 percent , both figures remaining below 1958 Jeve1s. Similarly in \" Biol06rical Products (SIC 2831) four- firm concentration dropped from 44 percent in 1958 to 37 percent in 1970.

Although concentration levels have resulted in a net increase between 1963 and 1970, the increase has not been substantial. As indicated in the foregoing table , Icss than two percentage points separates the I963 and 1970 concentration levels as calculated from DKK data. Census tabulation for 4-and 8- firm concentration ratios between 1963 and 1970 show a slightly more upward trend. Considering the picture presented by both DKK and Census data , the average rise was about two percentage points- not sufficient in our opinion to amount to a likelihood that in the foreseeable future concentration levels will reach a level which the Commission has heretofore considered unduly high. (See cases cited supra pp. 12-13). Complaint counsel argue that a type of \" concentration trend\" is evidenced by the fact that Census shows that the number of separate enterprises in the drug manufacturing industry declined from I214 in I954 to 910 in I967 and to 738 by 1972.

It is we11 known that in the drug industry there are a Jarge number of fringe \" repacka\"ring houses \" often contro11ed by physicians , that buy generic drugs from lowest-cost sources and rese11 them under their own brand names at much higher prices- frequently above prices charged by leading firms in thc industry.17 Many of the existing firms may come from this group which provides no competi- tion. Complaint counsel themselves conceded below \" virtua11y a11 the Census exits must have come from the ranks of small companies \" and that such \" decline in the population of sma11 competitors \" would not be of competitive significance to an economist \" (CPF 36). Indeed their economist-witness , Dr. Schifrin , testified that he did not find any competitive significance in the drop in the number of drug firms standing alone. (Tr. 2201 , 2373). The size of the fringe firms in the industry is indicated by the fact that DKK data for I968- 1969 shows that the 791st ranked firm had sales of only $16 000. We reject the argument that this \" depopulation \" trend has any significance for purposes of this case. Other objective measurements of industry position confirm the relatively low rank of the two companies. This evidence consists of a series of nonsales measurements of industry position in various categories of promotional activity and researcb expenditures.

Complaint counsel argue that the loss of independence of a large firm like Parke , Davis in itself is likely to Jessen competition in the drug field quite apart from any measurements of effects on concentration. The loss may be permanent , it is argued , by the fact there are substantial barriers to new entry 18 (Comm. Find. 29 & 30) that make it unlikely a new firm wi1 arise in the foreseeable future to take Parke , Davis' place. Although Parke , Davis and Warner- Lambert are substantial companies in absolute terms and leading companies in a number of product lines , the overa11 drug and ethical drug markets arc defined so broadly that there are no industry-wide dominant firms such as we find in automobiles , computers , or many other industries. Instead, the bulk of these two broadly defined markets arc shared by 20 or more large , well-established firms with a number of smaller , but viable firms. We know of no economic theory that suggests that the reduction by one out of such a large number of competitors constitutes substantial lessening of competition. The cases cited by complaint counsel on this point are readily distinguishable as concentration was higher making loss of one firm much more critical. Crown ZeliRrbah Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission (20) 296 F. 2d 800 (9th Cir. 1961) involved a merger between the largest firm in the market (51. percent) with the third Jargest firm (11 percent) in an industry with only four firms of any size 296 F. 2d at 8I8. Fruehauf TraiiRr Co. F.

Clearly, the instant merger, which involves firms ranking 15th and 12th with 2.42 percent of 3.IO percent market shares in the overall drug market and similar shares in the ethical market is not comparable to those in the cited cases.

Br. 27 28). They contend that concentration levels in individual product lines are considerably higher , ranging typica11y from 70 percent to 90 percent for the top eight se11ers. But this simply suggests that the overa11 drug and ethical drug markets are too broadly defined to be useful for purposes of analyzing the competitive effects of this merger. Complaint counsel cannot have it both ways. They cannot posit a market defined in terms of supply fJexibility to indude the output of non-suhstitutable drugs of both of the merging firms , characterize the merger in that market as entirely \" horizontal \" hut then when measuring the degree of concentration ignore portions of the output of other firms doing business in that same market. The extent to which this merger had effeets on concentration levels in therapeutic end-use product markets should be considered only in conjunction with claims of Section 7 i11egality in the 20 submarkets in issue. To that subject we now turn. (21) II. THERAPEUTIC SCBMARKETS Thyroid Preparations Individuals who are unable to secrete enough thyroid hormone to regulate adequately their bodies ' metabolism must consume thyroid preparations to compensate for the shortage. This affiction , ca11ed hypothyroidism , can be remedied by the ingestion of either natural thyroid hormone , which is cleaned and desiccated hog or cow thyroid or synthetic thyroid hormone , made by chemical synthesis. Parke, Davis sells two natural thyroid products, \" Thyroid lJSP,\" a generic product that meets the standards for dosage strength and processing set by the United States Pharmacopoeia , and \"Thyroid Strong,\" a1so a generic product which is 50 percent more potent than Thyroid USP. Warner- Lambert also produces two thyroid hormones both trade-named. They arc \" !'roloid,\" a natural hormune , which differs from Parke , Davis' product in that it is derived only from hog thyroid and is ' '\\vashed'' more in order to remove more extraneous materials , and \"Euthroid \" a synthetic hormonE , combining in a carefullv measured amount the two ingredients basic to a11 natural hormon , T-3 and T- , which are frequent1y found in irreguJar quantities in their natural state.876 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. Despite their differences , it is apparent that a1J thyroid hormones are administered and used in substantia1Jy the same manner on nearly a1J hypothyroid patients to bring them up to normal (euthyroid) condition. See Comm. Find. 48- 49. Complaint counsel urge that all thyroid preparations , including both branded and unbranded products , comprise a single line of commerce for Section 7 purposes. The administrative law judge , agreeing with respondent' s contentions , found that unbranded and branded thyroid preparations compete in separate economic markets on the grounds that \"there are substantial differences in the way the two companies products are manufactured , the customers and methods used in se1Jing their products , the way they are priced , and since they arc sold only on prescription of a physician , the way they are dispensed to the ultimate user\" (J.D. 48). We agree with complaint counsel that the ALJ erred in concluding that there is not a single thyroid market. Clearly the factors cited by the ALJ may be relevant in determining whether different thyroid preparations may be separated into different submarkets , but they do (22 J not compel a division into separate lines of commerce if the products arc functiona1Jy inter- changeable to a significant degree. \" The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use orthe cross-elasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.\" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States 370 U.S. 294, 325 (1962). See also United States v. ContincntJ:1 Can Co., 378 U. S. 441 (1964). Respondent argues , however , that the different ways that unbrand- ed and branded thyroids are dispensed to the ultimate use- makes therapeuti1 interchangeability irrelevant. It argues that individual physicians do not prescribe branded and unbranded thyroid inter- changeably for patients; that physicians arc fixed in their prescribing habits and do not abandon a product with which they have gained experience in favor of another. Respondent also contends , and the ALJ found , as Parke , Davis ) are commodity \" products sold to the pharmaJ:ist on a price basis , since prescriptions for USP thyroids generally do not specify a particular manufacturer s product. On the other hand , branded products (such as Warner-Lambert s Proloid and Euthroid) are promoted to the physi- cian in an attempt to secure his specification of their brand name for thyroid prescriptions. Thus , it is argued that sales of branded and unbranded thyroid products are insulated from each other. In support respondent cites testimony that the prices of branded products have not been a factor in manufacturers ' pricing of unbranded thyroid products , and vice versa. It also notes that the price of ProloidWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 877 812 Opinion (Warner-Lambert's branded naturaJ thyroid) is approximately twice that of USP thyroid , while the synthetic products are approximately four times the price of the USP thyroid. The retaiJ price of a USP thyroid tablet is approximately one to two cents Although there may be lack of price elasticity between branded and unbranded products at existing prices levels , we cannot assume that all physicians are so fixed in their prescribing habits that a substantial increase in the existing price differential between branded and unbranded tbyroids would never cause some shift toward more prescriptions of (23) the Jower- priced USP thyroids. Warner- Lambert' own advertisement to 9IO) assumes that prescribing habits are not immutable as it stresses the \" smoothness \" with which patients may be converted to its branded synthetic from other natural or synthetic thyroid preparations , whether branded or unbranded. Also, we can take notice that some physicians , even if a minority, are conscious of price differences between generic and branded versions of the same or similar preparations since a substantial number wil prescribe generic drugs despite promotions of branded varieties. We see no reason to beJieve that price would never enter into some physicians ' decisions in the area of thyroid medication. It is not necessary that two products batte inch for inch on the same turf in order for them to be in the same market. L. G. Balfrrr Co. v. FedEral Trade Commission 442 F. 2d 1, IO-I I (7th Cir. I971). We therefore reject respondent s contention that branded and unbranded thyroid preparations must be pJaced in separate product markets. This conclusion is consistent with the practices of the industrys leading market researcher (DKK) which furnishes data on these products to drug company clients under a single classification called \" thyroid preparations \" without a breakdown between branded and unbranded varieties. Respondent' s own documents in the record treat \" thyroid preparations \" as a single economic market (CX 912G 3663-64). As indicated in Table IX of our Findings , the top four suppJiers of this $20 millon market accounted for about 80 percent of sales in 1969 and 82 percent in I970 , measured in dollars. Warner- Lambert' s share was approximately 20 percent , placing it second in the market in I969 and third in I970. Parke , Davis' share was approximately 4. 5 percent placing it fifth in the market. However , it is ohvious that Parke , Davis share of the market is understated since its thyroid products were sold at prices one- half to one- fourth the price of Warner- Lambert' '\" require3 medicatiol1 01111 hasi3 the price differcntialg of rxmtinually take the medicatiDn878 FEDERAL TRADE COMCIISSIO:- DECISIO Opinion 87 F. branded thyroid preparations of equivalent dosage form. The other market leaders also sold branded products. Based on unit sales therefore, Parke Davis ' market share would have been much hig-her. Nevertheless , even using dollar sales as the sole criterion , the acquisition made Warner- Lambert the number one (24) sel1er and substantial1y increased four- firm concentration from 82.4 percent to 87 percent. This increase in an already high level of concentration amounts to a suhstantial lessening of competition. The high level of concentration and the substantial market shares involved outweigh any countervailing considerations based on the fact that Warner- Lambert's thyroid products are specialty products sold at a different price level than Parke , Davis' USP product and that entry barriers may not be as high in this submarkct as other therapeutic submarkets involved in this case. The continued presence of Parke , Davis' product in the hands of an independent marketer is important to assure prescribing physicians the choice of Parke , Davis' lower- priced product. Even if the identity of the l;SP thyroid prescribed for a patient is unknown to the doctor , Parke, Davis as an independent competitor may have contributed to keeping the price of USP thyroid lower than it might have been. We find , therefore , that the assimilation of Parke Davis into Warner- Lambert has violated Section 7 in this product market. Cough Remedies Cough remedies come in different forms- liquid syrups , tablets and capsules, and cough drops and lozenges- and are marketed in different ways. Some cough remedies are advertised directly to consumers and are sold as proprietary items. Others are also sold over the counter , but if promoted at al1 by brand name , are promoted mainly to physicians ethical OTC\" cough remedies). Another group are available only by prescription of a physician. Cough remedy sales altogether are quite large, exceeding $200 mj1ion in 1969. Most of Warner- Lamberts cough remedy products are proprietary cough drops or lozenges. These include Smith Brothers Cough Drops Hall's Mentho- Lyptus Cougb Tablets , Listerine Throat Lozenges (which although promoted for relief of sore throats is conceded by Warner- Lambert to be classifiable also as a cough remedy) and Listerine Cough Control Lozenges. Parke , Davis markets syrups , branded cough syrups and \" Parke, Davis' Medicated Throat Discs \" which is sold over the counter next to higher- priced cough lozenges. Unlike its position with respect to the thyroid preparation market respondent does not argue that cough remedies of any particular formWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 879 812 Opinion must be divided into separate \" branded\" (25 J and \"unbranded\" markets. Rather its contention here is that an cough drops and lozenges constitute a market separate from an cough syrups. The administrative law judge agreed , pointing inter alia to the fact that cough drops and lozenges \" arc asserted as one of the twenty submarkcts which compJaint counsel argue has been adversely affected as a result of the merger (J.D. 27). We reach a contrary conclusion. The fact that a grouping of products may constitute a submarket is not dispositive of the question whether they may be a part of a broader market. United States v. Greater Buffalo Press 402 U.S. 549, 552- 53 (197I); United States v. PhiUipsburg National Bank 399 U.S. 350, 359- 60 (1970); United States v. GrnneU Corp.384 t:. S. 563 (1966); United States v. Aluminum Co. of Arrrua 377 U.S. 271, 276- 77 (1964). Also the fact that there may be substantial physical differences in the products does not prevent them from being grouped in one product market if there is a significant degree of overlap in their usage. Unit d States v. Continental Can Company, 378 S. 44I (I964) (glass containers and metal containers grouped together in one market); Beah-ice Foods Co. C. Dkt. 8864 , July 1 I975 (86 F. C. 1J (paint brushes and paint rollers found to constitute a single market). It may wen be , as respondent contends , that drops and Jozenges arc most often used for minor coughs and that physicians rarely recommend a cough drop or lozenge but are more Jikely to prescribe a 1iquid or tablet preparation. J\\ everthelc\" , we believe that all \" cough remedies\" describe a proper market. The record shows that consumers use syrups as well as drops and lozenges to treat their own cough symptoms. Syrups , lozenges , and drops (and tablets and capsules) often contain the same ingredients and perform the same general function- symptomatic reJief of coughs. \" Between the mildest tickle and the most severe cough is a range of disorders that can be treated by products in any of these categories. Moreover , the best relief for coughs is an antitussive. The preferred antitussive compound now available is dextromethorphan , which, being non-narcotic is lozenges , tabJets and 1iquids. (26J Even when a physician is consulted and prescribes a stronger and more expensive product , such as a syrup containing the narcotic codeine, or larger amounts of antihistamine or decongestant than is found in over-the-counter products , there can be a degree of competitive substitutability. To the extent the anticipated price of a o Tr. 750. , :-\\52 Compare , for exml'le.

We have no doubt that if the sale of cough drops and lozenges were banned , sales of the other types of preparations inc1uding syrups would increase as a result. Considering these and other record evidence cited in our Findings (Comm. Find. 63) we find that cough preparations constitute a single line of commercc. The cough remedies market is sufficiently concentrated to be concerned with the loss of a significant firm through acquisition. The four largest firms had 45 percent of sales in I969 and the eight largest 63 percent. Warner- Lambert s share of the market in I969 was 4.4 percent. Parke Davis ' sales represented 4. 2 percent of the market in 1969. The acquisition raised four- firm and eight- firm concentration nearly three percent (Comm. Find. 64 and 65). In addition , as we recite in our Findings at greater length , both Warner- Lambert and Parke Davis were taking vigorous steps to expand their product Jines and improve their positions in the market (Comm. Find. 67). Thus , in 1969 and I970 Warner- Lambert had under development or had just begun marketing Silenex , Smith Brothers cough syrup, and two lozenges Coughlets and Listerine Cough Control Lozenges. Sales of some of these products appear to reflect only slightly in the market share figures given for 1969. Its 4.4 percent market share in 1969 was an increase of nearly 25 percent over its I968 market share and could possibly have risen to 6. 8 percent for that year if imported products had been included in tbe universe and market share tabulations since Warner-Lambert imported $5. 2 million in sales of Ha1ls Mentho- Lyptus tablets in 1969 which were not included. Parke, Davis also undertook efforts to reformulate many of its products. On September 1 , 1970 , it introduced Cosanyl- DM Cough Syrup (Improved Formula) with certain up- to-date ingredients. This new product was selJing at the rate of $100 000 per month at the time of the acquisition. (27) In sum , the record suggests the beginning of a growth trend that could bave elevated to even greater importance the two competitors who combined in late 1970. In view of existing concentration in the market , the merger removed sUDstantial competi- tion from the market. Entry barriers in this market have not been demonstrated to be so low that this judgment requires revision. Tbe presence of over a hundred actual , but de minimis competitors does not contradict the evidence of entry barriers (Comm. Find. 66). To be an effect?:ve competitor in this market , it is simply not enough to buy some bottesWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 881 812 Opinion fill them with a cough syrup, and sell them for a profit. To make substantial sales , great amounts of money and marketing ability are required to convince physicians or consumers as to the desirability of a new cough remedy. Cough Drops and Lozenges Cough drops and lozenges have particular characteristics and uses which set them apart as a separate submarket from other types of cough remedies. They are more portable than liquid cough remedies and can be purchased without a physician s prescription. Respondent does not dispute the existence of a \" cough drops and lozenges \" marketnor does respondent dispute that Warner- Lambert was a leading firm in this market with a 27 percent market share and that Parke, Davisshare was almost 3 percent based on dollar sales. Warner-Lambert markets two cough drops-- Smith Brothers Cough Drops and HalJ's Mentho- Lyptus Cough TabJets. It Cough Contro1 Lozenges , both of which it classifies as part of this market. Parke , Davis has one product in thismarket- Medicated Throat Discs. The administrative law judge summariJy dismissed the allegation of violation in this submarket essentially on the ground that Parke, DavisMedicated Throat Disc is an \" outmoded\" product. (J.D. 46). 21 The record does not support this conclusion. (28) In the two years prior to the merger . Medicated Throat Discs increased in sales from $1.4 to $1. 5 million and Parke , Davis officials anticipated a further increase in both dollar and unit sales in 1970 (CX 1574). Although Medicated Throat Discs were not distributed through food stores (as some cough drops and lozenges are) it was a successful over- the-counter product in drug stores. Although a Parke , Davis survey showed that Medicated Throat Discs ranked number six among lozenges in terms of dollars in sales to drugstores , it ranked \" number one in disc volume , number two in packages sold * * * . One out ofevery four throat lozenges said in drugstores in 1968 was a MTD (Medicated Throat Disc J\" (CX 1573 , 1575). Again this is an example of where a market share based on dollars understates the volume of Parke, Davis sales. ;'dedicated Throat Discs was ranked number six in dollar sales but number one in dosage volume because it is priced considerably Jower than the brand name lozenge products. The Parke 21 1W pondent make! the adUltior. al argument that Throat ;s not a viable oom)ktitive prouct beuse it dO\u20acs not taste goo Thig is unconvinciflg- u particularly ironic in view of W!irner- Lambcrt s \"Tai'. bad . . . twice theme in it.s camplii for Listerine mouthw1l,h which is an apparnt !ittempt create the impresgion that bau tate is characteristic of high quality in over- thr-c.our,ter pharalRuticaIB.882 FEDF:RAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. Davis survey report notes that whereas Medicated Throat Discs retaiJed at around 37 cents for a box of 60 discs , Merck' s Sucrets retailed at 98 cents for a box of 55 discs , and Squibb' s \"Spec T\" lozenges were packaged with 24 discs for $1.98. Concentration is high in this submarket. In cough drops , the top three firms possess over 80 percent of sales. J n cough lozenges , the four Jargest se11ers represented 76 percent of sales to hospitals and drugstores. Total sales of cough drops and Jozenges amounted to over $50 mil1ion in 1969. (Comm Find. 70 & 7I). Against this background we find that the merger violated Section 7 by significantly adding to an already high level of concentration and removing an important competitive factor. Cold Remedies There is , of course , no known cure for the common coJd. What is referred to here as cold remedies are preparations directed at relieving against the nasal. symptoms of a cold nasaJ swe11ing, stuffiness or excessive nasal secretions. There is an industry and public recognition of a distinction between \" cold remedies \" and \"cough remedies. n Preparations which are indicated for coughs (inc1uding coughs due to colds) because of the presence of antitussives or (29) expectorants are considered \" cough remedies \" in the industry and for purposes of this case.\" Warner- Lambert markets several cold remedies which together represent approximately 4 percent of sales in the market. Its rank in the market was 9th in 1969 and 10th in 1970. The administrative law judge found that Parke , Davis had at most 0. 16 percent of the market de minimis amount insufficient to find a violation based on elimination of actual competition. CompJaint counseJ contend , however, that the ALJ erred , as cold remedies in addition to their classification as cough remedies in this case. (Addition of these products would bring Parke , Davis' market share up to two percent.) They argue that these cough preparations arc also coJd remedies because they contain an antihistamine , which may have some drying action on the nasaJ passageway. However , it is undisputed that antihistamines do not combat nasal congestion resulting from a cold virus and therefore should not be considered a specific treatment against coJds , although at one time they were and a few physicians still 21 The industry aiw recgnizes a group of product., called \"cOl.:gb and wiG preparation \" which are product. usually having an antitussive and/or expetorant as well as an ora: (RX proucLo have hen ind' \"Jed in both the cold remedies submarket and the cough remedies submBrketWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 8&, 812 Opinion prescribe them for symptoms of colds. According to expert consensus today, antihistamines are useful in allaying the nasal dripping only if there is an allergy involved. The advertising, package inserts , andlabels for both Ambenyl and Benylin indicate them only for the control of cough due to cold or allergy. Complaint counsel's expert witness in pharmacology, Dr. Standaert testified that physicians who would still use Ambenyl and Benylin as cold remedies would be doing so \" (i In spite of the best teaching of we pharmacoJogists \" that antihistamines are not effective in such situations (30J ('1r. 924). Data derived from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index strongly confirm the observations of this and otherexpert witnesses who so testified. A sampling of office- based physicians show that from 1969 through the first half of I973 , they prescribed Ambenyl Expectorant for cough approximately 87. 9 percent of the time , and for cold only 6. 6 percent of the time (RX 2229). Similarly, during the same time period , these physicians prescribed Benylin Expectorant for cough approximately 87. 3 percent of the time and for cold only 5. 3 percent of the time (RX 2231). Ambenyl and Benylin were properly excluded from this market by the ALJ. As a result , it is clear that no violation of Section 7 has been demonstrated since Parke , Davis' sales of cold remedies amounted at most to 0. 16 percent of the market in I970. Furthermore , the record docs not show that Farke , Davis has any unusual competitive potential in this market. Oral Decongestants Decongestants shrink the swollen lining of the nose and decrease the activity of glands in the area. In 1969 , Warner-Lambert ranked 9th in the oral decongestant market ,,-ith a 5.15 percent market share. In 1970, it ranked 8th with 5. 19 percent. Parke , Davis entered this submarket in 1970 with sales of Cosanyl- DM Cough Syrup (Improved Formula) of $368 000 (all of which were also included in both the cough remedies market and the cold remedies market by complaint counsel), which represents 0. 18 percent of the market. This submarket is moderately concentrated but there are a large number of other toehold firms similarly situated. Complaint counsel argue that the ALJ in dismissing this submarket ignored the estimate of Parke , Davis officials that the company could reach an annual volume of about $I million in this market (CX I725) and that its toehold position of $368 000 sales at the end of 1970 was reached after just four months of sales. But even if the $I million \" The product was 11150 included :n tnI' wid remedies market as it contaim an or al dff-Ongestar.t. See preceing f()otnok884 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. projection were reached this would amount to only 0. 5 percent of the 1970 oraJ decongestant market. As in the cold remedies market , we find no indication that Parke Davis had unusual capabilities of becoming a substantial competitor in this market. (31 J Antihistamines Antihistamines arc materials which act against histamine , a compound produced in the body which is released when an individual is exposed to material to which he is allergic. Antihistamine sales were $36 mi1iion in 1970. The market is concentrated with Parke , Davis heing the second largest seller with 23. 5 percent of the market with sales of its antihistamines , Benadryl and Ambodryl. Warner- Lambert had minimal sales which were discontinued in I969. The principal evidence relied upon by complaint counsel to show that Warner-Lambert was a significant potential competitor is the fact that it had filed Abbreviated \"ew Drug Applications (Al-DA' s) with the FDA on five single- ingredient antihistamine products. The difficulty with this argument is that there are a large number of toehold firms already in the market. In addition , dozers of firms had also filed \"ew Drug Applications or Abbreviated New Drug Applications for antihistamines. From I 970 to 1973 , at least 110 ANDA' s were filed by 52 companies not counting \\Varncr- Lambcrt' The Commission finds there is insufficient evidence that Warner- Lambert was a lega1iy significant potential entrant in this submarket. Bronchial Dilators The drugs employed to give symptomatic relief of constriction of the muscles of the air passages (bronchospasm) caused by asthma bronchitis and emphysema are genera1iy referred to as bronchial dilators. Oral preparations are used primarily in maintenance therapy and to abort miJd attacks. Injectflble preparations such as Adrenalin (epinephrine) are used when other medication has failed or would be useless. They arc used only as a last resort because they must be injected and have substantial side effects. Over 99 percent of Warner- Lamberts sales are accounted for by oral preparations. Almost 99 percent of Parke , Davis' sales are accounted for by injectable epinephrine or ephedrine. Contrary to complaint counsel's contentions the record clearly shows that oral and injectable bronchial dilators are not in the same market as they are not interchangeable in medical usage (Comm. Find. 85 and 86). Reasonable interchangeability in use isWAR:\"ER- LAMBERT CO. 812 Opinion the test , not whether the effectiveness 01 one product may obviate the need for the other which is used only as means of a last resort. (32) Excluding sales of injectable dilators , tbe sales of Parke , Davis are de minimis ($I8000 or 0. 3 percent of the market). Warner- Lambert's sales of $10 mi11ion represent approximately 18 percent of the market. Elimination of actual competition is therefore not significant. Complaint counsel argue that among oral bronchial dilators , Parke Davis could have expanded its toehold position , citing the 1aet that shortly before the merger it negotiated with Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories for the possible purchase of almost one million oral bronchial dilator tablets for resale There is no sbowing, however what one mil1ion tablets would represent in dolJar sales , and there is no particular reason to be1ieve the company would be successful in expanding its present de minimis position in the market very greatJy. Sixteen firms among the top 50 ethical companies markcted bronchial dilators at some point during the period after I958 without attaining as much as two percent of the market in any year. There appears to be no shortage of firms in a position comparable to Parke , Davis. Irritant Laxatives (Ethical) Laxatives fall into two groups those promoted directly to the pub1ic and those promoted \" ethically \" to pharmacists and physicians. Regardless of their methods of promotion , all laxatives are usually shelved side- by-side in retail pharmacies. Laxatives contain ingredients which pharmacologically classified as irrtants , sa1ines and softeners. In recommending laxatives , doctors take these distinctions into consideration. For instance , irritant laxatives arc more dependable in clearing the bowels , but can also cause distressing cramps. Emollients and mineral oil laxatives are generally milder , however , a number of laxatives combine different ingredients so a laxative may not always be classified as clearly falling in a particular pharmacologi- cal category. In fact the record convincingly shows that the Jay consumer docs not recognize \" irritant\" laxatives as a distinct category. This is significant since most laxatives , even ethical laxatives are sold without doctors ' recommendations. However , even among physician- directed uses of laxatives the evidence is not entirely persuasive that irritant laxatives constitute a recohrnizable submarket since the principal characteristic of irritant laxatives (that they are \" sure fire in their effects as one pharmacologist witness phrased it) is also shared by saline laxatives (Comm. Find. 94). The ethical (33j1axative sold by \\Varner-Lambert, \" Agoral/' which is classified as an irritant laxative886 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. by complaint counsel as it contains the irritant phenolphthalein , is not classified by DKK in its surveys as an irritant laxative apparently because it contains emollients (mineral oils) as well and is promoted a gentle laxative. \" Under complaint counsel's market definition and treatment of Agoral as an irritant laxative , Warner- Lambert would be ranked eighth in 1969 with 2. 8 percent of sales , and Parke , Davis seventh with 3. 7 percent. Even accepting complaint counsel' s market definition , we are unable to conclude that they have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that their allocation of Agoral to the alleged irritant laxative submarket is appropriate. ),or is there a violation in any overall laxative market. 1\\ either party had as much as 2 percent of the overall market or ranked within the top I2 firms. Emollient/Protective Preparations Promoted Ethically Ethical emollient and protective dermatological preparations are creams , lotions , and ointments used to treat extremely dry skin conditions which require a high degree of lubrication. Such prepara- tions are promoted to dermatologists. (34 J It is clear that no violation has occurred in this market. Universe sales totaled $16 to $17 million in 1969 and 1970 with Parke Davis ' share about one- tenth of onc percent. Vlarner- Lambert' market share has heen between 12 and 13 percent , by reason of its sales of Lubriderm. After the bearing, complaint counsel contended for the first time that substantial existing competition bas been eliminated. They tendered a new market sbare tabulation showing Parke , Davis with a 3 percent market share , arguing that the tabulation submitted during the hearing had erroneously omitted sales of Aeroderm , a Parke, Davis product which the marketing survey firm DKK had placed in the \" All Other \" subdivision of Ethical Dermatologicals rather than the \" Emollient and Protective \" classification. Complaint counsd appeal from the ALJ' s failure to include sales of Aeroderm in determining Parke. Davis ' share of the market and failing to find a violation in this line of commerce. However , the record indicates that DKK's classification was correct as Aeroderm is more a hand and body massage rub lotion used in hospitals (CX 222I , 2230). It is not promoted to dermatologists for use outside hospitals by patients with extremely f1avcre , and describe the product s. II bedtime laxative. Complaint counsel' s ph\"rmacololG witne. agree that he would not consider a \" gure f\" irrl.nt laxative to be a type which is to be l.ken before retiring- for the night (Tr 952) Agora.1 also comes in unfa.vored fonn , which conl.iIJ no irrit.ant ingredient , but is a mineral oillaxativWARER-LA!.BERT CO. 887 812 Opinion dry skin conditions and is not competitive with preparations used for this purpose (Tr. 3133- 36). Anti-Anginal Drugs Although there were no formal findings concerning anti-anginal drugs in the initial decision , it appears that the ALJ believed there was no violation in this area on the ground that complaint counsel had defined the market too broadly by including anti-anginal products that work in therapeutically different ways (J.D. PI'. 3343). Anti-anginal drugs are defined as drugs designed to relieve the chest pains of angina pectoris. Complaint counsel' s market definition purports to include both those products which arc designed to abort an anginal attack and those which are desi6rned for long- term prophylax- is. The former include sublingual isosorbide dinitrate (PETN), , kets only PETN under the trade name Peritrate. Respondent contends that preparations used to abot an anbrinal attack , principally sublingual nitroglycerin , do not belong in the same market as preparations which serve only a long- term prophylactic purpose. Complaint counsel contend that competition between these regimens nevertheless exists- as the patient may either wait for an anginal attack to improve or occur , in which case he would be relegated (351 to using a sublin6rual nitrate , or he or his doctor may try to reduce the number of attacks in advance by re6TUIar doses of long-acting oral nitrates or beta blockers. Complaint counsel also produced evidence that as many as IO percent of nitroglycerin users take large quantities- up to 50 or 100 pi1s daily- in hope of avoiding feared attacks , thus using sublingual nitroglycerin as a prophylactic drug (Comm. Find. 103). Considerable evidence was placed in the record and relied upon by both parties in support of their respective positions , consisting, inter alia of medical practices by physicians , comparative efficacy of oral nitrate regimens (a subject of intense debate in the profession), promotional literature of oral nitrates , price desparity and lack of price sensitivity between the long and short-acting anti-anginal products. We find, however , that is unneCf;ssary to determine whether these two types of products constitute a single end-use product market , since even assuming they do , the record would not support a finding of violation. Total purchases oJ al1 anti-anginal drugs by ES. drug stores and888 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIO Opinion 87 F. hospitals were $55. I milion in 1969 and $61. 8 mi1ion in 1970. Warner- Lambert's 1969 sales of its oral nitrate , Peritrate were $23 million giving it a market share of 41.8 percent. Because of inroads by the earlier appearance of beta blockers in the U. S. market , Warner- Lambert' s share droppcd to 36. 5 percent in I970 ($22. 6 milion in sales). In 1971, Warner- Lambert was for the first time in many years passed in rank as the leading seller by American Homc Products , the seller of Inderal, a beta blocker. Parke , Davis sales of sublingual nitroglycerin amounted to $66 in I969 and $I30 000 in 1970 , \"riving it a market ranking of O. I percent and 0. 2 percent respectively, elearly dE minim'is shares. Complaint counsel argue , however , that market shares based solely on dollar salcs grossly understate Parke , Davis' sales since its short acting product is priced much lower than long-acting products in the market.\" Warner- Lambert' s Peritrate for instance sells for IS times as much per pill as does Parke , Davis' nitroglycerin. According to complaint counsel , in a \"pm universe \" comput\u20acd on the same data Parke , Davis ' market share would have risen to over 11 percent. However, it is not shown to us how this high figure was arrived at even assuming one pill of nitroglycerin is equivalent 1361 therapeutically to one pill of Peritrate. \" But further , unlike some other products involved in this case , dosage forms (pills here) are not therapeutically equivalent. According to complaint counseJ's witness , the effectiveness of oral nitrates , such as Peritrate , ranges from 6 to 12 hours per pill (Tr. 663). Nitroglycerin s duration is in the order of 20-40 minutcs per pil (Tr. 656)- a difference in ranges of duration by (exactly) a factor of 18. Complaint counseJ's \" pil universe \" approach therefore must be rejected as arbitrary. Pcritrate costs 18 times as much as nitroglycerin but lasts 18 times as long. Also , there is no coverage in complaint counseJ's calculations of Inderal- the beta blocker which has made sizeable inroads into the market and which propelled American Home Products in first position in the market in 1971. Nor is there sufficient basis for predicting that Parke , Davis would substantially improve its de rain,imi8 market positi on in an anti- anginal drugs submarket. Its market share in this submarket has historically been small. (This is not an atypical performance for a Parke, Davis generic product. ) It is true that Parke , Davis constantly evaluates its generic product line and has added products to it over the years. Among the products it considered adding to that line was PETN. But Parke , Davis determined not to add PETK because it felt that there was little generic demand for tbis product; it is a highly ., Complaint counsel bag their calcl.dilt;(),, or. exhibit. s which were not put in the r orr or the re;ect. xhjhit file orotherwil! ue!J,ribt,d in the briefs.WAR:;ER- LAMBERT co. 889 812 Opinion controversial drug; and it has only a \" possibly effective \" rating by the FDA (Tr. 3582- 83). Even if PETJ\\ had been available to Parke , Davis for generic marketing, there is no particular basis for finding that Parke, Davis would have become an important factor in the al1eged anti-anginal drugs submarket. There are many companies that are existing competitors in the anti-anginal drugs sub market. DKK reported sales by over 40 companies in J970 and by over 50 companies in I97I. Among the sel1ers with smal1 market shares were many large drug companies , al1 of which were at 1east as capable as Parke , Davis of expanding their market positions. In conclusion , we find there is insufficient evidence to find a violation of Section 7 in an anti-anginal drugs submarket. (37) Antacids Antacids neutralize excess stomach acid resulting from peptic ulcers heartburn and other causes of gastric distress. The antacids market , as defined for purposes of this case , encompasses al1 types of antacid products, inc1uding ethical OTC products and proprietary products such as Rolaids and Turns. Warner- Lambert manufactures Gelusil ethical preparation , and Rolaids and Bromo Seltzer , which are both proprietary products , and ranks second in the antacids market. Its sales amounted to $48.4 miJ1ion , which represent J8. 5 mil1ion market in J969. Parke , Davis manufactured three outmoded generic ethical antacid products , with combined sales of $IO OOO. Complaint counsel docs not dispute that Parke , Davis had no future in the antacids market on the basis of its existing outmoded products , and that it would have had to develop a new modern antacid product to be an effective competitor. Respondent accepts complaint counsel' al1- inc1usive submarket definition , but denies that the merger has removed Parke , Davis as a sigTiificant potential entrant. The that between I966 and I968 , Parke , Davis formulated liquid and solid dose antacid preparations; however complaint counsel' s own witness (a Parke , Davis employee untiJ I970), testified that he was informed by his superior , Dr. Wheeler there was no marketing interest in lthe antacids)\" (Tr. 1807) which had no unique qua1ities. While complaint counsel also refer to I969 proposals to al10cate minimal amounts of time to product development which could have embraced furtber antacid work in addition to work in other areas , no appreciab1e furtber work was undertaken , and fol1owing a review of the antacid field in tbe spring of 1969 , tbe company decided against expending any furtber effort in this general area. Moreover , unlike Parke , Davis, wbich had no proprietary distribution 216.969 O-LT - 77 -890 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. or consumer advertising expertise , there were 14 companies among the nation s top 100 advertisers which had substantial proprietary drug sales and already had products in the antacids market but were not among the top eight sellers. These toeholders were undoubtedly more capable than Parke , Davis of becoming significant competitors in the proprietary segment of the antacid market. Complaint counsel in fact concede that Parke , Davis was one of 13 companies with the ability to surmount barriers existing in the market (ApI'. Br. 82). (38 J In conclusion , the Commission finds that the record fails to show that Parke , Davis was more likely than others to expand into the antacid market. No probable substantial lessening of competition has been shown. Prenatal Vitamins In 1969 , the prenatal vitamin market was $14. 6 million , and concentrated in structure , with the top four firms (Parke , Davis ranking second with 15 percent of sales) accounting for 57. 3 percent of the sales. In 1969 , Warner- Lambert' s prenatal vitamin , Calcisalin occupied a ri minimis position in this market with 0. 3 percent and $64000 in sales volume. After the complaint issued , the company withdrew the product from the market , rather than reformulate it to meet new FDA requirements. Calcisalin was a market failure apparently because the excessively large tablet had to be taken six times rather than once daily. Although Warner- Lambert was capable of reformulating Calcisalin into a once-a- day preparation , it states it did not do so because it viewed the markct as relatively unattractive for entry. Warner- Lambert's lack of interest in the prenatal vitamin market is consistent with its low interest and activity in the entire vitamin field. DKK reported its total sales of all vitamins in 1970 as $53 000, including $46000 in reported sales of Calcisalin. In view of the lack of subjective evidence of Warner- Lam bert's intent to re-enter this market , com- plaint counsel state that they do not stress this market an appea1. Our findings also set forth reasons why objective considerations make it unlikely that Warner- Lambert is a likely entrant into this market (Comm. Find. 120- 121). K 0 violation of Section 7 has been demonstrat- ed in this market. (39 J Antibiotics Useful Against Gram- :'egative Baci1i The ALJ rejected this group of products as a relevant market and found, in any event , no lessening of competition. Complaint counselWAR:-ER- LAMBERT CO. 891 812 Opinion appealed on both points. However , we find the evidence fully supports the ALJ' s conclusions. Microorganisms causing infections are classified by scientists into several categories. One of those classifications is \" gram-negative bacilli.\" There are many different bacilli falling within the \" gram- negative\" category and different diseases result from such bacteria. (The term \" gram-negative \" simply refers to a negative result on a common diagnostic test devised many years ago by a scientist named Gram). These diseases , or infections , may be treated by antibiotics or other drugs such as sulfonamides depending upon the infecting organism. An antibiotic may be active against a particular gram- negative bacil1us , but not against other disease-causing organisms such as \" gram- positive bacili\" or \" gram negative cocci. \" Most important for purposes of determining the validity of grouping these antibiotics as a relevant market is the fact that the preferred drug for a specific gram-negative infection will not be just anyone of the twenty or so different antibiotics or chemotherapeutic agents active against onc or more gram-negative baci1i. Selection of the proper drug, which may not always be an antibiotic , requires consideration of many factors: The infecting agent , the seriousness of the patient' condition, whether he is al1ergic to a particular antibiotic or drug, the site of the infection , and possible other factors. Thus, despite the label \",\"ven this alleged submarket, \" antibiotics useful against gram- negative bacili\" does not define a group of products that appear to substantial1y compete inwr se in any given situation. A good example of this are the antibiotics sold by the partners to this merger that fall ,, thin this market definition. Warner-Lambert (40j has sold only one antibiotic , Coly-Mycin, which in injectable form , has been used mostly for certain urinary tract infections and , in topical preparations , for use for \" swimmer s cars, The evidence shows that the \" antibiotics effective against gram- negative haci1i\" sold , and Paromycin which arc preferred and used for other diseases. According to authoritative guides published to assist the practicing physician in selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapy, there is no circumstance in which Coly- Mycin is an alternate first choice with any of Parke , Davis' antibiotics and rarely are any listed together as possible alternative drugs if the drug or drugs listed as first choice should not be \",\"ven for any reason. The only situation where many of the antibiotics in this alleged market are perhaps interchangeable in practice is where initial therapy is necessary in infections which arc suspected to be due to gram- negative organisms pending completion of culture tests to identify the892 EDERAL TRADE CO MISSION DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. infecting organism. Even here the overlap in use appears to be more theoretical than real for the merging firms ' products. Parke , Davis Chloromycetin would not usually be used in such situations because of its sometimes fatal side-effects. Although antibiotics in general might qualify as an industry- type market , there is no recognized industry or group of firms that specialize in manufacturing \" antibiotics useful against gram-negative bacili\" to the cxclusion of other antibiotics. However, even if we accept \"antibiotics useful against gram- negative bacilli\" as defining a single product market for antitrust purposes (despite the doubts we have expressed), this merger would have no adverse effect on competition based on market shares considerations. In 1970 , Parke, Davis comhined sales accounted for a market share of 5. 31 percent giving it a seventh in ranking. Warner- Lambert's sales in 1970 accounted for a market share of 0. 66 percent. The combined effect of these market shares is a de minimis increase in concentration and precludes a finding that existing competition likely to be substantially lessened by the merger in this alleged submarket. In fact , the evidence indicates that concentration has been decreasing and the number of companies marketing two important antibiotics with gram-negativc activity, ampicillin and tetracycline has been increasing. (4lJ It also appears unlikely that Warner- Lambert would be one of the companies most likely to expand its position in this purported market. Its saJes have been declining due to displacement by new and superior antibiotic products. Warner- Lambert is not regarded as a leading antibiotic developer. (Tr. I3I6- , 1321; Tr. 2949- 52). It did not discover Coly- Mycin , its sole antibiotic product , has no antibiotic DA'on file, has no antibiotic manufacturing facilities , and has no research capability for elaborating new antibiotics. We agree with the ALJ that no lessening of competition in this alleged market is indicated. Ampicillin Ampicillin is a broad spectrum , semi-synthetic penicillin. The term broad spectrum \" refers to the fact that the drug is effective against many different kinds of microorganisms. There is no dispute that ampicillin \" describes a proper product market. Ampicillin was patented by Beecham , a British company, and sold in the If nited States by Beecham and licensed by Beecham to Bristol Laboratories and Bristol- YIyers Co., (\" Bristol\"). Bristol has , in turn, sublicensed Squibb- Beechnut and American Home Products ' Wyeth Division. In addition to Parke, Davis, which purchases ampicillin from Bristol in finishedWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 893 812 Opinion dosage form , Ay' r- t Laboratories Division of American HomeProducts and Ledt'rle distribute ampicil1in which they purchase in dosage form from beecham. A number of other companies also sel1ampicillin without license , as the validity of the ampicil1in patent has been successfully attacked. Parke, Davis commenced marketing ampici1in in 1968 and hasachieved a number 4 ranking in the market. Its 1970 sales of $10.4 million gave it an 11.7 percent market share. The top four sel1ers are estimated to have controlled 95 percent of the market in I970. Warner- Lambert has never sold ampicil1in. Complaint counsel appeals from the ALJ' s finding that there is nobasis for finding that Warner- Lambert was a potential entrant into this market. They cite the fact that during the period 1968 to March I970, Warner- Lambert approached Beecham , and its licensee Bristol about the possibility of obtaining rights to market several antibiotics including ampicilJn. However , no agreement was ever reached , andWarner-Lambert's primary interest was in obtaining marketing rights to other, newer, antibiotics. Although complaint counsel contend that Warner-Lambert' s interest was cut short only by the negotiations to acquire Parke , Davis , there is contemporaneous evidence indicating that what interest Warner- Lambert had in ampiciJlin was (42) not strong. Furthermore , the objective evidence strongly suggests that compa- nies selling other antibiotics were more likely entrants into this market which by 1970 was opening up to sel1ers of generic ampicil1in. In contrast to these companies , as previously noted Warner- Lambert had little experience in antibiotics. Loss of one among many such potential entrants would not substantial1y lessen competition. Anti-Pseudomonas Drugs Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a species of gram-negative baci1i which can cause life- threatening infections in a severely burned or leukemic patient as we11 as minor urinary tract and eye and ear infections. Unlike the H antibiotics useful against gram-negative bacili \" com- plaint counsel define this market to include not only antibiotics but other drugs effective against this organism. This permits them to claim the merger has eliminated Parke , Davis as a potential entrant since just prior to the merger Parke , Davis had filed an application with the \"\" For instanrA' , an early 1969 Warner- Lambert memorandum identified numerous \"LPJroblems of marketingampiciJiin in the black. \" It pointe out that there were aLready fiV( competitor. which has a \" head swrt \" that all competitors had made \" 2O1pricuts in Oct. 1967,\" that \" :sJellinR a ' commodity VS. a 'peiaity' item would reuire L to undercut already tringent price to carve any volume for iLo,lf \" that \"lcJomplcw orai and injl'tlble lines must markete (Squibb' mistake) detailing force enliste,\" FEDERAL TRADE COMMJSSIO DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. Federal Government for a hcense to market an anti- pseudomonasvaccine. Parke , Davis' only other \" anti-pseudomonas \" product was an ophthalmic preparation to which polymyxin B had been added to reach pseudomonas in the eye and which gave the company only a minimis share of this market. Warner- Lambert's share was 9.4 percent, down from I6. 9 percent in I969 , resulting from sales of Coly- Mycin antibiotic products. (By 1971 , its share was down to 6.1 percent because of the introduction of newer drugs in this field). The ALJ rejected any violation in this submarket because each of the two companies ' products is designed for specific purposes and neither would ehminate uses of the other. We agree. The proposed Parke, Davis vaccine is intended to be (43) used with severe burn and leukemic patients in the hope of gettng ahead of the development of infection by building a resistance in the patient. The vaccine is not intended to be used in heu of any antibiotics as it is an immunological product. J\\evertheless , complaint counsel argue that there would be cross-elasticity of demand between such an anti- pseudomonas vaccine and antibiotics , citing the testimony by respondent' s medical expert Dr. Finland , that the vaccine may, if proved successful , make the use of anti-pseudomonas antibiotics \" antiquated\" for burn patients (Tr. 2985). But that is not a sure test for eross- elastieity of demand. The invention of the automobile made the horse- drawn carriage antiquat- , but no one would seriously contend that today competition or cross-elasticity of demand\" still exists between the two. No doctor would forego using a life-saving immunizing vaccine on burn patients because an antibiotic could be used as a last resort. Nor would Warner- Lambert have any incentive to withhold the vaccine from the market since its only antibiotic , Coly-Nlycin , is not widely used on burn patients (Tr. 2527- 3I). We find no lessening of potential competition here. LJrinary Antibacterials The complaint identifies as an end-use submarket for this case urinary antibacterials (non-sulfa). \" These are defined by complaint counsd as drugs used in tbe treatment of urinary tract infections but exclusive of sulfonamides , antibiotics and urinary analgesics. While respondent in its answer admitted the propriety of this definition , the evidence at the hearing clearly established that short-acting sulfonam- ides are not only therapeutically interchangeable with other urinary antibacterials , but arc now considered the drug of choice for acute urinary tract infection (Tr. 851- , 1314- 32.')7). Complaint counsd themselves admitted this. (Tr. 140). Although respondent does not seek to change its concession as to the market definition , preferring toWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 895 812 Opinion argue the relevance of sulfonamides only on the issue of competitive injury, we believe analysis would best be aided by redefining the market to include sulfonamides. Cf. Geneml Foods C!Yrp. 69 F.C. 280 411 n.5 (1966). (44J As so redefined , Hoffman La Roche and Morton orwich companies dominated the market sharing nearly equally 70 percent of total sales (60 million). Warner- Lambert ranked third with 9_ 2 percent of sales. Parke , Davis had only $70 000 in sales , or 0.1 percent of the market. Although complaint counsel have objected to giving consideration to post-acquisition actions by respondents throughout other parts of this case when it favors respondent , in this submarket they rely almost entirely on post-acquisition evidence (indeed , post-complaint evidence) in arguing there has been elimination of Parke , Davis as a potential competitive force. They cite the faet that in March I973 , Parke, Davis introduced a new urinary antibacterial \" nitrofurantoin \" to its generic line and that factory sales were nearly $50 000 in the first year of marketing. Since there is no evidence in the record as to total industry sales of urinary antibacterials for 1973 , there is no way of ascertaining Parke Davis' market share in that post- acquisition year. But relating Parke Davis' 1973 sales to I970 industry sales of $60.4 million as reported by DKK, Parke , Davis would sti1 have only a de minimis market share (0.1 percent of the market). Even if we assume that a Parke , Davis independent of Warner- Lambert would have made a better showing than is indicated by its I973 sales , it is doubtful that the merger can even be characterized as combining a n leading\" company in the market with a potential entrant in view of \\Varner- Lambert having a market share below 10 percent. TIw Budd Company, C. Dkt. 8848 (Aug. 29 1975 slip opinion at I8 (86 F. C. 5181. Also we would have to consider other post-merger developments such as the new sulfonamide antibacterial compound , trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole , whieh was in the latter part of I973 specifical1y for urinary tract infections (Tr. I317- 18). Studies performed in this country showed that it was more effective than sulfonamide. Also the patent on nitrofurantoin expired in I969 or 1970. Approval to market it can now be secured under the abbreviated KDA procedure. This procedure is also available and has been widely used for securing marketing approval of the short-acting sulfonamides. In addition to the top 8 suppliers and Parke , Davis, 59 companies reported sales of urinary antibacterials as early as 1969. AI1 these facts would seem to overshadow Parke , Davis ' introduction of generic896 FEDERAL TRADE C01nnSSIOK DECISIONS Opinion 87 F. nitrofurantoin in 1973 insofar as it might indicate a loss of potential competition resulting from the merger. Mouthwash (45 J With 48 percent of this $I85 million market (1970), Warner- Lambert ranked first. In addition to Warner- Lambert , the other leading mouthwash companies are: Procter and Gamble Johnson and Johnson and Merril (Lavons). Parke, Davis had four non- branded mouthwash products packaged and marketed only for institutional use. Total sales in 1970 were only $29000. Complaint counsel ar\"rue that the initial decision ignores evidence that Parke , Davis gave serious consideration to the development and marketing of a proprietary mouthwash throughout the 1960' s. These efforts, however , led to a decision not to market such a product. After a review of past development work , the director of marketing explained in a 1969 memorandum that the \" primary reason for our decision is that it would take a considerable amount of money to effectively establish this product with the consumer. Unfortunately, within the last couple of years , the market has been literally flooded with new mouthwash preparations (i.Micrin, Scope , Colgate 100 etc.) as well as the old standbys , Lavoris and Listerine. In our opinion we could spend our advertising and promotion dollars more effectively in other product areas \" (CX 2723). o further work was done in the mouthwash area. In addition to this lack of subjective interest , objective considera- tions make it unlikely that Parke , Davis was a likely potential entrant. In order to achieve significant market penetration , substantial package goods merchandising, advertising, and distribution expertise is re- quired. \" Parke, Davis had never developed any of these. We find no basis to find a violation of Section 7 in this submarket. (46 J Human Blood Fractions-- ormal Serum Albumin albumin , immune serum globulin , and tetanus immune globulin are three out of some 25 or 30 different products that can be derived from human blood by a fractionation process.

Find. I47). Respondent does not dispute that each is a relevant line of commerce. Blood fractions are genera11y considered \" biologicals \" and are regulated by the Federal Government' s Bureau of Biologies (\" BOB\" Blood fractionation involves a complex manufacturing process. The technical requirements include facilities that are estimated to cost $2 million , which must be operated at a freezing temperature or below and requires special testing to assure quality control. BOB requires any manufacturer of therapeutic blood fractions to obtain a license to produce and anothcr to sell. Once produced , blood fractions are marketed in the same manner as drugs- to hospitals , drug stores , and physicians. Parke, Davis manufactures and markets each of these blood fraction products as we11 as others , and is a leading firm in two of them: In normal serum albumin (human) it ranked number one in I969 with sales of $2. 4 mi11ion which gave it a market share of 34 percent. In tetanus immune globulin (human) it ranked number two with 28 percent of the market , $701000 in sales. In immune serum globulin (human) it was only the fifth largcst se11er with 7 percent of the markct with salcs of $7I2 000. Warner-Lambert did not manufacture any of these or other blood fractionation products prior to the merger. However , in I969, Warner- Lambert acquired Elizabeth Biochemical Laboratory which operated a multi- State chain of blood eo11cction centers which distributed plasmas to industrial huyers such as bloed fractionation companies. Elizabeth was the ;\\ation s leading supplier of industrial blood plasma (47J (CX 257). Elizaheth' s plasma was thus a raw material for blood fractiona- tion. Despite indications that some blood fractionaters do not consider ownership of blood banks as advantageous , ownership by a blood fractionation company would assure the latter a source of plasma when supply on the open market is scarce. Complaint counsel aq\" rue that prior to the merger Warner- Lambert was a potential entrant into blood fractionation in entering these markets. In :\\arch 1969 , when Elizabeth Biochemical was acquired Warner-Lambert began laying the h'TOundwork for a merger proposal with Cutter Laboratories , a blood fractionation company. An offer was later made but was turned down by Cutter. It is c1ear that Warner- Lambert viewed an acquisition of Cutter as a means of entering the field of human blood fractions and would have added business \" closely '\" The rr. arkct-shares are oasee on ojJ\u20acn-marj(et sa:0!

Find. 156). Failing in its efforts to acquire Cutter , Warner-Lambert next turned to Squibb , anotber blood fractionation product supplier , investigating the possibility of Squibb manufacturing a line of blood products for Warner- Lambert to distribute. However , negotiations ceased in December 1969 because Squibb did not have manufacturing time available. Respondent's officials testified that these negotiations were conditioned upon a joint R&D program with Squibb for new blood fraction products and that this was its primary interest and that in any event Warner- Lambert was not seriously interested in selling blood fractionation products. However , the documentary evidence shows tbat the two areas of interest were not considered dependent upon each other. Consideration concerning Squibb supplying blood fraction products to Warner- Lambert for resale continued after it became certain that tbere would not be a joint reseaTch program. (CX 2887; CX 289I-92; CX 2105). We find the testimony un persuasive in light of this documentary evidence. We tbink there was a reasonable probability tbat Warner- Lambert would have eventually entered tbese important blood fraction markets if not by de rwo entry into fractionation itself (or by acquisition of a small company) tben by distributing such products supplied to it by a fractionater. In view of its new position in I969 as a supplier of plasma and tbe interest manifested tbereafter in entering the blood fractiona- tion business , the potential competition represented by Warner- Lambert was uniquely important. Considering the very (48 J high concentration - four firm ratios exceeding 90 percent (Comm. Find. 150)-and the undisputed entry barriers in these markets , we find that in acquiring Parke , Davis , a leading firm in two of these markets (normal serum albumin and tetanus immune globulin), Warner- Lambert eliminated itself as a source of future competition that could bave had a significant procompetitive effect. We find a violation of Section 7 in tbese two markets. (49J III. CONCLUSION Viewing this acquisition in terms of the entire drug industry and its major segment , ethical drugs , there has been no showing of violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. As we said in StErling Dru, Inc. , sUpTa 80 F. C. 477 , 598, in the absence of a merger which produces a firm controlling an undue percentage of the market under consideration and results in a significant increase in concentration in that market something more than mere ' horizontality ' of a merger must be shown *' * * (AJn important consideration is whether there is a recent trendWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 899 812 Opinion that threatens to transform an unconeentrated market into a concentrated market or whether the merger adds to or threatens to entrench existing concentration. \" Among aggregate sales of all drugs or \"ethical drugs \" (which represent 80 percent of all drug sales) concentration has not been high and there has been no trend threatening to change this picture. This is not to say that price competition flourishes in most drug product submarkets. It clearly docs not as indicated by the fact that the drug industry consistently enjoys one of the highest profit rates among all manufacturing industries. But lack of price competition is the result of a number of factors , including barriers to entry, that are in no way affected by this acquisition save where concentration has been unduly increased or entrenched by this merger in specific therapeutic submarkets. In only three specific submarkets did these two drug companies compete with the result that substantial existing competition between them bas been eliminated: thyroid preparations , cough remedies , and the immune globulin- impor- tant competition has been lost. Thus , in five submarkets altogether, competition has been substantially diminished by this merger in a manner that violates Section 7 of tbe Clayton Act. IV. RELlU' Complaint counsel have argued tbat if we find a violation of Section 7 in Cl/ny line of commerce resulting from respondent s stock acquisition of tbe Parke , Davis (50J company, divestitun: of the stock would be the appropriate relief. In United States v. du Pont Co.366 U. S. 316 (196I), the Court decreed complete divestiture of the unlawfully held stock, saying (:166 U. S. at 330- 3I): Divestiture has been called the most important of antitrust remedies. It is simp!e, relatively easy to administer , and sure. It should a!ways he in the forefront of a court s mind when a violation of 1;7 has been found. The court also said that \" complete divestiture is peculiarly appropri- ate in cases of stock acquisitions which violate Section 7\" (id. at :128). On the other hand , where the offending line or lines of commerce constitute a relatively small proportion of the entire business of the acquired corporation , partial divestiture may be appropriate if competition can te effectiveJy restored in the affected markets.

FINDI?,TGS OF FACTS AI'T) CONCLUSIO OF LAW (IJ On June 30 , I971, the Commission issued its complaint against respondent charging it with having violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended (15 V. C. sI8), in its acquisition of all or substantially all of the stock of Parke , Davis & Company. After the issuance of the complaint and the filing of respondent' s answer, hearings were held before a duly designated administrative law judge of the Commission and testimony and other evidence in support of and in opposition to the allegations of the complaint were received into the record. In an initial decision filed August 2 , 1974, the administrative law judge found the charge of violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act had not been sustained by the evidence and ordered that the complaint be dismissed. The Commission having considered the appeal of counsel supporting the complaint from the initial decision and the entire record in this proceeding and having determined that the appeal should be granted and that the initial decision should be vacated and set aside , now makes its own findings as to the facts , conclusions drawn therefrom , all of which, together with the accompanying opinion , shall be in lieu of the findings, conclusions and order contained in the initial decision. (2) JURISDICTIONAL FACTS 1. Warner- Lambert Company (Warner- Lambert), respondent here- , is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal office and place of business located at Morris Plains , Kcw Jersey. 2. Prior to November 13 , 1970, when it was acquired by Warner- Lambert, Parke, Davis & Company (Parke , Davis) was a corporation organized and existing under the Jaws of the State of Michigan with its principal office and place of business located at Detroit , Michigan.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 001 812 FlndinbTS of Facts and Conclusions of Law 3. At all times relevant to this proceeding, Warner- Lambert sold and shipped , and is now selling and shipping, products in interstate commerCe throughout the l'nited States and was and is engaged in commerce as \" commerce \" is defined in the Clayton Act. 4. At all times rc1evant to this proceeding, Parke , Davis sold and shipped products in interstate commerce throughout the United States and on November 13 , I970 , and prior thereto , was engaged in commerce as \" commerce \" is defined in the Clayton Act. 5. On November 13 , 1970, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated August 25 1970, Warner- Lambert acquired ownership of all or substantially all the stock of Parke , Davis in return for 6 600000 shares of Warner- Lambert common stock. RU.EV ANT :\\RKET A:.m LINES OF COMMERCE 6. The relevant section of the country within which to view the merger of Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis is the entire United States. 7. There are a number of lines of commerce alleged to be re1evant in considering this merger. They are as follows: (a) The overall drug market. This asserted market consists of medicines , both pharmaceutical and biological , in dosage form and are limited in this proceeding to those for human use. Included in this market arc ethical drugs and so- called proprietary drugs. Proprietary drugs are not a separate line of commerce relevant for consideration in this case, other than as a part of the overall drug market , described above. These are products manufactun,d and sold by the drug industry and which are promoted (3) principally to the consuming public. They may include products for which a prescription may often be written by a physician , but which may also bc sold over- the-counter without a prescription. (b) Ethical drugs. These drugs for which a prescription from a physician is required , ur which , a1though sold over- the-countcr (OTC) without a prescription , are primarily advertised and promoted by the drug industry to the medical , pharmacy and allied profession. These ethical drugs are a relevant line of commerce for consideration in this case. (c) In addition , counsel in support of the complaint assert that there are 20 separate submarkets of the overall drug market which include either cthical or proprietary drugs and which constitute distinct end- use product markets and must be considered individua11y in consider- ing this merger.902 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. ACQUIRIl'G CORJ)ORATION: WAR..'''ER-LA.\\1BERT 8. Warner- Lam bert's history dates back to I856 , the year in which William R. Warner founded an ethical drug business in Philadelphia which was acquired by Pfeifer Chemical Co. in 1908. In 1916 the stock of Richard Hudnut , a New York cosmetics manufacturer , was acquired and from 1920 to 1955 the combined business was known as Warner- Hudnut, Inc. Following a merger with the Lambert Company of St. Louis in 1955 , the firm name was changed to Warner- Lambert Pharmaceutical Company and in 1970 simplified to Warner- Lambert Company. 9. The major portion of Warner- Lamberts research facilities ethical pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and the executive offices are located in Morris Plains , New Jersey. Proprietary pharma- ceutical products arc manufactured at other plants. IO. In 1969 , prior to the acquisition of Parke , Davis, Warner- Lambert' s sales were $808 million and total assets were $572 million. In I969, its total domestic sales were $540 million and its total domestic assets were $366 million. Its sales were divided about equally among professional and consumer products and products sold internationally. In 1969, professional products , which included all products promoted to the medical profession , accounted for 36. 1 percent of total sales , while consumer products (which included proprietary pharmaceutical prod- ucts) accounted for 35. 9 percent , and international sales 28. 0 percent of total sales. Approximately 10 percent of the total of all sales for 1969 were accounted for by ethical drug sales. (4) 11. Warner- Lambert over the years has enjoyed substantial growth in the drug industry. Its trade name products have become very familiar to the medical profession. The advertising behind such products as Listerine , Bromo Seltzer , Super Anahist , Smith Brothers Cough Drops , Rolaids have made them household names and commonly are among the leading products in their markets. In addition , Warner- Lambert has been able to use these popular trade names to sell associated products , such as toothpaste , breath spray and throat lozenges. 12. Warner- Lambert utilizes both print antI electrical medium to promote its products. These include direct mail , billboard , shelf-talkers displays , television , radio , magazines and professional journals. In I968 Warner- Lambert spent approximately $80 million for domestic advertising; in 1969 approximately $93 million and in I970 approximately $126 million for domestic advertising. In 1970 Warner- Lambert was the largest drug and cosmetic advertiser in the country and the fifth largest advertiser among all companies.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 903 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law I3. Warner- Lambert engages substantia11y in research and devel- opment programs. In 1969 it spent approximately $11 mi11ion for ethical research and employed about 320 persons in this endeavor. Warner-Lambert 1ikewise engages in research and development work with its foreign operations and derives benefits in this country from this overseas research and development. Warner- Lambert also engages in research and development work in support of its proprietary drug products which amounted to approximately $2 million in 1970. 14. Warner- Lamhert also employs a bighly capable staff of 3 000 sales representatives in the United States serving various markets. It is a very marketing-oriented company, with an able promotional staff skilled packaging experts and market planners. ACQlJIRED CORPORATION: PARKE , DAVIS 15. Parke , Davis has long been a famous ethical pharmaceutical company. Since the company was founded in 1866 , its research and development has resulted in major contributions to pharmacy and medicine. Parke , Davis' executive offices and the largest of its ethical and proprietary faci1ities are located in Detroit , :.ichigan. Research facilities are centered in Ann Arbor , and Detroit , Michigan , while biological products are manufactured principally at Rochester , Michi- gan. (5J 16. At all times relevant to this case , Parke , Davis has manufactured and sold pharmaceutical , biological , medical-surgical and related hea1th care products in the United States and throughout the free world. Nearly all of Parke , Davis' pharmaceutical products were and are ethically promoted. It has been known in the pharmaceu- tical industry as a \" broad line \" house, meaning that its salesmen , in addition to detailing specialty items to physicians , also se11 generic drugs as commodities to hospital and retail pharmacies. Pharmaceuti- cal and biological products accounted for 41. 7 percent of total Parke Davis' sales in 1969 , while medical-surgical products were 13. 8 percent and international sales were 42. 0 percent of all sales. PRE-MERGER PERFOR.\\1CE M'D PROSPECTS OF PARKE, DAVIS 17. The record shows that by the time of the merger , Parke, Davis had fallen from its former preeminent position in the industry. Parke Davis had ranked second in 1950 among all manufacturers of ethical drugs. However , by 1969 , the year before the merger , it ranked eleventh. Its market share in the ethical drug line dropped from 6. percent in 1960 to only 2. 90 percent in 1969. 18. In the years just before merger, Parke, Davis planned to904 FEDERAL TRADE COM:\\ISSION DECISIONS Findings vi FacL'i and Conclusions of Law 87 F. expand into proprietary markets using its broad range of consumer products. To this end a special Consumer Products Marketing Department was established in the latter balf of 1969. However , these plans did not materialize into any significant entry in the proprictary field. I9. Parke , Davis' drop in market rank and share is matched by simiJar declines in its performance as measured by various financial indicators. From I965 to mid- 1970, Parke , Davis' net income fell approximately 50 percent from just under $40 million to less than 320 million. Its earnings per share dropped from $2. 25 in 1965 to approximately 31 per share in the twelve-month period ending June 30 1970. Parke , Davis reduced its dividend from $1.45 in I965 to $1 in I967 and to $0. 60 in I970. 20. The record suggests a number of contributing factors to Parke Davis' precipitous decline. One factor was problems with the compa- ny's principal antibiotic , Chloromycetin , a drug which had accounted for more than 20 percent of Parke , Davis' total sales as recently as I967. (6) Chloromycetin s patent expired in October 1966 , and it also received bad publicity as a result of certain fatal side effects. Subsequent declines in Chloromycetin sales volume and price adversely affected Parke , Davis' earnings. Parke , Davis' poor performance has also been attributed to management shortcomings (Tr. 2645), to outmoded marketing and poor coordination between marketing and R&D (Tr. 3572- 74), and to a general non-aggressiveness in the marketplace. (Tr. ;,025 , 3675). 21. Whatever cause of , by mid- 1970 the Parke , Davis R&D effort had been significantly affected by the company s low profitability. Dr. Sadusk , who was in charge of Parke Davis' research , testified that when he joined Parke , Davis in 1967 its R&D budget of approximately $15 million was spread over six or seven drug categories , with the result that there was not enough money in any of them to be productive. In his view , Parke, Davis had also failed to appreciate the implications of the Kefauver- Harris Amendments and had an inadequate elinical investigation department. These problems appear to be reflected in the disappointing productivity of the Parke , Davis K&D effort - only two new chemical entities (KCE's) were developed between 1965 and 1972. Since Parke , Davis low profits precluded increasing the R&D budget , the number of categories in which research was conducted was cut; and , in an effort to improve earnings , R&D money was shifted from research on new single entity drugs to developmental efforts on duplicate and combination products.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 905 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law THE ACQUISITION 22. During the first half of 1970 , Parke , Davis ' deterioration continued. The company s net earnings , excluding an extraordinary capital gain of $I.4 million , fell to $5. 6 mi11ion in the first six months of I970, compared to $9. 9 million for the first six months of 1969. 23. Fo11owing an internal review of Parke , Davis, Warner- Lam- bert, on July 19 , 1970, proposed a tax- free exchange of all Parke Davis' common stock for 5 400000 shares of Warner- Lambert's common stock. It recited , among other things , that the combination of the two companies would permit both companies to compete more effectively from both a marketing and research standpoint , and that very material economies appeared available in the overseas markets. Subsequently, Warner- Lambert was advised that it (7J would have to increase its offer in order to be acceptable to Parke , Davis. Warner- Lambert thereupon increased the offer to 6 600000 shares of Warner- Lambert common stock. Warner- Lambert was unaware at that time that there was a competing offer hy the Revlon Company under which Parke , Davis would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of a newly-named company, Revlon- Parke, Davis, Inc. 24. On July 30 , the Parke , Davis Board of Directors voted unanimously to reject the Revlon proposal and to accept the Warner- Lambert one. The controlling consideration was that Warner- Lambert had a good reputation and an appreciation and knowledge of drug research and development , whereas RevJon , principally a cosmetic firm, lacked comparable standing and experience in the complex pharmaceutical field. Dr. Sadusk , Parke, Davis' R&D chief , testified that he considered it mandatory that any Parke , Davis merger should be with a company which had an appreciation and knowledge of the ethics of drug development, landJ drug sales , and knowledge of research and development.\" (Tr. 2783). 25. The shareholders of the two companies approved the transac- tion at meetings held on October 2 , I970 , and October 23 , 1970 respectively. The transaction was completed on November I3 , 1970. ISSliES TO BE DFfERMINED 1:' TIns PROCEEDING 26.

There is (8) no issue as to \" section of the country, \" respondent having admitted that all alleged markets and submarkets are nationwide in scope. (Answer ) Likewise , there is no issue between the parties as to \"line of commerce \" with respect to the two major markets and I3 of the alleged submarkets. As to all markets and submarkets , respondent denies that the merger will have the proscribed anti-competitive effect. STIPULATION WITH REGARD TO I DuSTRY STATISTICS 27. The parties stipulated that Davee , Koehnlein and Keating (DKK) statistical data would \" be used by both sides to establish the approximate dollar value of purchases of drugs and diagnostic materials, the breakdown of such purchases by product , by brand and by maker and the aggregate of all such purchases , direct or indirect from each such maker during each of the years from I957 through 1971, inclusive. \" (Stipulation Concerning Statistical Data , CC Phy.

They stipulated further that \" such data shall be used to establish the approximate size of all product markets , both major markets and submarkets thereof , and the percentage market shares and ranks of each maker of products in such market (including Warner-Lambert and Parke , Davis).

The drug manufacturing line of commerce (sometimes referred to herein as the \" all drug line ) includes the manufacture and sale of all drugs, both ethical and proprietary. The ethical drug line of commerce embraces only ethical drugs. As noted above , respondent has admitted that both of these major lines are proper lines of commerce for Section 7 purposes. For purposes of this case, \" drugs \" are medicines , both pharmaceutical and biological , in dosage form intended for human use; \" ethical drugs \" are those for which a prescription is required or which , although sold over- the-counter without a prescrip- tion, are primarily promoted to the medical , pharmacy and allied professions; and \" proprietary drugs \" arc those which are promoted primarily to the consuming public. The ethical drug line accounts for more than 80 percent of industry sales in the all drug line , and virtually all of Parke , Davis' sales were and are in ethical drugs. For these reasons , the ethical drug line is the more significant of the two major lines of commerce being considered in this case. BARRIERS TO P'HR Y 29. The record indicates three principal barriers to entry among various ethical drugs: The common use of brand name prescribing; patent barriers; and the high cost of research and development. (a) Brand narne prescribing. To the extent that brand name prescribing is utilized , a new entrant often finds it difficult to compete solely on the basis of price , quality, and service. This is because if a doctor writes a prescription by using a brand name or trade name virtually every State requires by law or pharmacy board regulation that the dispensing pharmacist fill the prescription with the designated brand even though equivalent generic products may be available. Upwards of 75 percent of all prescriptions are written in brand name terms. Physicians are educated to the use of products by brand names by journal advertising, direct mail advertising, and by detail men who visit them and leave promotional literature and samples. Even if a physician becomes aware of cheaper substitutes , it is common for many physicians to prescribe by brand name because of familiarity with that name or because he knows who makes it and he may feel more confident in the quality (10 J of such product. As a result of this marketing system , drug companies with effective , large-scale promo- tional capabilities can establish brand names in the minds of physicians908 FEDERAL TRADE COM\"ISSIO DECISIO:-S Findings of Facts and ConcJusions of Law 87 F. and substantia11y exc1ude competing generic products or trademarked products sold by companies with more limited promotional capabilities. (b) Patents. An inventor of a patented drug or manufacturing process is provided with a I7- year period for the exc1usive use of such drug or process. This legal monopoly is an absolute barrier to competition , since no one else can sell the patented product or use the patented process without the permission of the inventor. One of the aJternatives of competing with patented drugs - development of a competing therapeutic substitute - is available only to firms with substantial financial resources and research laboratories. Although an inventor of a patented drug can license others , such licenses arc often not granted unless the patentee obtains a license on an important patented product or process. As a resuJt , licenses arc not exchanged except among the larger , established drug houses. Even after a patent expires , entry into the product line does not necessarily become easier since the patentee s brand name will have become established with doctors over the I7 years the patented drug is protected. (c) High Cost of Research and Devel.prMnt.. New products are the life blood\" of the drug industry, and research and development is a Jong, difficult , and compJicated process. Hundreds or even thousands of compounds may be investigated of which only a handful wi11 prove to be worthy of further trial. After a product is developed it must , in addition, undergo extensive and expensive clinical testing to determine safety and efficacy as required by the laws enforced by the Food and Drug Administration. A study by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association found a ratio of research budget to sales of 11 to 11. percent , underscoring the substantiality of the costs of doing pharmaceutical research. This cost of ethical research represents a higher budgetary commitment tban in almost any other industry. The Bureau of Census - Kational Science Foundation study of research and development computed an R&D to sales ratio for the pharmaceutical industry in 1970 of 6. 5 percent while for all other industries , the study found an average ratio of only 3. 8 percent. The drug industry ratio was the third highest of the 20 industries surveyed , exceeded only by electrical equipment and aircraft missiles. 30. Product differentiation is an important entry barrier among proprietary drugs. Through heavy advertising of brand names , major pharmaceutical manufacturers have established a competitive advan- tage in marketing. Public acceptance is greater when there is familiarity with a company name or a trademark.

Table II suprashows and eight- firm concentra- tion ratios (CR' s) in the major markets were virtually unchanged after the 1970 merger.

The Commission finds that the firms ' market shares in the ethical drug and overal1 drug markets are too smal1 and had too insignificant an effect on concentration to create a presumption il1egality in either market. 39. Furthermore , the merger did not accompany any clear trend or movement toward concentration in these markets. This is indicated not only by Table II suprawhich is based on the DKK industry statistics but is also borne out by available Census concentration ratios. The drug industry embraces two four- digit Census categories , 28, Pharmaceu- tical Preparations , and 2831 , Biological Products. The four- firm and eight-firm concentration ratios for these two categories up to the time of the merger have been: (17J TABLE VI CONCENTRATION IN SIC 2884 281 (BwWgical Products) CR8 1958 1963 1966 1967 1970 (CX 727) Trends in the four- firm and eight- firm concentration ratios are general1y regarded as having more significance than 20- firm concen- tration ratios in measuring competitive structure.

Although the existence of high entry barriers is a factor in weighing the loss of Parke , Davis as an independent firm in the market, other factors greatly minimize the horizontal effects of the merger in the overall markets. These factors include the lack of direct competition between Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis in many individual end-use submarkets. The two companies ' combined sales in the submarkets where we find each substantially competited with the other would amount to less than . 5 percent of total industry sales in both the ethical and the overall drug lines of commerce. Another factor tending to reduce the competitive significance of the merger is the rapid decline in the drug industry and ethical segment experienced hy Parke, Davis in recent years. 3 Warner- Lambert has never been among the leading ethical drug firms. It ranked 15th in 1957 and still I5th in 1969. 41. The Commission finds there has been no showing that competition may be substantially lessened in the overall drug industry and ethical drugs segment as a result of the acquisition.

Complaint counsel contend that the merger has eliminated both actual (what in the complaint is alleged as \" substantial existing (SE)\" and potential (\" PE\") competition between Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis.' The complaint itself charged that the merger would eliminate SE competition in five therapeutic submarkets. The remain- ing therapeutic submarkets involved contentions that Warner- Lam- bert or Parke , Davis was eliminated as a significant potential competitor because it was contemplating entry or already had a toehold position in a market where the other was strong. Complaint counsel , after the hearing, increased the number of alleged SE submarkets. They are now proposing eight SE submarkets: thyroid preparations , cough remedies , cold ethically, and anti-anginal drugs. We will deal first with the contentions relating to the eight alleged SE submarkets and then take up the remaining suhmarkets. (20) A. THYROID PREPARATJO?\"S 43. \"Hypothyroidism \" is the condition resulting from undersecre- tion by the thyroid gland of thyroid hormone , a substance having as its principal function the regulation of metabolic processes and rates within the body. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include general loss of energy, greater periods of sleep, slower response , preference for warm environment , weight gain , and slower pulse rate. The standard treatment for hypothyroidism is the administration of thyroid hormone. Notuml Thyroid ThRrap-y 44. The two principal aetive chemical components of natural thyroid hormone are thyroxine (T-4) and jiothyronine (T- 3), both of which contain large proportions of iodine. While both T - 3 and T -4 aet to increase body metabolism , they differ in that T- 3 is both more potent and more rapid-acting. :\\ atural thyroid therapy dates back to the turn of the century but thyroid did not become a U. S. Pharmacop- eia (\"L'SP\" ) product until the late 1920' s or early 1930' s. To meet USP The dispute ubmarkeL the distinction made in the complaint bctwe\u20acn the PE and the existing, imminent , or recent EIR\"cI!lifir-'tiuns insofar a', \" irnrnioent or reent\" competition is allegely involved.

It must also contain no less tban 0. I7 percent nor more than 23 percent iodine , which, as noted above , is an index of the active ingredient of a thyroid hormone. In the natural state thc T -4 and T- components of thyroid hormone are not found separately but only as part of the total thyroid complex. 45. At the time of tbis merger Parke , Davis had long been marketing two natural tbyroid products: \" tbyroid USP\" and a \"thyroid strong, \" which is 50 percent again as potent as thyroid USP. Since I940 Warner- Lambert had also been marketing a natural product under the trade name \" ProJoid.\" \" Proloid\" is called tbyroglobulin \" rather than \" thyroid USP\" hut it is a desiccated tbyroid which meets l;SP standards and differs from thyroid USP in that it has been further washed and cleaned to remove certain inert ma terials. Syntlwtic Thyroid Tlwrapy 46. Thyroid preparations have also been made by chemical synthesis for about 20 years. The earliest synthetics were either T- alone or T- 3 alone. In late I969 Warner- Lambert brought out the first synthetic combination of T-4 and T- , (2IJ known generically as liotrix under the brand name Euthroid. By 1970 synthetic thyroid prepara- tions accounted for 49.4 percent of the dollar value of all thyroid purchases by U. S. hospitals and drug stores (up from 46. 1 percent in I969), leaving natural thyroid preparations with 50. 6 percent of the total value. In view , however , of much higher prices generally charged for synthetics , it can be inferred that considerably less than half of all thyroid tablets purchased in I970 were synthetic. According to one witness, most thyroid patients are still on natural thyroid therapy (Tr. 64I-64). 47. Parke , Davis markets only unbranded thyroid. bert only branded thyroid: The nonsynthetic , purified product Proloid, and the synthetic T- 4/T-3 combination , Euthroid. Complaint counsel urge that all thyroid preparations , including both branded and unbranded products , comprise a single line of commerce for Section 7 purposes. Respondent disputes this , contending that unbranded and branded thyroid preparations each compete only in separate markets. However, as indicated below , we find that the manufacture and sale of all thyroid preparations are a proper line of commerce for purposes of this case. a The le!Jt expensive thyroid pnxuc aTe the USP preparations.

There is almost complete therapeutic substitutability between al1 kinds of thyroid preparations , natural and synthetic , for treatment The exceptions to this rule are minor. One requires recourse to T- 3 only in certain situations. The T- 3 component of thyroid hormone is more potent and acts more quickly (and by the same token has a shorter duration of action) than the T - 4 component or any natural or synthetic combination of T- 4 and T-3 (Tr. 634- 635). For that reason the use of T- alone may be preferred for quick diagnoses or in case of therapeutic emergencies. Another exception is the occasional need for injectable administration to unconscious patients , available only in the case of synthetic thyroid preparations (Tr. 639; Tr. 1835). Otherwise the indications for use of al1 thyroid preparations , natural and synthetic alike, are substantially identical. (22) 49. The only advantage of synthetic over natural thyroid lies not in any superior therapeutic qualities but rather in its known , fixed content which permits better control over the chemical purity of the material and thus facilitates blood testing in aid of diagnosis and/or therapy. The variation inherent in different individual animal thyroid glands, for example , may yield T- 4/T-3 ratios ranging from 2- 1 to 5- By contrast , the T -4/T - 3 ratio in synthetic thyroid may be standarized during manufacture. In chemical assays synthetic hormones with known, fixed T -4/T- 3 content tend to 6rive more reproducihle chemical analysis results which vary less with the material than in the case of natural hormones. Since such blood tests perform a useful function in aid of the attending physician s diagnosis and therapy, the somewhat greater accuracy of tests performed with synthetic thyroid may be considered a quality advantage. The quality advantage , however , is only a \" rather minor \" one of paticnt management , yielding no advantage in clinical results , according to complaint counsel's pharma- cological expert , Dr. Standaert. (Tr. 640 , 641, 642). This is becausc in the last analysis chemical assays are merely aids to a physician s judgment from pragmatic , clinical testing which must always prevail (Standaert Tr. 642; see also Model1 Tr. 3368), even if it seems contradictory of the blood test results. Dr. Mark Lund , a former Warner-Chilcott thyroid research director , testified that , while he would expect lab results with synthetic combinations to be more predictable than with natural products because of greater consistency, he was not sure whether these variations would be \" clinical1y important\" (Tr. 1845). No witness questioned Dr. Lund' s skepticism of Dr. Standaert' s ultimate conclusion that the general1y lesser variation918 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIO Findings of Facts and CDnclusions of Law 87 F. in T -4/T -3 ratio characteristic of synthetic thyroid \" has no real practical effect on the way you manage the patient \" because \" you can achieve the same goal with an of them. You regulate your dose of an of them (natural and synthetic alike J to achieve this goal the same way (Tr.641-42). The Commission finds that while the known , fixed content of synthetic thyroid to some extent facilitates chemical assays in aid of clinical judgment , this is at most a minor quality advantage against which must be weighed the long and satisfactory experience which the medical profession has had with natural thyroid and does not require subdivision of thyroid sales for purposes of antitrust analysis. (23J Buying Practices 50. Thyroid preparations are dispensed only on a physician prescription. The fact that the prescribing physician makes the choice as to the thyroid preparation means that price competition between thyroid products manufactured by different companies win be a factor for a pbarmacist or patient only if tbe physician omits to specify a particular brand. Altbough , as respondent contends , most physicians may tend to be fixed in their prescribing habits in this as in other areas of treatment (some preferring a brand natural thyroid , some prefer- ring a branded synthetic thyroid), pbysicians are stin free to take price into consideration and some , even if a minority, are presumably conscious of price differences between unbranded and branded since a substantial number prescribe the former despite promotions of the latter. Furthermore , we cannot assume that physicians arc so fixed in their prescribing habits that a substantial increase in the existing price differential between branded and non branded thyroids would never cause a shift toward more prescriptions of lower priced thyroid. Warner-Lambert's own advertisement (CX 910) assumes that prescrib- ing habits are not immutable , as it indicates how patients may be switched to Euthroid from other natural or synthetic thyroid preparations , whether branded or unbranded. We therefore reject respondent's contention that branded and unbranded thyroid prepara- tions must be placed in separate product markets. Market Structure and Market Shares 51. Purchases of an thyroid preparations by U.S. drug stores and hospitals, which by stipulation of the parties , are to be treated as a reasonable approximation of the entire U. S. market for thyroid preparations are set forth in the fonowing table. (24 T ABl.E IXWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 919 812 .Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law Thyroid Preparations I969 and I970 U.

As indicated in Table IX , the top four suppliers , including Warner-Lambert, accounted for about 80 percent of all purchases in 1969 and 82 percent in 1970 . while the top eight suppliers , including both Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis, accounted for 87 percent of all purchases in 1969 and about 89 percent in 1970. Thus , the tbyroid preparations manufacturing market is highly concentrated. Competitive Injury 53. On the basis of the 1970 market shares shown in Table IX , the acquisition of fifth-ranked Parke , Davis by third-ranked Warner- Lambert made the latter the first-ranked firm in the market and increased four- firm concentration from 82.4 percent to 87. 0 percent. The market share for Parke , Davis (4. 6 percent) understates the importance of that company s position in the market since Table IX is based on dollar sales. In view of the fact that Parke , Davis' USP thyroid sells for one- ha1f to one- fourth the price of branded thyroid preparations , Parke, Davis has a higher market share based on unit sales. (Three of the four leading companies , Flint, Warner- Lambert and SKF , sell only branded thyroids. The fourth , Armour , sells both920 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conc1usions of Law 87 F. branded and unbranded thJToid preparations. Parke , Davis, Lilly, and Rexall sell only unbranded thyroid products). 53a. The Commission finds that such an increase of concentration in a market already concentrated substantially lessens competition within the meaning of Section 7. The high degree of concentration substantially augmented by this merger , outweighs any countervailing considerations based on the fact that Warner- Lambert' s thJToid products are sold at a different price level than Parke , Davis' and thatentry barriers in this submarket may not be as high as other therapeutic submarkets. The presence of an independently priced Parke, Davis ' product is necessary to assure physicians the choice of prescribing a lower- priced product. (26) B. COLGH REMEDIES 54. A cough can be treated either by eliminating the underlying cause - removing a foreign particle or curing an infection - or by treating the cough itself symptomatically. Symptomatic treatment can be accomplished either by relieving the irritation locally or by suppressing the cough reflex in the brain. Materials which act locally to accomplish symptomatic cough relief include demulcents , local anesthetics and expectorants. Demulcents arc soothing sJTuPy or sugary substances which soothe the irritated surface. Local anesthetics inelude substances such as chloroform , hexylresorcinol and benzocaine. Expectorants arc used to induce secretions in the lung portion of the respiratory tract thinner so it can be coughed out. Expectorants include simple salts and certain herbal substances. 55. Materials which act on the brain , or central nervous system , to inhibit the cough reflex are known as antitussives. The most widely used antitussives arc codeine and dextromethorphan. Codeine has several undesirable side effects , including constipation , dizziness confusion and , in some instances , addiction. As a result , it is regulated as a \"Class V\" narcotic , requiring that all purchasers thereof register with a pharmacist. Dextromethorphan is as effective as codeine but has fewer side effects; in particular , it has a markedly smaller tendency toward abuse and is , therefore , not regulated in the same way as codeine. For these reasons , there is now a tendency, in cough preparations , to use dextromethorphan in preference to codeine. Dextromethorphan can be and is incorporated in cough drops , lozenges syrups , and tablets and its mechanism is the same regardless of product form. 56. There are essentially three physical forms in which cough remedies are manufactured: (I) liquid sJTups designed to be swal- lowed, (2) tablets and capsules designed to be swallowed , and (3) coughWARNER- LA:\\!BERT CO. 921 812 Findin,6rs of Facts and Conclusions of Law drops and lozenges , designed to be dissolved in the mouth. The liquid preparations can contain antitussives , expectorants , demulcents (usually the syrupy base) or any combination of these three. The tablets and capsules can contain antitussives and/or expectorants. Since the tablets and capsules are designed to be swallowed and not dissolved, there would be no point in incorporating a demulcent therein. Cough drops and lozenges always contain a demuJcent base which may be accompanied by antiseptics , local anesthetics , dextrome- thorphan , or any combination of these three. (27) 57. Cough remedies are marketed as either proprietary or ethical products. Of the ethical products , some are available by prescription only, while others can be purchased by consumers \" over the counter \" (the so-ca11ed \" ethical OTC\" drugs). Parke, Davis' Cough Remedy Products 58. Parke , Davis' position in the prescription cough medication field is due primarily to Beny!in Expectorant and Ambenyl Expectorant. Benyl?n the menthol and a1cohol. $3, 600000. Ambenyl is also of $1 500000. 59. Parke , Davis also markets several Expectorant Sy' rup with Tar (1970 other generic OTC's - Terpin Hydrate and Codeine Elixir P. D. & Co., Expectorant Mixture Solution and White Pine Compound Syrup - with total 1970 sales of $95 000, were discontinued in July and August of 1970. Parke, Davis has also marketed three branded ethical cough syrups Cosanyl . Cosanyl- DM and Cosadein. I970 , a new product Cosanyl- DM Cough Syrup (Improved Formula) was marketed and subsequently the o1d formulation of Cosanyl- , as wen as Cosanyl, was discontinued on January 13 , I971. The record does not show whether the Cosadein formulation was discontinued or whether similar \" improved n formulations of Cosanyl and Cosadein were ever introduced. Factory sales in I970 of the three old formulations were: Cosany 6::922 FEDERAL TRADE CO:lMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law87 F. Cosanyl-DM Cough Syrup (Improved Formula) appears to have annual factory sales of approximately $214 000. 61. Parke , Davis Medicated Throat Discs is a compressed lozenge composed of chloroform and various essential oils. It had 1969 factory sales of $I 506000. (28 J Warner-Lambert's Cough Remedy Products 62. Warner Lambert markets no ethical OTC cough preparations; and with the exception of some proprietary cough syrups (factory sales totaling $106 000 in 1970), and a prescription cough/cold preparation Ni/.ol (factory sales in 1970 - $700000) Warner- Lambert' s cough preparations are proprietary cough drops and lozenges , consisting of; (a) Smith Brotlurs Couh Drops. Factory sales of Smith Brothers Cough Drops was $2 260 000 in I970. (b) Hall's Mentho-Lyptus Cough Tablets contain menthol and eucalyptus oil as active ingredients. In I970, Hall's had factory sales of $6 000000. (c) Listerine Throat Lozenges contains the topical anesthetic hexylresorcinol as its active ingredient. It is promoted for relief of sore throat pain , but respondent agrees that it is also a cough remedy product. Sales of Listerine Throat Lozenges were $7 200000 in I970. (d) The only antitussive- containing cough drop or lozenge marketed by Warner-Lambert is Listerine Cough Control Lozenges containing the antitussive dextromethorphan and the local anesthetic benzocaine. Market Definition 63. Complaint counsel contend that all products useful against coughs constitute a market. Respondent takes the position that all cough remedies cannot be placed in one market , that cough drops and lozenges constitute a market separate from cough syrups. The record demonstrates , however, that all cough remedy preparations have the same end use e. symptomatic treatment of cough. This is confirmed by a comparison of the advertising for respondent' s cough syrups - \" * * * gives prompt relief from coughs * * * \" (CX 1497) with that for its cough dropsg. HalJ's Mcntholyptus Cough Drops \" For temporaryrelief of coughs * * * \" (CX I507) - and for its cough lozenges Parke , Davis ' Medicated Throat Discs - \" Effective for the quick relief of coughs * * * \" Both prescription and non- prescription cough preparations have this same end use; e. the symptomatic treatment of relief of coughs. For example , Warner- Lambert' s prescription product Nilcol is indicated for \"* * * symptomatic relief of congestion and cough in upper respiratory disorders \" (CX 1495); Parke , Davis non- prescription product Cosanyl is indicated for \" relief of irritating coughWARNER-LAMBERT CO. 923 812 Findings of FacL'i and Conclusions of Law, , ' \" (CX 1539). Other than the situation where a product has to be dispensed on prescription , conRUmers purchase cough preparation on the recommendation of physicians , (29) even though the product does not require a prescription , on the recommendation of pharmacists , and by their own choice (Tr. 755; 1689- 1691). :varket surveys made for Warner-Lambert show that consumers use drops , lozenges , tablets and capsules as well as syrups , variously, to treat coughs. (CX 1486- 1487). The only exception is where a physician may want to prescribe larger amounts of codeine or an antihistamine or decongestant than is found in an ethical OTC or proprietary product. Even here there is competitive substitutability. To the extent a consumer treats himself with a cheaper proprietary or over- the-counter remedy when a physician might have prescribed an RX syrup, and vice versa , demand is transferred from one type of product to the other. Warner- Lambert itself test-markets cough drops against syrups indicating that its marketing department recognizes that these products are in a common product market. Considering all the circumstances , we find that ali cough preparations constitute an appropriate line of commerce even though \" cough drops and lozenges \" and \"cough syrups \" constitute separate submarkets (Finding 68 infra). Market Structure 64. Data in the record shows the following estimate of market size (census data) and shares: TABLE X Cough Remedies 1968 1969 Universe (Census) W arner- Lambert Parke, Davis $18100 (30) The combined firms shared 7. 6 percent of this $200 million nationwide market in 1968 and a percent more in 1969 , not including Warner Lambert' s $5.2 million sales of Hajj's cough drops. DKK' s 1969 survey of hospitals and drug stores gave Parke , Davis 3rd rank with 6. percent of the market and Warner- Lambert 10th rank with 2. 9 percent of the market (CX 3457). . Excludes Halls Mentho-Lyptu3 sales , which aN' from England and are therefore , not inciuded in SIC measurc ufdomcstic production924 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIO;' DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 FTC. 65. The market is concentrated. Although census figures are not available with which to construct concentration ratios exactly, in the hospitaJ-drug store market sampJed by DKK the four largest firms had 45 percent in 1969 and the eight largest 63 percent (CX 3457). The acquisition raised four- firm and eight- firm concentration nearly 3 percent. 66. There are also substantial barriers to effective competition at the marketing distribution level. In addition to the barriers concerning the generation of physician prescription by brand name and insuring availabi1ity of the product in retail outlets , there are the marketing and merchandising barriers necessary to successful creation and fulfilment of a consumer demand for proprietary products. 67. Although nearly all of Warner- Lam bert's cough remedy sales are of cough drops and lozenges , and ovcr 83 percent of Parke , Davis sales are of cough syrups , the differing characteristics of these two types of products (drops and lozcnges versus syrups) are not so extreme as to e1iminate the inference of substantial anticompetitive effects indicated by the market shares held by each firm in this market. In so finding, we have taken into consideration the following additionaJ facts. (a). Prior to its acquisition by Warner- Lambert, Parke, Davis was activeJy seeking to improve its position in this market both by an increased marketing and promotional effort for existing products , and by new product development. In December 1968 , Parke , Davis commissioned a marketing study to determine the adequacy of its promotiollal program for Beny1in Expectorant. (CX 1564- 1569). In Expecto- the-counter (CX 492), anticipating (3I J an OTC volume of $1.8 million in six months (CX 587). (Beny1in is now sold as an over- the-counter cough syrup. ) To achieve a \" substantial increase\" in total volume by virtue of OTC sales , (CX 1577), Parke Davis planned to supplement existing medical advertising with an additional $125 000 for medical journals , $65000 for direct mail and $225000 for retail promotion of Benylin OTC (CX 494). In February and March of 1970 , Parke, Davis' ability to develop and market cough preparations is attested to by its own marketing personnel the 1970 marketing plan stated: Opportunities are available to improve our Expectorant market penetration. The introduction of two proposed new Beny1in formulations in 1971 could produce $1 000000 or more in a relatively short period of time (CX 493). (b). Warner- Lambert has had a substantial commitment to basicWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 925 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law and applied research with the ohjective of developing \" new drugs and/or drug combinations superior to existing marketed products used in the cough- cold area in respect to potency, efficacy, onset and duration of action; \" in 1969 expenditures totalled $281 400, included in which are grants and fellowships to \" experts and centers prominent in respiratory research\" (CX 15I2). Similar expenditures in 1970 for proprietary drugs in the area of respiratory research amounted to $230000 (CX I5I8). This research has included studies of expectorants because of Warner- Lam bert's \" potential interest \" (CX 1513), and the evaluation of bronchodilators and antihistamines antitussive activity (CX 1512 , ex 1519). Warner- Lambert also expends substantial 1519- 1520, CX 1516 , CX 1511). As the result of a development project which cost over $50 000 in the first half of I970 alone (CX 1516), Warner Lambert has also introduced a new product: Listerine Cough Control Lozenges. (32) Although , as noted , Warner- Lambert' s sales are heavily weighted toward cough drops and lozenges , it has been developing syrup products. In addition to Nilcol , introduced in 1970 , it has test marketed a Silenex brand cough syrup and has under development Smith Brothers Cough Syrup. Its total syrup sales (including Nilcol) have been expanded several fold between I968 and 1970 (CX 1462 , RX I797). (c). Prior to the acquisition , Warner- Lambert was increasing its market share. Table X supra. In conclusion , we find that the merger substantially lessened competition in the cough remedies. (33) C. COLGH DROPS AND LOZEI\"GES 68. Cough drops and lozenges have particular characteristics and uses which set them apart as a separate submarket of cough remedies in general. They are more portable than liquid cough remedies and arc often used for coughs of less severity. In addition , there are some differences between cough drops and cough lozenges that indicate that competition intra drops and intra lozenges is greater than between drops and lozenges. They arc often displayed at different points in the retail store. Cough drops are usually located at the candy counter while lozenges are general1y found on the drug counter. Cough drops are generally priced below 7 $.40 , while lozenges are priced at $. 70 up to two dollars. :levertheless , respondent does not dispute that cough drops and lozenges together constitute a relevant \" line of commerce. 69. Respondent further agrees that Warner- Lambert was among , P!Ikc, Davi8' loZ\u20acnge product , Medicate Throat Discs , is an exc.eption since it retails at II price around forty cent..926 FEDERAL TRADE COM ISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. the leading firms in the cough drop and lozenge market with about a 27 percent market share , and that Parke , Davis' share was almost 3 percent. Warner- Lambert markets two cough drops - Smith Brothers Cough Drops , Hall's Mcntho- Lyptus Cough Tablets - and two cough Lozenges and Listerine Cough Control Lozenges. Parke , Davis' position in this market is due entirely to Medicated Throat Discs. Respondent argues that Parke , Davis' position should be disregarded because its only product in this market was outmoded\" in I970. The record shows that instead of being an outmoded\" product , Parke, Davis' Medicated Throat Discs have been popular for many years. In the two years prior to the merger Medicated Throat Discs increased in sales from $I.4 to $1.5 millon and Parke, Davis officials anticipated a further increase in both dollar and unit sales in 1970 (CX 1574). Although Medicated Throat Discs were not distributed to food stores , it was a successful over- the-counter product in drug stores as witnessed by a Parke , Davis study showing that \" one out of every four throat lozenges sold in drug stores in 1968 was an MTD (Medicated Throat Disc)\" (CX I573). (34J Market Size and Structure 70. Total U. S. shipments of cough lozenges are listed by Census at $22.3 million in 1968 and $20. 6 million in 1969. From company figures Warner-Lambert had sales of $4.4 million in 1968 or 19.9 percent of all cough lozenges , and sales of $6. 7 million in 1969 or 32. 6 percent of all cough lozenges. Parke , Davis had sales of $1. 4 million in 1968 or 6.4 percent of all cough lozenges , and sales of $1.5 million in 1969 or 7. percent of all cough lozenges. This acquisition , therefore , results in a combined share of cough lozenges of 26. 3 percent in I968 and 39. percent in 1969. While Census lists lozenges separately, it does not break out cough drops as a separate category. Nevertheless the parties have stipulated that market survey data prepared by A. C. Nielsen Co. on cough drops are sufficiently reliable and accurate to establish total and company sales of cough drops (Tr. 1454). Total U. S. sales of cough drops were $31.0 million in 1969 and Warner- Lambert had a volume of $7. 1 milion or 22. 9 percent of all cough drops sold in I969. Warner- Lambert increased this share to 25. 0 percent in 1970. Combining the two sets of data, (Census and Nielsen), Warner- Lambert's share of the lozenges- and-drops market in 1969 would amount to 26. 8 percent and Parke Davis' share would be 2. 9 percent. 71. The market for cough drops and lozenges is highly concentrat- ed. In cough drops , according to Nielsen , three firms Richardson- Merrell, Warner- Lambert and Ludens had 84.4 percent in 1969 and 85.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 927 812 Findings of Fact.o: and Conclusions of Law percent in 1970 (CX 1463). In the DKK category \" Throat Prepara- tions\" which is the one containing Parke , Davis and Warner- Lambert cough lozenge products , the four largest firms had 85. 2 percent and the eight largest 96. 2 percent in 1969 (CX 3456). In this connection , it is noted that the total projected by DKK for its category \" Throat Preps - $I9. 3 milion in I969 (CX 3456) - closely correlates with Census figures for cough lozenges: $20. 6 million in 1969 (CX 1464). Concentra- tion ratios are availabJe for purchases by the hospital- drug store segment of the market , and show that the four largest firms had 76. percent of combined cough drops and Jozenges in hospital/drug store (CX 3459). Considering the high concentration shown by DKK for Throat Preparations (i.lozenges) separately (CX 3456) and for drops and lozenges together (CX 3459) and the high concentration in cough drops which Kielsen reports for both food and drug stores (CX 1463), it is reasonable to infer that concentration will be high in all outlets including those not sampled by Nielsen or DKK. (35 Competitive Injury 72. Warner- Lambert has been a market leader in solid- form cough preparations. In addition to Smith Brothers cough drops , Warner- Lambert acquired Hall' s Mentho- Lyptus cough tablets in 1964 and has steadily increased its sales from $3. 7 million in I968 to about $6 million (CX 1508; CX 1481). In 1969 , Warner- Lambert ranked second in cough drop sales with a market share of approximately 23 percent. In addition , with its Listerine Jozenge products it had 20 percent of cough lozenge shipments in 1968 (CX I464). Parke , Davis had 6.4 percent of cough lozenge shipments that year. In view of the fact that the merger gave Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis a combined 29. 7 percent share of cough drops and lozenges against a background of high concentra- tion, the Commission finds that injury to competition has been demonstrated in this line of commerce. The loss of Parke , Davis' as an independent firm is particularly detrimentaJ to competition in view of the fact that it priced its Medicated Throat Discs considerably lower than other brand name lozenge cough products sold directly in competition with it on shelves in drug stores. Medicated Throat Discs with 60 discs in a box sold at a retail price around $. 37. Merck' s Sucrets is described in the record as selling at $. 98 for a box of 55 discs. Squibb' s \"Spec T\" lozenges were packaged with 24 discs for $1. 98 and also 10 discs for $1.00 (CX product.928 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIO:\\S Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. D. COLD REMEDIES 73. A cough , of course , can easily occur with a cold and frequently does. Yet coughs arise from many conditions not associated with colds. When they do occur with colds , they usually follow the onset of the nasal symptoms with some lapse in time. There is an industry and public recognition of a distinction between \" cold preparations \" and cough preparations the latter are primarily designed to relieve against coughs in general or coughs due to colds or allergies. There is no \"cure\" for a cold and treatment by taking a \" cold remedy \" is therefore directed at relieving against the nasal symptoms of a cold e. nasal swelling, stuffiness or excessive nasal secretions and postnasal drip. Some products are promoted as remedies for both nasal symptoms of a cold and coughs due to colds (referred to herein as cough/cold preparations ) and are considered as part of both the cold remedies market and tbe cough remedies market. (36) 74. Warner- Lambert marketed several cold remedies in 1969 and I970: Sinutab and Sinutab II introduced in September I970. Parke , Davis marketed three cold remedies during that time: Coryza Rx A Richards CCT tablets and Rhinitis Full Strength CCT tablets , two old products with de minimis sales and Cosanyl-DM Cough Syrup (Improved Formula , containing nasal decongestant). In addition , complaint counsel as cold remedies. Respondent contends that these syrups arc not substantially used for treating nasal symptoms of the colds and therefore do not fall within the cold remedies market. Both Ambenyl and Benylin were included by complaint counsel in the cough remedies market supra. This was clearly correct as they are promoted for the \" control of cough due to cold or allergy. \" As indicated below , the record , however , does not support classifying them also as cold remedies significant treatments for nasa1 symptoms of colds. 75. Benylin Expectorant contains the following ingredients: (a) Berwryl which is an antihistamine useful in combatting an allergic component in whatever condition is being treated. Specifically, since Benylin Expectorant is indicated \" as an antitussive and expectorant for control of cough due to cold or allergy, \" tbe function of the BendryJ in this particular preparation would be to deal with cough of allergic origin. In a cough due to a viral infection and resultant nasal congestion and runny nose , the Benadryl would probably not be effective, although it may have some drying action on the nasalWARXER- LAMBERT CO. 929 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law passageway (Tr. 3720). Benadryl also has as an approved claim an antitussive action , and this is the primary purpose for its inclusion in the product (Tr. 36I6 , 3618) even though some authorities question its effectiveness as an antitussive (Tr. 3720). (h) Amrrnium chloride and sodium expectorants that stimulate bronchial and nasal secretions and act as lubricants by thinning out more viscous secretions (Tr. 3719). The amounts in Benylin Expectorant are subtherapeutic (Tr. 3618), but expectorant action was the rationale for their inclusion when the product was origina1ly formulated (Tr. 3617). (e) ChlorofoTm which is designated as an anesthetic for the throat (Tr. 37I9), but is probably just a flavoring agent in the product (Tr. 3618; Chusid 3719). (d) Menthol which is for flavoring. (e) Alcoholwhich is the vehicle that renders the other in\"rredients soluble (Tr. 3617; Tr. 37I9). (37) 76. Ambenyl Expectorant differs from Benylin Expectorant only in that (1) it replaces sodium citrate with the expectorant potassium guaiacolsulfonate , (2) adds hydra- mine of Benadryl , and (3) adds codeine , a Ambenyl and Benylin have same action , with the exception that Ambcnyl has more of an antitussive effect due to the addition of codeine. 77. It is undisputed that antihistamines alone are of no use in combatting nasal congestion resulting from a viral infection and are therefore not considered specific remedies for the common cold. Furthermore , combining an antihistamine with antitussives and expectorants docs not give the antihistamine any more anti-cold effectiveness than it would have alone (Tr. 3724). For these reasons , in an ordinary viral cold situation (i.absent any allergic clement), the antihistamine components of Ambenyl Expectorant and Beny1in Expectorant contribute nothing to combatting the cold' s symptoms (Tr. 3725). 78. Dr. E. Leslie Chusid , an expert in pulmonary diseases who teaches, publishes , and consults extensively in the field , testified that he is aware of no physician who prescribes either Ambenyl Expecto- rant or Benylin Expectorant to combat congestion caused by the common cold. Dr. Mickey C. Smith , Chairman of the Department of Health Care Administration at the university of Mississippi , testified that in several years as a practicing pharmacist , during which he fi1led a numher of prescriptions for both Ambenyl and Benylin , these products were prescribed for cough. Frequently, they would be prescribed as concomitant therapy with an antibiotic or a deconges- tant/antihistamine combination. Complaint counsel's expert pharma-930 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and O:mclusions of Law 87 F. cologist, Dr. Standaert , testified that those who would use Ambenyl and Benylin as cold remedies would be doing so \" (iJn spite of the best teaching of we pharmacologists \" that antihistamines are not effective in such situations (Tr. 924). 79. Data derived from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index strongly confirm the observations of these experts. They show that from 1969 through the first half of 1973 , offce-based physicians prescribed Ambenyl Expectorant for cough approximately 87. 9 percent of the time , and for cold only 6. 6 percent of the time (RX 2229). Similarly, during the same time period , these physicians prescribed Benylin Expectorant for cough approximatcly 87. 2 percent of the time and for cold only 5. 3 percent of the time (RX 221). Parke , Davis journal advertising and detailing of Ambenyl and Benylin Expecto- rants reveal that they have both been promoted solely for cough. (38J Industry classification treat Ambenyl and Beny1in neither as a cold preparation \" or a \"cough/cold preparation \" but classify them only as \" cough preparations \" (RX 1495; 1498) because they lack a decongestant (Tr. 3308). r:ompetitive Effect 80. Since Ambenyl and Benylin are not cold remedies , Parke, Davis share of the cold market is de minimis. Its Coryza and Rhinitis tablets had combined 1970 factory sales of $14 000. Their sales decreased at an annual rate of 10 percent during the four previous years (CX I652). Its Cosanyl-DM Cough Syrup (Improved Formula), containing a deconges- tant, was introduced on September 1 , 1970 (CX 1701). Its annual factory sales appear to be approximately $214 000 (calculated from CX 1472). DKK reports 1970 sales of Cosanyl- DM genera11y (presumably including the old non- decongestant formula) of $368 000. According to DKK, Parke, Davis had 0. 04 percent of the cold market in I969 and using the $368 000 figure for Cosanyl- DM - 0. 16 percent of that market in 1970 (RX 2046). Furthermore , the record shows that Parke Davis has no unusual competitive potential in the cold remedies market. Warner-Lambert' s position in the cold remedies market fe11 from 9th in I969 to 10th place in 1970 , although in each year it accounted for approximately 4 percent of the market. Concentration in the cold remedies market is at a moderate level. Four- firm concentration in the market declined from 46. 98 percent in 1969 to 44. 80 percent in 1970 while eight- firm concentration decreased from 70. 09 percent to 69. percent (RX 2045). Market shares are we11 distributed. In both 1969 and 1970, seventeen firms had more than 1 percent of the market (RX 2045-46).WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 931 812 Findings of FacL\" and ConcJusions of Law The Commission concludes that , based on the above facts , there has been no showing of violation of Section 7 in the cold remedies market. (39) E. BRO:'CHIAL DILATORS 81. Bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm is a condition in which the smooth muscles of the air passages contract and make it difficult for the individual to move air in and out of the lungs. It is often associated with allergic reactions , asthma, and chronic respiratory diseases such as emphysema. At the onset of an attack the individual feels a tightening in the chest and an inability to breathe properly, accompa- nied by a whistling or wheezing sensation. If the attaek continues , he becomes less oxygenated and this in turn is reflected in a rapid heart rate. In addition , he may experience a change in cardiac output , begin perspiring, and encounter palpitations and a constricting sensation in the throat and bronchial tubes which causes a degree of anxiety and pamc. 82. The drugs employed to give symptomatic relief of bronchocon- striction and bronchospasm are generally referred to as bronchial dilators. Depending on the substance involved , bronchial dilators can be administered orally (in solid or liquid form), by aerosol inhalation , or by injection. The therapeutic use to which bronchial dilators are put depends on their dosage form. Oral preparations are used primarily in maintenance therapy and also in aborting mild , low-grade attacks. The inhalants are used to terminate acute attacks or to forestall imminent attacks. Injectable epinephrine is used as a last resort when other medication has fai1ed or by people prone to sudden life- threatening attacks. 83. Over 99 percent of Warner- Lam bert's I970 factory sales of bronchial dilators are accounted for by oral preparations. These products are: (a) Tedral; (b) ChfllarQ(;e; (c) Chol\u20acdyl\u20ac; and (d) Brondcon. In addition to these oral preparations , Warner- Lambert markets an isoproteranol inhalant Nebairwhich accounts for about 0.6 percent of Warner- Lambert' s bronchial dilator sales. Almost 99 percent , Davis' 1970 factory sales of bronchial dilators by four 1835-36); three containing epinephrine , one ephedrine. The remaining 1. percent was accounted for by an epinephrine inhalant and an oral ephedrine product. 84. Since the Warner- Lambert inhalant product and the Parke Davis inhalant and oral products all have de minimis sales, the primary issue in this alleged submarket is whether oral products , like Warner- Parke , Davis, compete in932 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. the same market. As indicated below , however , the record shows that these products arc not interchangeable in medical practice and usage and, therefore , do not substantia11y compete. 85. The oral preparations , because they are taken through the digestive system , have a delayed onset of action and a prolonged effect. They are , therefore , useful primarily in prophylactic , or maintenance , therapy. (Tr. 785; 2026). In addition , in the event of a mild or very low- grade attack , if the patient recognizes its onset in advance, he can also take an oral preparation in an attempt to abort it. An example of such an oral preparation is Warner- Lambert' s Tedral. In its various forms , it has an onset of action of 15 to 20 minutes , and except for the sustained-release form designed to be taken twice daily, has a duration of effect of three to four hours. It is used primarily as a maintenance medication , to be taken periodica11y throughout the day to prevent bronchoconstriction from occurring. (Tr. 2026; 3728). As maintenance therapy, it can be prescribed either during the entire year or only during an individual patient's \" asthma season. \" (Tr. 3728). Tedral can also be used at the onset of an attack in an attempt to ward off further symptoms. (Tr. 3728). However , if such treatment does not terminate the attack or the symptoms become more severe , some further medication would have to be employed. In this regard , the package insert for these formulations states that they \" are adjuncts in the total management of the asthmatic patient. Acute or severe asthmatic attacks may necessitate supplemental therapy with other drugs by inhalation or other routes. \" (CX I815 , 1817-I8). 86. Injectable epinephrine is not used as a maintenance therapy and would not be thought of as a maintenance- type medication. (Tr. 3729). K or is it ever used at the onset of an attack. Because of its very significant side effects , injectable epinephrine is reserved for those situations in which the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of these side effects. (Tr. 929). In practice , therefore , the injectable form of epinephrine is used as a last resort by a patient who has tried and failed to abort an attack with other medications. Fo11owing his failure to abort an attack on his own , the patient wi11 go to a hospital emergency room or his physician s office for an injection of epineph- rine. In addition , severe asthmatics susceptible to sudden , serious attacks are sometimes given injectable epinephrine to carry with them or to keep at home , since they may not have sufficient time to go to a physician s office or emergency room. In such cases , the injection (41 J may be administered by a spouse. (Tr. 928- 30; 3729-30). Even in the case of the severe asthmatic , however , such a lay-administered injection would be used only as a last resort. (Tr. 930; 3729). In additionWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 933 812 Finding' s of Facts and ConcJusions of Law to its use as a bronchial dilator , epinephrine is employed in cases of acute anaphylactic shock and in some cardiovascular cases. (Tr. 927). 87. While Tedral and other oral products arc carried by patients for use as maintenance therapy and in suppression of mild attacks , the Parke, Davis injectables are sold either to hospitals or to pharmacies for turnover sales to physicians , dentists and veterinarians for emergency use. In pricing Tedral , Warner- Lambert does not take into consideration the price of epinephrine. There is no evidence that the industry recognizes \" bronchial dilators \" including oral , inhalant and injectable preparations as a single submarket. DKK , on which complaint counsel rclY as evidence of industry recognition in other submarkets , does not classify epinephrine in the same category with the other bronchial dilators. Competitive Effect (1) No Elimirwtion of Subswntial Existing Competition 88. In a bronchial dilator market excluding sales of injectable epinephrine , the sales and market share of Parke are minimis. DKK ranks Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis as follows in such a market: 1969 1970 1971 $000 $000 $000 OveraJJ market 98., 100. 581 100. 6 1.2 100. Warner-Lambert 318 18. 164 17. 871 17. Parke, Davis The sales shown for Parke , Davis represents only their sales of ephedrine preparations. Including the sales of Parke , Davis ' other noninjectable product , its epinephrine inhalant would not materially change this result. Even in the market as defined by complaint counsel there is no lessening of competition , since the different therapeutic uses of the oral and injectable products mean that they are not interchangeable in use and , therefore , are unable to provide competi- tion against one another. Because of this lack of competition between the products , the market shares as calculated by complaint counsel -- I8.I percent for Warner- Lambert and 1.5 percent for Parke , Davis (CX I862) --- have no competitive significance. (42J (2) Loss of Parke SignificantDavis as a New Competitm is Not uikely to be 89.Complaint counsel rely, as evidence of Parke , Davis' potential934 FEDERAL TRADE CO)JMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and ConcJusions of Law 87 F. to expand , on various documents concerning Parke , Davis' dealings with Premo Labs (CX a possible purchase of oral bronchial dilators for resale. There is no particular reason to believe however, the company would be successful in substantially expanding its toehold in this market. Parke , Davis' past failure to expand its toehold position in the bronchial dilator submarket is typical of the experience of many other ethical pharmaceutical companies. Sixteen firms among the top 50 ethical companies marketed bronchial dilators at some point during the period from I958 to 1971 without ever attaining as much as 2 percent of the market during any of the six reported years. By 1971 , only two of these sixteen firms had reached even the 1 percent level , even though 12 of them had marketed a bronchial dilator at least as early as 1963. There appears to be no shortage of firms in a position comparable to Parke , Davis. F. IRRnA LAXATIVrS (ETHICAL) 90. Laxatives are products which stimulate or ease defecation. They are generally self- prescribed and can be purchased without a prescription. They are also prescribed by doctors for constipation before certain X-ray procedures and certain kinds of surgery. Many authorities believe that laxatives are overused outside physician- prescribed usages. A number of laxatives are promoted directly to the public through the media , while others are ethically promoted. Regardless of the method of promotion , all laxatives are usually shelved together in retail outlets. (Tr. 3636- 37). 91. Laxatives contain ini,'Tedients which are classified as salines softeners. A number of laxatives combine ingredients from the different pharmaco- logic categories. Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis both market laxatives. (43 J 92. Complaint counsel allege that irritant laxatives promoted ethically constitute a relevant product market. They further contend that within this alleged market , the merger has eliminated substantial existing competition. Respondent contends that complaint counsel's submarkct definition excludes many therapeutically and economically interchangeable products; that there is no basis in the record for classifying Warner- Lambert' s combination product , Agoral , as an irritant; and that even assuming complaint counsel were otherwise correct, the merger still would have no substantial anticompetitive effect.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 935 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law Lack of Public Recognition 93. Tbe pubhc does not recognize irritant laxatives as distinct from others. All of the evidence establishes that the layman is not aware of the pharmacologic distinctions among laxative ingredients and so cannot distinguish so-ca1led irritants from others. The package inserts do not provide this information; in fact , the terms \" irritant\" \" irritant ingredient \" or \" irritant laxative \" do not appear in any of the package inserts for laxatives which contain irritant ingredients. In every case the product is described simply as a \" laxative \" or \"cathartic. Moreover , nowhere in Parke , Davis' marketing documents does the term \"irritant\" \" irritant ingredient \" or \" irritant laxative \" appear. The only distinction among laxatives found in these documents is between Parke , Davis' old-fashioned laxatives and \" the 'newer' type laxatives with a stool softener (that) are now dominating the market.\" (CX 2002, 2005). :'or do laxative advertising or retail shelving practices differentiate among irritant and other laxatives. The fact that the public docs not recognize so-called irritants as distinct from other laxatives is significant because , outside of hospitals , laxatives arc primarily self- preseribed. An ethical- proprietary distinction is not competitively significant for laxatives where the consumer chooses the product (and not a physician) since OTC and proprietary laxatives are featured side- by-side on the same retail shelves. 94. Although most purchases of laxatives are not by a doctor prescription , physician-ordered use of laxatives (44J is not d.e minimis as respondent suggests. In a one year period over 12 million physician or recommendations for 1axatives were made. Recognition of an ethical\" subdivision of laxatives is therefore undoubtably justified since most physicians do not like to prescribe for patients \" popular laxatives that have been advertised on television or radio (Tr. I939; RX 24I4-16). However , among physician- directed uses of laxatives the evidence is not persuasive that irrtant laxatives constitutes a meaningful submarket. While , as noted , there are pharmacological classifications for various laxative in\"rredients , many laxative products are interchangeable in actual medical usage. Whi1c onc expert attributed an advantage to irritant ingredients as being \" sure fire (Tr. 809) another testified that salines (not classified as \" irritant\") are preferred for this purpose (Tr. 3363). In terms of safety and side effects , there is no substantial difference. (Tr. 3362). Also , complaint counsel' s expert witness testified that a product containing com/rna- tions of irritants and other ingredients , such as Warncr- Lambcrfs Agora!, would not be classified with \" sure-fire\" types. (Tr. 95I- 52). In fact, Agoral is not classified in DKK reports as an \" irritant \" laxative.936 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIOKS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. Under complaint counsel's market definition and treatment of Agoral as an irritant laxative , Warner-Lambert would be ranked eighth in 1969 with 2. 8 percent of sales , and Parke , Davis seventh with 3. percent. 95. However , complaint counsel have not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that their proposed designation of Agoral to this submarket is appropriate. Nor is there any violation in any overall laxative market. Neither party had as much as 2 percent the overall market or ranked within the top 12 firms. (45) It is concluded that the record will not support a finding of substantial lessening of competition in any laxative market as a result of the merger. G. B10LLlE:'T/PROTECTIVE PREPARATIOt-S PROMOTED ETHICALLY 96. Ethical emollient and protective dermatological preparations are creams , lotions , and ointments used to treat extremely dry skin conditions which require a high degree of lubrication. Such prepara- tions tend to have a lipid fat content of 12 percent or more and thus differ from the less greasy proprietary products which have a much lower lipid content. As indicated by the name ascribed to this market products within it must contain not only emollient ingredients but also ingredients which form a protective barrier that retains moisture and guards the skin from the elements. Products within this market are promoted to dermatologists since , for the most part , patients with dermatosis severe enough to warrant their use either seck the advice of a dermatologist or arc referred to one by a general practitioner. 97. Respondent has admitted that these preparations constitute a relevant 1ine of commerce. There is a dispute , however, as to what products are properly within it. Complaint counsel and respondent agree that the market includes the following products of Warncr- Lambert' subsidiary Texas Pharmacal , Lotion; and Phorsix Cream and Lotion. The parties also agree that the market included the Parke , Davis products Dermalac Cold Cream , and Benzoin Compound Tincture USP , with total 1970 sales of $15 000. In addition , complaint counsel contend , and respon- dent denies , that the market should include the Parke , Davis product Aerodcrm , and ointment bases manufactured by both parties. Aero- derm had 1970 sales of $104 586. If ointment bases were included in the market, Parke, Davis' sales would increase by $I27 000 to $142 000 (not including Aeroderm), and Warner- Lambert's sales would increase by $117 000 to $2 189000. 98. Oint-men! bases are vehicles in which active ingredients areWARNER- LAMBERT CO 937 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law add cd in accordance with a doctor s particular specification. The ultimate therapeutic use of ointment bases varies , depending upon the nature of the active ingredients added to the product. They are not intended for use alone and are sold in bulk containers for use hy pharmacists rather than consumers. A1though DKK classifies ointment bases as ethical emo1lient and protectives , they should be distinguished competitively from othcr products within that category discussed herein. (46 J 99. Aeroderm was not classified by DKK in the Emo1lient and Protective subdivision of Ethical Dermatologists; instead , DKK included Acroderm in a subdivision entitled \" A1l Othcr. \" Neither complaint counsel nor respondcnt included its sales in the markct share charts they introduced into evidence. Aeroderm was origina1ly introduced as \" Scrub Kreme \" for use in the operating room area of hospitals by doctors and nurses who constantly scrub their hands. Aeroderm has characteristics , uses and customers distinct from the greasy, high lipid ethical emollients and protectives promoted to dermatologists for use outside of hospitals by paticnts with cxtremely dry skin conditions (Tr. 34I9- , 3486; 3136), and it is not considered competitive with such products (Tr. 3I33- 34).100. It is clear that no violation has occurred in this market. Universe sales tota1cd $I6 to $17 million in 1969 and 1970 with Warner- Lambert's market share between 12 and I3 pcrcent , making it the second ranking firm. Parke , Davis' market share was unranked , with one-tenth of one percent in 1969 and . 09 percent in 1970. If ointment bases are inc1uded , Parke, Davis' share would increase to. 64 percent in I969 and . 76 pcrccnt in 1970 (the cffect de minimis). If Parke, Davis' sales of Aeroderm were included the latter s share would increase to no more than 1.3 percent for I970. Even this overstates the case for a horizontal violation in this market since Aeroderm was not a successful product and was withdrawn from the market in October I972 , after nearly four years of virtua1ly flat annual sales slightly in excess of $100 000. I01. Nor can Parke , Davis be viewed as an important potential re- entrant into the market. Parke , Davis carried on no research in the dermatological area. In addition to the top eight se1lers of ethical emo1lient and protective dermatological preparations , in 1970 DKK reported 77 other se1lers , many of which appear to have the resources and capabilities at least comparable to Parke , Davis. (47J Both in tcrms of promotion and product formulation , barriers to entry are low. Since ethical emollient and protective preparations are promoted solcly to a small group of 3 000 dermatologists (Tr. 3417), it is undoubtedly possible to achieve effective nationwide promotion with a 216-9\u20ac9 O-LT - 7'1 - 59938 Finr:ings of Facts and Conc1usioTis of Law 87 F. small group of detail men. The lack of significant entry barriers is confirmed by the important role that small dermatological specialty companies play in this industry. H. ANTI- ANGINAL DRUGS 102. Angina pectoris is a pain in the chest which is caused by a lack of adequate blood supply to the heart. In contrast to a fu11- fledged heart attack \" angina is a more transient affair with little or no heart damage. This cardiac ma1function , with concomitant symptomatic pain, occurs if the work demanded of the heart is greater than can be supported by the oxygen available from the blood supply. Traditionally the most common drug therapy for angina pectoris has been the administration of organic nitrates. These are combinations of nitrogen oxygen and carbon whose basic pharmacological action , is to relax the smooth muscle of the blood vessels. 103. Since anginal attacks are usually unannounced and brief (ranging from a twinge to a pain lasting at most three to five minutes), the timing of an anti-anginal drug s action (both onset and duration) is of importance and this , in turn depends on the route by which it gets into the bloodstream. In order to understand the market definition issues raised by each party, it is necessary to set forth the ways in which different anti-anginal drugs are administered and their intended purpose. (48J (a) lnhalat'/vn. The fastest method of administration is by inhalation , the breathing of a vaporized nitrate into the lungs , whence it moves into the blood stream , usually in we11 under a minute. The only therapeutic nitrate , adaptable to administration by inhalation is amyl nitrate , which despite its swift action , is not a prefelTed antianginal drug, partly because of its unpleasant , socia11y unaccepta- ble sme11 and partly because of great difficulty in contro11ing the amount of the dose (which depends in part on how the patient holds it to his nose and how big a breath he takes). (b) SubLingual or bucal odminist.rat.ion. Almost as fast as inhalation is the sublinbrual or buccal administration of a nitrate (\" sublin6rual\" meaning \" under the tongue \" and \"buccar' meaning \" within the cheek\"), in either of which cases a tablet is dissolved in the mouth and from there absorbed through the membranes of t.he mouth direct.ly and immediately into the blood stream. The nitrates \\vhich can be formulated for sublingual abortive ,\"se of s,\"b/.tngwJi nit.rates.

This is probably the most common use of these antianginaI drug-so (ii) Short term pTr,phy/()(;UC ' use of suUingunl nitmtes. Sublingual administration of nitrates may also be employed preventively in situations where the attack will probably follow shortly, as when the patient can reasonably anticipate a possible attack because he is about to undertake strenuous exereisc or undergo emotional excitement. Another preventive use for sublingual nitrates involves those patients who get an advance (\" prodromal\" ) warning of a coming attack and immediately take a rapid acting pill to relax the smooth musc1e of their blood vessels before anginal pain begin. The number of times tablets are taken for short term preventive use may, in fact , exceed the number of situations where a patient gets a real \" prodromaJ\" warning because nervous patients sometimes misinterpret other sensations as prodromal\" warnings ('11' 18'79). l19 J term J!Trl'hyl.actic 1IS(' of SI. cbling1lnl nitmlRs. Beyond actual or misinterpreted \" pronromal\" warnings , it is estimated by \\Varner- Lambert's former earciiovaseular research director , on the basis of daily tabulations and stUdies conducted regularly by Warner- Lambert thaL something like 5- IO percent of all nitroglycerin users take large quantities -- up to 50 Of even 100 nitroglycerin pills daily - in a nervous hope of thereby avoiding the feared attacks (Tr. 1880). While taking as many as 50 to 100 sublingual nitrate pils a day is by no means an approved me(hcal practice ('fl'. 1898), the fact remains that such continuous \" pill-popping\" by unduly apprehensive angina patients must be rceobrnized (is a possihly misg-uidcd but real lay use of sublingual nitrates for eontimwus prevention of anginal attacks. (c) ara adm'in'istratiJ!'n. A nitrate may also be administered orally, that is, by swallowing' iL and getting- it into the blood stream through the stomach. However , it ordinarily takes from I5- 20 minutes to 45 minutes or an hour ror a nitrate taken oral1y to get into the blood stream. Consequently oral administration is not employed to relieve an anginal attack whieh has already begun. As a result of the same 8Jow absorption into the (,I,)od wbieb makes a nitrate taken orany have a sJower onset of action than one taken sub1ingua11y, th(-: nitrate administered ora11y yields subslf1ntially thus on1y preventive proleclion ;.gainst anginal attacks. There is a wide range of duration of action and protection among nitrates taken orally: from about foLtt' hOUl' S tn six so insoluble that they are adapted oniy to oral administration. Another group of antj..anginal products arc jj beta940 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSIO:- DECISIONS Findinb'\" of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. blockers\" which are unrelated to nitrates , but perform similarly to oral nitrate preparations. 104. Complaint counsel's anti-anginal drugs submarket purports to include botb products which arc designed to abort an anginal attack and oral preparations which are designed for long- term prophylaxis. The former thus , nitroglycerin; Lambert markets only PETN under (50 J name Peritrate. Respondent contends that preparations used to abar an anginal attack , principany sublingual nitroglycerin , do not belong in the same submarket as preparations which serve only a long-term prophylactic purpose. Complaint counsel contends that competition exists , nevertheless , as the patient may either wait for an anginal attack to improve or occur , in which case he would be relegated to using a sublingual nitrate , or he or his doctor may try to reduce the number of attacks in advance by rq, rular doses of long-acting oral nitrates or beta blockers. Considerable evidence was placed in the record and relied upon by both parties in support of their respective positions , consisting, inwr alia of medical practices by physicians comparative efficacy of oral nitrate regimens (a subject of intense debate in the profession), promotional literature of oral nitrates , wide price disparity and lack of price sensitivity bctween the Jong and sbort- acting anti-anginal products. We find however , that is unnecessary to determine whether these two types of products constitute a single end- use product market , since even assuming tbey do , the record would not support a finding of violation. Market Size and Structure 105. Total purchases of an anti-anginal drugs by U. S. drug stores and bospitals , which by stipulation here are to be treated as a reasonable approximation of any U. S. anti-anginal drug manufactur- ing market , were about $55. 1 minion in I969 and $61. 8 million in 1970. Warner-Lambert's 1969 sales its oral nitrate , Peritrate were $23 minion , giving it a market share of 41.8 percent. Because (51) of inroads by the earlier appearance of beta blockers in the 1:S. market Warner-Lam bert's share dropped to 36. 5 percent in 1970 ($22. 6 minion in sales). In 1971 , Warner-Lambert was for the first time in many years passed in rank as the leading sener by American Home Products the sener of Inderal , a beta of sublingual nitroglycerin amounted to $66 000 in 1969 and $I30 000 in 1970, giving it a market ranking of 0. 1 percent and 0. 2 respectively,WAR\"'ER- LAMBERT CO. 941 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law clearly too de minimis to constitute a basis of violation on the ground that actual competition has been eliminated. 106. Nor is tbere sufficient basis for predicting that Parke , Davis would substantia1Jy improve its dR minimis market position in an anti- anginal drugs submarket. Its market share in this sub market bas historica1Jy been small. This is not an atypical performance for a Parke Davis generic product. Parke , Davis constantly evaluates its generic product line and has added products to it over the years. Among the products it considered adding to tbat line was PETN (Tr. 3582). Parke Davis determined not to add PETN because it felt that there was litte generic demand for this product; it is a higbly controversial drug; andit has only a \" possibly effective \" rating by the FDA. Even if PETN had been available to Parke , Davis for generic marketing, and there is no basis for assuming that Parke , Davis would have become a significant factor in the a1Jeged anti-anginal drugs submarket. Tbere are many companies that arc existing competitors in the anti-anginal drugs submarket. DKK reported sales by over 40 companies in I970 and by over 50 companies in 1971. Among the sellers with sma1J market sbares were many large drug companies , all of which were at least as capable as Parke , Davis of expanding their market positions. In addition to the 12 companies in 1970 with market shares of more than I percent , there were 28 other companies , in addition to Parke , Davis with sales reported by DKK in this submarket. In conclusion , we find there is insufficient evidence to find violation of Section 7 in an anti-anginal drugs submarket. (52) We now turn to the submarkets in which complaint counsel do not contend there has been a lessening of substantial existing competition between Warner- Lambert and Parke , Davis, but only a lessening of toehold and/or potential competition. I. ORAL DECO?\\GESTAt-\" I07. Sympathomimetics , or \"decongestants \" as they are ea1Jed shrink the swo1Jen lining of the nose and decrease the activity of glands in the area. The overall effect is a shrinking in nasal tissue and some drying of the lining of the nasal passages. When ora1Jy administered , decongestants enter the blood stream and , therefore reach more vessels in the naso- pharyngeal area than when topica1Jy applied; however , because oral decongestants enter the blood stream they can have a dangerous vasoconstrictive side effect elsewhere in the body. The dosage levcl of oral decongestants must , therefore , be limited. Topical decongestants have the opposite advantages and disadvantages: because they arc not systemic , they do not reach as deeply as the oral preparations. On the other hand , since they are non-942 FEDERAL TRAm: COMMISSIO DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conelusions of Law 87 r. systemic, there is no danger of untoward vasoconstrictive side effects. Respondent s position as to this market was stated as, \" While respondent does not agree that all oral decongestants , ranging from proprietary self- help remedies to more sophisticated prescription medications , belong in the same submarket , it elected to dispute this submarket solely on the issue of competitive iJljury, accepting arguendo complaint counsel's all- indusivo submarket definition. 108. hospital- drugstore market for oral decongestants com- prised $I80 million in 1969 and $200 million in I970. The oral decongestant suhmarket is moderateJy concentrated. The record shows that four- firm concentration was 43. 8 percent in 1969 and 44.4 percent in I970, while eight- firm concentration was 70 percent in 1969 and 70. percent in 1970. In I969 , Warner-Lambert ranked 9th in the oral decongestant market with sales of $9. 3 million 19I in 19m and I89 in 1970. In 1969 , Warner-Lambert ranked 9th in the oral decongestant market with sales of $9. 3 million and a 5. 1 percent market share. In I970, it ranked 8th with a volume of $10.4 million and 5. 2 percent. (RX 2060). The products accounting for Warner- Lam bert's position are described in Finding 74 supra dealing with cOld remedies. Parke Davis entered tbis submarket in 1970 , witb sales of Cosanyl- DM Cougb Syrup of $368 000, (Finding 80 sapra), which represents 0. 2 percent of the market. (53) 109. We fail to find that the record supports complaint counsel's contention that Parke , Davis had \" unusual potential\" to expand its toehold position such that the addition of Warner- Lambert' s 5. percent market share would threaten to lessen competition in a substantial manner in this product market. Among the vast number of oral decongestant suppliers , which are not presently among the leaders, there are a large number of major pharmaceutical companies. In I970 , in addition to Parke , Davis, twenty- three of the top 50 pharmaceutical firms , including eight of the top 20 , had shares of less than I percent in the oral decongestant market. The number of substantia1 existing toehold entrants is so large that the merger cannot be found to have e1iminated si6TJificant competition. J. SIl'GLE INGREDIE;-T which act against histamine , a compound produced in the body which is released when an individual is exposed to material to which he is allergic. The primary purpose of single- ingredient antihistamines is to allay the effects of various allergic reactions associated with histamine release , such as hay fever food allergy, animal dander and insect stings. Sing1e- ingredient antihistamines have a similar effect on the body, serve primarily theWARNF;R- LA/.BERT CO. 943 812 Findi\"gs at Facts and Conclusions of Law same therapeutic purpose , are substantially interchangeable and have the same basic pattern of side effects. There is no dispute concerning the definition of single- ingred;ent antihistamines as a proper submar- ket. 111. Antihistamine sales were S33. 8 million in I969 and $36. million in 1970. The mnrket is highly concentrated. In I969 , the top four firms had 7,1.6 percent of sales , the top eight firms 95.4 percent. In 1970, their ratios were approximately the same. Parke , Davis is the second largest se11er of single-ingredient antihistamines with sales of $8.4 of antihistamines , Benadryl and Ambodryl. In the past, Warner- Lambert manufactured and sold two single ingredi- ent antihistamines. Its products were discontinued in I969 when its sales had fallen to $3 000. 112. The only dispute centers around complaint counsel's conten- tion that the acquisition has eliminated Warner- Lambert as one of the most likely potential entrants. The principal evidence relied on by complaint counsel to show that Warner- Lambert is a significant potential entrant is that it has filed Abbreviated New Drug Applica- tions (ANDA' s) with the FDA on products: (54) chlorpheniramine maleate , diphenhydramine hydrochlo- ride (two dosage strengths), and tripelennamine hydrochloride (two dosage strengths) - - three antihistamines in all. The difficulty with this line of argument , however, is that if the filing of such ANDA' makes vVarner- Lambert a potential entrant , then so are dozens of other companies which , like Warner- Lambert, have filed NDA' s or ANDA' s for single- ingredient antihistamines. From January 1965 through April 1970 , twenty-one KDA' s for antihistamines were filed by fourteen companies not among the top 8 antihistamine marketers including Alcon , from I970 to 1973 , at least 110 A:-DA' s for single- ingredient antihistamines were filed by at least 52 companies (not including Warner- Lamhert). Eighty-six of these ANDA' s were for the products of the markets two leaders: forty for Schering s chlorpheniramine s have already been approved for of drug companies (RX s filing of ANDA' s was for a specialized purpose not related to full-scale entry into the single ingredient antihistm\":line market. These five A)JDA' s were among the group of A:-DA' s which Warner- Lambert filed covering a number of products as part of the developn:2nt of its s0-called \" pull-pack\" system of drug dispcm-;ing. 3408- 09). LJ Hiler system , designed strictly944 FEDERAL TRADE COM ISSION DECISIO:\\S Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. for hospitals and extended care facilities , each dose of medicine would be individually packaged in its own dispensing cup, which would be unsealed by pulling the two component parts apart. The \" pull-pack\" would provide a convenient , cost-accountab1c , child-proof method of delivering medication from the hospital pharmacy to the patient. (Tr. 3408-3472-74). :vany companies already market \" unit dose\" systems similar to the one under development at Warner- Lambert, and most major pharmaceutical companies are considering such systems. There is no evidence that Warner- Lambert is any more likely than most other major pharmaceutical companies to establish a viable position in this segment of the market. 113. Finally, there are a large number of \" toeholders \" already in the sing1c- ingredient antihistamine market , many of them among the largest ethical drug houses. In 1971 , forty-three companies each had sales of single- ingredient antihistamines amounting to less than 2 percent of the market. (RX 1695- 99). Of these forty- three companies sixteen were among the top 50 l55 J suppliers of ethical drugs in 1970. The Commission concludes that the loss of Warner- Lambert as a possible entrant into the single- ingredient antihistamine market would not amount to substantial lessening of competition. K. ANTACIDS 114. Antacids neutralize excess stomach acid resulting from peptic ulcers, heartburn and other causes of gastric distress. Antacids are sold in a variety of dosage forms and are promoted directly to consumers as proprietary items or to doctors and other health professionals as ethical OTC' s. Ethical OTC antacids such as Gc1usil , Maalox and Mylanta tend to be more efficacious formulations intended for use in treatment of gastric ulcer , gastritis , hiatal hernia and other medical conditions requiring heavy, long- term antacid use. Proprietary antacids such as Rolaids , Turns , Alka-Seltzer and Bromo Seltzer tend to be mild formulations intended for short- term use in treating upset stomach and heartburn. (Di- Gel is a proprietary antacid but is equivalent to Mylanta , one of the leading ethical antacids. ) A large portion of the sales of the milder and proprietary antacids are in outlets such as food stores and restaurants where they arc displayed near cash registers in impulse purchase areas. Proprietary antacids account for approximate- ly two- thirds of all antacid sales. Respondent docs not dispute the existence of an all antacid market. 115. The entire antacid market had total sales of $26I milion in 1969. The ethical segment is highly concentrated. The top three sellers Rorers Maalox (39. 3 percent), Stuart' s :vylanta (2I. percent) and Warner-Lambert' s Gclusil (I9.4 percent) represent 79. 8 percent of allWARNER LAMBERT CO. 94. 812 Findings of Facts and Conc1usions of Law ethical sales in I969. In the entire antacid market , the top four companies make 59 percent of all sales , the top eight companies percent. Warner Lambert is the second lar!;8st antacid seller with 18. percent of the market ($48.4 million in sales). Well- known antacids made by Warner Lambert are Rolaids , Bromo Seltzer and Gelusi1. Parke, Davis was \" very strong \" in antacids in tbe 1920' s but lost this position (Tr. I394). In 1960 , Parke, Davis hired a new researcher to take command of the gastrointestinal products program and was charged to put and keep Parke , Davis in the forefront\" of this market (Tr. I394). It attempted to develop new antacid products , but never marketed any of them. (56) 116. The Parke , Davis decision not to market antacid products was part of a systematic review undertaken under Mr. Williams direction starting in the spring of 1969. (Williams was in charge of Parke, Davis marketing at the time. ) In the course of such review , the individual marketing plan groups reviewed all the products both in R&D and product development\" for the purpose of determining where the company \" had the greatest opportunity for success. (id.). The statement in Parke , Davis' I970 Marketing Plan that the \" entire field of antacids is being reviewed to determine one that we could use \" (CX 1913) is not inconsistent with William s testimony tbat after full review there was no interest in marketing antacid products (Tr. 3575- 76). Although designated a \" 1970\" .Yarkcting Plan , it was obviously prepared during I969 , probably in the spring or around mid- year, as shown by the fact that 1969 sales were \" forecast\" on the basis of five months sales (CX 2005- 06). 117. There are approximately J09 companies , in addition to the top eight antacid suppliers , which already market an antacid procuct. Among these existing toehold competitors are numerous firms with a competitive potential equal to or greater than Parke Davis. :\\oreover included among the companies with toeholds in the antacid market were firms with substantial capability in ethical marketing, as well as firms with extensive proprietary experience. Of tbe top 50 detailing companies , 33 were active in the antacid business in 1970. Moreover unlike Parke , Davis, which had no proprietary distribution or consumer advertising expertise , there were 14 companies among the nation s top 100 advertisers which had substantial proprietary drug sales and already had products in the antacids market but were not among the top 8 sellers. These nine toe holders were undoubtedly more capable than Parke , Davis to become significant competitors in the proprietary segment of the antacid market , and since antacid formulation is relatively easy, the same is true of proprietary manufacturers which do not already sell antacids.946 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. In conclusion , the Commission finds that the record fails to show that Parke , Davis was more likely than others to expand into the antacid market. No probable substantial lessening of competition has been shown. (57) L. PRENATAL V1TA.\\1INS 118. Prenatal vitamins arc vitamins that arc formulated to meet the requirements of pregnant women. Prenatal vitamins is an ethical submarket since the products are promoted to obstetricians who , in turn, recommend them to their patients. Respondent agrees that prenatal vitamins constitute a proper line of commerce. The sole question is whether the merger has eliminated legal1y and economical- ly significant potential competition. 119. In 1969 , the prenatal vitamin market was I4. 6 milion dol1ars and concentrated in structure , with the top four firms , (Parke, Davis ranking second with 15 percent of sales) accounting for 57.4 percent of the sales. The top eight firms accounted for 81.9 percent. In 1969 Warner-Lambert's prenatal vitamin , Calcisalin , occupied a toehold position in this market with 0. 3 percent and $64 000 in sales volume. After the complaint issued , the company withdrew the product from the market , al1egedly rather than reformulate it to meet new FDA requirements. Calcisalin was a market failure because the excessively large tablet had to be taken six times rather than once daily. 120. Although Warner- Lambert was capable of reformulating Calcisalin into a once-a- day preparation , it states it did not do so because it viewed the market as relatively unattractive for entry. This view is confirmed by the relative maturity of the market (CX 2276), which between 1958 and 197I experienced only an 11.94 percent increase in total volume. In dropping from the market , Warner- Lambert reached the same decision as did nine other large ethical companies which left the market between 1958 and 1971. Warner- Lambert's lack of interest in the prenatal vitamin market is consistent with its low interest and activity in the entire vitamin field. DKK reported its total sales of al1 vitamins in 1970 as $53 000, including $46000 in reported sales of Calcisalin. 121. As shown by the fact that since 1958 nine large drug companies in addition to Warner- Lambert have left this submarket size alone is probably an insufficient basis for identifying likely significant new compctitors. A more pertinent factor is a company position in the overal1 vitamin field. Even though prenatal vitamins account for less than IO percent of al1 vitamin sales (RX 1704 , 1708), al1 types of vitamins bave basical1y the same ingredients and it would be natural to expect substantial identity between the major vitaminWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 947 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law manufacturers and the leaders in the prenatal vitamin field. (58) This expectation is confirmed by the fact that the top 10 vitamin manufacturers of 1970 accounted for eight of the top IO companies in the prenatal vitamin submarket. The 9th company was the specialty firm Nion , and the 10th was Roerig which ranked I8th in overallvitamin sales. Accordingly, if this submarket should become attractive significant entry is most likely to come from the other major vitamin manufacturers. Complaint counsel cite no subjective evidence of Warner- Lambert' interest in re-entering this product markct and , as noted , the objective evidence clearly suggests that other companies are more likely entrants than respondent. No violation of Section 7 has been shown therefore , with respect to this market. M. A:!TIBIOTICS USEFUL AGAlNST GRA\\f-NEGATIVE BACILLI 122. Infection-causing organisms Within these classes there are many different micro-organisms. Infections resulting from these organisms may be treated by antibiotics , sulfonamides , and by various other chemotherapeutic agents. Each antimicrobial agent has a spectrum of usefuJ activity against particular micro-organisms; no onc agent is useful against all disease-causing organisms. 123. Gram-negative bacilli are distinguished from other infecting organisms. Gram-negative bacilli include numerous organisms , and the infections they cause may be treated either by antibiotics or by chemotherapeutic agents , such as sulfonamides. Antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents active against gram-negative bacilli arc not active against all gram-negative bacilli (and arc not effective exclusively against such bacilli but may hit gram-negative cocci and gram-positive bacilli as well). I24. About twenty different antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents are active against gram-negative bacilli. An important barrier to a complaint counsel's attempt to show the existence of an overall market of \" antibiotics useful against gram-negative bacilli\" is that the correct drug for a specific gram-negative infection will not be just any one of the antibiotics active against OTIe or more of the gram-negative bacilli; rather , selection of the proper antimicrobial agent requires consideration of many factors , including the seriousness of the patient' s condition , his medical history, the site of the infection previous drug therapy, and the likely infecting agent. gram- negative antibiotic , Coly-948 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. Mycin (colistin or polymyxin E). Parke , competes with Warner- Lam bert's antibiotic as the preferred drug against any particular disease. Complaint counsel contend that all antibiotic preparations - but not chemotberapeutic agents - whicb include a gram-negative organism v.ithin their spectrum of activity constitute a relevant product submarkeL Respondent disputes that such a product grouping qualifies as a meanini\"rful product submarket for Section 7 purposes. Lack of Medical and Industry Recognition I26. The Medical LeUer , Handbook of Antimicrobial Therapy, is well-recognized as an authoritative guide for physicians treating infectious diseases. It considers together all agents used in fighting infections , including both antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents such as sulfonamides (RX PI'. 3-15). In recommending the drugs to be used in treating infections caused by gram-negative bacilli it does so according to the specific infecting organisms rather than tbe gram- negative group as a wbole. There is no recognized \" industry\" of firms manufacturing such antibiotics as distinguished from antibiotics in general, and DKK docs not report on a category of drugs designated or corresponding to \" antibiotics useful against gram-negative bacili. These and other evidence clearly show that while the medical profession recognizes a group of disease-causing organisms called gram-negative bacilli\" neither the medical profession nor the pharmaceutical industry recognizes a separate economic or trade entity consisting of antibiotics effective against such organisms. Lack of Substantial Therapeutic Interchangeability I27. The term \" antibiotics useful against gram- negative bacilli\" includes a large number of antibiotics effective against one or more of the numerous infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. While all of these antibiotics are effective against one or more gram- negative bacilli, they are not all therapeutically interchangeable in medical practice. f601 There are distinct medical preferences with regard to antibiotic usage depending upone the identity of the invading organism and other factors. Each antibiotic (and each nonantibiotic antimicrobi- al agent), has its own \" peculiar characteristics and uses \" which are well-recognized. The only situation where some of these antibiotics are readily interchangeable is to initiate immediate therapy in serious infections that are suspected to be due to gram-negative organismsW ARNER- LA:.BERT CO. 949 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law pending definite identification of the organism through analysis of cultures (Tr. 1264). Even in this limited area , the only overlap in use between Warner- Lambert' s and Parke , Davis ' product is more theoretical than real. Although Warner- Lambert' s Coly-Mycin M. is indicated in this situation , Parke, Davis Chloromycetin would not be preferred for such use , except in limited situations , owing to possibility of serious toxic side effects. In addition to being so broad as to include some antibiotics that are not used interchangeably in the treatment of specific diseases , the proposed ,,'Touping excludes chemotherapeutic agents which arc also used against gram-negative bacilli , such as sulfonamides. Lack of Anticompetive Effect 128. Even if \" antibiotics useful against gram-negative baci1i\" were a product market , this merger would have no adverse effect on competition. In I970 , Parke, Davis combined sales of its four antibiotics in this submarket amounted to $19. 6 million and accounted for a market share of 5. :11 perccnt and seventh ranking. (By 1971 , its sales had fallen by over one million dollars to $I8. 4 million, its market share to 4.58 and its rank to ninth. ) Warner- Lambert s sales in 1970 were $2.4 million, a mi1ion dollars less tban in the previous year , accounting for a market share of 0. 66 percent. (By 197I its sales had declined an additional half million dollars to $1.9 million , and its market share had dropped to 0.46 percent.) This market (61J share is de min1:mis and precludes a finding that existing competition is likely to be substantial- ly lessened by the merger in this alleged submarket , especially since concentration is decreasing and there is no evidence as to any decline in the number of supp1iers. To the contrary, the evidence indicates that the number of companies marketing two important antibiotics with gram-negative activity, ampicillin and tetracycline, has been increas- mg. Warner-Lambert was not one of the companies most jikely to expand its position in this market. Loss of substantial potential competition is not indicated. Its Coly- :Iycin sales are dec1ining due to displacement by new and superior antibiotic products (Tr. 342- :1496; RX 1687). Warner- Lambert is not antibiotic developer (Gleckman 1316-17 , 1321; Finland 2949- 52). It did not discover Coly- :Iycin, its sole antibiotic product , bas no antibiotic NDA's on file, has no antibiotic manufacturing faci1ities , and has no research capabi1ity for elaborating new antibiotics.

N. AMPICILLIN 129. Ampici1in is a broad spectrum , semi-synthetic penicillin. Ampicilln has been extremely well accepted by the medical profession and is one of the most frequently prescribed broad-spectrum antibiot- ics in the United States. The term \" broad spectrum \" as applied to antimicrobials , refers to the fact that such drugs have a wide range of potential uses against many different kinds of organisms. Thus ampici1in includes hoth gram- positive and gram-negative organisms including both cocci and baci1i , in its spectrum. By comparison penicillins effort is restricted to gram- positive organisms. Ampicillin was patented by Beecham , and is sold in the United States by Beecham and 1icensed by Beecham to Bristol Laboratories , Inc. and Bristol- Myers Co. Bristol has , in turn , suhlicensed Squibb- Beechnut and American Home Products ' Wyeth Division. In addition to Parke , Davis which purchases ampicillin from Bristol in finished dosage form Ayerst Lahoratorics Division of American Home Products and Lederle distribute ampicilin which they purchase in dosage form from Beecham. A number of other companies also sell ampici1in , apparently without 1icense. The record reveals that the ampicillin patent has been attacked quite successfully from the standpoint of va1idity , , ' and other manufacturers can not \" come in with impunity. \" (Tr. 1739). \\Varner-Lambert has never marketed ampicillin. 130. Parke , Davis distributes ampicillin purchased in finished dosage form from Bristol. Parke , Davis commenced marketing ampicillin in I968 (CX 2451) and has achieved a number four ranking in the market. Its 1970 sales of $IO.4 million gave it an I1.7 percent marketing share. The top four sellers are estimated to have controlled 94.7 percent of the market in 1970. Respondent has admitted that ampicillin is a relevant end-use product market but disputes complaint counsel's contention that Warner-Lambert was a legally or compctitively significant potential entrant into the ampici1in submarket. I31. The record shows that during the period I968 to March 1976 Warner-Lambert approached Beecham , and its licensee Bristol- Myers about the possibi1ity of obtaining 1icensing and/or marketing rights to several antibiotics including ampicillin. No agreement was reached. Although f63J complaint counsel contend that Warner- Lam bert's interest was cut short only by the negotiations to acquire Parke , Davis there is contemporaneous evidence indicating that Warner- Lambert's interest was never very strong and was waning by 1969 (RX 760 , Even if we were to view Warner-Lambert as a potential entrant there is no reason to believe itsWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 951 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law loss as a possible entrant was significant since there are a number of other drug companies that are leading sellers of other antibiotics that were not yet seIJing ampiciIJin and with equal logic could be considered potential entrants. In contrast to these companies , Warner- Lambert had no antibiotic fermentation plant. Loss of one among many potential entrants would not substantially diminish competition. o. Al'TI-PSELDOMONAS DReGS 132. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a species of bacteria , gram- negative in character , which can cause relatively minor infections , such as swimmer s ear or urinary tract infections (Kirby 3249), and also life- threatening infections in a compromised host , such as the severely burned or leukemic patient. There are presently four approved antibiotics active Coly-Mycin antibiotic products their spectrum of activity. 3249; however, prineipaIJy useful only in treating urinary tract infections known or suspected to be caused by Pseudomonas. Warner- Lambert's largest sellng Coly- Mycin product is its otic preparation used for ear infections , such as \" sv.rimmer s ear, Parke , Davis' only \"anti-Pseudomonas \" product is a Chloromycetin Ophthalmic preparation to which polymyxin B has been added in order to reach Pseudomonas infections of the eye. 133. Complaint counsel contend that aIJ drugs (including biologi- cals) active against Pseudomonas constitute the relevant product market. At present such drugs are limited to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents. They are included within the alleged market whether formulated in injectable , oral or topical form. Complaint counsel claim the merger has eliminated potential competition in this market. Respondent disputes complaint counsel's market definition and furtber contends that Parke , Davis was not a significant potential entrant, and , even if it were , the merger can have no substantial adverse effect on competition in the so-caIJed anti- Pseudomonas drugs market. (64) 134. The products manufactured by Warner- Lambert and Parke, Davis are quite obviously altogetber for different therapeutic applications and there is no evidence in the record that the industry, DKK or the FDA or anyone else has ever recognized this group of drugs as a separate economic entity. Even accepting this as a proper market, \\Varner- Lambert's share of the anti- Pseudomonas market in 1970 was 9.4 percent (down from 16. 9 percent in I969) and Parke Davis' share was 0. 5 percent in 1970. (By 1971 its products now952 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. competed against two new antibiotics active against Pseudomonas including gentamicin. I35. Counsel in support of the complaint rely on the fact that Parke , Davis had filed an application with the Division of Biologics Standards on June 29 , 1970 for a new antipseudomonas drug which would be used as a vaccine. At the time of the hearings , this application was still on file. The original application was limited to claim usefulness of the vaccine to burn- injured patients. A new claim was planned to be made that the drug is efficacious for leukemia patients as well. The evidence presented in this record shows that the proposed Parke, Davis vaccine is intended to be used adjunctively or concurrent- ly with conventional antibiotics regimens. Assuming the application is approved, there would be litte if any effect on the use of Warner- Lambert' s antibiotics since they are designed for specific purposes and arc rarely used on burn or leukemic patients (Tr. 2527- 3I). In any event , a physician would not consider the vaccine as interchangeable with antibiotics (Tr. 1303- 04). I36. The record does not support a finding of likely lessening of competition in any anti- pseudomonas drug market due to the merger. P. CRINARY A'JTIBACTERlALS I37. The complaint identifies as an end-use submarket \" urinary antibacterials (non-sulfa). \" These are defined by complaint counsel as drugs used in tbe treatment of urinary tract infections excLusive antibiotics , sulfonamides and urinary analgesics. within compounds , nitrofurantoin compounds , and nalidixic acid. These compounds arc principally used for treating urinary tract infections characterized as chronic recurrent symptomatic disease. Methenamine compounds are designed for chronic suppressive use only and not for eradicating an infection. l65J The nitrofurantoin and nalidixic acid compounds may also serve that purpose but are desii.rned primarily to eradicate infections. All of these products are useful only for infections in the urinary tract. 138. Warner- Lambert markets mcthenamine mandelate com- pounds under the trade name of :Iandelamine. In I970 it had sales of $5.6 million. In addition , it has had an NDA pending before the FDA since 1969 on another non-sulfa urinary antibacterial , oxolinic acid. At the time of the merger , Parke, Davis marketed methenamine under the trade name Vritone. It had de minimis sales of about $1 000 annually according to DKK. (CX 2620). In 1973 , Parke, Davis added nitrofurantoin to its generic line. I39. While respondent admitted that \" urinary antibacterials (non- sulfa)\" is a proper line of commerce for Section 7 purposes (Answer'WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 953 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 6H(4)), the uncontroverted evidence , including testimony by complaint counsel's expert witness , establishes that short-acting sulfonamides are not only therapeutically interchangeable with other urinary antibac- terials, but are considered the drug of choice for acute urinary tract infection. (Dr. Gleckman I314- 15; see also Tr. 3257; 851- 52). This indicates that \" urinary antibacterials (non-sulfa)\" is an artificial\" and unduly narrow classification (Gleckman I346-7). 140. Although respondent does not formally seek a broadening of the market definition to include short- acting sulfonamides , arguing their relevance only on the question of competitive injury, analysis would best be aided by defining the market to include these sulfonamides. As so defined , the market in I969 totalled $60 353000. Hoffman- La Roche and Morton Norwich companies dominated sales sharing over 70 percent of total sales nearly equally. Warner- Lambert ranked third with 9. 2 percent of sales (CX 3266). Parke , Davis had only $70000 in sales with 0. 1 percent of the market. 141. In arguing that Parke , Davis was a likely significant toehold competitor or new entrant , complaint counsel rely on a new product managers market profile of generics written in June of 1969. The profile recommended that Parke , Davis introduce some fifteen generic products, including nitrofurantoin, \" allow(ingJ the complete line to be promoted' , ' \" (CX 3690). It further recommended that \" the Market Research Department institute immediately a study with physicians and pharmacists to determine acceptance and degree of success * * * for the program. (CX 3695). This plan was apparently never forwarded (66 J to :\\r. Wi1iams , then Director of Marketing and now President of Parke , Davis. In any event , it failed to receive the approval of the authors superior. While this plan was not approved , Parke, Davis has continued since the merger to evaluate its generic product line and to add selected generic products as they came off patent. In 1973 pursuant to such evaluation , it added generic nitrofurantoin. 142. Parke , Davis' factory sales of nitrofurantoin were less than $50000 in the first year of marketing (Williams 3583). Since there is no evidence in the record as to totaJ industry sales of urinary antibacteri- als for I973 is no way ascertaining Parke , Davis' market share in that post-acquisition year assuming it to be relevant. But relating Parke , Davis ' I973 sales to 1970 industry sales $60.4 mi1ion as reported by DKK , Parke , Davis would have only a de min'imis market share. Even if we assume that a Parke , Davis independent of Warner- Lambert would have made a better sho,, ng in I973 or afterwards than is indicated by its 1973 sales , it is doubtful that the merger can even be characterized as combining a \" leading\" company in the market with a potential entrant in view of Warner- Lambert' s market share being 216-969 ).T. 77 - 6:954 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Fact. and Conclusions of Law 87 F. below 10 percent. Even if we take into consideration the fact it has an NDA pending on another urinary antibacterial (oxolinic acid), we would also have to consider other post-merger developments such as new sulfonamide antibacterial compound , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa- zole, which was approved for marketing in the latter part of I973 specifically for urinary tract infections (Tr. 1317- 18). Studies per- formed in this country showed that it was more effective than sulfonamide (Tr. 1320). It is currently marketed by Hoffman- La Roche the market leader in this field , and hy another drug company. Also the patent held by Eaton (Morton Norwich) on nitrofurantoin expired in I969 or I970. Approval to market it can now be secured under the ANDA procedure. Likewise , the ANDA procedure is also available and has been widely used for securing marketing approval of the short- acting sulfonamides. These recent developments affecting the availa- bility of drugs for treating urinary tract infections make it reasonable to conclude that this submarket will be more competitive in the future than it was before the merger. These developments would seem to overshadow Parke , Davis' introduction of generic nitrofurantoin. Q. MOUTHWASH I43. Mouthwashes are intended for use in cleaning the oral cavity by means of rinsing and gargling. They commonly consist of ingredients which thin salivary secretions and soften material around teeth. They also include flavoring and deodorizing agents , as well as materials with purported (67J antibacterial effect. Total sales of mouthwashes were approximately $183 million in 1969 and $I85 million in 1970. Warner- Lambert manufactures Listerine Antiseptic Mouth- wash, which in 1970 had sales of $89 million. With about 50 percent of the market , Warner-Lambert is the undisputed leader. In contrast Parke, Davis had four non- branded mouthwash products which in I970 had de minimis total sales of $29 000. 144. Complaint counsel do not contend that Parke , Davis was a substantial existing competitor. They claim only that the acquisition ends all likelihood that Parke , Davis would have grown to be a substantial competitive factor. Respondent agrees that mouthwash is a proper line of commerce , but denies that the merger eliminates any significant potential competition. 145. The four non- branded products of Parke , Davis are an alkaline aromatic solution introduced in 1919; alkaline aromatic tablets , both white and pink , which were introduced in 1902 and 1911 , respectively, and an antiseptic solution introduced domestically in 1923. The tablet formulations are available only in gallon bottes. There are no consumer package sizes of any of these products which are marketedWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 955 812 FindinbJ\" of Facts and Conclusions of Law only for institutional use. There is no evidence that these products would be suitable for proprietary promotion or that Parke , Davis even considered such a step. No mouthwash products were included in the roughly JOO Parke , Davis products the Ted Bates Agency reviewed to assess for possible proprietary marketing. I46. During the 1960' , Parke , Davis ' Product Development Department worked on two mouthwash projects. These efforts however , ultimately led to a decision not to market a proprietary mouthwash product. The first effort was in 1961 or 1962 , when product development formulated a new mouthwash utilizing a new antibacteri- al agent the company had discovered. This effort was dropped because of toxicology problems. Subsequently, in 1967 or 1968 , product development again worked on a new mouthwash formulation. When the development work was completed , Parke , Davis ' marketing personnel were notified of product availability \" for any marketing interests you may be able to elicit.\" After a \" thorough review \" Parke Davis decided against marketing a mouthwash. A contemporaneous memorandum by :vr. Wiliams , tben United Marketing, dated Marcb 10 , I969, explained that tbe \" primary reason for our decision is that it would take a considerable amount of money to effectively establish this product with the consumer. Unfortunately, within the last couple of years , the market has been litera1ly flooded with new mouthwash preparations (-i.:vicrin, Scope, (68 J Colgate JOO, etc. ) as we1l as the old standbys , Lavoris and Listerine. In our opinion, we could spend our advertising and promotion d01lars more effectively in other product areas. \" (CX 2723). Thereafter , Parke Davis engaged in no further research and development in the mouthwash area. In light of the above , it seems clear that Parke , Davis was not likely to have become a meaningful competitor in the mouthwash market in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Commission finds no basis for a violation of Section 7 in the mouthwash line of commerce. R. BLOOD FRACTIONS serum globulin , and tetanus immune globulin are three therapeutic blood products that are separated out of human blood plasma by a chemical process ca1led fractionation. (a). Normal serum alilUmin (human). Serum albumin is an important factor in the regulation of the volume of circulating blood. In addition to its osmotic function , a1bumin serves as a source of protein nutrition for the tissues. As a carrier of intermediate956 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. metabolites , it is also important to the transport and exchange of tissue products. ormal serum albumin (human) is useful in shock due to burns, trauma, crushing injuries , abdominal emergencies and other similar conditions in which loss of red corpuscles is not severe , for the purpose of restoring blood volume rapidly. It is also useful in hypoproteinemia to increase the concentration of plasma protein and volume of circulating blood and in hyperbilirubinemia and erythroblas- tosis fetals as an adjunct in exchange transfusions. (b). Immune serum glolrulin (human). Immune serum globulin is a sterile, concentrated solution of antibodies found in normal human blood. The active component is highly refined gamma globulin. Solutions of human gamma globulin have been reported to be effective in preventing infectious (epidemic) hepatitis , preventing and modify- ing measles (rubeola) and poliomyelitis. In addition , it has been reported effective in various degrees against German measles (rubella), chicken pox , herpes zoster , oral herpetiform lesions , and as an adjunct in the treatment of various bacterial infections which do not respond well to antibiotic therapy alone. (69 J (c). Tetanus immune globulin (human). Tetanus immune globulin is a sterile , concentrated solution of tetanus antitoxin as gamma globulin prepared from the blood of adults who have been immunized with tetanus toxoid. It is used to provide immediate passive immunity to tetanus in any person who has sustained a tetanus-prone injury and who is not known to be immune to tetanus. 148. Immune serum globulin , normal serum albumin , and tetanus immune globulin are three out of some 25 or 30 different products tbat can be derived from the process of human blood fractionation. Such fractionation involves a complex manufacturing process of separating out various components from human blood sources; plasma or placental serum or serum from clotted blood. There are many legal as well as technical requirements to be met in order to become a therapeutic blood fractionater. The legal requirements include a license from the Federal government' s Bureau of Biologics (BOB) to be manufactured as well as a license for the product to be sold. The manufacturing license is granted only after inspection of the facility and approval of the operating staff. The technical requirements include the facility and equipment whicb arc estimated to cost $2 million and must be operating at freezing or below; a qualified staff to run the operation; a research and development group; and special testing to achieve quality control. 149. Parke , Davis manufactures and markets each of these three blood fractions as well as other blood fractions. Warner- Lambert has never manufactured or marketed any tberapeutic blood fractions. TheWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 957 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law three blood fractions are each admitted to be a relevant product market for Section 7 purposes. Complaint counsel contend that the merger eliminated Warner- Lambert as a potential entrant into these markets. It is respondent's position that Warner- Lambert was not a competitively significant potential entrant into blood fractionation in general or any of the blood fraction markets here in issue. 150. The total value of purchases in 1969 of the three blood fractions involved here by U. S. hospitals and drug stores as projected by DKK were as fo1lows: Product Normal serum $2.5 million (70 J The open markct for each of the three blood fractions in question is highly concentrated. In I969 , one-, two-, four- and eight- firm sales concentration in each was as follows: Product firm firm firm firm Normal 91% Bureau of Biologics currently licenses only 18 establish- ments to make one or more of the three blood fractions in question. A1l but one arc licensed to make albumin; a1l but five make both of the other products , too. Many if not most of the firms in the therapeutic blood fractionation business are drug companies. Current licensees include Parke , Davis , Abbott , Squibb, Chemical , Baxter Laboratories ' Travenol Division , Armour and such as Baxters Hyland Labs have a strong background in diagnostic as we1l as therapeutic blood products. Two new licensees (North American Biologics and Metabolic Inc. ) arc sma1l firms with blood banking and diagnostics backgrounds. 152. To enter the business of therapeutic blood fractionation unique facilities and a qualified staff are required , as is a Federal license, if manufacturing for interstate commerce is involved. Quality con tral is necessary and processing research desirable. On the marketing side, \" hospital know- how\" is pertinent , and established access to the customers (hospitals , drug stores , doctors) is valuable. Parke , Davis has an investment of about $2 mi1lion in plant and958 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. equipment for human blood fractionation , excluding warehousing, labeling, packaging, quality control and other ancillary functions. 153. Parke , Davis holds Federal licenses to manufacture more different biological products than any other establishment except American Cyanamid' s Lederle Laboratories. It has an extensive facility for producing biologicals , inc1uding blood serum processing at its Parkedale , Michigan laboratories , much of which was newly built in the mid- 1960's. Its biologicals line in 1969 inc1uded the three blood fraction products involved here , of which it is a leading company in two of the markets (serum albumin and (71J tetanus immune globulin): (a). Normal Serum Albumin. Parke, Davis markets this under the trademark \" Albuspan \" in a solution for use in restoring blood volume. In 1969 Parke , Davis was the biggest supplier of the open market , with about 34 percent of total sales. (b). Immune Serum Globulin. Parke, Davis markets this under the trademark \" Immu-\" In 1969 it was the fifth largest supplier of the open market , with about 7 percent of the total sales. (c). Tewnus Immune Globulin. Parke, Davis markets this under the trademark \" ImmuTetanus. \" In 1969 it was the second largest supplier of the open market , with about 28 percent of total sales. 154. Most of the early entrants , including Parke , Davis, Wyeth Merck (through its acquisition of Sharp & Dohme), Lederle and Lilly possessed biologics experience with antitoxins which are based on the immunal therapy from which human blood fractions developed. These efforts were encouraged by government contracts during World War II. Squibb also became involved at this time through a Red Cross contract for dried plasma. Another group entered human blood fractionation as an outgrowth of World War II research contracts which were an extension of their veterinary business. These were Armour and Pittman- Moore. A third group of companies , including Cutter, Baxter and Ahbott , entered after the development of blood extenders and human albumin. They combined their facilities and know-how for making hospital solutions , which involve large volume sterile production , with animal serum know- how achieved by acquiring veterinary houses. The only recent entrants have been two small non pharmaceutical companies , North American Biologicals and Meta- bolic Inc., which since the merger were licensed by BOB to fractionate human blood. Prior to securing their blood fractionating licenses they were already licensed in both blood banking and diagnostic typing sera. Diagnostic products that are used in blood processing, like the typing sera made by North American and (72J Metabolic , require a BOB license and are sold primarily to blood banks. There are other diagnostic products that are used merely as controls which do notWARNER- LAMBERT CO. 959 812 Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law require a license and arc sold primarily to hospitals and clinical laboratories. Warner- Lambert' s General Diagnostics Division produces such diagnostic controls. 155. Warner- Lambert's General Diagnostics Division , with I969 sales over $8 million , has led the industry in the development and marketing of quality control materials for use in monitoring the accuracy of numerous dia\"rnostic tests. General Diagnostic s techni- cians could not move immediately into therapeutic blood fractionation without some re- training and guidance but , if qualified and competent they could be so trained (Tr. 3559). The hospitals which buy Warner- Lambert's diagnostic reagents are also buyers of therapeutic blood products. In April 1969 Warner- Lambert acquired Elizabeth Biochemical Laboratory, a bifurcated enterprise which was at once a large clinical diagnostic laboratory serving Northern New Jersey and a multi- State chain of blood donation centers for the collection of human blood , blood fractions, plasmas and serums for distribution to industrial users. Elizabeth Biochemical was the Nation s \"leading supplier of industrial blood plasma \" (CX 257). Of total shipments of $1 I68000 by Elizabeth in I967 , serum albumin , gamma globulin and fibrinogen; $304 000 were of \" immune plasma \" for fractionation into tetanus gamma globulin; $Ill OOO were of \" immune plasma \" for fractionation into Rh gamma globulin; $89 000 were of so-caned \" salvage (outdated) plasma for fractionation into either serum albumin and gamma globulin or diagnostic control agents; and $335 000 were of \" blood-typing plasma for processing into various \" blood-typing plasma \" diagnostic reagents. (CX 2835 plus CX 2840). Most of Elizabeth' s plasma was thus raw material for therapeutic blood fractionation. (73) 156. By the end of March I969 (the same month the Elizabeth Biochemical acquisition was consummated) Warner- Lambert planners were working on a \" merger approach\" to Cuttcr Laboratories of Berkeley, California , one of the 18 Federal blood fractionation licensees. A comprehensive Warner- Lambert memorandum a little later described Cutter as a pioneer in the vaccine field which had been working with Parke , Davis in the field of \" human blood fractions. \" (CX 2878). Cutter was said to have continued to do a lot of work over the years with specific gamma globulin and antitoxins developed from hyperimmunized human donors , which work was \" quite closely related to the efforts of Elizabcth Biochemical.\" (CX 2878). The same memorandum pointed out that \" rb lecause of Cutter Laboratories ' long time emphasis on LV. solutions , vaccines , antitoxins and pLasma fractions Warner-Lambert \" would expect strong representation in960 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION DECISIONS Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law 87 F. this segment of the hospital market , etc.\" (CX 2880; emphasis added). By the Jatter part of April a meeting with Cutter had been arranged. Warner-Lambert's President (Giblin) and Executive Vice President (Bright) met with Cutter s President (David Cutter) on April 23 \" to see whether they would have any interest in joining with Warner- Lambert.\" (CX 2868). Giblin and Bright talked about a \" total health company \" and pointed out how Cutter s operations would tie in with Warner-Lambert', enabling both to grow more rapidly than either alone. (id. ) Warner- Lambert Jater reported that its \" offer\" had been turned down \" by Cutter shortly after it was made. (CX 2I06). 157. Having failed in its effort to acquire Cutter , Warner- Lambert next turned to Squibb , another of the 18 Federal blood fractionation licensees. This time it proposed not a merger but a processing agreement. On October 3 , I969 Warner- Lambert' s Hastings , with Executive Vice President Bright , visited Squibb \" to discuss possible future relationships regarding biological products. \" (CX 2886). Specifi-cally, they were investigating the feasibility of having Squibb manufacture a line of generic blood products for Warner- Lambert (CX 2105). Warner- Lambert determined that Squibb could accept orders for the manufacture of gJobulins , albumin and \" AHF\" in I970 , when Squibb' s current expansion would be complete (CX 2886). However , some time in December I969 negotia- tions were terminated because Squibb did not have the manufacturing time available (CX 2I05). The documentary evidence does not support the testimony offered by respondent that the negotiations were primarily aimed at and conditioned upon a joint R&D program with Squibb for new blood fractions. (74) I58. The Commission finds that immediately prior to the acquisition , Warner- Lambert had the interest and capacity to enter the normal serum albumin and tetanus immune globulin markets , that these markets were highJy concentrated and characterized by substan- tial technological and marketing entry barriers , that Parke , Davis was a leading firm in each of these two markets , that procompetitive means of entry by internal expansion , acquisition of a toehold company or companies , or supply arrangements with an existing firm , was a feasihle means of alternative entry, that the number of other likely entrants was not so numerous as to make the loss of future entry by Warner-Lambert' s insubstantiaJ , and that entry by Warner- Lambert would have had a procompetitive effect on these markets. 159. In view of the fact that Parke , Davis, with only 7 percent of the immune serum globulin saJes , was not a leading company in that market , no substantial lessening of competition in immune serum globulin is found to have resulted from the acquisition.WARNER- LAMBERT CO. 961 812 Order Cm\\CLUSIONS OF LAW 1.
