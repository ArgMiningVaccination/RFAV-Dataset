Questions: Call Kael at 206-850-1485 or email [info@ayurvedaseattle.com](mailto:info@ayurvedaseattle.com) What does the Cleanse involve? There are now 2 Cleanse Options to accommodate all Cleansers! Determine which option is best for you during the Q & A call on April 4. Option A: Cleanse & Rejuvenate Option B: Nourish & Rejuvenate Who should do Cleanse Option B? Those that have recently been through a traumatic event, are grieving a loss, feeling exhausted and depleted, have adrenal or chronic fatigue, or experience low-blood sugar. This is a gentle cleanse that focuses on re-setting your daily rhythms, sound sleep, healing digestion and deeply nourishing the mind and body without creating further depletion. Those participating in this option will not be doing the internal oleation and purgation, but will be following a similar dietary and herbal protocol as Option A. During the 2-week Ayurvedic Mind-Body Home Cleanse you will do a daily practice of yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, daily walks or gentle exercise, take Ayurvedic herbal formulas that support the detox process, and eat a special diet during the three phases: Pre-Cleanse (Day 1-5) To prepare your body to flush these toxins out of their storage sites, we will first make sure that your natural detox channels are functional by following an allergen-free whole foods diet, eating beets, apples, lemon juice and turmeric daily, juicing (optional) and taking herbs or specific spice/tea remedies as specified. This will help: - Balance Blood Sugar and heal the intestinal mucosa of your intestinal tract. - De-Stagnate the Lymphatic System: Improve the function of your lymphatic system, which drains the gut through the GALT (Gut Associated Lymphatic Tissue) where 80% of the body's immune system is housed. - Decongest the liver and thin the Bile to prepare to Detox: Adequate bile flow is critical in optimizing and maintaining the detox channels of the body. During the Main Cleanse, you will eat a simplified diet of khichari, which is a specific type of rice and beans prepared in a way that helps heal the digestion and allows the digestive system to rest so you can do deep cleansing. Daily meditation, breath practices and EFT Tapping will help release old emotions, patterns, habits and behaviors that limit healing. You will also drink increasing amounts of ghee each morning (Cleanse Option A only). The last step is 3 days of Basti's (herbal enemas.) - Reset Fat Metabolism, Flush the Liver and Detox Toxic Fat: Once the liver and bile are functioning better, cleanse the toxic chemicals that are stored in the fat cells. - Self-Inquiry and meditation help release old emotions, patterns, habits and behaviors, that store in the cells, and unleash your healing potential. - Reset Digestive Strength: After the cleanse, reset your digestive strength, which is the most common cause of digestive distress. - Basti's nourish the seat of vata and are deeply rejuvenating to the GI Tract, lungs and Nervous System. After the Main Cleanse, you can slowly return to the Pre Cleanse diet and use spices to reset and boost your digestive fire. You will begin your herbal rejuvenation program. You will take rejuvenating herbal formulas and foods for the following month. In addition, we recommend that you follow a seasonal, whole foods diet, specific for your constitution which you will naturally have the craving for now. "}
