I'm Dr. Rebecca, a chiropractor and a spiritual healer on a unique healing journey. The seeds of my journey were sown in the midst of family challenges - my brother's ongoing misdiagnoses and traumas within our medical system. These experiences compelled me to craft innovative and potent healing techniques that bring profound change. My approach is all-encompassing, weaving together chiropractic bodywork, yoga rehabilitation, energetic release of the past, and precision nutritional testing. This synergy is the heart of my full spectrum healing, where the realms of body and mind converge harmoniously. My abilities as a clairaudient medium and emotional-pain dowser, coupled with the capacity to mend both future and past, enhance my holistic healing practice. My patient spectrum predominantly comprises those grappling with disorders and complex traumas. The beauty of my work lies in its unity - healing physical, emotional, and chemical aspects in a single transformative session. Personally, I've triumphed over three challenging foot injuries, a journey that unveiled the healing power of yoga as rehabilitation. As a practitioner of full spectrum healing, I guide others to discover their innate healing potential by nurturing their physical, emotional, and chemical dimensions. Thank you for joining me on this remarkable healing journey. Together, we'll traverse the intricacies of holistic wellness, charting a course toward a revitalized sense of self. Warmly, Dr. Rebecca Call/Text: 805-723-2966 Email: Healing@karma-chiropractic.com HEALING THEORY: Envision a pathway to rejuvenation: the spinal cord, a conduit to your body's innate healing. Within this intricate network, I specialize in releasing antiquated scripts, those that have hindered your natural capacity for wellness. These scripts, nestled within the spinal cord, intertwine nutritional, physical, and emotional barriers, creating a narrative of blockage. Guided by intuition and supported by meticulous chiropractic evaluations, I facilitate the release of your body's suppressed story. This story, a compilation of your body's whispers, longs to be unburdened. Through my skillset, we gently disentangle these narratives, unearthing your potential for wondrous, spontaneous healing. The outcome is liberation - a spinal cord unburdened, a spirit untethered, and a body unshackled.
