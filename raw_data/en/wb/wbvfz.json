Candidates will be contacted with further details. - - Who can apply You can apply for a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship if you're already driving your own research and you're ready to lead an independent research programme. You must have a PhD and significant postdoctoral research experience. You should have made important contributions to your area of research, eg publications, patents, software development or an impact on policy. You must have sponsorship from a head of department or equivalent at an [eligible host organisation](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/eligibility-information-applicants#eligible-host-organisations)in the UK. Applicants who want to be based in the Republic of Ireland should apply for a [Research Career Development Fellowship](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/research-career-development-fellowships)instead. If you're proposing to stay in your current department, you should describe in your application how this proposal will further your independent scientific career. If you've been away from research (eg for a career break, maternity leave, or long-term sick leave), we'll allow for this when we consider your application. What we're looking for You should identify an important question that's within our [scientific remit](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/science-remit). We will review: - your research contributions - the scientific merit of your proposed project - the significance of the research - the feasibility of your proposal - the suitability of your sponsor and host environment for both your research and for the development of your independent career. At the end of this fellowship, you should: - have achieved international standing in your area of research - be leading your own research programme - have the skills and experience to apply for senior level fellowships or permanent positions at UK research organisations.

See the 'What we offer' section on this page for an update on extensions. Who can't apply You can't usually apply if: - you have a permanent or rolling employment contract, although we're willing to consider a preliminary application if you have a strong justification for moving to a different organisation - you have held or you currently hold a nationally competitive fellowship at the same (or a similar) career stage as this fellowship - you're currently applying for another Wellcome fellowship or a Royal Society University Research Fellowship. You can't apply if you want to combine research with a continuing clinical career in medicine, psychology, dentistry or veterinary practice. Instead, see our clinical fellowship schemes. You can only submit two full applications to this scheme. If you've already been unsuccessful with a full application, please contact us before you apply again. You can't apply to carry out activities that involve the transfer of grant funds into mainland China. What's expected of your host organisation You must have a sponsor who is a head of department or equivalent (eg centre director or head of school) in your host organisation. If you propose to work in a low- or middle-income country during your fellowship, you may also need a sponsor in that location. Your sponsor must guarantee that the host organisation will provide: - support to lead your own independent research - the space and resources you'll need from the start date through to the end date of your award - the status and benefits of other academic staff of similar seniority. Your sponsor should not expect you to spend more than six hours a week on non-research activities (eg teaching or administration). Your sponsor's support and mentorship should be part of a longer-term commitment to help you achieve your career aspirations.

You should ask for a level of funding that's justifiable for your proposed research. If your proposal is for more than \u00a31.2 million, please [contact us](https://wellcome.org/about-us/contact-us/funding-enquiry-enhanced)before you apply. New applicants, including those who have already applied but not yet been notified of a decision, who are awarded a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship, will no longer be able to apply for an extension at the end of their award. Current Sir Henry Dale Fellowship holders can apply for a 3 year extension if their award ends on or before 31 October 2022. They must submit their application by 24 June 2021 (see the 'key dates' section on this page). Those whose awards end after this time will not be eligible for an extension. The fellowship may be held on a part-time basis. The award includes: - - We will fund the total cost of your salary for the entire period of the grant. You should ask your host organisation to calculate this. It should reflect the skills, responsibilities and expertise needed to carry out the role, and include: - your basic salary - employer's contributions, including any statutory obligations (eg National Insurance contributions if you're based in the UK) and pension scheme costs - any incremental progression up the salary scale - locally recognised allowances such as London allowance. You should exclude any Wellcome Trust fellowship supplement that was part of a previous grant. You should allow for salary pay awards during Year 1. These should be based on pay awards already agreed: if you don't know what the pay award is yet then use our inflation rate. For Year 1 include any known pay awards for this period or an assumed percentage equivalent to our current inflation rate of 2.0% if this hasn't been confirmed. From Year 2 onwards, we will automatically increase your salary, based on our current inflation allowance rates.

Equipment maintenance We will cover maintenance costs for equipment if: - you are requesting it in your application - it is existing equipment that is: - funded by us or another source - essential to the proposed research project - more than five years old - cost effective to keep maintaining it. We won't cover maintenance costs for equipment if there is a mechanism in place to recoup these costs through access charges. Computer equipment We will cover the cost of one personal computer or laptop per person up to \u00a31,500. We won't pay for: - more expensive items, unless you can justify them - installation or training costs. - - - You can ask for the cost of access to shared equipment or facilities if they're essential to your research project.

This includes childcare and any other caring responsibility you have, provided: - Wellcome is paying your salary - the conference is directly related to your research - the caring costs are over and above what you'd normally pay for care - the conference organiser and your employing organisation are unable to cover the costs. You can ask for up to \u00a31,000 per person for each conference. Collaborative travel We provide travel and subsistence costs for you and any research staff employed on your grant for UK and overseas visits to collaborators, and for collaborators to visit your laboratory. You'll need to justify each visit and its duration. Other travel We will pay for other essential visits, for example to facilities, for sample collection and for fieldwork. You can include subsistence costs. Carbon offset costs This is a new policy. It applies to all types of travel costs Wellcome provides.
