Abstract Vitiligo is a dermatologic pigmentary disorder triggered by melanocytes' loss and sustained by a deep immune imbalance which induce chronic inflammation and excessive oxidative stress phenomena at skin level. Current therapies are mainly symptomatic and designed in order to inhibit the inflammatory mediators at vitiligo patches level. To restore the correct immune balance between Th1/Th17 and Th2/Treg response and concomitantly rebalancing the inflammatory response represents an innovative and effective approach for Vitiligo treatment; Low Dose Medicine theories and the availability of specific low dose SKA interleukins, antibodies and growth factors allows researchers and clinicians to act simultaneously against all the main etiologic causes of vitiligo and makes possible to design new therapeutic approaches for vitiligo. Keywords: V i tiligo; Introduction V itiligo is an inflammatory autoimmune skin disorder characterized by the progressive appearance of depigmented skin lesions caused by the loss of melanocytes at the cutaneous level. The global incidence of vi tiligo is between 0.5% and 1% with peaks of 5/8% localized in Asiatic countries, especially in India, where it is considered a severe invalidating social stigma [1,2]. The etiology of vitiligo is still unclear but a growing number of obs ervations have led the researchers to consider altered cellular immunity as a key factor of melanocyte loss [3]; a shift in the immune res ponse, characterized by the prevalence of Th1/Th17-related cytokines (pro-inflammatory) instead of a Tregs/Th2-related one (anti- inflammatory), is responsible of the increase of proinflammatory cytokines primarily observed on the border of lesional vi tiliginous patches [4]. Interleukin-1; Interleukin-6 and key role in inflammation and oxidative stress-enhanced cytotoxicity which imp airs both melanocytes and keratinocytes survival [5-7]. Chronic inflammatory status, excessive oxidative stress and altered imm un e response induce the loss of cross-talk between keratinocytes and melanocytes, altering the homeostatic levels of involved specific cytokines and growth factors (Figure 1). The comprehension of the inner mechanisms of the intra- and intercellular signaling pathways is crucial to better understand the vitiligo etiopathology, in order to design new innovative and effective therapeutic protocols.

The melanocytes loss is the primary cause of skin depig mentation. Current Strategies for V itiligo Treatment The main goal of vitiligo treatment is to reduce the melanocytes' loss due to autoimmune response and to enhance their migration from surrounding normal skin to lesional patches. V itiligo therapeutic approaches are divided in pharmacological, physical and surgical categories (with the opportunity of combined therapies). Topical treatments realized with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors and phototherapy represent the first line options for vitiligo [8].Lotti et al., Pigmentary Disorders 2015, Access Pigmentary Disorders ISSN:2376-0427 JPD, open access journalVolume 2 1000229Journal Pigmentary Disorders ISSN: 2376-0427Journal of Pigmentary Disorders Topical corticosteroids represent the first choice for vitiligo treatment; they are relatively cheap and easy to apply and are classified from low- to high-power corticosteroids. Their use is limited by the risk of local adverse effects such as skin atrophy (due to collagen synthesis inhibition), telangiectasias, striae purpura and hypertrichosis. Systemic adverse effects are also present, the most severe are: adrenal axis ad growth inhibition, Cushing's Syndrome and muscular atrophy. All the adverse effects are dose-dependent; high-power topic corticosteroids are indicated for the treatment of small vitiliginous patches for a brief period (2-4 months); low-power corticosteroids or other immunomodulators are second choice drugs which can be considered in order to decrease the risk of adverse events. The absence of clinical response within 3/4 months of treatment leads to the suspension of corticosteroid-based treatment [8,9]. Calcineurin inhibitors, which includes cyclosporine (not for topic use), pimecrolimus and tacrolimus, were originally studied and applied as immune suppressor agents in transplanted patients. Unlike topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors do not brake the production of collagen and thus not lead to atrophy of the skin. For example, tacrolimus acts by inhibiting the production of pro- inflammatory cytokines by T lymphocytes through the block of IL-2 gene transcription; blocking the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, tacrolimus reduces the inflammatory and oxidative stress phenomena at the vitiligo patches level of injury resulting in skin repigmentation. Both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus induce redness and itching of the skin but are generally more tolerated than corticosteroids [8,9]. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) of both A and B spectrum is used in the treatment of vitiligo; the action mechanism of UV rays is not fully understood but probably acts inducing immunosuppression and consequent reduction of melanocytes loss. UV A phototherapy was first introduced in 1948 in combination with psoralens (PUV A therapy), the role of psoralens is to sensitize the skin to UV A rays improving their efficacy. Short-term (skin irritation, ocular/cutaneous phototoxicities, nausea and headache) and long-term (increased risk of skin cancer) side effects are linked with UV A/PUV A treatments [8-11]. In the last two decades Narrow Band UVB therapy arose. UVB-NB are effective and safe ensuring a higher repigmentation response compared to PUV A. UVB-NB treatment dispenses the use of psoralens avoiding the onset of gastrointestinal and ocular side effects [12,13]. V itiligo topical treatments with pharmacologic or physical agents are effective but present some pitfalls such as highly variable response/ repigmentation rates, low compliance (particularly in pediatric use) and quite severe side effects which make difficult the adherence to a long-term therapy. Searching for New Therapeutic Opportunity for V itiligo: The Low Dose Medicine In recent years, preclinical and clinical results obtained by researchers operating in the field of Low Dose Medicine (LDM, an innovative medical approach based on Molecular Biology and Psycho- Neuro-Endocrine-Immunology (P .N.E.I.) and developed thanks to the results of research in the field of low doses pharmacology) highlighted the possibility of the treatment of V itiligo using low dose activatedinterleukins, antibodies, neuropeptides and growth factors (low dose SKA molecules) [14-22]. Immune imbalance, inflammation and consequent reduction of melanocytes' number and viability are the key triggers of skin depigmentation in vitiligo. Acting at the origin of the altered inflammatory response (rebalance of pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators) with low dose SKA cytokines and antibodies (IL-10, IL-4 and Anti-IL-1) and, simultaneously, stimulation of melanocytes growth and melanin synthesis with low dose SKA basic-Fibroblast Growth Factor, represents the new LDM therapeutic approach for vitiligo. Both basic and clinical studies were performed in order to test and validate the LDM approach for vitiligo. In vitro/ex vivo experiments were conducted on human perilesional keratinocytes from skin of vitiligo patients (cells obtained from lesion skin biopsies) treated with low dose SKA IL-4, IL-10, b-FGF, and - endorphin [20]. Obtained results highlighted a significant reduction of both intra- cellular and extra-cellular oxidative stress in cells treated with low dose SKA molecules. The improvement of oxidative status results in a reduction of inflammatory mediators with consequent increase of keratinocytes viability compared to control perilesional cells. These results validated the theoretical LDM approach confirming the key role of inflammation and oxidative stress phenomena in vitiligo onset and the correctness of the used low dose SKA molecules. Furthermore, a retrospective spontaneous clinical study was performed and published by Lotti et al. [21]. In this retrospective study, repigmentation rate was evaluated in patients who received both pharmacological (corticosteroid cream), physical (Narrow Band UVB and sunlight exposure) topical treatments and systemic treatment (oral intake of Ginkgo biloba extract); additionally, some patients concomitantly assumed (systemic oral administration) low dose SKA IL-4; IL-10; Anti-IL-1 antibodies and low dose SKA b-FGF. Evaluated clinical evidences highlighted that low dose SKA b-FGF alone and the association of low dose SKA IL-4, IL-10 and anti-IL-1 antibodies was effective in a significative number of cases with good repigmentation rates. The association of low dose SKA treatments with the topical Narrow Band UVB treatment further boosted the repigmentation rate, paving the way to an integrated use of the two therapeutic tools. Conclusions In summary the efficacy of low doses of SKA signaling molecules in order to reduce oxidative damages was assessed with both preclinical and clinical studies with strong evidences of positive rebalancing action on inflammation, immune alterations and oxidative stress- induced cytotoxicity, the most important inflammatory triggers in V itiligo. Low dose SKA signaling molecules safety was also assessed since no adverse effects were reported. LDM approach, characterized by high compliance due to the simplicity of administration of oral drops and proven efficacy and safety, represent a valid supportive and/or alternative treatment to the currently applied therapeutic protocols for vitiligo [23].Citation: Lotti T, Rivkina T, Kadurina M (2015) New Winning Strategies for Vitiligo: The Low Dose Cytokines Therapy Approach.
