Cost: $110 contribution Includes an Hour and a Half of Sound Healing, Spiral Walk, Fire Ceremony and Vegetarian Supper plus endless cups of warming tea The Festivals around each Solstice are an opportunity for each of us to take a moment of active reflection and honour the path we have walked. It also offers the time for us to look forward and to see the potential in the season to come. Ancient rituals have been passed on down the generations and it is a wonderful way to bring families, friends and communities together. The Winter Solstice is a time to go inward and to take this time to nurture yourself, fill up your cup, take rest, enjoy company and share a meal. It's nice to also ponder what lies ahead, what is yet to come, what potential will arise, the landscape is also taking a rest and wondering what changes will become reality in the coming weeks as the days get slightly longer. Through a shamanic fire ceremony we are asked to reflect on what parts of ourselves are illuminated and we welcome the opportunity to let go of what no longer serves us. This will be followed with a smudging process to cleanse and clear, preparing for the Sound Session. The Mandala Room will be host to this years Winter Solstice Sound Session, it's our luxury yoga room which has been fitted with underfloor heating and plush finishings to make it the perfect mid-winter place for this gathering. The Sound Session will be vibrations created from our ancient symphonic and planet gongs, crystal singing bowls, earth drum, didjeridu and stunning vocals. The evening concludes with a shared supper, bringing a beautiful sense of community and connection as we indulge in this potent, potential filled time of the lunar cycle. Join us for a night of Contemplation and Inward Grace and gift yourself the deep healing of Sacred Sound at this Winter Solstice Sound Gathering. These unique experiences are nourishing for the senses and include: Sacred Circle, ceremonial cleansing smoke, essential oil aromas, ethereal sounds, warming herbal teas, nourishing supper and a warming fire.
