Keep your cats and dogs safe with these 23 non-toxic houseplant options.", "sitename": "The Spruce", "date": "2019-03-18", "cleaned_text": "Pet parents who are also plant enthusiasts need to know the houseplants that are considered to be dog and cat safe. Whether it's mischief or curiosity, dogs and cats might be tempted to chew and consume houseplants so it's important to ensure that you choose pet-friendly plants for your home. Of course, for the sake of your plants and your pets, you'll want to keep all houseplants out of general reach of your pets. But, because some houseplants are [toxic to cats and dogs](https://www.thespruce.com/dangerous-houseplants-for-pets-1902927), it's wise to investigate each plant you purchase to ensure peace of mind if your pet happens to chew a plant's leaves or roots. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is a good resource for learning about plant toxicity for cats, dogs, and horses. Here are 23 beautiful non-toxic indoor plants that are safe for cats and dogs. - 01 of 23 [African Violet (Saintpaulia)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-african-violets-indoors-1902733) African violets (Saintpaulia) are one of the most popular flowering safe houseplants for pets. They are also in demand because they bloom in low light and thrive in environmental conditions that people like: moderate temperatures and average humidity. Choose a soil-free potting mix and use a [balanced fertilizer](https://www.thespruce.com/what-does-npk-mean-for-a-fertilizer-2131094)for the best African violet health. Keep in mind that while the leaves and flowers are non-toxic to pets, the fertilizer you choose will be absorbed by the plant and has the potential to cause harm if your pet ingests part of the plant. So if your cat or dog has a track record for eating your houseplants, find a non-toxic or natural fertilizer to use for your African violets.Continue to 2 of 23 below. - 02 of 23 [Baby's Tears (Soleirolia soleirolii)](https://www.thespruce.com/baby-tears-plant-4582879) The creeping mat of tiny green leaves of Soleirolia soleirolii adds character to [terrariums](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-make-terrariums-848007), small [hanging baskets](https://www.thespruce.com/best-houseplants-for-hanging-baskets-4151149), and as a companion plant around the base of indoor trees. Baby tears plants cover the soil and might discourage pets that like to dig in your houseplants.Continue to 3 of 23 below. - 03 of 23 [Chinese Money Plant (Pilea peperomioides)](https://www.thespruce.com/growing-pilea-peperomioides-5090425) This easy-keeper is part of the nettle family (Urticaceae) but is a safe choice for homes with cats or dogs. Its trademark is its round, fleshy leaves in vibrant green. Ideally, you'll place it in a location in your home that receives bright, indirect light but it can survive in moderate-to-low light conditions too. When it comes to watering, do so infrequently but deeply. The soil should dry out in between watering sessions. The plant's disc-like leaves will give you an indicator if you've neglected watering for too long because they'll begin to droop. Continue to 4 of 23 below. - 04 of 23 [Banana Tree (Musa spp.)](https://www.thespruce.com/banana-tree-growing-profile-3269353) The large pet-friendly banana tree (Musa spp.) serves as a dramatic accent plant and grows to a height of six feet or more, though dwarf varieties top out between two and four feet. A central stem splits into long, wide leaves that are sometimes used in tropical cuisine to steam or serve food. Safe enough for serving human food, it's not a huge surprise to find this plant listed as non-toxic by the ASPCA, making it a safe houseplant for cats and dogs. This tropical houseplant needs conditions that replicate its natural habitat in order to thrive. Specifically, you'll need to provide the banana tree with rich soil, bright light, and regular watering. And while dogs and cats can eat bananas as a treat, don't count on your banana tree as a supply source because trees kept indoors rarely produce fruit.Continue to 5 of 23 below. - 05 of 23 [Echeveria (Echeveria spp.)](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-echeveria-4778458) [This type of succulent is a safe choice](https://www.thespruce.com/succulents-safe-for-cats-7479632)if you share your home with dogs or cats because it's non-toxic. The echeveria plant grows plump rosettes, ranging in color from greenish-silver to blue-green or even lilac-hued. Like other succulents, you won't have to hover around this indoor houseplant, but you should place it in a location that gets at least 4 to 6 hours of sun each day. Water when the soil is completely dry; typically every 1 to 2 weeks. This plant will suffer if overwatered but it also doesn't do well with extended periods of drought. Continue to 6 of 23 below. - 06 of 23 [Gloxinia (Sinningia speciosa)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-senningia-hybrids-indoors-1902487) Gloxinia hybrids are a compact, flowering houseplant with a height between six and ten inches. It looks great as a single plant on a plant stand or as a centerpiece for your dining room table. Whatever spot you choose, remember that it's a low-light plant and should be kept out of bright, direct light. It requires frequent watering; the soil should be kept moist during the growing period. It will eventually drop its petals and leaves. If you're looking for a blooming houseplant that is dog- and cat-safe, gloxinia makes an ideal choice. The thick, ruffled leaves and single or double blooms (commonly seen in white, red, pink, lavender, purple, or blue) are non-toxic to dogs and cats. Because most of these plants are Sinningia speciosa hybrids, there is great variety in the shape and colors of the flowers. The plants are frequently sold as gifts and have a bloom cycle followed by a dormant period. Continue to 7 of 23 below. - 07 of 23 [Spider Plant (Chlorophytum)](https://www.thespruce.com/spider-plants-chlorophytum-definition-1902773) The cascading nature of the spider plant's foliage means it's a natural fit for elevated spaces like floating shelves, hanging baskets, or a windowsill (as long as it doesn't receive too much light). Also known as ribbon plant or airplane plant, it's non-toxic to cats and dogs and has a reputation as a hardy houseplant. The spider plant is tolerant of a wide range of light, moisture, and soil conditions. Pot it in loose, loamy soil and water regularly. The spider plant prefers partial shade; too much sun can scorch foliage and full shade might stunt growth. As the plant grows, it sends out shoots with [small plantlets](https://www.thespruce.com/spider-plant-propagation-5087087), giving this houseplant its common name of spider plant.

Venus fly traps (Dionaea muscipula) are non-toxic to cats and dogs, so a curious nibble won't result in a trip to see a veterinarian. [Bright light](https://www.thespruce.com/lighting-for-houseplants-1902691)and irrigation with distilled water will keep these pet-friendly plants in fly-catching condition. Continue to 9 of 23 below. - 09 of 23 [Areca Palm (Dypsis lutescens)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-areca-palms-indoors-1902876) Also known as the butterfly palm, Dypsis lutescens makes any interior feel like a trip to the tropics. Sometimes palm fronds can trigger a cat's playful swatting and biting instincts, so it's comforting to know that the areca palm isn't toxic for cats or dogs. This variety of indoor palm tree needs plenty of bright light. Ideally, it should be located in a south- or west-facing window. A well-draining pot is a must and you should allow the soil to [dry out between waterings](https://www.thespruce.com/tips-for-watering-houseplants-1902807). Take note that the areca palm is sensitive to fluoride in water, so you should ideally water it with distilled water or collected rainwater. Continue to 10 of 23 below. - 10 of 23 [Boston Fern (Nephrolepis)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-nephrolepis-boston-ferns-1902723) Boston ferns (Nephrolepis) are an enduring houseplant favorite, but their shaggy fronds might tempt cats and dogs to chew on them. Sometimes known as a sword fern, it has foliage that shoots straight up from the center of the plant, then arches as the frond grows longer. The foliage is non-toxic to cats and dogs, so it's fine to brighten up your guest room or [bathroom](https://www.thespruce.com/best-houseplants-for-bathroom-4151160)with these lush plants. Boston ferns prefer humidity and lots of bright, indirect light.Continue to 11 of 23 below. - 11 of 23 [Calathea (Calathea spp.)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-calathea-indoors-1902745) Calathea spp. plants, also called zebra plants or peacock plants, bear large tropical leaves with fascinating stripes or stippling. A calathea is an excellent choice for a shady spot in the pet-friendly house because too much light can cause the foliage color to fade. However, they're not the most low-maintenance houseplant. Calatheas prefer temperatures to remain constant between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (and never below 60 degrees). They need to be regularly watered but you must be careful not to overwater them. Because it's a tropical plant, calatheas thrive in humid environments, so placing it on a [pebble tray](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-make-a-pebble-tray-7371481)with water might be necessary to add more moisture to the air around the plant. Continue to 12 of 23 below. - 12 of 23 [Haworthia (Haworthia spp.)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-haworthia-succulents-1902980) Haworthia is a slow-growing, non-toxic succulent with minimal care requirements. Mature plants measure three to five inches tall, have rosettes of fleshy green leaves spotted with white warts or bands, and produce offsets. Clusters of haworthia can be separated to multiply your houseplant collection; these container plants usually need repotting every two or three years. Unlike the similar-looking [aloe plants](https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-aloe-plants-4586709), all members of the large Haworthia genus are safe for cats and dogs. Ideally, you should place your haworthia in bright light and water weekly in the summer and less frequently in the winter. It can tolerate moderate-to-low light conditions, too, but if the leaves start to lose their green coloring, that's an indicator that the plant is receiving insufficient light.Continue to 13 of 23 below. - 13 of 23 [Polka Dot Plant (Hypoestes phyllostachya)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-hypoestes-phyllostachya-indoors-1902650) The green, pink, red, or white splashed foliage of Hypoestes phyllostachya is so ornamental that you won't need to worry about providing the perfect conditions to trigger blooming that many houseplants need. Although non-toxic to cats and dogs, sensitive pets might experience mild digestive upset if they consume large quantities of the polka dot plant or other non-toxic plants.Continue to 14 of 23 below. - 14 of 23 [Air Plant (Tillandsia stricta)](https://www.thespruce.com/growing-tillandsia-stricta-5085259) [Air plants](https://www.thespruce.com/air-plant-care-guide-5211052)are not your typical houseplant; as epiphytes, they don't grow in soil. Instead, you'll want to attach them to a board or other solid surface mount. For the sake of your plant and to prevent the stiff leaves of this bromeliad from attracting your cat's attention, secure it using glue, wire, or twine to its mount. Just keep in mind that to water the air plant, you'll have to submerge it in water for 10 to 30 minutes every week or two. If it's too challenging to soak the plant with your choice of surface mount, you can heavily mist the plant several times each week. Continue to 15 of 23 below. - 15 of 23 [Prayer Plant (Maranta leuconeura)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-maranta-inside-1902647) The prayer plant has a unique habit: it folds its leaves each evening, giving the impression of hands folded in prayer. It's non-toxic for pets and makes a popular houseplant choice, given its tropical foliage. It adapts well to a range of light conditions, though it prefers bright, indirect light. It will grow in moderate-to-low light conditions, too. This is not a plant that tolerates dry conditions. The top of the soil should feel dry to the touch but completely dried out soil spells trouble for this plant. To prevent problems, water it as soon as the top layer of soil is dry. Continue to 16 of 23 below. - 16 of 23 [Friendship Plant (Pilea involucrata)](https://www.thespruce.com/pilea-definition-and-overview-1902769) Pilea involucrata is a trailing plant with fragile stems that thrives in high humidity. It does well as a terrarium specimen, making it even more unlikely that your cat or dog will take an unauthorized nibble. It's one of the best pet-friendly plants to put on full display in any room in your home.Continue to 17 of 23 below. - 17 of 23 [Peperomia (Peperomia spp.)](https://www.thespruce.com/peperomia-plant-4584414) The diversity of colors and textures across the Peperomia species keeps them on the short list of popular houseplants. They are non-toxic to cats and dogs, look great in containers, and they [don't mind if you occasionally forget to water](https://www.thespruce.com/drought-resistant-plants-2132050)them.Continue to 18 of 23 below. - 18 of 23 [Orchid (Orchidaceae)](https://www.thespruce.com/basic-indoor-orchid-care-1902822) If you have a passion for orchids (Orchidaceae), you can safely add them to your go-to list of pet-safe plants. [Many orchids](https://www.thespruce.com/orchid-identification-1315976)bloom for weeks in the winter when days are short and thrive in partial light and root-bound conditions.Continue to 19 of 23 below. - 19 of 23 [Mosaic Plant (Fittonia albivenis)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-fittonia-houseplants-indoors-1902486) Besides mosaic plant, one of the common names of Fittonia albivenis is nerve plant, which has the ominous sound of something that affects the nervous system. However, this rainforest native with lovely white- or pink-veined leaves is non-toxic to cats and dogs. This small and safe houseplant thrives in low light with moderate watering. However, it requires a very humid environment. With this in mind, a bathroom is a good indoor location. Continue to 20 of 23 below. - 20 of 23 [Bromeliad (Bromeliaceae)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-bromeliads-indoors-1902667) The tough, strappy leaves of the bromeliad and the curious cone-shaped blooms make [bromeliad plants](https://www.thespruce.com/growing-bromeliads-at-home-1403144)(Bromeliaceae family) favorites as houseplants. These pet-safe plants are easy to maintain, needing only a bright window and a humid environment. The appearance and specific care needs vary depending on the bromeliad you choose; many varieties grow as soil-free epiphytes attached to a log. You can secure them to the log by tying them in place or using glue. The advantage of a soil-free houseplant like a bromeliad is that it eliminates the potential for a soil disaster if your dog or cat tends to dig in your potted plants or knock them over. Continue to 21 of 23 below. - 21 of 23 [Ponytail Palm (Beaucarnea recurvata)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-beaucarnea-recurvata-1902886) The ponytail palm, which is sometimes called elephant's foot because of its round, smooth trunk, is a popular indoor tree that is easy to grow. You might think that the thin, swinging fronds of this palm would be attractive to household pets, especially cats, and you wouldn't be wrong with this assumption. Fortunately these plants are non-toxic. The only damage done will be to the palm fronds. If you encounter this issue, try moving your ponytail palm out of your pet's reach or provide an edible alternative\u2014like cat grass. If you do move the ponytail palm to a new indoor location, keep in mind that these non-toxic plants thrive in bright light and like to be watered when they're on the dry side. Continue to 22 of 23 below. - 22 of 23 [Purple Waffle Plant (Hemigraphis alternata)](https://www.thespruce.com/purple-waffle-plant-overview-4581371) The textured leaves of the purple waffle plant (Hemigraphis 'Exotica') offer all-season interest for those who don't grow flowering houseplants. Bright indirect light will help to maintain the purple coloration without bleaching the leaves. Purple waffle plants are known as great air purifiers, keeping the environment healthy for you and your pet.Continue to 23 of 23 below. - 23 of 23 [Purple Passion Vine (Gynura aurantiaca)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-velvet-plant-indoors-1902643) Gynura aurantiaca plants are a unique addition to your dog- or cat-safe houseplant collection. They feature velvety hairs on the leaves. The brighter the light conditions, the deeper the color of the purple leaves. These plants grow very fast, but be forewarned that they only have a lifespan of a few years. One way to maximize the plant's lifespan is to water them only when the soil is dry, which prevents [root rot](https://www.thespruce.com/treat-root-rot-houseplants-5223283). - Can you keep toxic plants with cats and dogs?

That might mean putting it on a high shelf that's inaccessible to your pet or growing it outside as a potted outdoor plant where your pet doesn't go. - Are succulents safe for cats and dogs? Many succulents, such as haworthia, are safe for cats and dogs. But it's important to know your specific succulent species, as they aren't all pet-friendly. - Is lavender safe for cats and dogs?
