A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT, DR. JUDY GENSHAFT Thank you for your interest in graduate education at the University of South Florida System. USF is a Top 50 research university that has been named by the Chronicle of Higher Education as one of the fastest growing research universities in the nation in federal funding. We are distinguished by our excellent research and graduate education and our location in a major ur ban region that is among the nation\u00b9s most diverse and desirable places to live. Strong interdisciplinary programs put USF on the leading edge of research and graduate education in a number of areas. For example, collaboration among researchers throughout the university has made USF a leader in the neuro s cience of aging and USF's interdisciplinary doctoral program in Aging Studies was the first of its kind in the nation. Recently, USF's Industrial/Organizational Psychology program was ranked highest in the nation for publication in peerreviewed journals and the Princeton Review has named USF's Center for Entrepreneurship one of the Top Entrep reneurial Graduate Programs in the country. In addition to doctoral programs, USF offers many opportunities for postgraduate study through our many Master's and Graduate Certificate programs, many of which are designed to prepare graduates to make immediate contributions to the economic, cultural and social vitality of communities. A growing focus for the university is enlisting leading i ndustries in our area as partners in graduate programs as evidenced by our new partnership with the Tampa Bay Lightning, The Lightning Foundation and USF's College of Business in an MBA in Sport and Entertainment Mana gement, a progra m em phasizing the business fundamentals of the sports and entertainment industry. Our commitment to discovery and the application of knowledge relevant to urban communities has earned USF frequent citations as a model of an \"engaged university.\" The opportunities for graduate education at USF are vast, and we have worked hard to build an environm e nt that supports and encourages innovation. In many areas, USF offers programs that prepare you to make your best contribution to a challenging world. I invite you to inquire further about USF programs of interest to you. Sincerely yours, Judy Genshaft, Ph.D. President Office of the President http://system.usf.e du/president/about president genshaft.asp USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 1 Welcome to Graduate Studies! 2 A MESSAGE FROM THE PROVOST AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, DR. RALPH WILCOX As one of the nation's best and fastest growing research universities, the University of South Florida is attracting in ever growing numbers many of the world's best and brightest students, which today, as you read this, includes you. Thank you for considering USF to be your academic home as you prepare to embark on the challenging yet ultimately rewarding journey of graduate educ ation. It is a serious commitment, and one to which the dedicated faculty and staff at USF attach utmost importance. Our shared promise is to engage you in meaningful programs and initiatives that support the educational, health, and socioeconomic wellbein g of the local, national, and global communities we all serve \u2014 efforts that embrace interdisciplinary inquiry and collaboration as the keys to success not only within our academic programs, but also in the globally interwoven world of 21st century business, communications, and culture.

Such recognition speaks to both the professional regard afforded to our faculty members by their peers worldwide and the quality of academic mentorin g available to our graduate students across a broad range of scholarly endeavors. At USF, we encourage students and faculty to forge real relationships that replace the more academic department centered experience common of most other graduate schools. We believe, too, that interdisciplinary partne rships between students, faculty, and researchers ac ross campus, in the community, and around the world strengthen both the university and the graduate student experience at USF, creating a \"collaboration for competition\" that often leads to new knowledge and exciting, innovative solutions to pervasive and emerging problems.

The sources may include: undergraduate grade point average, letters of recommendation, personal statements, samples of academic work, portfolios, auditions, professional experience related to proposed gradu ate study, as well as nationally know n, standardized test scores. It is the responsibility of each graduate program to select admissions criteria that best predict success in their specific field and to determine the weight given to each measure. None of the sources of information, parti cularly standardized test scores, should be used in isolation nor should such scores be used in com bination or separately to establish minimum or \"cut off\" scores. Program specific guidelines for the use of standardized test scores should be developed based on the experience of a given department with its pool of applicants.1 1 Adapted from the GRE \"Guide to the Use of Scores\" 2003-2003 USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 14 Admission Requirements Each applicant to a graduate program at the University of South Florida is required to meet the following minimum requirements: 1.

Such a request must be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies with justification and docu mentation. *International students who are seeking employment as a teaching assistant (in departments that offer them) must meet additional English Language Requirements. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 15 Application Process (How it works) Graduate applicants are urged to submit accurate and complete information as early as possible. Applications and supporting documents received after the application deadline will only be acted upon at the discretion of the graduate program. They will be kept on file for up to one year. At the request of the applicant or gradu ate program, they will be processe d for th e next available term. Please consult with your graduate program is a Direct Receipt Program. For Direct Receipt Programs application materials should be uploaded with the online application AND the hard copies should be sent directly to the program (NOT to the Office of Graduate Admissions.) All inquiries regarding application status should also be directed to th e Program. The Graduate Admissions Office and the Graduate Program review your application for admission to graduate study at USF. Once the graduate program reviews your eligibility for its graduate program they will forward their decision to the Graduate Admissions Office which, in turn, will issue the official decision. If you are a foreign graduate applicant, the International Services Office (http://global.usf.edu/is/ ) will evaluate your financial and immigration documents after you are admitted to determine your eligibility for a student visa. Your financial statement must be dated within 6 months of the starting the degree program. Each of these offices may request additional documents from you to make a decision.

Responsibility for one's own conduct and respect for the rights of others are essential conditions for academic and personal freedom within the University. USF reserves the right to deny admission or refuse enrollment to students whose actions are contrar y to the purposes of the University or impair the welfare or freedom of other members of the Universi ty comm unity. Disciplinary procedures are followed when a student fails to exercise responsibility in an acceptable manner or commits an offense as outlined in the Student Conduct Code. Refer to the USF 6.0021, Student Code of Conduc t at http://general counsel.usf.ed u/regulations/pdfs/regulation usf6.0021.pdf Responsible Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF has information about RCR available online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php Effective Spring 2013, the Office of Graduate Studies requires all new doctoral students to have basic RCR training by completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) module most relevant to the student's program of study. The CITI modules have been designed to introduce researchers to various elements of research conduct ranging from research misconduct to data management to mentoring. As this is a minimum requirement, specific doctoral programs ma y require training that goes beyond the basic components introduced in this module. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 35 Graduate Programs that have received Office of Graduate Studies approval for rigorous RCR training consistent with disciplinary standards and practices may exempt their students from the CITI requirement. Students must complete the module, or provide evidence of previous qualified RCR training to their Program Director and Office of Graduate Studies, in the first semester enrolled in a doctoral program . Previous RCR training should have been completed within the past year. Students will be unable to register for courses in a future semester until successful fulfillment of this RCR requirement. Once the training is completed, the Registration hold will be lifted. Intellectual and Scholarship Integrity Shared Authorship and Research Education Policy USF contains a broad range of academic programs in diverse disciplines, and the USF faculty recognize that the conventions on shared authorship and credit for scholarship vary among disciplines. In general, sharing in authorship implies both substantive intellectual contributions to the work and also approval of the work as it appears in public. Right to authorship credit is not automatically conveyed by being the instructor of a course, being a student's major professor, or being a research assistant working with faculty and professional researchers; neither is credit automatically prohibited because of such status. Each college /program that includes research educat ion shall include an explicit discussion of sh ared authorship issues and disciplinary conventions as part of the formal curriculum addressing research methods and ethics, including the conventions of the discipline's publications. In addition, each college or program shall have a formal statement about shared authorship made available to students (such as on a college or program website) or given to students at the same time as they are given no tice about other program and college expectations. Each college/program shall also have a written procedure for resolving questions or conflicts about shared authorship where students are involved. The college and prog ram may use the same procedure for reso lving questions for nonstudent employees, but the procedure for resolving questions or conflicts involving students must address the educational needs of students (e.g., explicitly asking about the nature of the research methods and ethics education as experienced by a student involved in the case at hand ). This written procedure must be made available to stude nts (su ch as on a college or program website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice about other program and university expectations.

Graduate Catalog The USF Graduate Catalog, including college and program requirements, and program and course descriptions, is available on the web at http://www.grad.usf.edu . Each Catalog is published and in effect for the academic term(s) noted on the title page. Student's Program Degree Requirements In order to graduate, students must meet all requirements specified in the USF Catalog of their choice, except as noted below. As the University is dynamic, changes and updates to the catalog are anticipated. In contract to program requirements, which are tied to a specific catalog, all studen ts must comply with University policies and procedures that come into effect each catalog year. Students cannot choose a USF Catalog published prior to admission (or readmission) or during an academic year in which they did not complete at least two terms. If a studen t is dropped from the system and mus t be reinstated, the student's choice of Catalog is limited to the USF Catalog in effect at the time of readmission or any one Catalog published during their continuous reenrollment. If state law or certification requirements change, the student must comply with the most curre nt standard or criteria. If the College or Department makes fundamental chan ges to the program that necessitates changes in the degree requirements of enrolled students, the needs of those students will be explicitly addressed in the proposal for change and scrutinized by the Office of Graduate Studies. USF policies and procedures not relate d to degree requirements such as academic grievance procedures, student conduct code and other procedural processes and definitions may be updated each year and the student will be held to the most current catalog and procedures available. USF does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in th is Catalog. If the student cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the Catalog of choice as a result of decisions and changes made by the University, appropriate substitutions will be determined by the program to ensure that the student is not penalized. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 37 Student/Advisor Relationship Although it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements, the Advisor's role is to guide students in all aspects of their academic program and to monitor and evaluate students' progress toward their degrees. He/she should be aware of any difficulties that students may be facing in their coursework or research experiences and should work with stude nts in resolving these issues. It is recommended that the advisor and student understand each other's expectations and that effective means of communication are established. The advisor and student are encouraged to meet at appropriat e intervals to critically evaluate the student 's progress. These meetings may be requested by the student or the advisor. The advisor also has the obligation to express to the student any concerns he/she may have regarding the student's performance, to stipulate the level and quality of work expe cted, and to offer suggestions leading to student success. As such, the advisor neithe r gives the studen t excessive guidance nor allows the student to struggle needlessly. The goal of this relationship is to foster student independence, which results in successful completion of the program of study. Student's Program of Study In addition to the graduate degree program requireme nts as specified in the Graduate Catalog, each student should have a written, flexible program of study that includes the student's choice of Catalog year, choice of concentration, cognate, or other options available in the degree program, and a tentative identification of other appropriate choic es available to the student in the progr a m, which may (but does not need to) include specific courses. A program of study is not a guarantee that specific courses will be available in a specific semester or that statutory and regulatory requirements will not change during the student's enrollment in the program. As required or appropriat e, th e program of study should be revisited and modified by the student and the student's advisor/major professor(s). Electronic Signatures Where procedures described in this catalog require signatures, requirements for original signatures may be satisfied by University approved electronic signatures or other secure methods of verifying approval by advisors, major professors, committee members, or other University administrators, faculty, and staff. Assistantships Graduate Assistantships (GA), Research Assistantships (RA), and Teaching Assistantships (TA) Graduate Assistantships are intended to recruit quality students to graduate study at USF and to enhance the graduate learning experience. Graduate assistantships exist within academic departments or other university offices on campus. Graduate assistants may teach, conduct research, or perform other tasks that contrib ute to the stude nt's professional development. Graduate students may be classified as Graduate Assistants (GAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants/Associates (GTAs), Graduate Instructional Assistants (GIAs), and/or Graduate Research Assistants/Associates (GRAs). All graduate assistants at USF work under a contract negotiated by the Graduate Assistants United (GAU) and the USF Board of Trustees. The GAU is the labor union certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for graduat e assistants at USF. Eligibility To receive an assistantship, the grad uate student must meet the following eligibility requirements: Accepted in a graduate degree program; Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and degree program GPA of 3.00; Enrolled fulltime durin g the semester(s) appointed as a graduate assistant. For Teaching Assistants, demonstrate proficiency in spoken English (if student is not from an English speaking country) USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 38 Appointments Graduate Assistants may be appointed up to a maximum of 0.50 FTE for a single assistantship. Programs who desire to appoint a Graduate Student, in any classification, more than 0.50 FTE up to 0.75 FTE, for single or multiple appointments, must submit justification to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. Stud ents hired in nonGA positions on campus must also not exceed 0.75 FTE for the combin ed position and assistantship appointments. It is preferred that students refrain from employment outside of the assistantship appointment. Departments may determine the maximum number of semesters for teaching assistantship appointments. Enrollment Fulltime enrollment is considered nine (9) graduate credit hours in th e fall semester, nine (9) graduate credit hours in the spring semester, and six (6) graduate credit hours in the summer semester. If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study, the number of registered semester hours may be less than the fulltime requirement. Graduate assistants must comply with all Office of Graduate St udies enrollment requirements to retain their assistantship as stated in the Graduate Catalog. For specifics regarding Graduate Assistantship requirements, guidelines, and policies, refer to the Graduate Assistants Policies and Guidelines Handbook Note Criminal History Backg r ound Checks may be required depending on the appointment reference USF Policy 0615 http://generalcounsel.usf.edu/policies andprocedures/pdfs/policy 0615.pdf Enrollment Requirements Students receiving Veterans' Administration benefits should confirm their enrollment requirements with the Office of Veterans' Services or Veterans' Coordinator. Minimum University Regulations USF FullTime Student Definition Students taking a minimum of nine (9) hours toward their degree in the fall or spring semester, or taking a minimum of six (6) hours in the summer semester, will be classified as FullTime students for academic purposes. Stud ents may take a maximum of eighteen (18) hours in any given semester; exceeding eighteen (18) hours requires a signed program of study or written approval from the College. For financial aid enrollment requirements, refer to the Office of Financial Aid http :/ /usfweb2.usf.edu/finaid/other/enrollment.aspx . Continuous Enrollment for All Graduate Students All graduate degreeseeking students must be continuously enrolled. Continuous enrollment is defined as completing, with grades assigned, a minimum of 6 hours of graduate credit every three continuous semesters. Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Students on an approved leave of absence are not subjec t to the enrollment requirement for the time approved for the leave. Students who have bee n admitted to Doctoral Candidacy must follow the Dissertation Hour Enrollment in place of the Continuous Enrollment requirement as specified here for all graduate students (not in candidacy). See also the Time Limitations Policy. Readmi ssion Following Nonenrollment A graduate student who is not registered and enrolled for a minimum of six (6) credits in a 12 month period is automatically placed in nondegree seeking (i.e. inactive) status. Students must be readmitted to the degree program to continue their studies. Readmission is at the discretion of the program and is not guaranteed. Re fer to the Readmission Policy in the Graduate Admissions Section for more information. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 39 Enrollment during Comprehensive Exams and Admission to Candidacy During the term in which students take the comprehensive exams, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit. If the exam is taken between semesters, the student must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Students must also be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hou rs of graduate work in the semester of admission to doctoral candidacy. Dissertation Hours Students working on a dissertation must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of dissertation every semester, starting with the semester following Admission to Doctoral Candidacy, up to and inc luding the semester the dissertation is submitted to and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies. Dissertation hours may apply to the Continuous Enrollment Requirement. Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Students who are dropped from degreeseeking status and formally readmitted to the program must enroll in a minimum of 5 dissertation hour s in th e semester that the readmission is effective. Refer to the Readmission Policy in the Graduate Admissions Section for more information. Enrollment during Semester of Thesis Submission Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) thesis hours during the semester that the thesis is submitte d and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies, usually the semester of graduation. Studen ts not enrolled for the minimum requirement will not have the thesis/dissertation approved and therefore may not be certified for graduation. Enrollme nt during Seme ster of Graduation Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) graduate hours during the semester of graduation. Enrollment for Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants should be fulltime students. Exceptions must be approved by the College Dean and the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. Leaves of Absen c e (LOA) Leaves of absence may be granted to students under exceptional and unavoidable circumstances. Students requesting a LOA must specify the reasons for the leave, as well as the duration. Requested LOA may be approved for up to two years. Students requiring less than three (3) conse cutive terms of absence do not need an approved LOA if they meet the continuous enrollment requirement. Students with an approved LOA must be enrolled in the first semester after the leave expires. To request an LOA, the student must complete the form available from the Office of Graduate Studies website. The LOA must be approved by th e Major Professor, the Program, the College, and the Office of Graduate Studies, and is noted in the student's record. If the LOA is granted, the time absent does not count against the student's time limit to obtain the degree. Stud ents returning from an approved LOA must reactivate their status by con tacting the Office of Graduate Studies for procedures. Doctoral candidates returning from a LOA must also have their candidacy status reactivated. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 40 Academic Standards and Grades Minimum University Requirements In Good Standing To be considered a student in good standing, graduate students must Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken as a graduate student, and Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all cou rses taken in each of the student's degreeseeking programs. No grade of C or below will be accepted toward a graduate degree. Students must meet the requirements to be in good standing to graduate. All \"I\" and \"M\" grades must be cleared for graduation to be certified. Stude nts who fail to maintain good standing may be placed on probation or academically dismissed. Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of graded (AF) hours completed. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the numbe r of credits as signed to each course by the quality point value of the grade given. The GPA is truncated to two decimals (3.48) and is not rounded up. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, W, Z and grades which are preced ed by T (Transfer ) are subtracted from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Graduate students are not eligible for grade forgiveness. All grades earned, regardless of course level, will be posted on the transcript. If a student retakes a course, both grades will be used in the determination of the GPA. Courses taken at USF as nondegree seeking are not computed in the GPA unless the courses are transferred in and applied to the degree requirements. The program and the college must approve such actions. Grades for transfer credits accepted toward the degr ee program will not be counted in the GPA unless the coursework in question was taken as a nondegreeseeking student at USF and meets the requirements stated above (see Institution Based Credit/Transfer of Credit section). Graduate Grading System Plus/Minus Grading: Effective fall semester 2000, graduate and under graduate grades will be assigned quali ty points in the Grade Point Average (GPA) grading system. The +/ designation must be included in the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course. The use of the +/ grading system is at the discretion of the instructor. The syllabus policy is available in the office of the Provost. Letter grad e = number of grade points A 4.00 A 3.67 B+ 3.33 D+ 1.33 USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 41 D 1.00 D .67 F 0.00 FF Failure due to academic dishonesty2 CF Cancelled Financially (Course was cancelled due to financial reasons) CMU Cancelled, Missing Grade that has turned to a \"U\" IA Incomplete, grade points not applicable IB Incomplete, grade points not applicable IC Incomplete, grade points not applicable ID Incomplete, grade points not applicable IF Incomplete, grade points not applicable* M Missing grade /no grade repor ted by instructor, grade points not applicable N Audit, grade points not applicable S/U Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, grade points not applicable W Withdrawal or drop from course without penalty, grade points not applicable Z Continuing registration in multisemester internship or Thesis/Dissertation courses, grade points not applicable *Incomplete grade policy change effective fall 08. IF grad es earned and posted prior to fall 2008 do calculate in the GPA; IF grades earned as of fall 2008 forward do not calculate in the GPA refer to Incomplete Grade Policy for more information. Satisfactory (S)/ Unsatisfactory (U) Graduate students may not take courses in the major on an S/U (satisfactory / unsatisfactory) basis unless courses are specifically designated S/U in the Catalog. St udents may take courses outside of the major on an S/U basis with prior approval of the course professor, major professor or advisor, and the Dean of the College in which the stude nt is seeking a degree. The student may apply a maximum of six (6) hours of such credit (excluding those courses for which S/U is designated in the Catalog) toward a master's degree. Directed Research, Thesis, and Dissertation courses are designated as variable credit and are graded on an S/U basis only. Before a student beg ins work under Directed Research, a written agreement must be completed between the student and the professor concerned, setting forth in detail the requirements of the course. Incomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and granted at the instructor's discretion only when studen ts are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyon d their control. This applies to all gradable courses, including pass/fail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: majority of the student's work for a course has been completed before the end of the semester the work that has been completed must be qualitatively satisfactory the student has requested consideration for an \"I\" grade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of finals week. The student must request consideration for an Incomplete grade and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the eligibility requirements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the final decision on granting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must comp lete and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to 2 Graduate Students who receive an FF will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at USF. See section on Academic Dishonesty and Graduate Studies Policy on Academic Integrity for more information. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 42 be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed one semester from the original date grades were due for that course. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the dep artment that offered the course and the Office of Graduate Studies by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade. Stud en ts may register to audit the course, with the instructor's approval, but cannot retake the course for credit until the I grade is cleared. An I grade not cleared within the next academic semester (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contra ct. I grades are not compute d in th e GPA, but the grade noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semester the course was taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. When the final grade is assigned, if applicable, the student will be place d on academic probation or academically dismissed (refer to Automate d Ac ademic Probation Procedures for information). Students cannot be admitted to doctoral candidacy or certified for graduation with an \"I\" grade. Example: Current Semester student has a \"B\" in the course, not including the grade for the missing assignment, therefore is eligible for an \"I\" student's grade, includin g a zero for the missed work, would be an \"D\" student and instructor complete the \"I\" Grade Contract, assigning an \"ID\" (Incomplete +D grade) Deadline Agreed Upon in Contract (e.g. two weeks)* If the student completes the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the note d de adline the instructor of record will submit a change of grade in egrades student earns final grade comprised of all completed course work If the student does not complete the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the note d deadline \"I\" automatically drops off and the grade of \"D\" remain s. GPA is recalculated for the current semester and retroactively recalculated for the semester in which the \"I\" was granted. *Although the instructor establishes the deadline for completion of the work, the deadline may only extend through the end of the subseq uent seme s ter. Missing (M) The University policy is to issue an M grade automatically when the instructor does not submit any grade for a graduate student. Until it is removed, the M is not computed in the GPA. To resolve the missing grade, students receiving an M grade must conta ct their instructor. If the instructor is not available, the student must contact the instructor's department chair. Courses with an M grade may not be applied to the degree program requirements. Students with an M grade will not be admitted to doctoral candidacy until the M grade is resolved. Continuing Registration Grades (Z) The Z grade shall be used to indicate continuing registration in multi semester internship or thesis/dissertation courses where the final grade to be assigned will indicate the complete sequence of courses or satisfactory completion of the thesis/dissertation. Upon satisfactory completion of a multi semester internship or thesis/dissertation, the final grade assigned will be an S. The Office of Graduate Studies submits the chang e of USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 43 grade for the last registration of thesis/dissertation courses once the thesis/dissertation has been accepted for publication. Note: Graduation will not be certified until all courses have been satisfactorily completed. No grade changes will be processed after the student has graduated except in the case of university error. Procedures requiring petitions are processed through the Office of Gradua te Studies. Probation Any student who is not in good standing at the end of a semester shall be considered on probation as of the following semester. The college or program may also place students on probation for other reasons as designated by the college or program. Notificatio n of probation shall be made to the student in writing by the department, with a copy to the College Dean. At the end of each probationary semester, the department shall recommend, in writing, to the College Dean one of the following: 1. Removal of probation 2. Continued prob ation; OR 3. Dismissal from the degree program. Students on probation may only enr oll in graduate courses (50007000 level) that are part of the approved degree program requirements as specified in the Graduate Catalog. Students with a GPA below 3.00 for two consecutive semesters will be prevented from registering for courses without the permission of the College Dean. The College Dean will notify the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies in cases of academic dismissal. To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time. For information on the Automated Probatio n Pr ocess go to http://www.grad.usf.edu/inc/linked files/probation procedure.pdf Voluntary Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the university without grade penalty by the University deadline. Information on the different types of withdrawal (i.e., withdrawing from a single class - see the Drop section, an entire semester, or from the degree program itself) can be obtained from the Registrar's Office. Appropriate alterna tive calendar dates may apply . St udents who withdraw may not continue to attend classes. Transfer of Credit With the approval of their graduate degree program, students may, but are not guaranteed, transfer of graduate level structured coursework from regionally accredited institutions; this includes USF System Institutions. These courses must have grades of B or better to be eligible for transfer of credit. To ensure compliance with Institutional Enrollment Requirements (Residency), up to a maximum of 49% of a given graduate degree program's minimum hours may be transferred; these hours are reflected in the individual degree program listings in the USF Graduate Catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment for that degree program. For doctoral pr ograms, this percentage is based on the postbaccalaureate minimums. No coursework may be transferred that was completed five or more years prior to enrollment in the graduate degree program. Acceptance of transfer of credit requires approval of the student's acad emic advisor, Graduate Program Director, College Dean or designee, and the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies or designee. The graduate degree program / department will be responsible for evaluating, approving, and initiating the transfer using established criteria to ensure academic integrity of the coursework. This must be completed and submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies preferably in the first semester, but no la ter than the second semester the student is enrolled in the graduate degree program. Credits obtained from USF System Institutions will be calculated into the GPA at USF and will be note d on the transcript as the grade ea rned. Credits from other regionally accredited universities are not calculated into the GPA at USF. Also see Course Currency Policy in Section 5 Course Information. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 44 Change of Graduate Degree Program See Change of Graduate Program in the Admissions Section. Accelerated Program Guidelines Programs who desire to offer Accelerated Degree Programs must establish guidelines that define the following. The guidelines must then be submitted and approved by the Policy Committee of the Graduate Council. These guidelines are used in the development of a new Accelerated Program. For Departments Developing an Accelerated Program: Proposed Programs must meet the Accelerated Program Requirements, as well as follow the best practices listed below: Programs have a choice of conferring degrees simultaneously or sequentially, but it is recommended that undergraduate degrees are to be conferred in a timely manner as soon as undergraduate requirements are fulfilled. Programs must comple te a Program of Study, develop a plan for academic advising, and tracking of students, including notation of potential financial aid impact. Typically, up to twelve (12) hours of graduate credit may be shared between the graduate and undergraduate degree. Although, with Graduate Council and Office of Graduate Studies approval, programs may offer accelerate d programs with more shared credits. Typically, a minimum undergraduate GPA of at least 3.33 overall and a minimum GPA of 3.50 in the major, having taken a minimum of 15 hours in the undergraduate major are required for students to be admitted to an accelerated program. With Graduate Counc il and Office of Graduate Studies approval, programs may offer accelerated programs with different GPA requirements. Students must have a minimum of a \"B\" (3.00) in each graduate course. Consequences for not obtaining a \"B\" in each graduate course must be noted in the Department al Accelerated Program requirements. Following completion of a minimum of 15 hours in the undergraduate major, the student may be considered for acceptance into the Accelerated Degree program in one of two ways: faculty nomination or student selfnomination, via submission of the Accelerated Graduate Program Nomination Form. Prog rams will review the applications and approve the nomination. Programs will submit the required paperwork (Accelerated Graduate Program Admission Form ) to officially convert the student to graduate standing, no later than when the student has reached 90 hours or Bachelor's degree has been conferred. The application requires approval from the Graduate Program, College , and Office of Graduate Studies. What Departments will submit for Curriculum Approval and catalog copy: ACADEMIC INFORMATION (Catalog Copy): Accelerated Program Requirements Accelerated Programs allow academically qualified students to complete an undergraduate Bachelor's degree and a graduate master's degree on an accelerated timeline , graduating sooner than in traditional programs. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 45 Admission Requirements Admission into an Accelerated Program is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) Faculty Nomination 2) Student SelfApplication To be eligible for consideration for an Accelerated Program, students must: Have completed a minimum of 15 undergraduate hours in the major Have a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.33 overall Have a minimum undergrad u ate GPA of 3.50 in the major Accelerated Degree Program Academic Requirements Each Program will indicate the specific academic requirements, including the up to 12 hours of shared coursework between the undergraduate and graduate degrees. Undergraduate Degree Requirements specify Shared Requirements specify Graduate Degree Requirements specify Accelerated Program Information for Students: Accelerated Programs allow academically qualified students to complete an undergraduate Bachelor's degree and a graduate degree (typically master's degree) on an accelerated timeline, graduating sooner than in traditional programs. Typically students will complete a portion of the required graduate coursework while classified as an undergraduate student and have it count toward s both degrees. As soon as th e student completes the undergraduate degree requirements, the student is converted to graduate status, where the remaining graduate requirements are fulfilled. Students interested in pursuing an Accelerated Program must complete an Accelerated Program Application (http://www.grad.usf.edu/inc/linked files/Accelerated_Program_Application.pdf ). Editor's Note: Although students may be in an Accelerated Program, pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's Degree at the same time, they cannot be in two levels at once. Dual Degree Designation A student may pursue two graduate degrees at USF through a formal, approved Dual Degree Designation. The goal is for a student to attain two graduate degrees. (Students pursuing a combined bachelor's and graduate degree are considered to be in an Accelerated Program see catalog section for information on this separate process.) A Dual Degre e designation is required for a student pursuing two separate graduate degrees. Either through an established relationship between two degree programs (see 1 below) or through an individualized designation (see 2 below), between 0% and 15% of the total combined credit hours for the two degree programs may be shared, with Department (or equivalent), College, and Office of Graduate Studies approval. With the exception of shared coursework, all other separate degree requirements must be su ccessfully met (e.g. two dissertations, one thesis/one dissertation, projects, exams, etc.), unless approved by Graduate Council. (Note: where a single degree is preferred, refer to the Interdisciplinary Degree Program information below). Example: A student is enrolled in two master's degree programs requiring theses and 30 credits minimum each. With approval, the student may share 9 hours (equal to or less than 15%) across the combined 60 total minimum credit hours required. The student would also complete two separate theses. Once the degree requirements are successfully completed, the degrees may be conferred concurrently or sequentially. However, both degrees must be conferred within the timelimit for the first degree to which the student is admit t ed. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 46 Application for Dual Degree Designation Procedures for applying for Dual Degree Designation are available on the Office of Graduate Studies website. Advising and approval of a Dual Degree Designation Dual Degree Designation may be developed in the following ways: 1) an established relationship between two degree programs formulated through the Department(s) and then formalized through the College(s), Office of Graduate Studies, and Graduate Council. A current list of formalized programs with Dual Degree designation may be found in the Graduate Catalog. 2) formulated by an individual student who is intere sted in pursuing two degree programs that are not currently a formalized relationship with Dual Degree Designation. Students must request from both programs of interest approval to pursue Dual Degree Designation with those programs. For procedures and the necessary forms, refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website. Note: when a Program has this occur more than three times, the Program should follow the process to for malize that Dual Degree Designation. Interdisciplinary Degree Programs A student may pursue a single graduate degree that spans several academic areas. An Interdisciplinary Degree Program - is defined as a student pursuing a single standalone graduate degree, which is offered across two or more graduate degree programs. (Note: where two separate degrees are preferred, refer to the Dual Degree Program information above). Application to an Interdisciplinary Degree Program Students interested in applying for admission to an Interdisciplinary Degree Program follow the established University, College, and Program admission requirements - refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website for specific information for that particular program. Development of an Interdisciplinary Degree Program Interdisciplinary Degree Programs are formalized through the College, Office of Graduate Studies, and Graduate Council and must follow the University requirements for new degree program development, including notation on the Workplan. Procedures for developing an Interdisciplinary Degree Program are available on the Office of Graduate Studies website. For information contact the Office of Graduate Studies. OffCampus Courses and Programs Graduate courses and programs are offered at locations other than the Tampa, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, and Lakeland campuses. Information on course enrollment procedures for offcampus courses and programs may be obtained from the College in which the courses or programs are offered. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 47 Section 8 University Degree Requirements Degree Requirements The following sections describe the University requirements established by the Office of Graduate Studies for the Master's, Education Specialist, and Doctoral degrees. However, individual programs and colleges may establish additional or more stringent requirements. Student Responsibilities The University of South Florida and all colleges, departments and programs therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Faculty and graduate program directors are available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these requirements, but the stude nt is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if all requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed th roughout their college careers. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the USF Board of Trustees. Graduate Faculty Definition The University of South Florida recognizes Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty. Graduate Faculty is defined to consist of all tenuretrack or tenured faculty appointed at the Assistant, Associate, or Professor rank, who hold a terminal degree or equivalent in their discipline. Graduate Faculty members are eligible to teach graduate courses and may direct and serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees. To chair a doctoral level committee, a Graduate Faculty member must engage in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities, such as publications, performances, exhibitions, patents, inventions and research grants. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership may be grante d by the Office of Graduate Studies Dean to individuals whose skills or expertise meet criteria established by the College. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership is in effect for a specified period of time and specific purposes. Affiliate members may be eligible to teach graduate courses, to serve on master's, specialist, and doctoral level committees, USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 48 to direct master's and specialist's level committees, and to codirect doctoral level committees, at the discretion of the College. Emeritus Professors and retired or recently resigned professors may also be appointed as Affiliate Graduate Faculty with the approval of the College and Office of Graduate Studies Dean. Graduate Faculty Approval - Graduate faculty is defin ed as noted above; Colleges and Departments may have additional requirements. The Office of Graduate Studies will maintain a list of Graduate Faculty along with approval guidelines from the Colleges and Departments. For a current list of Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty in any program contact the program director or coordinator. Als o see Section 3 Faculty and Research Interests. Master's Degree Requirements Minimum Hours A minimum of thirty (30) hours is required for a master's degree, at least sixteen (16) hours of which must be at the 6000 level. At least twenty (20) hours must be in formal, regularly scheduled course work, ten (10) of which must be at the 6000 level. Up to six (6) hours of 4000le vel courses may be taken as part of a planned degree program. Additional graduate credit may be earned in 4000 level courses only if specifically approved by the appropriate College Dean. Lower level undergraduate course may not be used to satisfy master's course requirements but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. Stude nts enrolled in un dergraduate courses as part of a planned degree program are expected to demonstrate a superior level of performance in these courses. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the overall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degree. Graduat e students may not enroll for more than 18 hours in any semester without written permission from the College Dean. Institutional Enrollment Requirement The majority of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the home institution (e.g., USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF SarasotaMan atee) granting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the degree refer to the degree requirements in the program listing. Students are responsible for consulting with their degree program coordinator for information on courses that may be taken outside their gradu ate degree program, as well as the Transfer of Credit Policy for course tran sfer eligibility requirements. Although equivalent courses may be offered at other institutions (including within the USF System), they may not satisfy degree requirements. Time Limitations Master's and Ed.S. degrees must be completed within five (5) years from the student's date of admission for gradu a te study. Courses taken prior to admission to the USF graduate program, for example as nondegree seeking or from other institutions that were transferred in, can be no older than seven years at the time of graduation. Master and Ed.S. degrees (including dual degree program s ) that require course work in excess of 50 credit hours may be granted a longer statute of limitations by the University Graduate Council. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 49 Time Limit Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.edu/student forms.p hp Requests must include the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate program, and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree prior to submission to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. (Edito r's note - for th e time limit extension procedures, if the time limit extension will cause courses taken or transferred into the program to be older than 7 years, then a request for course concurrency may be required or the courses may be invalidated toward the degree requirem ents, per the time limit policy) If approved, the time limit extension also applies to courses applied toward the degree. However, programs may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition of the time limit extension. Students who exceed the time limitations may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approve d . Only one time limit extension request is permitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave (see the section on Leave of Abse nce in the Enrollment Requirements section.). Enrollme n t Requirements Refer to the Academic Policies Section Major Professor The Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the department to confirm the internal process and timeline for the selection and appointment of the Major Professor. The studen t must identify a major professor and receive that person' s agreement to serve as majo r professor. The selection of the Major Professor must be approved and appointed by the department as soon as possible, but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. Students must have a major professor in order to maintain Satisfactor y Ac ademic Progress. If a major professor cannot be identified or in the event a major professor is unable or unwilling to continue serving on the student's committee, the student is responsible for finding another major professor. Students who are unable to find a replacement majo r professor should confer with the Program Director for available options (including converting to a nonthesis program if available.) If no other options exist the student may be requested to voluntarily withdraw from the program or may be honorably withdrawn in good academi c standing. The student and major professor should plan a progr a m of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and professor, must be maintained in the student's department file. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Be graduate faculty, as defined by the University, from the student's academic area. Faculty who do not meet this definition may serv e as CoMajor Professor. Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities and have met departmental (or equivalent) requirements. Have been approved by the Department Chair (or equiva lent) to serve as a Major Professor or CoMajor Professor. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 50 The membership of graduate faculty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e., for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing and able to continue serving on the stude nt's committee, the Major Professor then beco mes a CoMajor Professor on the committee and another faculty is appointed as the other CoMajor Professor. To ensure that the student can make satisfactory progress, one of the CoMajor Professors must be accessible. In the event a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.); the Major Professor shall coordinate with the Program Director to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances a stude nt may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"CoMajor Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, change of committee form, etc.) Appointment of a (Co)Majo r Professor(s) may be rescinded by the Department Chai r (or equivalent), with the approval of the appropriate Department (or equivalent) faculty committee (separate from student advisory committee.) (Co) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Committee Responsibilities Available on the Office of Graduate Studies Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/policies.php Thesis Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for content and format. Composition The committee will consist of either: 1) the major professor and at least two ot her members; or 2) two comajor professors and at least one other member Committee members should be from the general research area in which the degree is sought. (Colleges and Programs may require additional committee members and speci fy characteristics.) Member Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the University and the College/Department, and approved by their department and college, are assumed by the Office of Graduate Studies as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a committee. Persons desiring to serve on a Graduat e committee who are not defined as Graduate Facu lty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the University and the College/Department must submit a curriculum vitae (CV) and be approved by the Department, College, and, as needed, the Office of Graduate Studies, for each committee. Committee members must meet the following requirements: Be graduate or affiliate grad uate faculty, as defined by the University Have the background and expertise that contributes to the success of the student. In addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Faculty definition, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed withi n the appropriate progra m or departme nt and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 51 Approval Once a committee has been determined, a Supervisory Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signatures. Check with the College for instructions and forms. The original appointment form and two (2) copies should be submitted to the College Associate Dean's office for approval. A copy of the approve d for m should be kept in the student's file. An approved and current Committee Form must be on file in the program/college before graduation may be certified. Committee forms need to be processed as early in the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. (Colle ges and depa rtments may institute additional requirements for membership on Supervisory Committees.) Changes to Committee Changes to a Supervisory Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form. Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are acce ptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s) indicate (s) approval of the change, as well as acknowledgem ent and approval of the change by the removed member. Any nonfaculty being added to a committee must submit a Curriculum Vitae (CV) for college approval. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes plac e. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. Masters Comprehensive Examination Prior to clearance for the degree, candidates must perform satisfactorily on a comprehensive examination or an alternative method designated by the academic unit to measure student competency in the major area. Students must be enrolled for a minim um of two (2) hours of graduate credit during the semester when the comprehensive examination is taken. If the exam is taken between semesters, the student must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Thesis If a thesis is required, it must conform to the guidelines of the University. Refer to the Thesis and Dissertation Guidelines, available on the web at http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php for complete information about requirements, procedures, and deadlines. For enrollment requirements, refer to the Academic Policies section in the Catalog. Format The Thesis must conform to one of two formats: Option 1 - a traditional format 3 inclusive of: Part I: Preliminary Pages Title Page Dedication (optional page) Acknowledgments (optional page) Table of Contents List of Tables (if applicable) List of Figures (if applicable) Abstract 3 Deviations from the available format are acceptable if approved in advance by the Supervisory Committee and Office of Graduate Studies.

Directed Research Directed Research hours may satisfy up to 50% of the thesis hour requirement . Manuscript Processing Fee USF Regulation USF40107, http://generalcounsel.usf.ed u/regulations/pdfs/regulation usf4.0107.pdf Students participating in the thesis/dissertation process are required to pay a processing fee. More information is available on the Thesis and Dissertation website. Exchange of Thesis for Non Thesis Credit If a student changes from thesis to nonthesis during a semester and is currently enrolled in thesis credit, the current thesis credits may be excha nged without acad emic pe nalty if a Office of Graduate Studies Petition is filed with the Office of Graduate Studies no later than the last day to withdraw without Academic Penalty. If a student enrolled in a thesis required program has taken thesis credits but elects to change to nonthesis track or program, the accumulated thesis credit s may not be exchanged or converted to another nonstructured credit. The thesis hours will remain on the transcript and will retain the \"Z\" grade. Thesis Defense Policies and procedures for the thesis defense are handled within the College and Program. Cont act the College and Program for requirements. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 53 Thesis Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available online at the Thesis and Dissertation website http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php . Students who fail to submit the final copy of a thesis by the posted submission deadline will be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for graduation by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) thesis hours for that subsequent semester, and meet the submission requirements as posted on the Thesis/Dissertation website. Only after the Office of Graduate Studies has approved the manuscript can th e student be certified for the degree. Mandatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the thesis in an electronic format (ETD). Requirements and procedures are available at the Office of Graduate Studies website http:// www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php Submission for Official Publication and Archiving All theses/dissertations will be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies designated System for official publication and archiving. Changes after Publication Once a thesis is approved and accepted by the Office of Graduate Studies for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Thesis Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be co nsidered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored resea r ch to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor, the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby preser ving patent rights...\"4 To protect the University's primary goal from undue compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Theses will be releas ed for worldwide access once submitted to and approv ed by th e USF Office of Graduate Studies. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay the release of the Thesis, a petition to request a one year delay may be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for consideration. Such requests mu st be received by the format check of the thesis. 3. Students should not be delayed in the final defense of their theses by agreements involving publication delays. 4 April Burke, \"University Policies on Conflict of Interest and Delay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on University Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, February, 1985.

Thesis Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Office of Graduate Studies submits the chan ge of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of thesis courses to the office of the re gistrar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. Education Specialist Degree (Ed.S.) Requirements Ed.S. Thesis Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. Thesis must meet all of the requirements for the thesis, as specified in the Master's Degree section of this publication. For specific degree program information, refer to the College of Education. Ed.S. Project Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. NonThesis project must meet all of the requirements as specified by the College of Educ ation. A project does not need to meet the requirements of a thesis and is not submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval and archiving. Doctoral Degree Requirements The doctoral degree is granted in recognition of high attainment in a specific field of knowledge. It is a research degree and is not conferred solely upon the earning of credit, the completion of courses, or the acquiring of a number of terms of residency, but also the successful completion of scholarly work. The length of residency and the requireme nts below are minimums; programs/colleges may elect to establish more rigorous requirements. The degree will be grante d after the student has shown proficiency and distinctive achievement in a specified field, has demonstrated the ability to do original, independent investigation, and has presented these findings with a high degree of literary skill in a dissertation. A major professor will be appoin ted as soon as possible but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. The advisor will advise on any specific subject matter deficiencies and assist in the choice of a major professor and area of research. Resp on sible Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF has information about RCR available online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php Effective Spring 2013, Office of Graduate Studies requires all new doctoral students to have basic RCR training by completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) module most relevant to the student's program of study. The CITI modules have been designed to introduce researchers to various elements of research conduct ranging from research misconduct to data management to mentoring. As this is a minimum requirement, specific doctoral programs may require training that goes beyond the basic components introduced in this module. Graduate Programs that have received Office of Graduate Studies approval for rigorous RCR training consistent USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 55 with disciplinary standards and practices may exempt their students from the CITI requirement. Students must complete the module, or provide evidence of previous qualified RCR training to their Program Director and Office of Graduate Studies, in the first semester enrolled in a doctoral program. Previous RCR training should have been completed within the past year. Students will be unable to register for courses in a future semester until successful fulfillment of this RCR requirement. Once the training is completed, the Registration hold will be lifted. Doctoral Minimum Hours The doctoral degree is earned on the basis of advancement to doctoral candidacy status and satisfactory completion of the dissertation. The minimum number of credit hours to earn the docto r ate is 72, postbachelors, including dissertation. The minimum number of credit hours required for each individual programs is noted in the degree requirements section of the Graduate Catalog for that program listing. Some graduate programs may require more th an 72 hours. Programs with formally approved concentrations must have core major requirements that all students must successfully complete. The typical minimum number of credit hours postmaster's is 42, allowing for a 30 hour master's degree program. Some programs may have variations in the postmaster's hours requirement, which is accept able provided that the total minimum credit hours postbachelors is 72 hours or greater. Students must comply with general enrollment requirements and also institutional residency requirements. All doctoral students must have at least one gradable (AF) graduate course taken at USF to satisfy the GPA minimum requirements. Up to six (6) hours of 4000level courses may be take n as part of a planned degree program. Additional graduate credit may be earned in 4000 level courses only if specifically approved by the appropriate College Dean. Lower level undergraduate course may not be used to satisfy doctoral course requirements but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. Students enrolled in undergraduate courses as part of a planned graduate degree program are expected to demonstrate a superior level of performance in these courses. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the overall GPA, whether or not they count towar d the minimum hours for the degree. No undergraduate course may be used to satisfy the gradable minimal course requirement for the doctoral degree. Time Limitations Doctoral degrees must be completed within seven (7) years from the student's original date of admission for doctoral study. All courses applied to the doctoral degre e must be completed within seven (7) ye ars, including courses taken 1) prior to admission to the USF doctoral program, 2) taken as nondegree seeking, or 3) transferred in from other institutions. There is no time limitation for courses from a completed master's degree used toward a doct oral degree. For students who are readmitted, see Readmission Policy. Typically a student will reach candidacy within four years, but this may vary per discipline. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 56 Time Limit Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.edu/s tudentfo rms.php . Requests must include the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate program, and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree Prior to submission to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. If approved, the time limit extension also applies to cour ses applied toward the degree. However, programs may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition of the time limit extension. Students who exceed the time limitations may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been appro v ed. Only one time limit extension request is permitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave (see Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section for information; the Lea ve of Absence Request Form is available online at: http://www.grad.usf.edu/student forms.php ). Enrollment Requirements See Academic Policies Section Institutional Enrollment Requirement The majority of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the home institution (e.g., USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF Sarasota Manatee) granting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the degree refer to the degree requirements in the program listing. Stude nts are responsible for consulting with their degree program coordinator for information on courses that may be taken outside their gradu a te degree program, as well as the Transfer of Credit Policy for course transfer eligibility requirements. Although equivalent courses may be offered at other institutions (including within the USF System), they may not satisfy degree requireme nts. Major Professor The Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the department to confirm the internal process and timeline for the selection and appointment of the Major Professor. The student must identify a major professor and receive that person' s agreement to serve as major professor. The selection of the Maj or Professor must be approved and appointed by the department as soon as possible, but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. Students must have a major professor in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a Major Professor cannot be identi fied or in the event a Major Professor is unable or unwilling to continue serving on the student's committee, the student is responsible for finding another Major Professor. Students who are unable to find a replacement Major Professor should confer with the Program Director for available options. If no other options exist the studen t may be requeste d to voluntarily withdraw from the program or may be honorably withdrawn in good academic standing. The student and Major Professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and profess or, should be maintained in the student's department file. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 57 Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Be active in scholarly pursuits as evidenced by at least one refereed publication in the last three years. Be graduate faculty, as defined by the University, from the student's academic area. Faculty who do not meet this definition may serve as CoMajor Professor Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activi ties and have met departmental (or equivalent) requirements Have been approved by the Department Chair (or equivalent) to serve as a Major Professor or CoMajor Professor The membership of graduate faculty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and a pproved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e. for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing and able to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then beco mes a CoMajor Professor on the committee and another faculty is appointed as the other CoMajor Professor. To ensure that the student can make satisfactory progress, one of the CoMajor Professors must be accessible. In the event a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.); the Major Profess or shall coordinate with the Program Director to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"CoMajor Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently both faculty mu st sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, change of committee form, admission to candidacy, etc.). Appointment of a (Co)Major Professor(s) may be resci nded by the Department Chair (or equivale nt), with the approval of th e appropriate Department (or equivalent) faculty committee (separate from student advisory committee.) (Co) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Committee Responsibilities Available on the Office of Graduate Studies Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/policies.php Doctoral Committees Some Colleges have a Program Committee comprised of graduate faculty, who advise the student from admission up to doctoral candidacy, when the formal Doctoral Dissertation Committee is formed. As soon as an area of research is determined and a major professor is selected, a Doctoral Dissertation Committee will be appointed and approved for the student. The Department will request approval of the Doctoral Commi ttee from the Dean of the College and, as needed, the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. Role of Doctoral Committees Depending on the College, either the Program Committee or the Doctoral Dissertation Committee is responsible for approvin g the student's course of study grading the written comprehensive qualifying examinatio n USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 58 Doctoral Dissertation Committee Doctoral Dissertation Committees will, approve the plan for research supervise the research read and approve the dissertation, and conduct the dissertation defense. Composition The Doctoral Dissertation Committee will consist of at least four members three must come from the academic area (i.e., discipline) of the student at least one external member (from outside the Department, School, or e quivalent, hosting the doctoral program, but may be within the academic discipline) Faculty holding joint or adjunct appointments in the degreegranting academic unit (i.e. Department or equivalent) cannot be external members on a student's committee. Member Definition All graduate fac ulty, as defined by the University and the College/Department, and approved by their department and college, are assumed by the Office of Graduate Studies as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a doctoral committee. Persons desiring to serve on a committee who are not define d as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the Univers ity and the College/Department must submit a curriculum vitae and be approved by the Department, College, and Office of Graduate Studies, for each committee. Committee members must meet the following requirements: Be graduate or affiliate graduate faculty, as defined by the University Have the background and expertise tha t contributes to the success of the student. In addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Faculty definition, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Gradua te Stud ies. Approval Once a committee has been determined, a Doctoral Dissertation Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signature. Check with the College for instructions and forms. To insure unifor mity of excellence across the colleges, the (Co)Maj or Professor(s) of Doctoral Dissertation Committees will need to submit a current curriculum vitae (equivalent to an NIH Bio, approximately two pages long with the last three (3) years of scholarly activity included) with the committee appointment form to the College Dean or designee. This approval is in addition to the approval from their departm e nt chairperson. (Colleges and departments may institute additional requirements for membership on Doctoral Dissertation Committees.) Once approved, the original form and the approved Curriculum Vitae (CV) are placed in the student's file. An approved and current Form must be on file in the program/college before grad uation may be certified. Doctoral Dissertation Committee Forms need to be processed as early in the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 59 Changes to Committee Changes to a Doctoral Dissertation Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form . Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are accept able. Fac u lty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s) indicate(s) approval of the change, as well as acknowledgement and approval of the change by the removed member. Any nonfaculty being added to a committee must submit a CV for approval. If a faculty member is being added as a CoMajor Professor, or if there is an appointment change to the Major Professor position, a CV must be included for the faculty member who is being adde d to that position. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes place. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. An approved and current Doctoral Dissertation Committee Form must be on file before graduation may be certified. Doctoral Qualif ying E xamination As soon as the substantial majority of the course work is completed, the student must pass a written qualifying examination covering the subject matter in the major and related fields. This examination may be supplemented by an oral examination. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate cr edit in their discipline at the time they take the qualifying examination. If the exam is taken between semesters, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Admission to Candidacy In order to be admitted to doct oral candidacy, students must meet the following requirements at USF: 1. admission to a doctoral program 2. appointment of a Doctoral Committee , 3. attainment of an overall and degree program Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.00 at USF at the time of candidac y. All \"I\" and \"M \" grades, including \"IF\" and \"MF\", must be cleared before candidacy may be finalized. 4. successful completion of a qualifying examination 5. certification by the Doctoral Committee that the above qualifications have been successfully completed. The Admission to Candidacy form should be submitted for approval durin g the semester that the qualifying exams were completed, bu t no later than the semester following the successful completion of the exam. The form will be approved by the Dean of the College and forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies for final approval. Doctoral Candidacy is effective as of the day that the Office of Gradua te Studies approves of the request and changes the student's status to 6C. For procedures and processing deadlines refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website at www.grad.usf.edu . Once candidacy status is approved, students with approved candidacy are eligible to enroll in dissertation hours (7980) in the semester that immediately follows the last business day of the approval window. For example, students approved during the Fall approval window may enroll in the Spring. Students approved during the Spring approval window may enroll in the summer and students approve d during the Summer approval window may enroll in the Fall. Students may NOT enroll in dissertation hours prior to being admitted to doctoral candidacy . Each degree program has a required number of dissertation hours for completion of the degree. Departments may, with College approval, apply Direct ed Resear ch hours toward the total number of dissertation hours required. Directed Research hours shall not exceed 50% of the dissertation hour requirement. No directed research hours will be converted to dissertation hours (i.e. a directed research course dropped and a dissertation course added) prior to or during the approval window. Fo r more information refer to Enrollment Requirements in the Academic Policies section.

More information is available on the website athttp://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php Doctoral Dissertation Defense After the Doctoral Dissertation Committee has determined that the final draft of the dissertation is suitable for presentation; the Committee will request the scheduling and announcement of the Dissertation Defense (also called Final Oral Examination or Oral Defense). Check with the College and Program for college and program specific procedures for this process. A copy of the anno uncement should be sent to the Office of Graduate Studies, preferably two weeks in advance of the defense date. The announcement must also be posted in a public forum for a minimum of twentyfour hours to comply with statute requirements for a public meeting. A student must successfully def end the dissertation in order to be able to proceed and complete the final submission process. Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair The Doctoral Dissertation Defense (Final Oral Examination) shall be presided over by an external committee member from outside the Department, School, or equivalent, hosting the doctoral program, but may be within the academic discipline, OR, a noncommittee member (a.k.a. Outside Chair) (Refer to the individual Program's Degree Requ irements in the Graduate Catalog for information). If the Chair is from another institution, this individual must be approved for Affiliate Graduate Faculty status. The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair's role includes overseeing the proceedings as well as serving as the student's advocate, by ensuring fairness of the process. Faculty holding joint, courte sy, or adjunct appointments in the degree granting academic unit (i.e. Department or equivalent) cannot serve as the Defense Chair. Procedures for Conducting the Doctoral Dissertation Defense (Final Oral Examination) 1. The Doctoral Dissertation defense (final oral examination) should be conducted within a timeline to allow for the student to make any necessary corrections follow ing the defense and still meet the final copy deadline for turning in the Dissertation to the Office of Graduate Studies. 2. The presentation should be considered an important function in the Department and all graduate students and faculty be encouraged to attend. 3. The presentation and defense are open to the public and as such, must meet the requirements of the Sunshine Laws for the State of Florida. The Doctoral Dissertation Committee deliberation is not public. 4. The room selected for the examination should have adequate seating with an alternate room selected in case of problems. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 62 5. It is required that all members of the Doctoral Dissertation Committee be present for the examination unless an absence is approved prior to the defense taking place by the Office of Graduate Studies Dean. In the event that a member cannot attend in person, participation is permissible via speakerphone or video conference. A minimum of three members, including the Major Professor is required to proc eed with the defense. If a noncommittee member (Outside Chair) chairs the Defense, this individual does not count as one of the three required members in attendance. If an unforeseeable situation arises that would prevent compliance with this requirement the Major Professor or Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair should contact the Office of Graduate Studies for guidance and approval to proceed with the defense. 6. The length of the examination period will generally not exceed three hours. Throughout this time the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair is to be in charge of all proceedings and, ideally, is expec ted to play a balancing role between advocacy and contention. 7. The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair, at any time during the course of the examination, may request all visitors to leave. 8. Presentation The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair should open the proceedings by introducing the candidate and the Doctoral Dissertation Committee. The examination should begin with a presentation by the candidate design ed to summarize the dissertation. 9. Questions Following the presentation the Defense may be moved to a different setting for the main examination. The College determines the order of the proceedings described bel ow: The examination will consist of questions about the research by the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair and the Doctoral Dissertation Committee. It is suggested that questioning should be limited to about 15 minutes for each Doctoral Dissertation Committee member with subsequent rounds of questioning as necessary. Questions from the facultyatlarge and/or the public may be allowed following the presentation. It is suggested that questioning from the general audience be limited up to 5 minutes per person. 10. Deliberations and Voting Following the completion of these proceedings, the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair will ask all visitors and the candidate to leave and will reconvene the Doctoral Dissertation Committee only. will preside over the delibe rations and voting of the Committee. (Note: If a non committee member [Outside Chair] is used, he/she will not participate in the voting) . is responsible for tallying the votes and informing the candidate of the final decision. The voting is to be limite d to \"pass\" and \"fail\" votes. The vote of the Doctoral Dissertation Committee must be unanimous. If unanimous agreement cannot be reached, the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair notifies the Department Chair (or appropriate equivalent) who will endeavor to resolve the dispute in an expedient fashion. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 63 records the vote on the Successful Defense Form and conveys the decision of the Doctoral Dissertation Committee (Successful Defense form) to the Department/College Graduate office to be kept in the student's file. Dissertation Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available online at the Thesis and Dissertation website at http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php. Students who fail to submit the final copy of a dissertation by the posted submission deadline will not be considered for graduation. The studen t may be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for the degree (graduation ) by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) dissertation hours for that subsequent semester, and meet the submission requirements as posted on the Thesis/Dissertation website. Only after the Office of Graduate Studies has approved the manus crip t can the student be certified for the degree. Mandatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the dissertation in an electronic format (ETD). Requirements and procedures are available at the Office of Graduate Studies website at http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD res main.php Submission for Official Publication and Archiving All theses/dissertations will be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies designated System for official publication and archiving. Changes after Publication Once a dissertation is approved and accepted by the Office of Graduate Studies for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Dissertation Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on resear ch proje cts but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the publi c and the broader academic community. The University's \"Sta tement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inve ntor, the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby preserving patent rights...\"8 To protect the University's primary goal from undue compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Dissertations will be released for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by the USF Office of Graduate Studies. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay the release of the Dissertation, a petition to request a one year delay may be 8 April Burke, \"University Policies on Conflict of Interest and Delay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on University Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, February, 1985.

Such requests must be received by the format check of the dissertation. 3. Students should not be delayed in the final defense of their dissertations by agreements involving publication delays. Duty to Disclose New Inventions and Works USF 0300 . For information about the requirements of this policy contact the Division of Patents and Licensing at (813) 9740994. Dissertation Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Office of Graduate Studies submits the chan ge of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of diss ertation courses to the office of the registrar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. The Use of \"Ph.D.\" in Credentials and Publication Students may only use the credential of \"Ph.D.\" after degree conferral is granted. It is inappropriat e to use the credential until it is officially and formally granted . The use of the abbreviation \"Ph.D.\" in university publications, correspondence, etc., including websites and other electronic media, shall be upper case \"P\", lower case \"h\" followed by a period, an upper case \"D\" and another period. It shall not be used in the format of all upper case letters without periods, as in \"PHD\". USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 9 Graduation Information 65 Section 9 Graduation Information and PostDoctoral Affairs Application for Degree (Graduation) To graduate, a student must submit the Application for Degree through their College.

For more information, please see www.grad.usf.edu/postdoc USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 10 Degrees, Programs, and Concentrations 68 Section 10 Degrees, Programs, and Concentrations New graduate degrees, programs and concentrations are continually under development and may now be approved and available. Check the website for recently approved programs and for information on which programs are currently accepting applications and which are currently closed for admission. For the most current list of authorized degrees, programs and concentrations, Accelerated Degree Programs, and Dual Degree Programs, go to http:// www.grad.usf .edu/programs.php . As of the date of this publication, the University is authorized to offer 50 different degrees with graduate programs (majors) offered as follows: 120 Master's programs (including the MPAS) 220 Concentrations at the Master's level 2 Education Specialist programs 15 Concentrations at the Specialist level 47 Doctoral programs (Ph.D., Ed.D., Au.D., D.N.P., D.P.H., D.B.A.) 108 Concentrations at the Doctoral level 3 Professional doctoral programs (including M.D., D.P.T., PharmD) How to understand Degrees, versus Programs, versus Concentrations. The University offers a number of degrees (e.g. M.A., M.S.E.S., Ph.D., etc.) under which various programs (a.k.a. majors) are offered - for example Accounting . Concentrations are formalized areas of study available within the program and may be noted on the transcript and diplom a- for example Tax/Audit . Definitions are noted on th e following page. Some programs are offered as the area of study presented. Other programs are offered through a variety of concentrations within the Program. The Degree is awarded in the Program, e.g. M.S. in Nursing. For example: Adult Education (Curriculum and Instruction) M.Ed. Education Would translate to: M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction with a Concentration in Adult Education M.Ed. = the name of the degree \"Master of Education\" Curriculum and Instruction = the name of the program of study the degree is awarded in Adult Education = the name of the concentration within the program To learn more about the Program or Concentration, refer to the corresponding college section of the Catalog. Note: Programs may also offe r plans, tracks, or areas of study which are informal groupings within a program or concentration. Questions about degrees and concentrations may be directed to the Office of Graduate Studies. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 10 Degrees, Programs, and Concentrations 69 Definitions Degrees (http://files.acad.usf.edu/edout/New Degree/USF Procedures onNewAcademic Program.pdf ) A degree program is defined as an organized curriculum leading to a college degree in an area of study recognized as an academic discipline by the higher education community, as demonstrated by assignment of a Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code by the National Center for Educational Statistics, or as demonstrated by similar programs existing at other colleges and universities, and having designated facult y and instructional resources. Eac h degree program will be assigned a CIP code and included in the State University System Academic Degree Program Inventory. Example: Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Graduate Program (Major) (ref: BOG Regulation 6C8.011 ) An organized curriculum offered as a major area of study that is part of an existing or proposed degree program and does not constitute sufficient distinct coursework, faculty, and instructional resources to be considered a separate degree program. A Program Major must be reasonably associated with the degree program under which it is offered and share comm on core or prerequisite course s with other majors within the same degree program. A Program Major will not be assigned a CIP Code, will not be included in the State University System Academic Degree Program Inventory, and will not be recognized as a standalone degree program at the University. The number of credit hours for a Program Majo r will be established by the University for each degree level. Example: Curriculum and Instruction Concentration (approved by Graduate Council 3/15/10) A Concentration is a coordinated set of courses in conjunction with examinations, thesis and/or dissertation, sub curriculum that is applicable to one or more existing gradua te programs. The total number of credit hours must not equal or exceed the number of credit hours established for the Degree Program(s). Concentrations must be approved by the Department (or equivalent), College, and Graduate Council. Concentrations are listed on a student's transcript, but not on the diploma.

List accurate as of 8/21/14 USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 10 Degrees, Programs, and Concentrations 83 Accelerated Degree Programs Accelerated Programs allow academically qualified students to complete an undergraduate Bachelor's degree and a graduate degree (typically master's degree) on an accelerated timeline, graduating sooner than in traditional programs. Typically students will complete a portion of the required graduate coursework while classified as an undergraduate student and have it count towards both degrees. As soon as the student completes the under graduate degree requirements, the student is converted to graduate status, where the remaining graduate requirements are fulfilled. Students must submit an Accelerated Program Application for acceptance into an Accelerated Program track. Once a student is ready to move into graduate student status, the Progression Form must be completed and submitted. More information and the Application and Progression Forms are available online at: http://www.grad.usf.edu/accelerated.php For specific degree requirements, refer to the corresponding program section of the Graduate Catalog.

Students will be awarded certificates upon completion of specific course work, which has been approved by the Graduate Council. The graduate certificate is not defined as a degree by the Office of Graduate Studies; rather, it is a focused collection of courses that, when comp leted, affords the student some record of distinct academic accomplishment in a given discipline or set of related disciplines. Moreover, the graduate certificate is not viewed as a guaranteed means of entry into a graduate degree program. While the courses comprising a gradu ate certificate may be used as evidence in support of a student's appli c ation for admission to a degree program, the certificate itself is not considered to be a prerequisite. Process of Approval for New Graduate Certificates Proposals for new areas of study for graduate certificates are created and submitted by the academic unit that wishes to offer such a certificate. Proposals must be accompanied by endorsement from the department heads and deans of the colleges/schools in which the contributing course work is offered as well as from the academic unit or units whose students or degree programs could be impacted by the creation of the graduate certificate. The Graduate Council will consider all the proposals for new graduate certificates to assure proposal guidelines have been followed and that repetition and redundancy across areas of study for certificates are not evident. Those meeting the criteria set forth by Graduate Council will then be recommended to the Provost for approval. Criteria for Approval The ge neral principles applied to the assessment of the academic quality of proposals for new graduate areas of study for certificate include: 1. The proposed sequence of course work must offer a clear and appropriat e educational objective at the postbaccalaureate level. 2. The proposed curriculum will achieve its educational objective in an efficient and welldefined manner. 3. A perceived need for such a certificate should exist. This provision might be defined in terms of either external markets (i.e., exter nal demand for the skills associated with such a certificate) or internal academi c means (i.e., the need for a critical mass of students in a given discipline). 4. An appropriate number of credit hours must comprise the area of study for the certificate. The number of gradu ate credits cann ot be less than nine (9) or more than onehalf of the credits necessary for a related master's degree from the Office of Graduate Studies. 5. If the area of study for a certificate requires new courses, those courses must be approved by the appropriate College bodies or offices and the Graduate Council. USF Graduate Catalog 20142015 Section 11 Graduate Certificates 90 Student Eligibility and Admission Criteria Student must apply and be accepted into the graduate certificate area of study to be eligible to receive a certificate. The prerequisites and general criteria of eligibility for admission to any graduate certificate area of study include: 1. An earned baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from a regionally accredited college or university or enrollment in a USF fiveyear academic program is required. Stude nts in fiveyear academic programs may be admitted upon completion of 120 semester hours. 2. Each graduate area of study sets the requirements for admission, including minimum grade point average, standardized test scores, and other similar criteria as part of the applicati on. However, prospective nondegree seeking graduate certificate students mu st meet University graduate admissions grade point average requirements. Students who wish to pursue a graduate certificate must apply to the Graduate Certificate Office (www.gradcerts.usf.edu ) and be admitted to the certificate area. Students are encouraged to contact the coordinator prior to applying. NonDegree Seeking Students All nondegree seeking students who wish to pursue approved graduate certificates should apply for admission to the certificate through the Graduate Certificate Office (www.gradcerts.usf.edu ) as soon as possible for maximum benefit, but must apply to the certificate and complete required coursework within five years of taking the first course applicable to the certificate. Students must submit a Completion Form for the certificate to be awarded. Degree Seeking Students o All degree seeking students who wish to pursue approved gradua te cer tificates must apply for admission to the certificate through the Graduate Certificate Office (www.gradcerts.usf.edu ). The application must be received prior to conferral of the degree that includes the same coursework. Students who have completed all coursework must apply for admission to the certificate and submit a Completion Form prior to the deadline to apply for graduation by the fourth week of the semester in which the student plans to graduate. o Degree seeking students who are pursuing a Graduate Certificate in a discipline outside of their graduate degree program (major) must apply for admission to the certificate through the Graduate Certificate Office (www.gradcerts.usf.edu ).

The essences of education are a capacity for the appreciation of social change within a context of prior human achievement. The faculty of the Arts and Sciences strive to instill in their students a history of human ideas, a love of learning, and an understanding of the means that scholars have used in their search for beauty and order in the natural world. The education provided by the disciplines of the Arts and Sciences is the foundation upon which the lives and professions of our stude nts are built, and the basis from which personal growth occur s . The College of Arts and Sciences takes as its goal a melding of the natural, humanistic and social philosophies into a comprehensive whole that encourages the development of new ideas and new approaches to the understanding of our universe. It is the responsibility of scholars to share their discoveries for the better m ent of society. Thus, the Arts and Sciences embrace the disciplines that strive to make immediate use of knowledge in the service of social goals as well as the disciplines whose discoveries contribute to the fund of basic information that is the stepping stone of applied knowle dge.

Faculty at USF specialize in various areas, including medical anthropology, biological anthropology, urban policy and community development, education, archaeology, cultural resource management (CRM), economic development, immigration, media, and issues pertaining to race, gender, and ethnicity. Geographic specializations emphasize the Ca ribbean, Latin America, SubSaharan Africa, Europe, and the United States. More than 240 graduates have received an education in anthropology and its practical uses, leading to employment in government and private sector agencies and organizations. For many, the MA is a terminal degree that qualifies them for professional careers in administration, program evaluation, planning, research, and cultural resource management. Others have gone on to earn doctoral degrees and have gained employment in academic or higher level nonacademic positions. Students entering the Master's program in Applied Anthropology at USF choose from one of four tracks: Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, or Medical Anth ropology. Although these four tracks share some common requirements, and are bound by general rules of the USF Office of Graduate Studies, they have different curricula and employment trajectories. Archaeology Track graduates typically enter careers in contract archaeology, or public and private agencies and mus eums responsible for managing archaeological resources. The Cultural Anthropology Track is designed to lead to employment in diverse areas that include education, urban planning, human services, private sector consulting and research, and nongovernmental community organizations. Museum and heritage programming represent an area of overlap between the two emphases. Students wh o wish to pursue these kinds of specialties will develop curricula that draw from both applied and public archaeology requirements in consultation with their advisors. Biological Anthropology students are trained to work in law enforcement, private sector consulting and research, and nongovernmental organizations. The Medical Anthropology track prepares students to conduct research, evaluati on, and consulting in a variety of settings, including community based organizations, county and state health departments, and nongovernmental organizations. In addition to following the curriculum of a track, M.A. students can select elective courses to fulfill one of four concentrations in Archaeological and Forensic Sciences, Bio cultural Me dical Anthropology, Cultural Resource Management, or Heritage Studies.

For the doctoral/master's combination, students develop individual programs of study in consultation with an inte rdisciplinary academic advisory committee. The committee must approve the plan of study as well as the proposal to fulfill the thesis and dissertation requirements or dissertation and special project requirements through a single project. The two programs review applicants independently. After admission to both programs, the Graduate Admissions office instructs the Registrar's Office to classify the student as dually enrolled in Anthropology and Public Health. In choosing which program to apply to first, students should take into consideration the following: requirements in Anthropology for admission are different than in Public Health; admission to one program does not guarantee admission to the other; and of cours e, the student's interests and career plans. Upon completion of all requirements for the dual degree program, the student submits separate applications for graduation to Anthropology and Public Health, and is certified for graduation by both programs and receives two diplomas. Dual degree students can also select electi ve courses to fulfill a concentration in Biocultural Medical Anthropology.

Each Department has its own Chair and Graduate Director and offers students a Master of Science in Biology with a specific concentration associated with either CMMB or IB. There is no general Biology MS degree program. The CMMB and IB Departments ar e located in modern, well equipped buildings. Research in the CMMB Department is done by faculty housed in Interdisciplinary Science Building and the BioScience Faculty building (BSF), and most of the research within the IB Department is conducted by faculty housed in the Science Center building (SCA). Because of the interdisciplinary aspect of most research projects, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad training research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Many of the faculty within CMMB and IB are involved in coope r ative research with their colleagues in Chemistry, Public Health, Nursing, Medicine, Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often CMMB and IB graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require handson experimental laboratori es, both CMMB and IB support many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. CMMB and IB values high quality teaching at all levels of instruction. Research Assistant positions also are available to support research with specific faculty members depending on an individual faculty members funding. Numerous scholarship opportunities are also offered on a competitive basis through the USF Office of Graduate Studies. Application to the Biology Progr am is through one of the two departments, with students selecting a formal Concentration. Refer to the Concentration listing in the Catalog for specific information and requirements.

Nonnative English speaking graduate students must score a minimum of at least 570 on the paper based test or a minimum total score of 79 on the internet based test on the TOEFL and at le ast 50 on the TSE to be eligible for a teaching assistantship. For acceptance into the IB Department, acceptance by a faculty member in IB is MANDATORY. IB encourages applicants to contact faculty via email to indicate an interest in the research being conducted in their laboratory. IB will make every effort to pair potential graduate stude nts with appropriate faculty; however, it is recommended that applicants make direct contact with individual faculty. It is expected that candidates for the M.S. degrees will have completed courses equivalent to those required for the B.S. in Biology at U.S.F. Applying to the Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biolog y Students interested in attending graduate studies within the CMMB Department should visit the CMMB website that can be accessed from the main USF site and review the current CMMB faculty. It is recommended that potential students consider at least 23 CMMB faculty that they would be interested in working with and communicate this information in their letter of application. It is also recommended that potential students contact the CMMB Graduate Director as well as the individual faculty members they are interested in working with via email. Such communication will facilit ate the assignment of the laboratory rotations that CMMB students will participate in during their first semester of residency and also allow the applicant to determine whether the desired faculty member has positions available in the laboratory. All students admitted to the Masters concentratio n in Cell Biology and Molecular Biology must establish a Graduate Supervisory Committee. The Graduate Committee shall constitute the major professor and at least two additional credentialed faculty. At least one of the committee members must be a faculty member at USF. Supervisory committee must be formed within two semesters after matriculation. Refe r to Committee information in the University Requirements Section of the Catalog for more information.

This will prepare students to enter the emerging new technological workforce required to implement biomedical advances that will have a key impact on global health and yield significant societal advantages. The Program is a joint endeavor between the Moffitt Cancer Center and the University of South Florida. Tremendous advances in the detection and treatment of cancer has occurred through basic research and translational medicine, yet cancer continues to adversely affect millions of people worldwide in terms of quality of life, life span, and economic burden. The Moffitt Cancer Center located at the University of South Florida is a leading institution of basic research, clinic al research, and patient treatment with a focu sed mission \"to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.\" The Moffitt Cancer Center is officially designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The Cancer Biology Ph.D. Program's goal is to train the next generation of cance r researchers. Studies of cancer require specific knowledge in multiple fields that have traditionally been independent. Our Cancer Biology Ph.D. program emulates the Moffitt Cancer Center and eliminates these boundaries. Students rece ive cancer oriented training in multiple areas include: molecular biology, immunology, functional genomics, bioinformatics, drug discovery & development, cancer genetics, cancer prevention & control, cancer therapeutics, cell biology, biochemistry, and proteomics.

USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Chemistry (M.A.) 129 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS General Program Requirements Graduate students must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (B) in all courses. Any graduate student who falls below a 3.00 GPA at the end of any given semester will be placed on academic probation and has the next two semesters (excluding summers) to remedy the situation before being dismissed from the program. No grade below \"C\" will be accepte d toward a graduate d egree, but will be used in the computation of the overall GPA. Enforcement of Minimum Standards The Graduate Council shall be responsible for ensuring that all graduate students meet the minimum standards as set down in the Graduate Student Handbook. The Graduate Coordinator will periodically review the standin g of each student with regard to grade point average (GPA), academic progress, and (in the case of teaching assistants) teaching performance and notify the Graduate Council as necessary. Should disciplinary action appear in order, the student's major professor will be consulted (in order to obtain as many relevant facts as po ssible) before such action is taken. Probation Students who fail to meet the minimum GPA (3.00 for all graduate courses) shall be placed on probation. The student's GPA must meet the minimum of 3.00 by the end of the semester in which probation was initiated or termination fr om the graduate program will result. Appeals In actions based on departmental requirements, petitions and appeals shall be directed to the Chemistry Graduate Council through the student's major professor. (In case of a student who has not yet selected a major professor, the appeal may be carried out through the Gradua te Coordinator or through some other chemistry faculty member selected by the student.) Unsuccessful appeals to the Chemistry Graduate Council may be further carried to the chemistry faculty as a whole, and from there to the Dean of the College and then to the University Graduate Council if necessary. Minimum Grade s in Courses Although all grades in graduate level courses will be used in computing the student's GPA, no grade below \"C\" may be counted toward fulfillment of the approved course of study. Consequently, any such course in which a student receives a grade below \"C\" must be repeated, or have the requirement waived by the Supervisory Committee. A student who receives three grades lower than a \"B\" in structured courses required by his supervisory committee to meet the structured course requirement will be dropped from the program. A student who receives a grade of \"U\" while a chem is try graduate student will be placed on automatic probation. A second \"U\" grade is grounds for termination from the Program, and the Chemistry Graduate Council will automatically review the student's status. Students on probation are not excluded from having teaching assistantships during the probationary semester. Seminars All chemistry graduate stud ents must satisfy the following minimum requirements for CHM 6935: enrollment every semester of the regular academic year during his/her career as a graduate student, or enrollment in seven (7) credit hours for the Ph.D.; four (4) credit hours for the Master's degree. A maximum of two unexcused abse nces will be permitted each semester, whichever is less. Under exceptional circumstances, students may petition for a waiver on a semester bysemester basis if employment or other obligations conflict with the requirement. Master's Degree General Requirements Students must meet all degree requirements as specified by the Office of Graduate Studies.

Domestic students follow rolling admission. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Students with only a Bachelor's degree must take 4 ACS entrance exam (with an option to take Biochemistry or Analytical and a requirement to take core exams in Organic, Inorganic, and Physical Chemistry). They must obtain at least the national median ACS score in the required core exams to pass. If they fail, they have the option to retake the exam or remediate the deficiency by obtaining at le ast B (not a B) in one of our upperdivision undergraduate courses (or by taking the exams in the appropriate course and obtaining the equivalent grade) in the area of the deficiency before their candidacy exam. Students with a Master's degree may be required to adhere to the policy at the discretion of the Graduate Cou ncil at the time of acceptance. Entering students will have a Promotion to Candidacy Committee established upon entering the Ph.D. Program. The Committee advises students as to what courses they need to take in their first semester. There are no set course requirements, but the decision of the Committee is binding. Student s wil l normally be expected to take the first semester of the first year covering \"Tools of Research,\" including literature search and analysis, proposal writing, oral presentation skills, and laboratory instrumental techniques. The sec ond semester of the course may be required by a student's promotion to Candidacy committee. Advanced courses in other subject areas may be assigned by the Committee, where appropriate. Final coursework decisions are made by the candidate's research advisor. Advisor Selection Students need to choose a prePh.D. candidate research adviser by the beginn ing of the second semester to begin precandidate research in that laboratory (See below). The student will then proceed to initiate a research project by the beginning of the second semester and through the first summer of study. Selection of a research advisor is one of the most important decisions a student will make during the graduate career. In order to avoid hasty or poorly founded decisions each student must discuss potential research projects with at least three members of the chemistry faculty. Appropriate forms can be obtained from the Chemistry Graduate Office and should be completed and returned no later than the end of the second semester (excluding summer semester) after entering the program. Qualifying Exam / Promotion to Candidacy At the conclusion of the first year (before the start of the third semester), a written research document outlining progress to date and future plans is submitted to and approved by the Promotion to candidacy Committee. This proposal is sub sequently defended in front of the committee. A successful defense results in Promotion to Ph.D. Candidacy, contingent upon the student being formally accepted into a research group. The committee must vote three quarters in favor of the candidate (for a four person committee) or two thirds in favor (for a three person committee) for a pass. A vote of two or four members (or one of three) in favor results in a conditional pass, and the committee must set conditions to be met to promote the student within 30 days of the first m eeting. At the discretion of the committee, the student not promoted to candidacy may be given a pass at a JM.A. level of competency and proceed to obtain a terminal research master's degree or be terminated from the program. Appropriate forms to document promotion to candidacy must be completed and forw arded to the Office of Graduate Studies. The forms may be obtained from the Chemistry Graduate Office. USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Chemistry (Ph.D.) 136 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Dissertation Committee Upon promotion the candidate must formally choose and declare a research adviser and a dissertation committee must be established initially with at least three members. An additional committee member from outside the department or university must be added before the final defense. The research advisor chairs the committee. Original Research Proposal An original research proposal mu st be written and defended by the end of the first semester of the third year. At the discretion of the research adviser, the student's original research proposal may or may not be related to the student's current or future research. The student must be informed of the research adviser's preference in advance of se eking approval for the thesis topic. The dissertation committee formally approves the proposal and its defense. The candidate should meet with the dissertation committee members (individually or as a group) to discuss the proposal topic. The original research proposal should follow the format of a major federal granting agency appropriate to the nature of the proposed research . The format of the proposal, in conjunction with the topic, should be approved in advance by the dissertation committee. The written proposal must be given to the dissertation committee members two weeks in advance of the scheduled defense. After the defens e, the committee must vote three quarters in favor of the candidate (for a four person committee) or two thirds in favor (for a three person committee) for a pass. A vote of two of four members (or one of three) in favor results in a conditional pass, and the committee must set conditions to be met to pass the candidate withi n 30 days of the first meeting. Students not passing will normally be terminated from the Ph.D. program. Research Data Presentation and Dissertation By the end of the fourth year, a research data presentation must be made to dissertation committee and the committee formally advises the candidate on research milestones that need to be met before permission to \"write up\" the dissertation is granted. Th e permission to \"write up\" the dissertation can be given at any subsequent time. A peer reviewed publication based upon the dissertation research is required to obtain the degree of Ph.D. Note: Extenuating circums t ances will be reviewed on a casesbycase basis. Further, students have to wait a minimum of 6 months after successful completion of the Research Data Presentation (aka Data Defense) (and the associated online data base forms) before they will be permitted to defend their dissertation. This rule can only be waived by the Department Chair with the wr itten approval of the majority of the Thesis Committee in the case of exceptional circumstances. Final Dissertation Defense Each student should consult with their supervisory committee for deadlines in submitting the dissertation prior to the defense. Thesis or dissertation defense are not normally sch eduled during final exam week or during the weeks between regularly scheduled sessions. The dissertation defense must be scheduled through the Chemistry Graduate Office at least two weeks in advance. The Chemistry Graduate Office will then announce the defense to the entire Chemistry Department. The candidate normally defend s their dissertation in the fourth or fifth year. NOTE: these deadlines are in addition to those imposed by the Office of Graduate Studies. The Office of Graduate Studies sets deadlines pertaining to thesis/dissertations each semester. Candidates may be offered a departmental TA position in year five given satisfactory progress in res earch as judged by the dissertation committee and approval of the Department Chair, TA's are not normally awarded beyond year 5. RA's are only permitted beyond year six in exceptional cases with the written approval of the department chair. It is important to note that the Office of Graduate Studies will not award tuition wai vers for credit hours beyond 120 for students entering with a baccalaureate degree and 90 for students entering with a master's degree. Supervisory Committees The M.S. and M.A. supervisory committee should consist of at least three members including the major professor, and two other chemistry faculty members, at least one of whom is outside the student's major area (analytica l, biochemistry, e tc.)According to University Regulations, the Ph.D. supervisory committee must consist of at least four (4) members, including the student's research director. At least two (2) of the members must be from an area related to the student's research.

In addition, the contents of the portfolio should represent diversity on a national level, with at least one paper focusing on literature of the Americas and the other on literature from Britai n (broadly construed) or its colonie s. o Papers should be developed under the direction of three different faculty members from the English Department, who then will form the committee for the defense. One member of the committee will serve as the chair, who will coordinate the circulation of the portfolio, the scheduling of the defense, and the sub mission of evaluation forms to the graduate director within specified deadlines. The portfolio will be reviewed and evaluated by this threemember faculty committee using the published assessment rubric. Members of the portfolio committee will be asked to work with the student to revise the papers she/ h e wrote for class. The goal is to get the papers into a form that might reasonably be published. Because this option is not a thesis, it does not have to be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies, and so it does not need to adhere to the Office of Graduate Studies deadlines . Defenses should be concluded two weeks before the end of classes. The whole portfolio, along with the revised papers and the introductory essay, should be circulated two weeks prior to the defense, to give committee members an opportunity to read it through. Each portfolio paper will be scored on a sc ale from 1 to 4 overall using the rubric at the end of the handbook. To pass, a portfolio requires a total score of 9 with no papers earning a 1. USF Graduate Catalog2014 2015 English (M.A.) 153 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Each portfolio paper will also be scored on a scale from 1 to 4 on content using the rubric at the end of the handbook. To pass, a portfolio requires a minimum score of 9 in content. Pass with Distinction: portfolios scoring between 11 and 12 will merit distinction; this will be noted in the student's file and can be referenced on a student's CV. Deficiency: portf olios scoring between 7 and 8 or with one paper earning a 1 will be deficient. Any paper scoring less than 3 will require revision. Individual faculty need to specify in writing what the essay requires for revision in order to pass. Students will have the opportunity to revise during the remaining time of the semester; revised paper(s) need to be submitted to all committee members for approval no later than the last da y of class for the semester. No second defense is required. Students who fail to revise appropriately before the end of the semester will be put on academic probation and will be required to finalize thei r papers the following semester (excluding summer unless faculty agree to serve during the summer). Failure: portfolios that score a 6 or less or portfolios that score less than 9 in overall content fail. Students who fail will automatica ll y be put on academic probation and given the opportunity to revise papers so that the portfolio reaches a minimum score of 9 the following semester (excluding summer unless faculty agree to serve during the summer). A failed portfolio requires a second defense after revision, and the committee will determine if it passes or fails (no deficiencies or distinctions may be awarded). If the portfolio fails after the second defense the student will be academically dismissed from the program. Graduate Assistants on probation in the initial term maintain eligibility for an assistantship. If probationary status is not removed, the student can be removed from assistantship and academically dismissed from the program. The committee will also evaluate the introductory essay using the appropriate rubric; this grade will be recorded for purposes of program assessment. Oral Defense The committee chair convenes a meeting with the committee and student for 30 minutes; this oral examination provides the opportunity for faculty to question the student on various aspects of the portfolio, and it gi ves the student the opportunity to expand upon and refine ideas represented in writing. The defense also provides an opportunity for further suggestions on publication and revision. After 30 minutes, the committee will conve ne without the student to discuss a final assessment for the portfolio using the published rubric.

The research requirements include the following coursework, for a minimum total of 9 credit hours: 1. Directed Research (The sis Preparation, EVR (6920): Students complete at least 6 credit hours of thesis research under the direct supervision of their major professor, typically during the second year of studies. After completion of all Core and Elective requirements, students remain enrolled in at least 2 credit hours USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Environmental Science and Policy (M.S.) 163 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ per semester of EVR 6920 until the completion and submittal of the Thesis which completes the requirements for the degree. Throughout this period students must work in close cooperation with their major professor and Supervisory Committee, and provide the Committee a summary of progress at least once per semester. 2. Research Methods/Design Preparation: All students selecting the Thesis option will comple te a research methods/d esign course (GEO 6970 - Research Methods in Geography). Other courses may be substituted for this requirement with the permission of the student's advisor and the Graduate Program Director. 3. Research Colloquium (EVR 6930), 1 credit hour Thesis/Non Thesis Options There are two options to complete the M.S. Degree: A. Thesis Option. The thesis option is a 36hour program designed for students who wish to complete original research as part of their graduate studies. The thesis option is a viable option for all students. Those intending to continue graduate work to the Ph.D. level are strongly encouraged to complete a thesis. B. Non Thesis Option. Students complete a minimum of 36 hours, with 24 hours of electives, keeping in mind that a minimum degree requirement is 16 hours at the 6000 level. Students must pass a comprehensive written examination that is administered during the semester they plan to graduate. Comprehensive Examination Thesis Option: 1. The student is required to present his/her thesis research at a public thesis defense. 2. As part of the thesis defense, an oral comprehensive exam is also administered. The defense and oral exam is scheduled and organized by the student's major professor, in consultation with the student's Supervisory Committee and the Graduate Director. As part of this process, a Pr esentations Form (available in the department office) needs to be completed one week prior to the defense date. 3. The exam can be completed only during the spring and fall Semesters. 4. A copy of the thesis must be made available in the department office one week prior to the defense for public review. NonThesis Option: 1. The examining committee will be comprised of the student's Supervisory Committee. 2. Nonthesis students are required to complete a sixhour long, written, closed book, comprehensive exam, which typically consists of series of questions that are prepared by the examination committee. Students are not allowed any outside materials during the exam, which is to be handwritten on paper supplied by the examination committee. 3. The exam can be completed during the spring or fall semesters, but not during the sum mer. 4. Students are encouraged to complete the exam during the last semester of their coursework. The exam must be completed no later than one seme ster after the student completes the coursework for the degree. You must be registered for two credits in that semester in the semester that the exam is completed. 5. All nonthesis examinations will be scheduled for the same day each semester (i.e. all students will sit for the exam at the same time), the date being set by the Graduate Director. Students must coordinate with their major professors when they will take the exam. USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Environmental Science and Policy (M.S.) 164 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ 6. Questions are solicited and organized by the student's major professor in consultation with the student's examination committee. 7. The answers to the questions are evaluated by the student's Supervisory Committee within two weeks of the exam. 8. If the answer to any question is determined to be incorrect or incomplete, the student may be required to retake that portion of the exam in the form of an oral exam that is only open to the committee. Students are encouraged to comple te the oral exam in the same semester they completed the first written exam. 9. If the student fails all portions of the exam, they will have one opportunity to retake the entire exam. This second exam must be co mpleted no later than the semester after the student receives notification that a second exam is necessary. 10. If it is determined that the student did not successfully complete his/her comprehensive exam after their second attempt, he/she will be dismissed from the program.

PROGRAM INFORMATION Geography is the study of the humanenvironment relationship either in a global or more regional context. Human Geography studies the construction of space, place, and power. It encompasses the study of economic geographies (e.g. globalization and development), political geographies (e.g. geopolitical struggles and new social movements), and social and cultural geographies (e.g. identities and exclusions) . Human geogra phy is key to providing insights into contemporary spatial arrangements, including the role of cities within the global economy, locating urbanrural intersections in the production of uneven development, and how class, gender, and race shape struggles for social justice. Environmental Geography links the study of nature and society and conside rs the ways in which conventional divisions between human and nonhuman (natural) worlds are bridged through the production of socio natures. This understanding is crucial to explaining and ameliorating contemporary environmental problems, including the privatization of natural resources, inequalities in access to food and water, injustices associated with environmental hazards and undesirable land uses, and the role of human activities in spurring largescale environmental change GI Science and Spatial Analysis concentrates on the use of advanced geospatial technologies, and the development and use of spatial analysis methodologies, to applied research problems in human and environmental geography. A thorough understanding of such geospatial technologies as Remote Sensing, GIS, and GPS, as well as modern methods of spatial statistical analysis and emerging spatial analytical techniques such as agentbased modeling, is a critical aspect of developing appropriate approaches to the analysis of geographic data.

The core seminars, directed by a faculty member from one of the participating departme nts, will familia rize students with the literature, existing knowledge, and research approaches of the various fields of area studies and invited to acquaint students with faculty and their research. The purposes of the seminars are: to provide an interdisciplinary graduate experienc e to foster a community of sc holars and learners focused on Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino experiences Students will also take a three (3) hour methodology course that acquaints them with particular research relevant to their major field of study and when possible, Latin America and/or the Caribbean. This includes special approaches to finding documentation from Latin America and the Caribbean; newlyavailable search tools available on the internet; and an overview of how disciplines utilize different research materials. Major With the concurrence of the ISLAC advisor, students will elect major and minor fields during their first semester. These fields will draw heavily on participating departments (e.g . Anthropology, History, Government and International Affairs, Art History). At that time the student will constitute a supervisory committee, made up of two professors from the major field and one from the minor field. The committee members will counsel the student and serve as member s of the exam or thesis committees. A large number of courses are available to fulfill the major and minor field requirements. These are listed separately and change somewhat from year to year. Departments who frequently work with ISLAC are Anthropology, Government and International Affairs, Sociology, Mass Communication, Geography, Social Work, Women's and Gender Studies, Global He alth, Philosophy, Economics, History, World Languages, Humanities and American Studies, Art History, Africana Studies and Education. Students may also request to have courses from other departments count toward major or minor fields. Electives Students can take one elective from outside the major and minor fields, in order to complement their core studies. These might be technical courses, study abroad courses, internships, math and science courses, methodology, or another unrelated field. In all cases, students must justify their elective hours and receive approval from their committees. In addition, students opting for the nonthesis track must take one more course in each of their major and minor fields (2 courses total).

Most research in the CMMB Department is done by faculty housed in the BioScience Facility building (BSF). Due to the interdisciplinary aspect of most Research projects, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad ranging research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Many of the faculty within CMMB are involved in cooperative resear c h with their colleagues in Chemistry, Integrative Biology, Public Health, Nursing, Medicine, Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often CMMB graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require handson experimental laboratories, CMMB support many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. CMMB values high quality teaching at all levels of support. Research Assistant positions may also be available to support research with specific faculty members dep ending on an individual faculty members funding. Numerous scholarship opportunities are also offered on a competitive basis through the USF Office of Graduate Studies. Applying to the Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Students interested in attending graduate studies within the CMMB Department should visit the CMMB website that can be accessed from the main USF site and review the current CMMB faculty. It is recommended that potential USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Microbiology (M.S.) 225 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ students consider at least 23 CMMB faculty that they would be interested in working with and communicate this information in their letter of application. It is also recommended that potential students contact the CMMB Graduate Director as well as the individual faculty members they are interested in working with via email. Such communication will facili tate the assignment of the laboratory rotations that CMMB students will participate in during their first semester of residency and also allow the applicant to determine whether the desired faculty member has positions available in the laboratory. All students admitted to the Masters in Microbiology must establish a supervisory committee. The supervisory committee shall constitute the major profes sor and at least two additional credentialed faculty. At least one of the committee members must be a faculty member at USF. Supervisory committee must be formed within two semesters after matriculation. The CMMB Graduate Director and CMMB Chair must approve the Supervisory Committee. Once a major professor has been as signed and/or a student occupies or utilizes significant space or facilities for research or analogous scholarly activity directly pertinent to the generation of a thesis, the student shall enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of research credit each semester (other than summ er semester), until eligible to enroll in thesis credits.

USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Microbiology (M.S.) 228 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Accelerated nonthesis BS/MS program in Microbiology This program allows B.S. majors in Microbiology to take graduate courses for the elective part of the Microbiology degree and apply them to a nonthesis M.S. degree in Microbiology. Successful students will be able to earn the M.S. degree in two additional semesters beyond the completion of the B.S. degree . This accelerated program shares 12 credits between already existing degrees/concentrations: B.S. in Microbiology M.S in Microbiology (NT) Target students and expected outcomes This program will appeal to the more competitive Microbiology majors who would benefit professionally from having the M.S. when they enter the job market but do not want to commit to the longe r time a thesis M.S. or a Ph.D. program takes to comple te. Professions that do not require bench laboratory experience but desire the broadened knowledge base are targeted. Graduates from this program would be ideally suited for health professions, technology based industry, education and government. We also expect that some students will be intere sted in doctoral education in the biological or biomedical areas. Description and Requirements Microbiology majors who have completed the following courses may apply to this program: PCB 3023 Cell Biology PCB 3063 Graduate Degree Requirements Students admitted into the M.S. portion of the program must complete all the requirements for the M.S. degree (nonthesis) within three semesters of admission. The requirement is 30 hours of graduate work with at least 16 of these hours completed at the 6000 level; 26 hours must be formally structured courses; and at least 15 hours must be in CMMB courses. Students will be required to take 3 core courses from the list below as part of these 26 hours. Of the required 26 hours, 9 hours will be derived from the coreCMMB graduate courses listed below (see assoc iated curriculum). These requirements can be partially met by up to 12 hours of graduate courses taken as undergraduates. Any graduate class taken outside of CMMB must be approved by the CMMB Graduate Director. Students should be aware that a B grade or better is required for every graduate class applied to the MS portion of their degree. In addition, students will be required to pass an oral qualifying exam based on a review paper submitted in their final semester. Students must form a committee as part of their action plan to complete their graduate work. This committee will be comprise d of at least 3 CMMB faculty, and will serve as the examination committee for the review paper required as part of the MS portion of their degree. Upon approval of that paper, students must successfully complete a comprehensive oral exam by their committee. Timeline and benchmarks: 1. Completion of prerequisite up per division courses and application to the accelerated program. Typically students will be in their junior year. 2. Acceptance into the program and an action plan within a semester of application. 3. Students will take up to 12 credits of graduate credit in CMMB courses following acceptance into the program. Typically these courses will be taken in the latter half of the junior year and in the senior year. BioAdvise will monitor the progress of the students and ensure they follow their action plan. Students who do not complete at least 9 hours of graduate work by graduation will be dropped from the accelerated M.S. program. 4. GRE exams will be taken in a timely manner so scores will be available for admission to the M.S. portion of the program. Students who do not complete the GRE in time will not be admitted to the accelerated M.S. program. 5. Students must apply for admission to the M.S. portion of the program in a timely manner (Fall admission deadline is Febr uary 15, Spring deadline is August 1). 6. Students admitted to the accelerated program must form a committee prior to the beginning of their first semester in the M.S. portion of the program and must continue to follow the action plan which will be monitored by BioAdvise.

MPA Concentration PROGRAM INFORMATION The Public Administration Program offers a multidisciplinary course of study leading to the Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.). The M.P.A. degree is designed primarily to prepare students for successful leadership roles and management careers in the public (i.e., governmental and quasigovernmental organizations) and nonprofit sectors. Students enrolled in the M.P.A. Program pursue careers in local, state, or federal agen cies of govern ment, nonprofit organizations, and special service districts. Additionally the M.P.A. degree prepares individuals for further academic study leading to a doctorate in Public Administration, a Ph.D. in Public Policy and Administration, as well as a variety of other disciplines. Those employed in public management positions may wish to pursue the M.P.A. in order to broaden educational backgrounds to prepare for increased job responsibilities, or to change career paths. Such in service students currently make up the majority of the M.P.A. student body. The Public Administration Program also offers courses of study leading to a Graduate Ce rtificate in Public Management (G.C.P.M.), Graduate Certificate in Research Administration (G.C.R.A.) and Graduate Certificate in Nonprofit Management (G.C.N.M.). These programs are designed for individuals who wish to acquire knowledge of public and nonprofit management theory and practices, but who do not find it necessary or feasible to pursue the M.P.A. d egree. The M.P.A. Program also serves preservice students who have recently completed a bachelor's degree, who wish to gain entry to a professional career track. Students admitted to the M.P.A. are not eligible for the Graduate Certificate in Public Management.

Department may waive som e of the course requirements for those students who have taken equivalent course work at another institution. Comprehensive Examination Graduation from the Master's program also requires the completion of both written and oral examinations. For the nonthesis option, there is no language or thesis requirement for the M.A. degree. Written Comprehensive Examination The written exam is designed to cover material presented during the first year of graduate work. The purpose of the exam is to make sure the students have reviewed their first year's work before starting the second year and to point out weaknesses which should be overcome during their second year in order to graduate. Students are expected to pass this exam in at most two attempts. More specifically, the material for the above examination will be taken primarily from the following sequences of course s Semester 1: STA 5166 Statistical Methods I and STA 5326 Mathematical Statistics I; Semester 2: STA 6167 Statistical Methods II and MAT 6326 Mathematical Statistics II, and STA 6208 Linear Statistical Models. A. Non thesi s Option At least 30 hours of Statistics and Mathematics graduate courses. Specifically: (A) The Statistics and Mathematics graduate courses of 5000 level or higher, offered regularly for statistics and mathematics majors from our department are counted towards the 30 hours requirement.

B. Thesis Option Student's Graduate Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty, appointed by the program director/departmental chairperson and approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and a pprove the thesis for content and format. USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Statistics (M.A.) 279 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ At least 30 hours of stat and math graduate courses (see above for details). Taking the sequences Statistics Methods and Mathematical Statistics with at least a \"B\" average for each sequence. At least 6 hours in MAT 6971, Master's Thesis, only 6 hours of which are counted in the 30 hours requirement. Oral Defense of the Thesis Final Submission of Approved Thesis. Under this degree option, six (6) research credits may be applied to the total of 30 required on the student's program of study. These reductions are made to allow the student sufficient time to complete a formal master's thesis. A master's thesis is a scholarly composition that demonstrates the ability of the author to do independe nt and creative work. It explores in some depth a problem or issue related to the major field of study. Although considerable variations in format and style are acceptable, precise expression, logical construction, and meticulous attention to detail are essential. A thesis in statistics should deal with some aspect of statistical methodology or theory, or the development of statistic al models for a class of problems related to a scientific question. While most theses will include a case study or example that involves scientific data, the analysis of a particular data set does not, alone, constitute the level of scholarly acc omplishment required for a thesis.

ABA provides an approach for developing, implementing, and evaluating practica l strate gies to produce changes in socially significant behaviors of individuals in the context of community settings. Three important features characterize the scientific basis upon which ABA is built: a) it focuses upon objectively measurable behavior of individuals; b) it studies environmental influences upon the targeted behaviors; and c) it places a premium upon singlesubject research designs to an alyze the effects of different environmental variables. The 44credit hour master's degree in ABA is in the department of Child and Family Studies in the College of Behavioral and Community Sciences. Students demonstrate knowledge of behavioral principles and procedures in courses that constitute a core curriculum, demonstrate applied behav ior analysis skills through supervised practicum experiences, and complete a data based thesis. The master's degree program is designed to prepare students to meet the standards to be Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs). It will prepare them for employment in a variety of fields where there are growing demands for comp etent professionals with expertise in applied behavior analysis. Philosophy The systematic analysis and application of behavioral principles is an extensive repertoire of professional behaviors. In the USF ABA program, these skills are acquired as students move through the sequenced curriculum of coursework and practicum experience s. The curriculum requires application of behavior analytic principles, with direct supervision by faculty and BCBA supervisors. Students participate in practicum training in community agencies under the supervision of BCBAs. In addition to the 1025 hours of behavior analysis practice they complete in their practicum sites each week, students also participate in practicum seminars each semeste r. In these seminars, the Practicum Coordinator discusses important practice issues and facilitates student discussion of their applied work. The supervision of the students' research theses rests in the hands of designated core faculty members (i.e., \"major professors\"). Major professors serve as mentors for the students by closely supervising thei r research and their progress through the program. Therefore, as students are mentored by their major professors during the program, a meaningful major professor student relationship is essential. Accreditation: Accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools.

The primary objective of the program is preparation of the graduate for professional social work practice through acquisi tion of specialized knowledge and skills necessary for clinical practice with individuals, families, and groups. The secondary objectives of the M.S.W. program are: 1. to prepare students academically for pursuit of doctoral education in social work or related human service disciplines or professions; 2. to contribute to the needed supply of professionally educated clinical social wo rkers in the Tampa Bay area, the state, the region, and the nation. The M.S.W. program offers a specialized course of study in direct clinical practice. The program offers students a core curriculum, plus electives, and a supervised field experience designed to produce professionals wi th individual, family, and group practice skills. M.S.W. graduates are prepared to engage in advanced clinical social work practice. As such, it is our goal that by completion of the program, students will be prepared: 1. To become advanced social work practitioners who integrate the knowledge, skills , and value s of the profession so they are able to conduct evidence informed practice effectively and ethically with individuals, groups, families, organizations, and communities ranging from local to global levels. 2. To engage in addressing the needs of vulnerable, oppressed, and underserved populations and to promote university community partnerships that strengthen communities and further so cial and economic justice.

To contribute to the body of knowledge regarding theory and skills that is critical to the practice of effecti ve social work and the vitality of the profession. 5. To engage in the pursuit of professional ifelong learning, which may include advanced education preparation necessary to sustain professional competency. The M.S.W. program places great emphasis on standards of professional behavior and ethics in the practice of social work. Entrance into the M.S.W. program does not guarantee gr aduation from the program. Students admitted to the M.S.W. program must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0, in all social work courses, with no grade below \"B\" counting toward graduation. Failure to maintain the specified GPA or to exhibit responsible professional behavior determined by the School may result in s uspension or dismissal from the program. Courses with grades below \"B\" must be repeated before progressing to the next sequence. Students must pass the comprehensive paper during the last semester in order to graduate from the program.

Code: DEA Program (Major/College): BUD BA Effective date Summer 2014 CONTACT INFORMATION College: Business Contact Information: www.grad.usf.edu PROGRAM INFORMATION The DBA program offered by the College of Business provides its graduates with the skills needed to conduct rigorous research with the objective of applying the findings to realworld decisionmaking in industry and government. The Program provides for intellectual growth as students work closely with faculty in seminars, research projects, and other assignments that develop their research skills and ability to communicate their findings to a broad audience of both practitioners and researchers. It also offers students the opportunity to develop a portfolio of skills that, when combined with the extensive experience that they bring into the program, uniquely qualifies them to serve in clinical faculty p ositions. The curriculum is designed to build upon the breadth of business understanding that they have previously achieved as successful executives. This is achieved by offering substantive coverage of a broad variety of qualitative and quantitative research techniques and by allowing students the flexibility to focus more deeply on their personal areas of interest during the dissertation phases of the program. The degree conferred is a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), a terminal degree sonamed to differentiate it from the Ph.D. degree that specifically focuses on preparing students for an academic research career within a specific discipline. Students will comple te the 3year program in a cohort with other executives. Classes are scheduled all day for two consecutive days approximately one weekend a month for six 5month semesters. Each semester is divided into 2 quarters, with a one month break between semesters. Facetoface classes are heavily supplemented by online activities between facetoface cl asses. The weekend format allows participants to continue carrying their careers while they master a range of applied research skills.

They fall into three categories. The first are designed to develop the student's quantitative and qualitative research skills, and to provide opportunities to practice these skills in real world contex ts . These required courses consist of: GEB 7557 Research and Writing Skills for Doctoral Students 3 credits QMB 6375 Applied Linear Statistical Models 3 credits QMB 7565 Introduction to Research Methods 3 credits QMB 7566 Applied Multivariate Statistical Methods 3 cred its GEB 7911 Qualitative Research Methods in Business 3 credits The second category is intended to provide students with exposure to research in the multidisciplinary topics that represent the current areas of focus of the College of Business.

Two of the following courses would be offered so as to provide exposure to a variety of researchrelated topics and activities. ACG 7936 Seminar on Special Topics in Accounting 3 credits FIN 7930 Selected Topics in Finance 3 credits ISM 7930 Selected Topics in MIS 3 credits MAN 6930 Selected Topics 3 credits MAR 7931 Seminar on Selected Marketing Topics 3 cre d its Publication Courses 9 Credits These courses are offered during the first three semesters of the program and have a substantial distance learning and collaboration component between class meetings, with members of the cohort being required to peer review each other's work and make revisions. They represen t an extension of previous courses, and require the students to create publishable documents, such as journal, conference and book chapter submissions. Depending upon the particular publication project, each course will have one of the following designations: ACG 6915 Directed Research 3 credits GEB 6930 Selected Topics 3 cred its FIN 7915 Directed Research 3 credits ISM 7931 Directed Research 3 credits MAN 6911 Directed Research 3 credits MAR 6916 Directed Research 3 credits Issues Courses 10 Credits These courses are offered starting in the fourth semester of the Program, and are intended to run in parallel with proposal and dissertation activities. Although meeting according to the same schedule as regular courses, issues courses offer fewer cre dits than regular or publication courses, and therefore have commensurately reduced outside workloads to avoid interfering with the dissertation process. Members of the cohort select the topics from a list of proposals made by faculty members and other members of the cohort. Students may also elec t to facilitate issues courses under the direction of a faculty supervisor, who acts as the instructor of record. Depending on the topic being taught, these courses may be any of the following: USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Business Administration (D.B.A.) 347www.coba.usf.edu ACG 7939 Executive Issues in Accounting 2 credits FIN 7939 Executive Issues in Finance 2 credits GEB 7939 Executive Issues in Business 2 credits ISM 7939 Executive Issues in MIS 2 credits MAN 7939 Executive Issues in Management 2 credits MAR 7939 Executive Issues in Marketing 2 credits QMB 7939 Executive Issues in Operations Rese arch and Operations Management 2 credits With the approval of the DBA Program Committee, students may be permitted to substitute up to four (4) credits of independent study/directed research (e.g., ACG 7905, MAR 7910) for selected issues courses during their final year of the program. Dissertation Pro posal Course 4 Credits The proposal course is offered during the student's fourth semester. It requires the student be matched to a four (4) person Dissertation Committee and submit a dissertation proposal for approval by the Committee. For the purpose of the DBA program, the course requirements for both dissertation and doctoral project proposals are the sa me. Prior to the proposal course, students will take the university mandated qualifying exam, whose results will be assessed by the DBA Committee. Proposal courses are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passed. GEB 7981 Dissertation Preparation 4 credits Qualifying Exam and Doctoral Candi dacy Per University Policy, students must be enrolled in a minimum of 2 graduate credit hours in the semester of the exam. For DBA students, this requirement will be met as part of the normal course load. Before a student enrolled in the DBA program can be admitted to doctoral candidacy, the following University requirements must be met: appointment of a Dissertation Committee, attainment of an overall and degree program Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.00 at USF at the time of candidacy. (All \"I\" and \"M\" grades, including \"IF\" and \"MF\", must be cleared before candidacy may be finalized.) suc cessful completion of a qualifying examination certification by the Dissertation Committee that the above qualifications have been successfully completed. Dissertation/Doctoral Project 16 Credits Students are required to complete a dissertation or doctoral project, as approved by his or her committee. Dissertation Dissertation courses are offered every quarter throughout the st udent's last year, upon satisfactory completion of at least 44 course credits, four (4) proposal credits, and Admission to Doctoral Candidacy. These courses require the student to work towards the completion of the Dissertation approved by his or her committee. Because the DBA degree is designed to be responsive to the needs of the Candidate, there is some flexibility in the form that the Dissertation can take\u2014subject to approval by the Committee. University policy allows for two variations in the format: 1. A traditional research dissertation 2. Collection of articles/papers The Candidate will meet with members of the Committee during each residency of the final year of the program, and will present his or her dissertation to the Committee in the final semester of the Prog ram. Upon successful completion of the dissertation defense presentation, the Dissertation Committee will then approve the awarding of the Degree, subject to all remaining program requirements being met, including submission of the Dissertation to the Office of Graduate Studies . USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Business Administration (D.B.A.) 348www.coba.usf.edu Dissertation courses are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passed. The sixteen (16) dissertation credits can be earned by taking one or more of the following courses: ACG 7980 Dissertation in Accounting FIN 7980 Dissertation GEB Dissertation ISM 7980 Dissertation MAN 7980 Dissertation MAR 7980 Dissertation Doctoral Project Or, a student may opt to complete a doctoral project in lieu of the Dissertation. Examples that could be approve d might include: 1. a practicefocused book submitted for publication, 2. a writeup of a substantial work related project in which the principles of evidence based research were applied 3. a portfolio of related research products/activitie s that demonstra te knowledge creation or innovative application in a given area. Such a portfolio might include journal, book, magazine articles, conference papers and presentations. Students completing the Doctoral Project earn their required 16 credit hours by taking the same courses specified for dissertations, which are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passe d . Confirmation of successful completion of the Doctoral Project must be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies. External Activity Requirements In addition to the Program's course requirements, each student is required to participate in three external activities that involve meeting with academics and/or doctoral students from other institutions. Examples of such activities could include academic c onferences, workshops, colloquiums, doctoral symposiums or academic association annual or regional meetings. At least one of these should include a substantial proportion of international attendees. Grading Requirements Proposal, Dissertation, and Directed Research courses are graded Pass/Fail, and must be passed. Students must complete all remaining cours es with a grade of \"B\" or better. This is in addition to the University requirement for a 3.00 GPA overall and in the Program. Should a student fail to pass or complete a course with the required grade, the DBA Program Committee may offer an alternative activity as a substitute. Other R equirements As a result of the program's cohort structure, normally all doctoral coursework must be completed at the University of South Florida within the DBA program. Students seeking to transfer from other programs should contact the DBA Academic Program Director prior to applying. All program requirements will normally be completed in three (3) years, as part of a cohort. In the event of unavoidable interruptions to a student's p rogress, the student may petition the DBA Program Committee for an extension up to a maximum of five (5) years from the student's original starting date. Any student not completing all progr am requirements within the five (5) year time period will be dropped from the program and the student would need to reapply for admission to the program in the event he or she wishes to continue.

Business Intelligence (BI) Track The M.S./MIS program offers a track in business intelligence. The requirements for this track are as follows. Required Courses Students will have to complete four out of the following five courses: ISM 6136 Data Mining* 3 ISM 6218 Advanced Database Management 3 ISM 6208 Data Warehousing 3 ISM 6137 Statistical Data Mining* 3 QMB 7566 Applied Multivariate Statistical Methods 3 USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Management Information Systems (M.S.) 372www.coba.usf.edu In addition, graduate students who take the courses to satisfy this track and earn a GPA of 3.00 or higher for the courses in the track, will receive a \"Joint SAS/USF Certificate in Analytics and Business Intelligence,\" when they use a SAS analytics package as part of some of these courses. *Specifically, graduate students will need to use, among other tools, SAS Enterprise Miner or an equipalent SAS analytics package in the Data Mining and Statistical Data Mining courses. Students may take both of the data mining courses, but only need to complete one of the two courses and four courses in the track to be eligible for the Certificate . The tool wi l be provided free for class uses by SAS Institute. Accelerated B.S./M.S. Program The goal of the USF College of Business integrated undergraduate graduate program in MIS is to provide outstanding undergraduate students an option to complete the B.S. undergraduate degree in MIS and the M.S. graduate degree in MIS in five years (141 total hours). The integrated B.S./M.S. program is a 141hour undergraduate graduate option that allows eligible students to wor k towards the M.S. in MIS degree requirements while completing their undergraduate B.S. degree. Students interested in this option will work closely with an advisor and a faculty member to develop an integrated plan of study. General Guidelines Time of admission to the program: Students will be elig ible for admission to the integrated degree program at the beginning of their Senior year in MIS. Students must apply for admission consideration during their Junior year. Students will start taking courses in the graduate program in their Senior year. Joint admission: Students must apply to and meet admission requ i rements of the M.S. in MIS graduate program. Plan of study: In consultation with an advisor and a faculty member, students will be required to prepare a Graduate Degree Action Plan. The plan will cover the entire time period of the program and it will be periodically reviewed with an advisor. Advising: Students will present their portfolio (s ee below for details and a plan of study in person to the integrated program committee prior to being admitted to the program. Tuition charges: Students will be required to pay graduate tuition rates when taking graduate courses. Admission Requ irements 1. Students with at least a Junior standing in their undergraduate degree program may apply for admission consideration into the integrated B.S./M.S. undergraduate/graduate program Students will submit an Accelerated Program Interest Form that must be signed by the Graduate Program. 2. Students must have a minimum 3.25 GPA. 3. Interested students will be required to present a \"portfolio\" of the following c redentials: a. Three letters of recommendation, at least two from faculty b. Statement of intent\u2014a personal statement about why the student wishes to apply for the integrated program. c. Undergraduate transcripts. d. Other supporting documents (e.g., projects and papers, software, work experi ence, internships, etc.) should be included where possible. 4. The GMAT or GRE should be taken sometime before or during the Fall semester of the Junior year of study. 5. All applicants will need to meet any other admission requirements established for the M.S. in MIS program. 6. The application to the integrated program will be consider ed as a complete package and therefore obtaining a high undergraduate GPA is not a guarantee of admission. Grades in the undergraduate MIS core courses will be taken in consideration and will have a significant impact on the M.S./MIS acceptance decision. USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Management Information Systems (M.S.) 373www.coba.usf.edu Degree Requirements 5Year Plan of Study for Integrated B.S./M.S. Undergraduate Graduate Program: With appropriate planning, a total of 12 hours of graduate credit may be taken that can be applied to both the B.S. and M.S. degrees. This will reduce the minimum total credits required for both programs from 153 (120 for B.S., 33 for M.S.) to 141 credits . Specifically: 9 hours of graduate credit can be taken in place of the 9 hours of elective undergraduate credits. The student must earn a minimum grade of B in each graduate course that is to be counted for both degrees. The graduate level Operations and Su pply Chain Processes course ISM 6436 can be taken in place of the comparable undergraduate course ISM 3431. A comprehensive plan of study to complete the integrated B.S./M.S. program will be developed with the guidance of an advisor and a faculty member. A possible plan of study could be as follows. Summer sessions may also be included in the study plan. First and Second Year Courses and credits as design ated for Freshman and Sophomore years.

New cohorts will begin twice each year in January and August. Students will continue to be en rolled in the program as long as they 1) Remain Infosys employees 2) Continue to meet the USF and COB academic standard of maintaining a minimum GPA of 3.00/4.00. Students who fail to enroll in program courses for six or more months will be required to reapply for admission. In that case COB will not guarantee availability of cours es in the USFInfosys program. Students have a break in enrollment must complete all required coursework within five years from the cohort start date as defined in the 2012/2013 and subsequent USF catalogs. Prerequisites Incoming studen ts are expected to have completed or be enrolled concurrently in the following courses or equivalents: A one semester course that addresses a highlevel, objectoriented programming language (e.g. C#, C++, Java) or substantial programming experience A one semester course in systems analysis and design or equivalent experi ence A one semester course in database systems or equivalent experience A one semester in statistics A one semester course in economics A one semester course in financial accounting Prerequisite coursework may be completed at any regionally accredited college or university either on site or online; required prerequisi tes may also be satisfied by completion of nonacademic credit courses that specify learning objectives and provide for assessment of learning. With prior approval, students may also enroll concurrently in prerequisites and Infosys program courses. Examples of acceptable online courses include: Louisiana State University Financial Accounting: ACT 2001 Introduction to Financial Accounting Economics: Eco n 2000 Principles of Microeconomics Brigham Young University Statistics: STA 121 Principles of Statistics USF Statistics: QMB 6305 Managerial Decision Analysis Online notfor credit prerequisite courses recommended by COB Prerequisite courses will not count toward the 33 credit hours required for the MSMIS. Comple tion of the Inf osys foundation program and relevant work experience may substitute for the technical prerequisites in objectoriented programming, systems analysis and design, and database design. Prerequisite coursework and equivalent experience will be evaluated by Infosys. Based on that evaluation, Infosys will provide assurance to USF that minimum levels of preparation hav e been met. Admission The ultimate admission decision for each student will rest with the COB. To be considered for admission, a student must provide a transcript or other academic record from a regionally accredited college or university indicating completion of requirements for a four year degree in engineeri ng or a technical field or evidence of completion of both a three year degree and a higher level minimum one year program (e.g., M.Sc., MCA, M.Com. etc.) The admission process will begin with Infosys sending a list of proposed students who are curren t employees to the COB. Concurrently, these students will complete the COB USF online application for admission to the MSMIS. Students applying online should select MS/MIS (Infosys) as the program of study from the program option available, USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Management Information Systems (M.S.) 375www.coba.usf.edu and then input their Infosys employee number while inputting the online application form and indicate the program code as USFINFY. Required application elements include: USF application form and application fee Infosys employee number and program code (USFINFY) Official copies of undergraduate and graduate transcripts and degree certificates from all postsecondary institutions (Infosys will be responsible for collecting official transc r ipts and supporting documents and submitting them to the COBUSF) A statement of purpose Resume 23 Letters of Recommendations GMAT or GRE score TOEFL score for students whose primary language is not English To receive conside ration students, students whose primary language is not English must present a minimum TOEFL score of 213 (computer based test) or 79 (Internetbased test); or 6.5 on the IELTS; or a converted score of 500 or higher on the verbal section of the GRE. Students who have earned a college degree from an institution for which the languag e of instruction is English (noted on the transcript) may waive this requirement. Transcripts from institutions outside the United States, especially if they are not written in English, may require a transcript evaluation. If a transcript evaluation is required, the student will be responsible for any fees associated with the evaluati ons. Failure to pay for a required transcript evaluation will result in rejection of the application. The COB will evaluate all applications and admit students who meet admission criteria for the USF COB onsite MSMIS program offered on the USF Tampa Campus. Students will be admitted to the program base d on an evaluation of a portfolio of criteria including prior collegelevel academic record; GMAT or GRE score; letters of recommendation; student's statement of purpose; relevant work experience; and TOEFL score for students whose primary language is not English. On admission, students will be required to pay a onetime administrative fee of $175. Degree Program R equirements The MS/MIS program requires 33 hours of coursework.

Approved 2011 CONTACT INFORMATION College: Education Department: Teaching and Learning Contact Information: www.grad.usf.edu PROGRAM INFORMATION Program Description The purpose of this online Master's program is to prepare teachers to be highly qualified and provide access to the general curriculum in least restrictive school environments to students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (InD). Accreditation: The Master of Arts in ASD and InD meets the accreditation standards required by the College of Education, University of South Florida. The proposed curriculum in the program is alig ned with the conceptual framework of the College of Education and will meet the specific standards of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Major Rese arch Areas The program benefits the university, local community and the state can be summarized in two ways. In a quantitative way, the program meets the need of preparing effective teachers to work with the growing number of students in general and special education who are identified as having ASD and/or InD labels. This is dem onstrated through the critical shortage of data at a national and state level and also in the surveys of local school districts to USF. In a qualitative way, the program meets the need to prepare effective teachers to work with this group of students that represents a paradig matic shift in where and how these students learn. Students with ASD and/or InD labels need meaningful access to general education curriculum and their typically developing peers and this program meets this need. ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements An earned baccalaureate degree in education or a related field that has a relationship with autism and/or intellectual disabilities from a regionally accredited college of university.

Graduation Requirements: Portfolio System The Master's Portfolio System is a means through which each master's level student demonstrates his/her competency in the \"best practices\" of special education. Commensurate with the belief that the merging of research and practice is desirable and beneficial; the Department of Teaching and Learning has identified eight areas in which students are required to demonstrate their competency: Professional and personal selfawareness Assessment of exception students Behavior management Classroom instruction Collaboration Knowledge of the professional literature Research in critical areas such as child development, learning and teaching Professional development The department has also developed a list of suggested artifacts through which students can document their competenc y in each area. Students should meet with their advisor to discuss and plan their individualized portfolio. A copy of the Master's Portfolio System complete with policies and procedures, as well as suggested artifacts, is available with the Program Coordinator. Each student will be required to present his/her individualized portfolio to the Portfolio Revie w Committee in the Department of T eaching and Learning upon completion of their program.

Further requirements may be imposed by the candidate's doctoral program and supervisory committee. See individual programs for specific requirements. 3. Learning Focus. Throughout the student's program of study, independent learning will be emphasized. For the first time in the participant's career, in most cases, the student will be responsible for mastering a new domain of knowledge without the aid of organized lectures and textbooks. The principal information source will be current literature. Such experience is a necessary preparation for a meaningful career in engineering and other fields where the professional must keep pac e with a large, everchanging body of knowledge. USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Section 16 College of Engineering 531 http://www.eng.usf.edu/ 4. Qualifying Examination. A written and oral qualifying examination, conducted by the supervisory committee, will be taken by each Ph.D. student as soon as a substantial majority of coursework is completed. 5. Admission to Candidacy. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they register for dissertation. Before admission to candidacy, students must have officially formed a Ph.D. Supervisory Committee and passed the qualifying examination of paragraph 4. Once admitted to candidacy students must enroll for a minimum of 2 credit hours each semester of the academic year until completion of program. 6. Dissertation Research. The student must carry out an investigation resulting in an original and significant contribution to the knowledge in the field of research. The requirement of uniqueness means that the dissertation research will provide an important creative experience for the student. As the final stage of the student's program, the candidate must prepare a written dissertation covering the research. Students in the Ph.D. program must take an appro priate number of doctoral dissertation credits, but not less than 20 hours; the exact number is determined by department and/or individual requirements. The defense of the dissertation will conform to Office of Graduate Studies general rules. 7. Residency. Minimum residency requirements may be satisfied by completing the University's minimal requirement at the University of South Florida. Any graduate work counted toward the fulfillment of the requirement for the Ph.D. degree after admission to candidacy must be accomplished within 5 calendar years. Collaboration with Other Colleges and Departments Advanced study and research challenges exist at the interfaces between engineering and other academic disciplines. Examples inc lude surface physics and chemistry applied to semiconductor processing technology; semiconductor physics applied to VLSI and analog integrated circuit design, manufacture and quality control; chemical processing and its relation to chemical principles; environmental engineering and chemical identification of minute impurities; environmental and transportation engineering and its relation to public health and public administration; water resources e ngineering and geohydrology; and biomedical engineering, to name only a few.

In order to accomplish the first objective, advances in health care increasingly involves the application of emerging science and technology (I.E., Engineering) to clinical problems, including problems in diagnostics treatment and the health care system itself. Unlike more basic research that often aims to incre ase science and technology knowledge in itself, translational research seeks to specifically address the science and technology needed to solve problems with the end product an actual application or product (of course, adding new significant knowledge in the process). In order to conduct effective biomedical translational research, the investigator must be trained in both clinical science (i.e . the MD Degree) and Engineering (Specifically Biomedical Engineering). This need has been delineated by both academics and industry and is validated by the growing number of MD/PH.D. (BME) programs nationally. USF has the necessary educational components and research infrastruct ure for this endeavor; both degrees are currently available. The proposed program seeks to provide an integrated experience where the student really fells a part of both the medical/clinical and engineering worlds simultaneously, hence the need for an integrated dual degree program.

The MSIT graduate will demonstrate strong information technology skills as well as problem solving skills needed for the deployment of technology solutions to achieve business and organizational goals. The degree is av ailable in an online mode, and provides students with a broad and integrative understanding of both technology and operational and strategic business and organizational applications. There is considerable freedom in the choice of the courses. The breadth of subjects which are part of information technology together with the immense diversity of its applications, make it imperative that students in the Master's program maintain close conta ct with the Graduate Program Director, in order to achieve a coherent plan of study directed towards a specific goal. In particular, election of courses should only be made with prior consultation and approval of the Major Professor or the Graduate Program Director .

New Graduate Certificate: Teaching and Communicating Ocean Sciences Broader Impacts USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Section 17 College of Marine Science 625 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ University of South Florida College of Marine Science 140 7th Avenue S, MSL119 St. Petersburg, : Jacqueline E. Dixon, Ph.D. Director of Academic Affairs: David Naar, Ph.D. Accreditation: The Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools College Structure and Location: The College of Marine Science (CMS) was formed during 2000 from the previous Department of Marine Scien ce, initiated in 1967 with three foun ding faculty members. The Florida Board of Regents declared it a University Center of Excellence in 1978 and approved the Marine Science Ph.D. program in 1982. The CMS at the University of South Florida is constituted as a graduatelevel resea rch program that forms the basis for educational op portunities at the Ph.D. and M.S. degree levels and for public service to the State of Florida. Located on the beautiful waterfront of Tampa Bay adjacent to the USF St. Petersburg campus, CMS is administratively part of the USF Tampa campus and reports to the Provost of USF. The College is focused on interdisciplinary research in marine science. Our 30 ranked fa culty, 112 support personnel and roughly 100 graduate students work together toward a vision of understanding the unified global ocean system. The College seeks to build new interdisciplinary research teams in colalbor ation with our local marine science research partners, include the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, the U.S. Geological Survery, NOAA, SRI St. Petersburg, and Mote Marine Lab. Mission Statement: The primary mission of the College is to conduct basic and applied research in ocean science. Here, ocean science is defined by application of the traditional fields of science to both the biology, chemistry, geology, and physi cs of the marine environment and to the interactions between the marine environment and the adjoining atmosphere and land systems - presently and throughout earth's history. Included in the primary ocean science mission is the development of new technol ogies and tools for explor ing the co upled ocean atmosphereland systems. The College expects its faculty to develop research programs of outstanding caliber and to fully engage the national and international scientific communities, through the reporting of research results in the most respected oral and written venues, and by profes sional service. Integral to the ocean science research mission is the educat ion of gra duate students. The College recruits, trains, and graduates productive, creative scientists at the Ph.D. and M.S. levels that are prepared to make independent contributions to ocean science. The faculty are expected to develop outstanding graduate education programs that will afford studen ts the opportu nity to participate in all aspects of research. The College recognizes that graduate education requires strong mentoring along with traditional USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Section 17 College of Marine Science 626 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ classroom instruction. An ancillary but important mission of the College is education outreach for students at all levels and for the public at large. Our outreach programs have significantly expanded our educational responsibilities, and they are intended to motivate all generations to become scientifically literate citizens and to understand the environment in which they live. Th e College pu rsues innovative avenues for educational outreach. Efforts are made to attract more junior and senior level undergraduates into both the ocean science core courses and into advanced courses for which they have prerequisites. Historically, this is a way in which students have made career decisions to engage in ocean science. In this manner the College maintains close ties with the studen t body in other University of South Florida Colleges and campuses. Research Facilities: The College facilities include specilaized laboratories equipped for studies in: Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; Trace metal analysis; Water quality; Organic and isotope Additionally, the complex includes the Center for Ocean Technology, which provides manufacturing and prototyping support to the faculty, students and engineers. The College's students and faculty have conducted research in the Antarctic, Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Norwegian, Bering, Mediterranean and Caribbe an Seas. The College has access to 5 research vessels in conjunction with the Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO) and the U.S. geological Survey: The RV Weatherbird II (115 ft), the RV Bellows (71 ft), the RV Gilbert (42 ft), the RV Fish Hawk (38 ft), and the RV Price (24 ft). Ship time on other vessels in the U.S. fleet of oceanographic vessels, as well as foreign research vessels, is generally obtained through federal funding. Major Research Areas: .

This researchbased program has a low studenttofaculty ratio, with an average of 100 graduate students under the direction of 30 filltime faculty. Sudents in the Master's program may elect a concenetration in biological, chemical, geolog ical, or physical oceanography, or Marine Resource Assessment through course work and thesis research. CMS graduates are well prepared for positions in academe, industry, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations at local to international levels. Biological Oceanography Biological oceanography seeks to understand the life histories and population dynamics of marine organisms and how they interact with their environment over spac e and time. Scientists in the College of Marine Science study the full breadth of biological oceanography including microbiology, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, coral reefs, fishes, and marine mammals. Our biological oceanographers utilize a variety of techniques including SCUBA, shipboard samplers, acoustics, molecular biology, and mathe matical modeling to understand the oceans and their inhabitants. Scientists in our college also use the latest in remote sensing technology to study vast regions of the Earth's oceans, and have also developed new technology, such as genosensor capable of identifying and quantifying harmful algal blooms and related processes on unprecedented scales. USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Marine Science (M.S.) 629 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ Chemical Oceanography Chemical oceanographers seek to understand the ways in which various elements are cycled within the oceans, and the reactions that these elements undergo. Ocean chemists improve our understanding of the basic conditions under which ocean life thrives in seawater, and help predict the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on ocean composition. Rese arch programs in the College of Marine Science include such wide ranging topics as the role and variability of nutrients in seawater, the distribution and cycling of rare earth elements and other trace metals, examination of the oceans' CO2 system, the study of dissolved organic matter, molecular organic compounds, radionuclides and stable isotopes in the oceans, and the distribution of chemical pollutants and their toxicity on marine organisms and ec osystems. Faculty and students utilize a wide variety of stateofthe art instrumentation and technology for investigating these research problems. Geological Oceanography Geological oceanographers in the College of Marine Science conduct research from the continental margins to the deepocean seafloor extending in time from modern envi ronments to millions of years back in Earth's history to understand and predict Earth surface and interior processes. Primary research themes include: (1) paleoceanography and paleoclimatology; (2) coastline and continental shelf development and processes including effects of storms and sealeve l fluctuations; (3) the health of modern and recent geologic history of coral reefs and carbonate depositional environments; (4) anthropogenic influences on estuaries; (5) mathematical explanations of geologic phenomena; and (6) plate tectonics. Our geological oceanography group has a variety of modern well equipped laboratories and field equipment, including one of the best seafloor mapping capabilitie s in the US. Fully integrated with these field instruments is the computational capability to generate stateofthe art data depictions and imagery. Our group also works closely with scientists from the US Geological Survey's Center for Coastal and Marine Science Center, a major federal laboratory located nearby. Physical Oc eanography Physical oceanography involves the study of water movement in the ocean. Energy is introduced to the ocean through wind and solar heating, and these combine with the rotation of the Earth and gravitational effects to drive ocean circulation, tides, and waves. Our physical oceanographers also investigate how the Earth's oceans are directly coupled with the atmosphere, from local weather patterns to the global climate system. Physical oceanographers in the CMS carry out research on a variety of topics using the latest technology. Computer models, real time data, satellite remote sensing, and in situ data from moored arrays, coastal and island tide gauges, and research cruises are used to study a wide range of research problems. Topics include tide and current prediction in Tampa Bay, circulation on the West Florida Shelf and in the Gulf of Mexico, El Ni\u00f1o, and the potential for global climate change. Marine Re source Assessment The College of Marine Science offers an interdisciplinary concentration in Marine Resource Assessment (MRA) as part of its M.S. and Ph.D. programs. This concentration provides training in the emerging field of ecosystem based management. Its mission is to train a new generation of scientists that can effective ly address i ssues concerning the sustainability of the world's living natural resources. At the College of Marine Science, the MRA concentration addresses the national shortage of graduates possessing the skills required for managing living marine resources by requiring a quantitative approach to ecosystem analysis and living resource assessment. The MRA concentration is designe d to produce resource assessment scientists who can introduce relevant ecosystem level variables into the traditional, singlespecies assessment process, complementing and enhancing the development of the sciencebased management policies that protect living marine resources.

In some concentrations, the concentration director will develop the program plan with the student and forward the program plan to the professional advisor. Once a program plan is determined, students are expected to adhere to this plan unless special permission is obtained. As not all courses are offered each semester, a student who deviates from the program plan understands that delay in graduation can be expected Priority is given to students who maintain initial degree plans. Clinical and/or site placements are based on preceptor and/or site availability. While every e ffort is made to assign students to preceptor/clinical sites near their residence, it is not always possible, and thus, students will need to be flexible. Students may find it useful to meet with the concentration director to understand speciality course focus and/or clinicla course demands and plan according ly.

There is a mandatory doctoral student orientation that all new doctoral students must attend in the fall semester of their first academic year. Students will demonstrate or document proficiency in teaching acad emic courses at the University level. When all required coursework is satisfactorily completed (including tools of research and prerequisites), the student must pass a comprehensive qualifying examination. All students must complete a dissertation. Doctor of Public Health (Dr.P.H.) The Doctor of Public Health (Dr.P.H .) is a professional, practiceoriented degree which is grant ed in recognition of the attainment of a broad set of practice, analytic and evaluative skills, including demonstrated public health leadership skills. Emphasis will be placed on proficiency in policy development and health policy strategies, public health leadership and management of health prog rams. Demonstration of applied research skills and strength in evaluation methods via practicebased speci alized study will be expected. The Dr.P.H. will require 90 semester hours beyond the baccalaureate degree. Candidates will have an M.P.H. or equivalent degree prior to admission, therefore the actual additional hours required for the Dr.P.H . beyond the Master's level will average 45 to 50 semester hours, depe nding upon the program designed by the student and his or her committee. Per University guidelines, all requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven calendar years from the student's date of admission for doctoral study. Students have four years to comp lete all required coursework, pass the qualif ying examination, an d be admitted to doctoral candidacy. Students then have four years from the date of doctoral candidacy to complete degree requirements.

Public health professionals can better perform these functions through not only obtaining the prerequisite knowledge but also through partnering with welltrained professionals in other fields such as law to develop and implement society's responses to public health needs. However, lawyers' effecti veness is often limited by their inadequate knowledge of public health and its scientific disciplines. The joint degree program is intended to supply this knowledge by giving public health and Stetson Law School graduates a sound education in both law and public health. A related goal is to increase the opportunities for interdisciplinary research, teaching, and advocacy for the faculties at the College of Public Health and Stetson University College of Law.

ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements Students will need to be accepted to both institutions and follow the admission standards of each setting. Students must complete the GRE and the LSAT for acceptance into this dual program. Refer to the M.P.H. listing for specific USF admission requirements. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS College of Public Health Students : Students in the College of Public Health will enroll in the J.D./M.P.H. program, complete the M.P.H. degree, and meet the admission requirements of Stetson which includes taking the LSAT, and then enroll in the Stetson College of Law to complete the JD. Students in the dual degree program will be permitted to count nine hours of credit from the M.P.H. program toward satisfac tion of JD credit requirements, and up to nine hours of credit from the JD program toward satisfaction of M.P.H. credit requirements. All students in the dual degree program must complete a field experience requirement. Students in Stetson Law must do mandatory pro bono work (20 hours). Some of these hours may qualify for the field experience however these must be done in a public health setting. This will be determined by the student's public health advisor and department. Credit hours for the M.P.H. may be more than 42 hours (i.e. 46 hours ) depen ding on the concentration program. Stetson Law Students : Students already enrolled in Stetson College of Law will normally apply for the dual degree program in their first or second year. Students in the program will usually complete either one or two years of law school, after which they will spend a year comple ting the M.P.H. program in the College of Public Health. Students will have the ability to choose whichever concentration within the College that best meets their interests and needs and which they are formally accepted to by the College and Department. After completing their M.P.H., students will return to Stetson to comple te their JD and prepare for the bar exam. The virtue of this study plan is that students will commence M.P.H. study with a sound foundation in law and legal process, and students will complete the elective portion of their legal study with a sound foundation in public health.

USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Public Health (Dr.P.H.) 783 http://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ PreDissertation Committee All Dr.P.H. students are admitted into the College of Public Health Dr.P.H. will be assigned a faculty advisor (see above) and a Dr.P.H. practicebased Mentor who will work with the student in forming a predissertation committee. The roles of the predissertation committee are as follows: 1. Meet with the student to discuss plan of study, practicebase specialized study, and academ ic progress. The Program of Study should include proposed time schedule to complete each course, and copies shall be given to each committee member and to the Office of Academic and Student Affairs. 2. Facilitate opportunities for strengthening leadership and manage ment skills, applied research skills and scholarly growth. 3. Administer and evaluate the qualifying exam. Dissertation Committee Successful completion of the preliminary examination advances the doctoral student to a doctoral candidate. At that time, the student will convene a Dr.P.H. Dissertation Committee. The PreDissertation Committee may continue to serve as the Dissertation Committee, although this not necessary. At this time, the student may desire to change Faculty Advisor and/or committee members. This may occur when practice, professional or research interests are more closely matched with another faculty member, the student and faculty member mutually agree that another person is more appropriate, or a faculty member is leaving the University. This action is to be appr oved by the Department Chair, the Dean of Academic and Student Affairs, and the Office of Graduate Studies. The Dissertation Committee must have a minimum of four members, which includes at least two faculty members from the College of Public Health and a public health professional or practitioner. Refer to Office of Graduate Studies guidelines for information on the chair appointed for the dissertation defense. A minimum of 9 dissertation credits is required. The roles of the dissertation committee are as follows: 1. Guide student throughout practicebased dissertation. 2. Approve written dissertation proposal through a formal oral presentati on process. 3. Provide guidance and support during dissertation 4. Evaluate dissertation through dissertation defense process. 5. Recommend an appropriate chair for the dissertation defense. Use of \"c\" in Degree Acronyms for Degree Candidates The College of Public Health does not permit students who are pursuing masters or doctoral degrees to use the degree acronym after their names and a small \"c\" for candidate. In other words students are not permitted to use MPHc, MSPHc, MHA, PhDc, or DrPHc. If students, after successfully completing all comprehensive exams (core and concentration) for the master degrees or the qualifying exam for the doctoral degree wish to put after their name the words \"master degree candidate\" or \"doctoral degree candidate*\" - we allow this. The use of the degree acronym and small \"c\" creates confusion for faculty, employers, and other individuals who are reviewing students' CVS and other materials. It creates a situation wherei n a student appears to have earned a degree when such is not the case. As a degreegranting College, we do not allow this. *Editor's note: the use of \"doctoral degree candidates\" should only be done after Admission to Doctoral Cand idacy has been processed and approved through the Office of Graduate Studies.

The diverse staff includes architecture faculty and students, research scientists, and programmer analysts. In addition, the Center has affiliated faculty or graduate students from the Department of Anthropology, Biology, Fine Arts, Geography, and Social Work. USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Architecture (M.Arch.) 790 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ Accreditation and Licensure: Applicants for architectural licensure in Florida, and most jurisdictions in the United States, normally must have: earned a professional degree from a School accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) completed the Intern Development Program (IDP) passed the Architect Registration Examination (ARE) According to the 2004 edition of the of the NAAB Conditions and Procedures:\"In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredi t ed professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit US professional degree programs in architecture, recognized two types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architec ture and the Master of Architecture. A program may be granted a sixyear, threeyear, or twoyear term of accreditation, depending on its degree of conformance with established educational standards. Masters degree programs may consist of a preprofessional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, which, when earned sequentially, comprise an ac credited professional education. However, the preprofessional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.\" Major Research Areas: Architecture and Community Design ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below.

USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Architecture (M.Arch.) 792 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ OTHER REQUIREMENTS Computers The School of Architecture and Community Design requires each student enrolled in the Advanced Design Studios level, or higher, to possess (through purchase or lease) a NOTEBOOK COMPUTER system. The notebook computer requirement allows students to conduct the majority of digital work, which is an integral aspect of advanced architectural design education and professional practice, in the design studio. The studio is the primary place for the exchange of design ideas, critique, and synthesis, and the Architecture faculty believes that the student's regular presence in the studio is critical for maximizing her or his architectural design learning. The notebook system is required in lieu of a desktop in order to address the limited design studio sp ace available to each student. The mobility of the notebook allows the student to easily and quickly transform a relatively small desk space into a variety of configurations suitable for physical modelmaking, handdrawing, handdrafting, design research, and desig n writing as well as digital drawing, modeling, and graphic design. The batterypowered notebook allows for maximum computer use within environments with limited electrical power outlets. The School will continue to maintain highpowered computer systems in the laboratory for intensive computing required for manipulating large digital models, renderings, etc. Students may begin their digital work on their laptops and, if needed, us e removable storage and network connections to transfer files to the lab systems for final development. The School provides black and white printers, color and black and white plotters, and scanners in the computer laboratory. Because the notebook computer system is an educational requirement of the School, the cost of a new computer purchase can be factored in determining a student's financial need. The student must contact the USF Office of Financial Aid (813974 4700) to request additional information and a \"Budget Adjustment for Computer Purchase\" form prior to ordering a comput er. The decision regarding a student's budget adjustment may take 68 weeks, so students are strongly encouraged to plan ahead. Only one financial aid budget adjustment up to $2,500 for a new computer can be issued during a three year period. Portfolios The faculty requires the submission of portfolios of academic work by each stude nt at two formal portfolio reviews. Students must pass these portfolio reviews in order to advance in the program. The portfolio policy can be found on the School's website. Students are advised to prepare their design work for inclusion in their portfolios at the end of each des ign semester, instead of waiting until just before the portfolio due dates. Some expense, varying widely according to reproduction technique and/or ambition, should be anticipated. Field Trips Each year students in the fall term beginning students in take a field trip to Savannah, GA. Transportation, lodging and meals ($200 300) are paid by the students. Students in design studios take field trips to such cities as New York, Boston and Chicago in the spring. The cost of these trips may be $200 600 per student. Student Work Student work, submitted to the School in satisfaction of course or degree re quirements, becomes the physical property of the School. This work may include papers, drawings, models, and other materials in either physical or electronic form. The School assumes no responsibility for safeguarding such materials. At its discretion, this School may retain, return, or discard such materials. The School will not normally discar d the materials of currently enrolled students without giving the student a chance to reclaim them. GPA of 3.00 in Design In addition to the statewide requirement that students maintain an overall grade point average(GPA) of 3.00 or better, the Architecture faculty also requires that students maintain a GPA of 3.00 or better in all design courses.

RESEARCH PROJECT: Exhibition/Orals/Written Document OTHER REQUIREMENTS A course in 20th Century Art History should have been successfully completed at the undergraduate level prior to entering the M.F.A. program. If not, new students must enroll in the USF course during the first year of graduate study. However, financial aid awards will not cover the cost of the course and it cannot be used to satisfy the 60 credits required for the M.F.A. degree. The School of Art and Art History highly recommends that all students seeking an advanced degree in Art take a minimum of one course in Electronic Media. The remainder of the program is discretionary and can be planned with the advice of the Graduate Art Advisor in its initial stages. After faculty acceptance of the s tudent's M.F.A. Proposed Research Project, a Graduate Supervisory Committee selected by the student will serve in an advisory capacity to the student for planning the rest of his/her program. DIRECTED STUDIES As part of the student's studio and discretionary electi ves, he/she may register with a faculty member under a Directed Study Contract. All M.F.A. students are required to take coursework for a grade until they have formed their Supervisory Committees. The descriptions for Directed Study are as follows: ART 6940, Selected Topics in Art, Grading option Regu lar (For a grade) , 14 credits Suitable for coursework by contract in an area in which the student has prior skill. ART 5910, Research, Grading option Regular (For a grade), 14 credits Suitable for coursework by contract in an area in which the student has little or no prior skill. ART 6907, Independent Study, Grading option S/U, 119 credits. Suitable for graduate level coursework in any area for which the student does not wish a letter grade, or which justifies more than 4 hours of credit. May be used only after the student's Supervisory Committee is formed. (See S/U Grades) ART 6911, Di rected Research, Grading option Regular (For a grade)119 credits. Suitable for graduate level coursework in any area that USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Art (M.F.A.) 795 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ justifies more than 4 hours of credit. May be used only after the student's Supervisory Committee is formed. As noted, ART 6907 and ART 6911 are not for use by M.F.A. students who have not yet established their Supervisory Committees. The other, media specific, course numbers such as Sculpture or Painting are not often used as they are fixed at 4 credit hours. When they are used it is the policy of the School that they be taken by contract. Transfer Credits Requests for use of transfer credits or credits earned under \"special\" (aka nondegree seeking) student status should be made when the student applies to the graduate program. The faculty wil l decide at the time of admission whether or not transfer credits and credits earned as a special student will be used toward the requirements for the M.F.A. degree. Transfer credit and credit earned as a special student to be used toward the students' M.F.A. degree is limited to 8 semester hours. SU GRADES A Student may not take any course work for a grade of \"S/U\" until they have elected a supervisory committee, usually by the fourth semester. All course work taken during the first three semesters must be taken in course work assigning letter grades that designate quality points. Appropriate contract num bers would include graduate level studios such as Sculpture or Painting, and ART 5910 for an area in which a graduate student did not have prior skill, or ART 6940 for studies in an area where prior skill exists but the student requires variable credit or the research does not conform to cle ar categorization by discipline. ART 6907 Independent Study offers the S/U grading option and is not to be used until after the student has elected a supervisory committee. GRADUATE SUPERVISORY COMMITTEES The Graduate Supervisory Committee consists of a chair an d two members from the Studio Art faculty. The Supervisory Committee must be approved by the MFA Program Coordinator. Exceptions only with approval of the MFA Faculty Coordinator and the Director of the School. FACULTY EVALUATIONS AT THE END OF FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD SEMESTERS At the end of the first, second and third semesters, students will receive a written evaluation from a faculty committee regarding their progress in the program based on a presentation of their work. A student receiving \"unsatisfactory\" grades for any two of these three semester evaluations will be dropped from the program. M.F.A. RESEARCH PROJECT PROPOSALS During the fourth semester students will present a proposal for their MFA Research Pr oject. The student must present a body of work and written paper supporting the student's proposed direction. If a student's proposal is satisfactory, he/she will select a graduate Supervisory Committee to oversee the realization of the research project. If a studen t's project proposal is not satisfactory, another proposal can be presented before the end of the fourth semester. If the student's proposal and reproposal are voted unsatisfactory the student will be dismissed from the program. . M.F.A. RESEARCH PROJECT EXHIBITION/ORALS/WRITTEN DOCUMENT The exhibition, written document and the orals defense conclude the student's graduate program and take place after all cours e work is completed. The exhibition is usually during the term the student plans to graduate, typically the second semester of the third year. M.F.A. Research Project exhibitions cannot be scheduled for the summer term. Information regarding the exhibition, the wri tten document and the orals defense will be distributed to students prior to the final semester.

Program Admission Requirements Departmental Requirements plus a research paper dealing directly with Art History or a related discipline (literature, political history, psychology, philosophy or classical studies). Three letters of recommendation from people who can professionally assess the applicant's ability to do scholarly and academic work. A short essay of one to two pages explaining the applicant's research interests and goal s for graduate study in art history. A personal interview by the Art History faculty may be requested. Undergraduate Deficiencies in Art History Students pursuing graduate studies in Art History, who do not have an undergraduate degree in Art Histor y wil l be expected to complete four undergraduate Art History survey courses plus two courses in critical studies. Exceptions can be granted only with consent of the Art History faculty. Language Requirements Reading knowledge of the foreign language most relevant for study and research in the student's area of specialization must be acquired before the end of the second semester of enrollment in the program. Please see the Academic Advisor for exceptions to this rule. The student may take appropriate courses in the Division of Language or Classics Program. Whenever the courses are available, the student should be encouraged to take one of the special one seme ster foreign language courses designed for graduate students. When these courses are not available, the student may take two semesters of a beginning foreign language course. These courses may not be taken pass/fail or audit. In order to fulfill the foreign language requirement, the student must receive a letter grade of \"B\" or better in both courses. Cour ses taken to fulfill the foreign language requirement will not count toward hours necessary for graduation and the grades in these courses will not be computed in the student's graduate GPA. Students may elect to take the GSFLT (Office of Graduate Studies Foreign Language Te st). The student must achieve a score of 450 or above on the test in order to fulfill the foreign language requirement. Students may take a proficiency exam in which they translate, from a foreign language into English, materials relevant to their particular disciplines. The form of these proficiency exams should be devised by the appropriate language professors from either of these two units.

A student should, if possible, have at least one graduate class in these three areas: 1) Ancient/Medieval 2) Early Modern (15th18th centuries) 3) Modern (1921st centuries). Museum experience is encouraged for all students, but course credit for museum internships is limited to those seeking a Certificate in Museum Studies. Thesis and Qualifying paper options Students either write a qualifying paper or thesis to complete the requirements of the M.A. program. Students should consult with the Coordinator of the Graduate Program and the faculty to determine which option is the best for them; the final decision rests with the faculty. For either option, a B+ average or above is required in courses taken to fulfill Program graduate credits, for students to move on to this final phase of their graduate studies. The M.A. in Art History is a twoyear program for students who attend full time, but the thesis option often takes longer to complete. Qualifying paper option Requires 8 seminars in art history (32 hours), with 8 additional hours of electives, plus 2 hours for preparing the qualifying paper (in the fourth and final semester). The qualifying paper should dem o nstrate the student's ability to do significant arthistorical research, to persuade by effective use of evidence and argument, and to write fluently and clearly. The qualifying paper will usually be a substantially revised seminar paper and should be about 1520 typed pages in length, excluding endnotes, bibliography, illustrations or other materials. Students choosing this option should form a qualifying paper committee by the end of the second semester of their first year. The Committee is composed of a major professor and a second faculty member. Members of the Committee are faculty in the School of Art and Art History, of which one must be tenured or tenureearning. The major professor will usually be the professor who oversaw the wr iting of the original seminar paper. Students pursuing this option download the relevant form at http://www.arts.usf.edu/ab solutenm/articlefiles/20 GradComApptFrm.pdf . Students are responsible for collecting committee members' signatures. The M.A. Program Coordinator must authorize all committee assignments with his/her signature When submitting drafts of the qualifying paper to committee members, students must allow faculty members two weeks to read any given version. Remember that first drafts usually have to be extensively revised, often several times, before the qualifying paper is accepted. Faculty are not normally available during the summer to read qualifying paper draft s. The qualifying paper committee must approve the qualifying paper before the student can graduate. Qualifying papers must be submitted two weeks before the last day of classes of the semester in which the student wishes to graduate. The major professor, in consultation with the other faculty member, notifies the Academic Advisor of the School of Art and Ar t History of approval of the paper before the end of the semester. If a paper is not approved, the student may revise and resubmit it a second time. It is the student's responsibility to stay abreast of Office of Graduate Studies deadlines and registration requirements in the final semester, which are available online at http://www.grad.usf.edu . Thesis option Requires six seminars in art history (24 hours), with 8 additional hours of electives, plus 6 hours of thesis writing (4 hours in the third semester and 2 hours in the fourth and final semester). Students writing the thesis should work with faculty during the second semester to begin developing potential topics . By the end of the first year, students who wish to write the thesis should decide on a thesis topic with a major professor from the art history faculty. The topic is usually related to research done in a seminar. During the following summer students prepare the thesis proposal. The proposal should define USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Art History (M.A.) 799 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ a significant research problem and explain how the topic has the potential to contribute to scholarship in the field; it must include a research plan and a critical review of the scholarly literature on the subject area. Thesis proposals will be presented to faculty and fellow graduate students in a public forum at the beginning of the third semester. Each presentation is followed by discussion, which provides an opportunity for students to receive suggestions and recommendations from faculty and peers. If the proposal is declined, the student will be eligible to pursue a Qualifying Paper. If the art history faculty approves the thesis topic, the student should form a thesis committee by the end of the seme s ter in which they have successfully proposed a thesis topic, and have thereby achieved thesis candidacy. The committee is composed of at least two members and the major professor. The major professor and at least one other committee member must be chosen from tenu red or tenureearning art history faculty, or otherwise as approved by the Coordinator of the M.A. program. Students forming the thesis committee download the relevant form at http://www.arts.usf.edu/ab solutenm/articlefiles/20 GradComApptFrm.pdf . Students are responsible for collecting committee members' signatures. The M.A. Program Coordinator must authorize all committee assignments with his/her signature. While moderate in length and considerably more limited in scope than a doctoral dissertation, the M.A. thesis must demonstrate the student's ability to do original, independent research of publishable quality. The thesis should be approximately 3540 typed pages of text - the usua l length of a journal article excluding notes, bibliography, illustrations or other materials. When submitting drafts of the thesis to committee members, students must allow faculty members two weeks to read any given version. Remember that first drafts will have to be extensively revised several times before the thesis is accepte d. Faculty are not normally available during the summer to read thesis drafts. The thesis committee must approve the final thesis before the student may schedule a date for the M.A. thesis defense. The examining committee will consist of the thesis committee and at least two additional questioners who are chos e n by the student in consultation with the thesis committee. Students should keep in mind that the questioners must also be allowed two weeks to read the draft of the thesis after it is accepted for the defense by the thesis committee. The oral defense is open to the public. No defenses are scheduled durin g the summer. Immediately after the orals, the examining committee meets to determine whether the student has passed the oral examination and whether the thesis is acceptable in its current form. NOTE: It is usually necessary to make some changes in the thesis after the oral defense. Allow at least one week between the oral exam an d the Office of Graduate Studies deadline so that you will be able to make the changes. Ideally, the student will complete the thesis and submit it in the fourth semester. It is the student's responsibility to stay abreast of Office of Graduate Studies deadline s and registration requirements in the final semester. Check with the USF Office of Graduate Studies for specific deadlines and requirements for the M.A. thesis and graduation. These are available online at http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp. All theses must be submitted electronically. Transfer of Credit There is no automatic transfer of special student cre dit or graduate credit earned at other institutions or from other graduate program in the university towards M.A. degree requirements. The School of Art and Art History has designated a six hour limit on all credit taken as special student status. Any transfer of credit or special student hours to be us ed toward M.A. degree requirements are only granted after a faculty review at the time the student has been accepted into the M.A. program.

USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Section 26 Graduate Course Information 816 http://www.grad.usf.edu/ Section 26 Graduate Course Information To view the Course Listing with Course Descriptions, see next section or refer to the websites: USF Course Inventory: website: http://scns.fldoe.org/sc ns/public/pb_inst_dtl.jsp Courses offered for credit by the University of South Florida are listed with the program or college that offers them. The first line of each description includes the State Common Course prefix and number (see below), title of the course, and number of credits. Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numbers were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System. This common numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating non public institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Each participating institution cont rols the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). The list of course prefixes and numbers, along with their generic titles, is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course details.\" Courses are created using the State Course wide Numbering System (SCNS). The following information is from the SCNS Handbook. For more information visit their website at: http://scns.fldoe.org/scn s /public/pb_index.jsp# The SCNS uses a course designation which consists of a threeletter prefix and a four digit number and, when necessary, a oneletter laboratory (L) or lecture/laboratory (C) suffix. Example: SCNS COURSE ID AML Content Suffix Explanation: AML 6017, Studies in American Literature to 1860 American Studies course taught at the graduate level (no lab). A level code, which roughly corresponds to the year in college the course is normally taken (i.e., masters, doctoral, etc.), is placed between the course prefix and the cours e number. The level is recommended by the institution according to its own USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Section 26 Graduate Course Information 817 policies and the policies of the State of Florida, and approved by the faculty committee. The level digit does not affect course equivalency - course equivalency is determined by the prefix and the last three digits . The following are the level definitions: 0 PSAV, college prep, vocational prep 12 Lowerlevel undergraduate 34 Upperlevel undergraduate 59 Graduate and Professional (see definitions on the next page) Courses are numbered based on content, rather than by department or program. This means that a single program may have courses in several different disciplines and may consist of courses having several different prefixes. Glossary of Cou rse Description Terms Credits separated by a colon indicate concurrent lecture and laboratory courses taught as a unit: PHY 3040, 3040L PHYSICS AND LAB (3:1) Credits separated by a comma indicate unified courses offered in different semesters: AMH 2010, 2020 AMERICAN HISTORY I, II (4, 4) Credits separated by a hyphen indicate variable credi t: MAT 7912 DIRECTED RESEARCH Var. The following abbreviations are used in various course descriptions: G Graduate PR Prerequisite CI With the consent of the instructor CC With the consent of the chairperson of the department or program CR Corequisite Lec Lecture Lab Laboratory Dem Demonstration Pro Proble m Dis Discussion ML Master's Level GS Graduate Standing Rpt May be repeated UL Upper leve l S/U No grade, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Only Graduate Course Level Variance Definitions It is expected that the 5000 60007000 courses will have distinct syllabi demonstrating different depth and breadth of the subject matter as reflected in the course requirements. The courses presuppose different audiences, and the intention is to offer them at distinct levels. 5000 5999 Typically Intro ductory Graduate Level Courses 6000 6999 Typically Master's level Courses 7000 7999 Typically Doctoral level Courses The University reserves the right to substitute, not offer, and add courses and programs that are listed in this catalog. USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Section 26 Graduate Course Information 818 Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code (first digit) Century Digit (second digit) Decade Digit (third digit) Unit Digit (fourth digit) Lab Code SYG 1 0 1 0 Sociology, General Freshman Level at this institution Entrylevel General Sociology Survey Course Social Problems No lab in this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions. (Exceptions are listed below.) For example, a survey course in social problems is offered by 34 different posts e condary institutions. Each institution uses \"SYG_010\" to identify its social problems course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"SYG\" means \"Sociology, General,\" the century Sociology,\" the decade digit \"1\" represents Course,\" and the unit digit \"0\" represents \"Social Problems.\" In science and other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a cours e, having the same prefix and course number without a lab indicator, which may meet at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the rece iving institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, SYG 1010 is offered at a community college while the same course is offered at a state university as SYG 2010. A student who has succes sfully completed SYG 1010 at the community college is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for SYG 2010 at the state university upon transfer. The student cannot be required to take SYG 2010 again since SYG 1010 is equivalent to SYG 2010. Transfer credit must be awarded for succ essfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed which have not been designated as equivalent. The Cour se Prefix The course prefix is a threeletter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or sub category of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the prefix designation. Authority for Ac ceptance of Equivalent Courses State Board of Education Rule 6A10.024(19), Florida Administrative Code, reads: When a student transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the common course designation and nu mbering system, the receiving institution shall award credit for courses satisfactorily completed at the previous participating institutions when the courses are judged by the appropriate common course designation and numbering system faculty task forces to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic cont rol of the previous institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the course numbering system. Credits so awarded shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptio ns to the Ge neral Rule for Equivalency The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution: Courses in the 900999 series(e.g., HUM 2905) Internships, practica, clinical experiences, and study abroad cours es Performance or studio cours es in Art, Dance, Theater, and Music USF Graduate Catalog 2014 2015 Section 26 Graduate Course Information 819 Skills courses in Criminal Justice Graduate courses Courses not offered by the receiving institution College preparatory and vocational preparatory course may not be used to meet degree requirements and are not transferable. Questions about the Statewide Course Numbering System and appeals regarding course credit transfer decisions should be directed to Undergraduate Studies (for questions pertaining to graduate and undergrad uate courses) or the Florida Department of Education, Office of Articulation, 1401 Turlington Building, Tallahassee, Florida 323990400.
