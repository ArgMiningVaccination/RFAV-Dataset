Arrangements should be made to obtain medications prior to arriving on campus and again while on breaks or by other means. Second Option Obtain a new provider in the NYC area to continue/transfer care from your original physician or to initiate care with a new provider if you are seeking an evaluation to investigate whether you have or need treatment for ADHD/ADD.

Please contact your medical insurance company about coverage benefits for testing, treatment and physician coverage for this disorder. Testing centers often have waiting lists for evaluations and the results can take 4-8 weeks. In Certain Cases Obtain prescriptions from FIT Health Services.

Required Documents All of the following documentations are required before prescriptions for ADHD/ADD can be administered by FIT Health Services: - A summary on a physicians letter head that includes diagnosis, date of diagnosis, length of treatment with medications for this diagnosis and a plan of care clearly describing medication management and other treatment modalities to be carried out. - A summary of behavioral testing and/or neuro-psychiatric testing from within the last 4 years, that is an accepted gold standard test for evaluating and diagnosing ADHD/ADD. This must include the name of the testing performed, the date of evaluation and a summary of the results. - A summary of a plan of care will have to be provided from the current managing physician each calendar year moving forward in order to continue receiving medication prescriptions from FIT Health Services.

We offer free acupuncture to all students by appointment only (no walk-ins). You are only able to schedule one appointment at a time. These appointments are limited and run out quickly. We please ask students who need to cancel their acupuncture appointment to notify the Health Services at least 24 hours in advance by calling (212) 217-4190. What is acupuncture? Acupuncture is a Chinese therapy that has been used for centuries and is based on the idea that energy called chi flows through your body. Illness may block the flow of chi and acupuncturists believe that acupuncture unblocks and rebalances the flow of chi to improve health. To do this, tiny needles are used to stimulate specific areas of the body. Who should get acupuncture? People use acupuncture to relieve pain and treat certain health conditions, including: - Lower back pain - Headaches - Menstrual Cramps - Asthma - Dental pain - Osteoarthritis - Fibromyalgia - Myofascial pain Is it safe? Yes, when given by a trained, licensed practitioner, such as our provider at FIT Health Services. The needles are sterile, nontoxic and used only once. What does it feel like? Acupuncture needles are hair-thin. Most people feel no pain. Some people are energized by treatment, others are relaxed. We offer free massage therapy to all students by appointment only (no walk-ins). You are able to schedule one appointment at a time. These appointments are limited and run out quickly. We please ask students who need to cancel their massage therapy appointment to notify the Health Services at least 24 hours in advance by calling (212) 217-4190. What is Massage Therapy? Medical massage therapy can help students who suffer from ailments relating to sports injuries, arthritis, muscle pain or circulatory problems. Our massage therapist employs techniques applied to the muscular structure and soft tissues such as kneading, stroking, tapping, compression, and pressure to reduce stress and fatigue and improve circulation to aid in muscle health recovery. If you have any chronic issues, please consult with a healthcare provider at Health Services in order to create a care plan specialized for you. Before Your Appointment - Make sure it is a good time for you to have a massage. Reschedule your visit if have a fever, skin irritations (such as poison ivy or sunburn), or if you are trying to stabilize your medication (because massage can affect the dosage needed). - In the days before your massage, drink plenty of water. - Do not eat just before your massage. Consume a meal no less than an hour prior to your massage. If needed, a small snack prior to you massage is manageable. - Give yourself enough time to arrive on time and relax.
