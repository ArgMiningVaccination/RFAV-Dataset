The history of medicine shows how societies have changed and developed their approach to illness and disease....", "sitename": "ipl.org", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "civilization raised or how the people lived? How they regulated their lands? Or what they used to eat? Etc. One of the aspects that many people are curious about is the old-world medicine, how ancient people dealt with illnesses and how they treated their patients? As for the American civilization, the most recorded advanced medicine was in the Aztec's empire. The Aztec's Empire was the most powerful Mesoamerican kingdom of old ages. In fact, their culture was full of creativity with a combination of methodology and religious tradition. They arrived in the Valley of Mexico in 1325C.E, and their name means Aztlan people, where they were originally from. In fact, The Elizabethan time period was from 1558 through 1603 known as the Renaissance. During the Renaissance there was not any running water, so people would have to throw their waste in the streets. With people's waste in the street came many illnesses including The Plague. Even a minor scrap could kill you in the next minute. When people got sick they needed medicine, physicians, and health care. In the late 1500 there was not a great deal medican, there was mostly just spiritual analysis. Owning the complete collection of Grey's Anatomy may make someone feel like an expert of the medical field, but when it comes down to knowing the diseases that were common during other periods of time, that understanding seems to be very limited. While diseases like the common cold have been around for a long time, there are many staple diseases that have shaped the medical field and the foundation for medicine today that need to be known. To fully understand diseases during the Elizabethan era, it is vital to understand the cause, type, and treatment of the illnesses that were common during that time period. Medicine during the Elizabethan Era was extremely basic. The knowledge most people had about medicine came from their ancestors through many generations. The Elizabethan Era was a time when terrible illnesses such as the Black Plague were killing nearly one-third of the population. The cause of many illnesses during this time was lack of sanitation. Back then, women played a major role in medicine. They often nursed the sick using home remedies that were passed down from generation to generation. Doctors are prominent figures in many aspects of the world. They influence not only science, but history, math, art, religion, and even to politics. Horace Newton Allen was a medical missionary who went to Korea. Not only did he save thousand of lives, including those of a prince, but had managed to connect two countries, America and Korea. Horace first practiced his medical skills after gapsinjeongbyeon, when Prince Min Young Ik was badly injured. Horace was able to cure him with his westen medicine. This influence Horace to introduced westen medicine to Koreans, which resulted in saving over many lives. Aside from medicine, Koreans were not familier with western culture, technology, or science. With the help of Horace, Koreans were able to bulid mines for gold, silver, and coal, develop an electric and steam railroad, and a waterway system. Horace's effort did not end there, he tried to pursuade Americans that Korea was a country of potential and wanted American businesses to take interest. If the American buinesses were to take interest of Korea, Koreans would be able to grow more of their modern technology and raist their financial status. As a result of Horace's efforts, American businesses began to take intrest in Korea, and Korea was able to advance in their overall finace and On September 16, 1862, Daniel M. Holt M.D. wrote to his wife, \"Shortly [we encountered] a rebel with his brains blown out, arms extended, and eyes protruding from their sockets, some not yet dead but grasping the few remaining breaths away in utter unconsciousness, others mortally wounded calling for water knowing that eternity was separated only by a hair's breadth...I have seen what I never once expected I should see.\" Dr. Holt of the 121st New York Army further describes the carnage and horror that he and countless other Civil War surgeons encountered in letters and journals written during his experience in the war. While working during a time described by Surgeon General William Hammond as \"the end of the Medical Middle Ages,\" it was inevitable When I think of a physician and their characters I immediately think of the traits listed in this honor code. A physician must be responsible and diligent. They must be able to be honest and responsible enough to put their patient 's best interest as a top priority. When I started working at the Hunt Regional Medical Center I took a HIPPA regulation class and took it very seriously. I was very careful not to share any information about any patient that I might have seen during my volunteer work or shadowing. An experience that really showed me how important the privacy of the patient is was my volunteer work trip to Egypt. I shadowed and worked with a general surgeon. I remember how very different it was from all my other volunteer work. I learned In Mesopotamia, there was a king by the name of Hammurabi. He believed in a strict set of laws. Some people say the set of laws were very unfair, but some people believed that it was fair and it was the right thing to have. The reason why people thought it was fair was that every crime had a punishment so it kept people from stealing or injuring people ( an eye for an eye), it made surgery a lot more careful because of the consequences if the doctor wasn't careful, and In order to become a doctor, a person needs to become licensed in the medical profession. As the book states, to perform surgeries or any other medical duties, the person needs to acquire a license from the licensing board. The licensing system allows doctors to protect themselves regarding their job, salary and even from patients that might take advantage from them. The system also creates a sense of \"security\" towards patients, because someone who is certified is examining them. According to the book, AMA is a powerful political body that was founded to enforce good medical practices. The organization restricts the amount of annual licenses in order to maintain doctor's high salary and high orrison's women oriented approach of folk healing is countered in A Mercy, through the character of the blacksmith, a free black man having knowledge of folk medicine. He is serving as a catalyst in the development of the plot of the novel. He has cured Sorrow from the deadly disease of small pox, during his stay at Jacob Vaark'splace for constructing a fancy gate for his new building. He is invited again to the household of Jacob, when Rebekka becomes the victim of small pox.is the not his skill as a craftsman but the healing power that has made the women in the family after the death of Jacob Vaark to depend on him. Rebekka's sickness is fetching danger to the security of the \"three unmastered women\" and \"belonging to no one, became wild game for anyone\" (56). Lina feared that the death of their mistress will make them more vulnerable as \"female and illegal, they would be interpolers, squatters, it they stayed on after Mistress died, subject to purchase, hire, assault, abduction, exile\" (56). Even Rebekka also realised in her illnessthat \"the smithy's value was without price when he cured Sorrow of whatever has struck her down\" and in her deathbed prayed God to enable Florens to find out the blackman so that \"he could repeat that miracle(95).His seconding coming was Medicine is civilizing every day. It helps people stay healthy, strong, and able to live good lives. Medicine helps people who have, for example, Type One Diabetes live and have a good life. It makes people who have blood disorders, which are lethal, live and have normal lives. Modern medicine is not like how it was to be. Greece and Rome, two ancient societies, both influenced many aspects of modern life. Their advancements were utilized in many later cultures. They influenced almost every part of today's world, such as government, language, and architecture, as well as making scientific advancements. Also, the successes of these two civilizations lead to many countries modeling most of their public facilities and systems after the ones found in Greece and Rome. Culture refers to the unified forms of philosophies and human behaviors pooled within a particular society. These unified forms classify adherents as part of an assemblage and extricate adherents from other assemblages. It includes the language, religion, sexual orientation, upbringing, life experience, geographical origin, ethnicity and assemblage history. Each culture has beliefs concerning health, disease, treatment and health care providers (https://www.kidsnewtocanada.ca/culture/influence). There were many civilizations that had technology that impacted their world in various manners. I will be looking at four different civilizations, specifically: Egyptians, Chinese, Romans, and The Incas. Some of the Technology in medicine they created is still used today and was very innovative in their time. Byzantine architecture was evolved from Early Christian architecture. For example, Early Christian style architecture had basilicas (churches) with three or five isles, but Byzantine style architecture rarely used three to five isles. Byzantines used domes and vaults frequently, unlike the Early Christian style architecture who rarely used domes. To keep the highest domes upright, the Byzantines used pendentive. Pendentive supports the dome using four triangle legs sitting on a square base. In the 6th century reign, with the emperor Justinian I, Byzantine architecture became a distinctive style "}
