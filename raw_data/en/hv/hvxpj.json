Section B - Issuer B.1 Legal name and commercial name of the Issuer: Sanofi B.2 Domicile and legal form of the Issuer, the legislation under which the Issuer operates and its country of incorporation: Sanofi was incorporated under the laws of France in 1994 as a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme, a form of limited liability company, for a term of 99 years. Its registered office is located at 54 rue La Bo\u00e9tie 75008 Paris, France. Sanofi operates under the laws of France. B.4b Trends: Sanofi has developed a new strategic r oadmap, announced on 6 November 2015. The Group will continue to be a global healthcare company focused on disease prevention and treatment. The strategic roadmap has four pillars, namely reshape the portfolio, deliver outstanding launches, sustain innovation in R&D , and simplify the or ganization: To reshape the portfolio, Sanofi has segmented its businesses focusing on three targets: to sustain leadership, build competitive positions, and explore strategic options. Sanofi is on track to deliver up to 18 new products to the market by 2020. Sanofi has focused the organization on six major product launches among the 18, namely Toujeo\u00ae, Praluent\u00ae, strengthen its R&D pipeline, increasing the number of high-quality projects in the early -stage pipeline and replenishing the late-development pipeline as products launch. Sanofi expect s to increase its R&D investments up to \u20ac6 billion annually by 2020. The final strategic priority is to drive focus and simplification within the organization of the Group. As of 1 January 2016, Sanofi created: five Global Business Units (GBUs, namely General Medicines & Emerging Markets ; Speciality Care; Diabetes & Cardiovascular; Sanofi Pasteur and Merial); Centralized global functions, aligned with the GBUs; and t he aligned R&D organization. Full implementation of the new organizational structure remains subject to ongoing negotiations with labor unions/employee representatives. Sanofi expects the decline caused by generic competition to continue in 2016, with a negative impact on net income. In 2015, the consolidated net sales of these products in countries where generic competition currently exists or is expected in 2016 amounted to \u20ac4,411 million; this comprises \u20ac873 million in the United States (including \u20ac723 million in net sales of Renage l\u00ae/Renvela\u00ae); \u20ac2,230 million in Europe (including \u20ac909 million in net sales of Lovenox\u00ae); and \u20ac1,308 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 3 - 36-40620607 million in Japan (including \u20ac94 million in net sales of Aprovel\u00ae). The negative impact from generics entering the market on 2016 net sales is likely to rep resent a substantial proportion of this amount, but the actual impact will depend on a number of factors such as the actual launch dates of generic products in 2016, the prices at which they are sold, and potential litigation outcomes. B.5 The Group and t he Issuer's position within the Group: The Issuer is the holding company of a consolidated group of subsidiaries.

Indiquer quand 36-40620607 RISK FACTORS The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under Notes issued under the Programme. All of these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to e xpress a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring. Factors which the Issuer believes may be material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with Notes issued under the Programme are also described below. The Issuer believe s that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in Notes issued under the Programme. Prospective investors should however read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Base Prospectus (including any document s incorporated by reference herein), reach their own views prior to making any investment decision as investors may lose the value of their entire investment or part of it and should consult with their own professional advisers if they consider necessary. In addition to the risks listed herein, Sanofi may be subject to other material risks that are not currently known to it. 1. Risk Factors relating to Sanofi A Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters Sanofi relies on its patents and proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of its products , and if such patents and other rights were limited or circumvented, its financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Through patent and other pro prietary rights such as data exclusivity or supplementary protection certificates in Europe, Sanofi holds exclusivity rights for a number of its research -based products. However, the protection that Sanofi is able to obtain varies in its duration and scope from product to product and country to country. This protection may not be sufficient to maintain effective product exclusivity because of local differences in the patents, in national laws or applicable leg al systems, or developments in law or jurisprudence, which may give rise to inconsistent judgments when Sanofi assert s or defend s its patents. Moreover, patent and other proprietary rights do not always provide effective protection for its products. Manuf acturers of generic products or biosimilars are increasingly seeking to challenge patent validity or coverage before the patent expire s, and manufacturers of biosimilars or interchangeable versions of the products are seeking to have their version of the p roduct approved before the exclusivity period ends. Furthermore, in an infringement suit against a third party, Sanofi may not prevail and the decision rendered may not consider that its patent or other proprietary rights are valid, enforceable or infringe d. The competitors may also successfully avoid patents, for example, through design innovation, and Sanofi may not hold sufficient evidence of infringement to bring suit. In certain cases, to terminate or avoid patent litigation, Sanofi or its partners ma y be required to obtain licenses from the holders of third -party intellectual property rights that cover aspects of its existing and future products in order to manufacture, use and/or sell them. Any payments under these licenses may reduce Sanofi's profit s from such products and Sanofi may not be able to obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all. Third parties may also request a preliminary injunction in a coun try from a court of law to prevent Sanofi from marketing a product if they consider that Sanofi infringes their patent rights in the country. If they obtain a preliminary or permanent injunction from a court of law or if Sanofi fails to obtain a required license for a country where the valid third -party intellectual property right , as confirm ed by a court of law, exists or are unable to alter the design of its technology to fall outside the scope of third -party intellectual property rights, Sanofi may be unable to market some of its products in certain countries, which may limit the profitabil ity of Sanofi . Also, some countries may consider granting a compulsory license to a third party to use patents protecting an innovator's product, which limits the protection granted to such products. Sanofi is involved in litigation worldwide to enforce certain of its patent rights against generics, proposed generics and biosimilars of its small molecule and biological pharmaceutical products (see \"Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - Infor mation on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\" of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F for additional information). Even in cases where Sanofi ultimately prevail s in an infringement claim, legal remedies available for harm caused to Sanofi by infringing produc ts may be inadequate to make Sanofi whole. A 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 23- 36-40620607 competitor may launch a generic or a biosimilar product \"at risk\" before the initiation or completion of the court proceeding s, and the court may decline to grant Sanofi a preliminary injunction to halt further \"at risk\" sales and remove the infringing product from the market. Additionally, while Sanofi would be entitled to obtain damages in such a case, the amount that Sanofi may ultimately be awarded and able to collect may be insufficient to compensate all har m caused to it. A successful result against a competing product for a given patent or in a specific country is not necessarily predictive of the future success of Sanofi against another competing product or in another country because of local variations in the patents and patent laws. Sanofi has increased the proportion of biological therapeutics in its pipeline relative to traditional small molecule pharmaceutical produ cts. Sanofi expect s to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. With the accelerated regulatory pathways provided in the U.S. and Europe for biosimilar drug approval, biosimilars can be a threat to the exclusiv ity of any biological thera peutics Sanofi sells or may market in the future and can pose the same issues as the small molecule generic threat described hereinabove. Governments may adopt more permissive approval frameworks (for example, shortening the duration of data exclusivity, o r narrowing the scope of new products receiving data exclusivity) which could allow competitors to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars including as a substitutable product, increasing competition for the products of the Group (see also \"Chang es in the laws or regulations that apply to Sanofi could affect the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition\"). If a biosimilar version of one of Sanofi's products were approved, it could reduce the sales of that product. However, w ith Sanofi's presence as a manufacturer of generics and anticipated entry into biosimilars, Sanofi will utilize patent challenge strategies against other innovators' patents, similar to those of long -established generic companies, but there is no assurance that these strategies will be successful. If Sanofi's patents and/or proprietary rights to its products were limited or circumvented, its financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanof i's business, results of operations and financial condition. Product liability is a significant risk for any pharmaceutical company, and the Group's product liability exposure could increase given that liability claims relating to its businesses may differ with regards to their nature, scope and level, from the types of product liability claims that Sanofi have handled in the past. Substantial damage awards and/or settlements have bee n handed down - notably in the United States and other common law jurisdic tions - against pharmaceutical companies based on claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. Such claims can also be accompanied by consumer fraud claims by customers or third -party payers seeking reimbursement of the cost of the pr oduct. Sanofi is currently defending a number of product liability claims (See Note D.22.a) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F) and there can be no assurance that the Group will be successfu l in defending against these claims or will not face additional claims in the future. Often, the side effect profile of pharmaceutical drugs cannot be fully established based on preapproval clinical studies involving only several hundred to several thousa nd patients. Routine review and analysis of the continually growing body of post-marketing safety surveillance and clinical trials provide additional information - for example, potential evidence of rare, population -specific or long -term adverse reactions or of drug interactions that were not observed in preapproval clinical studies - and may cause product labeling to evolve, including restrictions of therapeutic indications, new contraindications, warnings or precautions, and occasionally even the suspensi on or withdrawal of a product marketing authorization. Following a recall or a withdrawal, pharmaceutical companies can face significant product liability claims. Furthermore, Sanofi commercialize s several devices (some of which use new technologies) which, if they malfunction, could cause unexpected damage and lead to product liability claims (see \" - Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could re sult in financial, legal, business or reputational harm.\"). Although Sanofi continue s to insure a portion of its product liability with third -party carriers, product liability coverage is increasingly difficult and costly to obtain, particularly in the Un ited States. In the future, it is possible that self -insurance may become the sole commercially reasonable means available for managing the product liability financial risk of the Group's pharmaceutical and vaccines businesses. In cases where Sanofi self-insure s, the legal costs that Sanofi would bear for handling such claims and potential indemnifications to be paid to claimants could have a negative impact on its financial condition. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 24- 36-40620607 Due to insurance conditions, even when the Group has insurance coverage , recoveries from insurers may not be totally successful. Moreover, insolvency of an insurer could affect Sanofi's ability to recover claims on policies for which it has already paid a premium. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or the u ltimate success of the Group's defense, are costly, divert management's attention, may harm Sanofi's reputation and can impact the demand for its products. Substantial product liability claims could materially adversely affect its business, results of oper ations and financial condition. Sanofi's products and manufacturing facilities are subject to significant government regulations and approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to its business if Sanofi fails to anticipate the regulations , comply with them and/ or maintain the relevant approvals. Obtaining marketing authorization is a long and highly regulated process requiring Sanofi to present extensive documentation and data to the regulatory authorities. Regulatory proce sses differ from one authority to another. Either at the time of the filing of the application for a marketing authorization or later during its review, each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements which can evolve over time, including requiri ng local clinical studies, and may delay or refuse to grant approval, even though a product has already been approved in another country. Health authorities are increasingly focusing on product safety and on the risk/benefit profile of pharmaceuticals pro ducts. In particular, the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) and the EMA (European Medicines Agency) have increased their requirements, particularly in terms of the volume of data needed to demonstrate a product's efficacy and safe ty. Even af ter regulatory approval, marketed products are subject to continual review, risk evaluations or comparative effectiveness studies including post -marketing studies to which Sanofi has committed as a condition of approval. In addition, following the implemen tation of European pharmacovigilance legislation in 2012, the Company and the European Regulatory Agencies (under the supervision of the PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee)) have reinforced their systematic and intensive safety signal detect ion systems, which may detect safety issues even with mature products that have been on the ma rket for considerable time. These system s may result in additional market authorization suspensions or withdrawals. All of these requirements have increased the c osts associated with maintaining regulatory approvals and achieving reimbursement for Sanofi's products. Post -regulatory approval reviews and data analyses can lead to the issuance of recommendations by government agencies, health professional and patient or other specialized organizations regarding the use of products; for example, a recommendation to limit the patient scope of a drug's indication, impose marketing restrictions, or suspend or withdraw the product can result in a reduction in sales volume, as well as an increased risk of litigation. Moreover, to monitor Sanofi's compliance with applicable regulations, the FDA, the EMA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions routinely conduct inspections of the Group's facilities and may identify potential deficiencies. Sanofi has received FDA warning l etters in the past following the inspection of some of its facilities and may receive such letters in the future. If Sanofi fails to adequately respond to warning letters identifying a deficiency following an inspection, or fail s to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at all or within the targeted timeline, it could be subject to enforcement, remedial and/or punitive actions by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, in order to comply with the duty to report adverse safety signals to regulatory authorities, Sanofi must regularly train its employees and third parties (such as external sales forces and distributor employees) on regulatory matters. If Sanofi fails to train these people, or fail s to train them appropriately, it may be exposed to the risk that safety events are not reported or not reported in a timely manner in breach of its reporting obligations. To the extent that new regulations raise the costs of obtaining and maintaining product authorizations, or limit the economic value of a new product to its originator, the growth pro spects of the industry and of the Group would be diminished. Approximately 65% of the current development portfolio of the Group consists of biological products that may in the future bring new therapeutic responses to current unmet medical needs, but that may also lead to more regulatory and technical constraints and/or costly investments from an industrial standpoint as biological products are complex to produce. These constraints and costs could adversely affect the business, results of operations and fi nancial condition of the Group . Claims and investigations relating to compliance, competition law, marketing practices, pricing and other legal matters, could adversely affect the Group 's business, results of operations and financial condition. The marketing of Sanofi's products is heavily regulated. The Group's business covers an extremely wide range of activities worldwide and involves numerous partners. Sanofi has adopted a Code of Ethics that calls for employees to comply with applicable legi slation and regulations, as well as with the specific values and rules of conduct set forth in that Code. Sanofi also 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 25- 36-40620607 has policies and procedures designed to help ensure that Sanofi , its employees, officers, agents, intermediaries and other third parties c omply with applicable laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, the OECD Anti -Bribery Convention and other anti -bribery laws and regulations). Notwithstanding these efforts, deviations may occur and there can be no assurance that Sanofi , its officers and/or its directors will not face liability under laws and regulations for actions taken with respect to its business. Any failure to comply directly or indirectly (including as a result of a business partner's breach) with the laws and regulations applicable to Sanofi could lead to substantial liabilities and harm the Group's reputation. Governments and regulatory authorities around the world have been strengthening enforcement activities in recent yea rs. Sanofi and certain of its subsidiaries are under investigation or could become the subject of additional investigations by various government entities and are defending a number of lawsuits relating to antitrust and/or pricing and marketing practices ( including, for example, in the United States, class action lawsuits and whistleblower litigation). The Group also faces significant litigation and government investigations or audits, including allegations of securities law violations, corruption, claims r elated to employment matters, patent and intellectual property disputes, consumer law claims and tax audits. See \"Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\" and Note D.22. to Sanofi's consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F. Responding to such investigations is costly and distracts management's attention from the business. Unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters, or in similar matters to be faced in the future, could preclude the commercialization of products, harm Sanofi's reputation, negatively affect the profitability of existing products and subject Sanofi to substantial fines (including t reble damages), punitive damages, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, potentially leading to the imposition of additional regulatory controls or exclusion from government reimbursement programs or markets, and could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial conditions. These risks may encourage Sanofi to enter into settlement agreements and those settlements may involve significant monetary payments and/or criminal penalties and may include admissio ns of wrongdoing. Settlement of healthcare fraud cases in the United States may require companies to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement, which is intended to regulate company behavior for a specified period of years. For example in 2015 Sanofi entered into such an agreement as part of settlements relating to its Seprafilm\u00ae and Hyalgan\u00ae products (each agreement runs for five years with effect from 2 September 2015). Changes in the laws or regulations that apply to Sanofi could affect the Group 's business, results of operations and financial condition. All aspects of Sanofi's business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, pricing or sales are subject to extensive legislation and regulation. Changes in applicable laws, or in their application, could have a material adverse effect on Sanofi's business. For example, governmental authorities are increasingly looking to facilitate generic and biosimilar competition to existing products through new regulatory proposals intended t o achieve, or resulting in, changes to the scope of patent or data exclusivity rights and use of accelerated regulatory pathways for generic and biosimilar drug approvals. Such regulatory proposals could make patent prosecution for new products more diffic ult and time consuming or could adversely affect the exclusivity period for Sanofi's products (see \" Sanofi relies on its patents and proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of its products, and if such patents and other rights were limited or circumvented, its financial results could be materially and adversely affected\" above). This new competitive environment and potential regulatory changes may further limit the exclusivity enjoyed by innovative products on the market and direct ly impact pricing and reimbursement levels, which may adversely affect Sanofi's business and future results. In addition, changes in the various tax laws of the jurisdictions where affiliates of the Group operate, or changes in their application, with res pect to matters such as tax rates, transfer pricing, dividends, controlled companies or a restriction in certain forms of tax relief, could affect Sanofi's effective tax rate and its future results. For example, both the OECD's initiative on Base Erosion a nd Profits Shifting (BEPS) and the European Union's initiative on the Code of Conduct for Business Taxation could lead to significant changes to tax laws and regulations in the future. Additionally, due to the complexity of the fisca l environment, the ulti mate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or lesser than amounts accrued. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 26- 36-40620607 For information regarding risks related to changes in environmental rules and regulations, see \" - Environmental liabilities and costs related to compliance w ith applicable regulations may have a significant adverse effect on Sanofi's results of operations\" below. Risks Relating to Sanofi's Business Sanofi's research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing its product portfolio. Discovering and developing a new product is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. To be successful in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, Sanofi must commit substantial resources each year to research and development in order to develop new products to compensate for the decreasing sales of its products facing expiry of patents and regulatory data exclusivity or competition from new products of competitors that are perceived as being superior. In 2015, Sanofi spent \u20ac5,259 million on research and development, amounting to 14.2% of its aggregate net sales. Sanofi's industry is driven by the need for constant innovation, but Sanofi may spread itself across too many areas of inquiry to be successful and may not be able to improve internal researc h productivity sufficiently to sustain its pipeline. Sanofi may also not invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, and product classes to build a robust pipeline and fulfill u nmet medical needs. Fields of discovery, in particular biotech nology are highly competitive and characterized by significant and rapid technological changes. Numerous companies are working on the same targets and a product considered as promising at the very beginning may become less attractive if a competitor addres sing the same unmet need reaches the market earlier. The research and development process can take up to 15 years from discovery to commercial product launch. This process is conducted in various stages in order to test, along with other features, the eff ectiveness and safety of a product. There can be no assurance that any of these product candidates will be proven safe or effective. Accordingly, there is a substantial ris k at each stage of development, including clinica l studies, that Sanofi will not ach ieve its goals of safety and/or efficacy and that Sanofi will have to abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts and human resources, even in late stage development (Phase III). Decisions concerning the studies to be carried out can hav e a significant impact on the marketing strategy for a given product. Multiple in -depth studies can demonstrate that a product has additional benefits, facilitating the product's marketing, but such studies are expensive and time consuming and may delay th e product's submission to health authorities for approval. Sanofi's ongoing investments in new product launches and research and development for future products could therefore result in increased costs without a proportionate increase in revenues, which w ould negatively affect its operating results. Sanofi has up to 18 new medicines and vaccines on track to arrive on the market between 2014 -2020, including six key launches (Toujeo\u00ae, Praluent\u00ae, Dengvaxia\u00ae, sarilumab, LixiLan and dupilumab). However, there can be no assurance that all of these products will be ap proved, or with the targeted indications, and/or within the expected timeline, or that, if approved, they will achieve commercial success.Following each product marketing approval, the medical need served by the product and the corresponding reimbursement are evaluated by governmental agencies and/or third party payers, requiring in some cases additional studies, including comparative studies, which may both effectively delay marketing of the new product and add to its development costs. After marketing app roval of Sanofi's products other companies, or investigators whether independently or with Sanofi's authorization, may conduct studies or analysis beyond its control that may ultimately report results negatively affecting Sanofi's sales either permanently or temporarily and it may take time for Sanofi to address the reported findings, leading among other things to a material adverse impact on sales. The pricing and reimbursement of Sanofi's products is increasingly affected by decisions of governments and other third parties and cost reduction initiatives. The commercial success of Sanofi's existing products and its product candidates depends in part on their pricing and the conditions under which Sanofi's products are reimbursed. Sanofi's products continu e to be subject to increasing price and reimbursement pressure due inter alia to: price controls imposed by governments in many countries; removal of a number of drugs from government reimbursement schemes (for example products determined to be less cost-effective than alternatives); increased difficulty in obtaining and maintaining satisfactory drug reimbursement rates; increase in cost co ntainment policies related to health expenses in a context of economic slowdown; 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 27- 36-40620607 governmental and private health care provider policies that favor prescription of generic medicines or substitution of branded products with generic medicines; more demanding evaluation criteria applied by Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies when considering whether to cover new drugs at a certain price level; more governments using international reference pricing to set the price of drugs based on international compari sons; and aggressive pricing strategies by some of Sanofi's competitors. In addition to the pricing pressures they exert, governmental and private third -party payers and purchasers of pharmaceutical products may reduce volumes of sales by restricting acc ess to formularies (including exclusive formulary) or otherwise discouraging physicians from prescribing Sanofi's products. In the United States, price is increasingly important to managed care organizations (MCOs) and as the MCOs grow in size following ma rket consolidation, competition among pharmaceutical companies to have their product included in the formulary is aggressive. For example, for Lantus\u00ae, since 2014, Sanofi has increased the level of rebates granted in order to maintain favorable formulary p ositions with key paye rs in the United States. Exclusion of one of Sanofi's drugs from a formulary can significantly reduce sales in the MCO patient population. Also in the United States, the federal health care reform law is increasing the government's r ole with respect to price, reimbursement, and coverage levels for healthcare services and products within the large government healthcare sector. This law also imposed cost containment measures and rebates and fees on pharmaceutical companies and current f ederal budget proposals would impose further restrictions on pricing and reimbursement. In addition, some U.S. states are considering legislation that would influence the marketing and prices of, and access to, drugs. U.S. federal and state officials will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform implementation in the future. Sanofi encounter s similar cost containment issues in countries outside the United States. In certain countries, including countries in the European Union, China and Canada, the co verage of prescription drugs, pricing and levels of reimbursement are subject to governmental control. For example, in Europe various authorities are developing the use of tenders for expensi ve products and are considering joint procurement mechanisms to n egotiate lower prices. See also below \" - Global economic conditions and the unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for Sanofi's business\". In addition, if Sanofi loses patent protection in patent litigation, it faces the risk t hat government and private third -party payers and purchasers of pharmaceutical products may claim damages alleging they have over -reimbursed a drug. For example, in Australia, Sanofi's patent on clopidogrel was ultimately held invalid. Following this decision, the Australian Government is seeking damages for its alleged over -reimbursement of clopidogrel drugs due to the preliminary injunction Sanofi had obtained against the sale of gene ric clopidogrel during the course of the litigation. As a consequence of the growing number of mergers of retail chains and distributors and resulting consolidation of the distribution channel, distributors have increased their capacity to negotiate price and other terms. Due to these cost containment policies and pressure on the prices, Sanofi's revenues and margins are, and could continue to be, negatively affected. Sanofi is also unable to predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for its product candidates. Price negotiations in a country may be incompatible with the global positioning of its products, which may lead Sanofi not to launch the product in that country, resulting in a decrease in initially anticipated sales. Finally, Sanofi's operating results may also be affected by parallel imports, particularly within the European Union, whereby distributors engage in arbitrage based on national price differences to buy products in low cost markets for resale in higher cost markets. Sanofi may lose market share to competing remedies, biosimilar or generic products . Sanofi is faced with intense competition from generic products, biosimilars and brand -name drugs including from retail chains and distributors. Doctors or patients may choose compet itors' products over Sanofi's or alternative therapeutic options such as surgery if they perceive them to be safer, more reliable, more effective, easier to administer or less expensive, which could cause Sanofi's revenues to decline and adversely affect its results of operations. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 28- 36-40620607 The success of any product also depends on Sanofi's ability to educate patients when permissible and healthcare providers and provide them with innovative data about the product and its uses. If these education efforts are not ef fective, Sanofi may not be able to increase the sales of its new products or realize the full value of its investment in their development. Sanofi may not be able to anticipate precisely the date of market entry of generics or biosimilars or the potential impact on its sales, both of which depend on numerous parameters. The introduction of a generic version of a branded medicine typically results in a significant and rapid reduction in net sales for the branded product because generic manufacturers typically offer their unbranded versions at significantly lower prices, resulting in adverse price and volume effects for Sanofi's genericized products. Substitution is often permitted for generic products that are considered to be interchangeable or clinically identi cal. With respect to biosimilars, in the United States only biosimilars that refer to an innovator drug that was approv ed under a Biologics License Application may be designated as interchangeable with the original biologic and only in circumstances where specific criteria are met. In many European countries, automatic substitution of biologics is officially prohibited or not recommended. Nevertheless competition even from non -substitutable biosimilars would likely result in a decrease in prices, additional rebates, promotion effort and lower margins. Approval of a generic or biosimilar that is substitutable for one of Sanofi's products would increase the risk of accelerated market penetration by that generic or biosimilar to a greater extent than would be the case for a non -substitutable product. These trends are exacerbated by applicable legislation which encourages the use of generic products to reduce spending on prescription drugs in many countries such as the United States and France. Therefore, the market for Sanofi's products could also be affected if a competitor's innovative drug in the same market were to become available as a generic because a certain number of patients can be expected to switch to a lower -cost alternative therapy. Sanofi expect s this generic competition to continue and to affect more of its products, including those with relatively modest sales. A substantial share of the revenue and income of the Group continues to depend on the performance of certain flagship products. Sanofi generate s a substantial share of its revenues from the sale of certain key products. Lantus\u00ae is particularly important; it was the Group's leading product with revenues of \u20ac6,390 million in 2015, representing 17.2% of the Group's aggregate net sales for the year. Lantus\u00ae is a flagship product of the Diabetes business. Accounting for recent market trends, Sanofi announced in October 2015 that it project s global diabetes sales over the period from 2015 to 2018 to decline at an average annualized rate of between 4% and 8% at constant exchange rate (CER). Nevertheless its actual sales may differ from these expectations given the numerous underlying assumptions (for example the outlook for insulin glargine sales, and expectations for Lyxumia\u00ae and BGM (Blood Glucose Monitoring)). Furthermore, the launch of new medicines and vaccines in other therapeutic areas and the performance of the Group's other businesses may not be sufficient to reduce the relative contribution of Lantus\u00ae to its overall performance. Sanofi's flagship products benefit from certain intellectual property protections such as patents and exclusivity periods but patent and proprietary rights, even if they are not challenged, are subject to expiration dates. Expiration of effective intell ectual property protections for Sanofi's products typically results in the entry of one or more lower -priced generic competitors, o ften leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues on those products (for information on the expected impact of biosimilar ent ry on the market see \" - Sanofi may lose market share to competing remedies, biosimilar or generic products.\") Furthermore, in general, if one or more of Sanofi's flagship products were to encounter problems such as material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, recall, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confiden ce, press ure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, or if a new, more effective treatment were introduced, or if there were a reduction in sales of one or more of Sanofi's flagship products or in their growth, the adverse impact on Sanofi's busine ss, results of operations and financial condition could be significant. The manufacture of Sanofi's products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affec t its operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact its image. Many of Sanofi's products are manufactured using technically complex processes requiring specialized facilities, highly specific raw material s and other production constraints. Third parties supply Sanofi with a substantial portion of its raw materials, active ingredients and medical devices, which exposes Sanofi to the risk of a supply shortage or interruption in the 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 29- 36-40620607 event that these suppliers are unable to manufacture its products to Group quality standards or experience financial difficulties. Further, some raw materials essential to the manufacture of Sanofi's products are not widely available from sources it consider s reliable; for example, Sanofi has approved only a limited number of suppliers of heparins for use in the manufacture of Lovenox\u00ae. Any of these factors could adversely affect Sanofi's business, operating results or financial condition. Sanofi's products a re also increasingly reliant on the use of product -specific devices for administration which may result in technical issues. For example in October 2015, Sanofi voluntar ily recalled all Auvi -Q\u00ae (epinephrine injection, USP) marketed in the U.S. and Canada a s the product has been found to potentially have inaccurate dosage delivery, which may include failure to deliver the drug. Sanofi has ultimately decided to return all U.S. and Canadian rights to the developer of Auvi -Q\u00ae. One of Sanofi's newly launched pro ducts, Praluent\u00ae, is administered with an auto -injector manufactured by a third party. The success of this product will depend partially on the performance of this device. Sanofi must also be able to produce sufficient quantities of its products to satisf y demand. Sanofi may have difficulties transforming and adapting its existing plants to manufacture new products, including biologics, and scaling up production of its products currently under development once they are approved. Sanofi's biological product s in particular, are subject to the risk of manufacturing stoppages or the risk of loss of inventory because of the difficulties inherent in the processing of biological materials and the potential difficulties in accessing adequate amounts of raw material s meeting required standards. Effective insurance coverage for biologics products in the event of contaminated batches may also be difficult to obtain as t he cause of the contamination can be difficult to ascertain (for the impact on the financial statemen ts see \" - Impairment charges or write downs in Sanofi's books and changes in accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial results.\") For example, in the U.S . Sanofi encountered production issues which caused delays in the supply of Pentacel\u00ae vaccine starting from 2012. While these problems have either been remedied or are in the process of being remedied, Sanofi continue s to face strong demand for its vaccines that requires in certain cases to manage the supply allocation. Sanofi is working to increase its capacities but cannot reasonably estimate how long it will take to address these constraints. There can be no guarantee that Sanofi will not face similar issues in the future or that it will successfully manag e such issues when they arise. Additionally, specific conditions must be respected both by the Group and its customers for the storage and distribution of many of the biological products, for example, cold storage for certain vaccines and insulin -based products is required. Failure to adhere to these requirements may result in lost product inventory. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict internal and health authority standards for the manufacture of the products, subjec t Sanofi to risks because the investigation and remediation of any identified or suspected problems can cause production delays, substantial expense, product recalls, or lost sales and inventories and delay the launch of new products, which could adversely affect Sanofi's operating results and financial condition, and cause reputational damage and the risk of product liability (see \" - Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations and financial condition\"). When ma nufacturing disruptions occur, Sanofi may not have alternate manufacturing capacity, particularly for certain biologics. In the event of manufacturing disruptions, Sanofi's ability to use back up facilities or set up new facilities is more limited because biologics are more complex to manufacture. Even though Sanofi aims to have backup sources of supply whenever possible, including by manufacturing backup supplies of its principal active ingredients at additional facilities when practicable, Sanofi cannot be certain they will be sufficient if its principal sources become unavailable. Switching sources and manufacturing facilities require significant time. Supply shortages generate even greater negative reactions when they occur with respect to life saving medicines with limited or no viable therapeutic alternatives. Shortages of products lead to lower product revenues but also can have a negative impa ct on the confidence of patients, customers and professional healthcare providers and the image of t he Group. Government authorities and regulators in the United States and in the European Union are also considering measures to reduce these risks . It cannot be ruled out that these ongoing initiatives may generate additional costs for the Group if they re sult in a requirement to establish back up supply channels or to increase inventory levels to avoid shortages. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 30- 36-40620607 Sanofi is sometimes required to use animals to test its products in the development phase and its vaccines before distributing them. Animal test ing activities have been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Testing on animals can be vital for the development or commercialization of a product. If applicable regulations were to ban this practice, or if, due to pressur e from animal welfar e groups, Sanofi was no longer able to source animals to perform such tests, it would be difficult and in some cases impossible to develop or distribute Sanofi's products in certain jurisdictions under the applicable marketing authorizations. In addition, negative publicity regarding Sanofi's use, or the industry's use, of animal subjects could harm Sanofi's reputation. Sanofi relies on third parties for the discovery, manufacture and marketing of some of its products. Sanofi's industry is highly collaborative, whether in the discovery and development of new products, in -licensing, the marketing and distribution of approved products, or manufacturing activities. Sanofi expect s that it will continue to rely on third parties for key aspects of its business. Sanofi conduct s a number of significant research and development programs and market some of its products in collaboration with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, Sanofi currently has a global strategic collaboration with Regeneron for the discovery, development, commercialization and manufacturing of therapies based on monoclonal antibodies. With Alnylam Sanofi has an agreement to develop and commercialize treatments for rare genetic diseases. Sanofi also has collaborative arrangements with Merck & Co., Inc. for the distribution of vaccines in Europe. In addition Sanofi may also rely on partners to design and manufacture medical devices, notably for the adm inistration of its products. If disruptions or quality concerns were to arise in the third -party supply of raw materials, active ingredients or medical devices or if its partner were unable to manufacture a product, this could also adversely affect its ability to sell its products in the quantities demanded by the market and could damage its reputation and relationships with its customers. See also \" - The manufacture of Sanofi's products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect its operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact its image\". When Sanofi research s and market s its products through collab oration arrangements, the performance of certain key tasks or functions are the responsibility of its collaboration partners and, therefore Sanofi is subject to the risk that they do not perform effectively. Sanofi is also subject to the risk that decision s may be under the control of or subject to the approval of its collaboration partners, and Sanofi may have differing views. Failures in the development or differing priorities may adversely affect the activities conducted through the collaboration arrange ments. Any conflicts that Sanofi may have with its partners during the course of these agreements or at the time of their renewal or renegotiation may affect the marketing of certain of its products and may cause a decline in its revenues and negatively affect its results of operations. Sanof i is subject to the risk of non -payment by its customer s1. Sanofi runs the risk of delayed payments or even non -payment by its customers, which consist principally of wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. This risk is accentuated by recent concentrations among distributors, as well as by current global credit and economic conditions, i ncluding the worldwide economic slowdown, in particular in the emerging markets. The United States poses particular customer credit risk issues, because of the concentrat ed distribution system in which more than half of its consolidated U.S. pharmaceutical sales are accounted for by three wholesalers. Sanofi is also exposed to large wholesalers in other markets, particularly in Europe. Worldwide, the Group's three main customers represent 24.7% of its gross total revenues. An inability of one or more of the se wholesalers to honor their debts to Sanofi would adversely affect its financial condition (see Note D.34. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). In some countries, some customers are public or subsidized health systems. The economic and credit conditions in these countries may lead to an increase in the average length of time needed to collect on accounts receivable or the ability to co llect 100% of receivables outstanding. Because of this c ontext, Sanofi may need to reassess the recoverable amount of its debts in these countries during the coming financial years. 1 Information in this section is supplementary to Notes B.8.8. (with resp ect to information required by IFRS 7), D.10 and D.34 to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F, and is covered by Sanofi's independent registered public accounting firms report on the consolidated financial statements. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 31- 36-40620607 Global economic conditions and the unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for Sanofi's business2. Over the past several years, growth of the global pharmaceutical market has become increasingly tied to global economic growth. In this context, a substantial and lasting slowdown of the global economy, major national economies or emerging markets could ne gatively affect growth in the global pharmaceutical market and, as a result, adversely affect Sanofi's business. Unfavorable economic conditions have reduced the sources of funding for national social security systems, leading to austerit y measures includ ing heightened pressure on drug prices, increased substitution of generic drugs, and the exclusion of certain products from formularies. Further, Sanofi's net sales may be negatively impacted by the continuing challenging global economic environment, as hi gh unemployment, increases in co -pays, and lack of developed third party payer systems in certain regions may lead some patients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments t o reduce their costs. In the Unit ed States there has been an increase in the number of patients in the Medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many U.S. states, to formulary restrictions limitin g access to brand -name drugs, includi ng Sanofi's . Also, as a result of the insurance coverage mandate that came into effect in the United States in 2015, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of hea lthcare costs to their employees. In emerging markets countries where the economy is highly dependent on oil, a decline in oil prices may impact the ability of those countries to sustain healthcare spending, which could adversely affect Sanofi's sales in those countries. Sanofi's Consumer Health Care (CHC) and Animal Health businesses could also be adversely impacted as difficult economic conditions may limit the financial resources of people and livestock producers. If economic conditions worsen, or in the event of default or failure of major players including wholesalers or public sector buyers financed by insolvent states, the financial situation of the Group, its results of operations and the distribution cha nnels of its products may be adversely affe cted. See also \" Sanofi is subject to the risk of non -payment by its customers\". Economic and financial difficulties may have an adverse impact on third parties who are important to Sanofi's business, including collaboration partners and suppliers, which c ould cause such third parties to delay or disrupt performance of their obligations to Sanofi and could materially adversely affect its business or results of operations. See \" - Sanofi relies on third parties for the discovery, manufacture and marketing of some of its products\" above. Counterfeit versions of Sanofi's products harm its business. Counterfeiting activities and the presence of counterfeit products in a number of markets and over the Internet continue to b e a challenge for maintaining a safe drug supply. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be life-threat ening. To distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs along with increased levels of counterfeiting could be mistakenly attribute d to the authe ntic product, affect patient confidence in the authentic product and harm the business of companies such as Sanofi. If one of Sanofi's products were to be the subject of counterfeits, the Group could incur substantial reputational and financial harm. Breac hes of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm. Sanofi's business depends heavily on the use of information technologies. Certain key areas such as rese arch and development, production and sales are to a large extent dependent on Sanofi's information systems, including cloud -based computing, or those of third party providers, including for the storage and transfer of critical, confidential or sensitive in formation. Sanofi commercialize s a number of devices using new technologies which if they malfunction could lead to a risk of harm to patients 2 Information in this section is in addition to Note B.8.8. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F, with respect to information required by IFRS 7, and is covered by the independent registered public accounting firms' report on the consolidated financial statements. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 32- 36-40620607 (see \" - Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations and financial co ndition\") including the unavailability of its products. Sanofi and the third -party service providers are implementing secure information technology systems for the protection of data and threat detection. However, there can be no assurance that Sanofi's efforts or those of its third -party service providers to implement adequate security and control measures would be sufficient to protect against breakdowns, service disruption, data deterioration or loss in the event of a system malfunction, or prevent data from being stolen or corrupted in the event of a cyber -attack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks or insider threat attacks which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm. The expansion of social media platforms and mobil e technologies present s new risks and challenges for Sanofi's business and reputation . Sanofi increasingly relies on social media and new technologies to communicate about its products and diseases or to provide health services. The use of these media requires specific attention, monitoring programs and moderation of comments. For example, patients may use these channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product and to repor t an alleged adverse event. When such issues arise, the nature of evidence -based health care and restrictions on what pharmaceutical manufacturers may say about their products are not always well suited to rapidly defending the Group or the public's legiti mate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media and rapid news cycles, and this may result in commercial harm , overly restrictive regulatory actions and erratic share price performance. Negative or inaccurate post s or comments about Sanofi, its business, directors or officers on any social networking website could seriously damage its reputation. In addition, its employees and partners may use social media and mobile technologies inappropriately, which may give ris e to liability for the Group, or which could lead to breaches of data security, loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property or public disclosure of sensitive information, including information about the Group's employees, clinical trials or custom ers. Such uses of social media and mobile technologies could have a material adverse effect on Sanofi's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Impairment charges or write downs in Sanofi's books and changes in accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial results. Substantial value is allocated to intangible assets and goodwill resulting from business combinations, as disclos ed at Note D.4. to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F at Item 18, which could be substantially impaired upon indications of impairment (primarily relating to pharmacovigilance, discontinued research and development projects, patent litigation and the launch of competing products), with adverse effects on the Group's financial condition and the value of its assets. If any of the Group's strategic equity investments decline in value and remain below cost for an extended period, Sanofi may be required to write down its investment. Sanofi owns a significant stake in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (22.1% of share capital as of 31 December 2015), which is listed on the NASDAQ and has been accounted for using the equity method since 2014. Any material deterioration in Regeneron's share price or financial performance would be an indicator that the value of Sanofi's investment might have become impaired. This would require Sanofi to perform an impairment test, which could have a negative impact on its financial statements. In addition, the inherent variability of biologics manufacturing increases the risk of write -offs of these products. Due to the value of the materials used, the carrying amount of biological products is much higher than that of small -molecule products. The financial environment and in particular the economic difficulties affecting Russia, Venezuela, Brazil, China and the Middle East could also negatively affect the value of the Group's assets (see \" - Global economic conditions and the unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for Sanofi's business\" and \" - Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect Sanofi's results of operations and financial condition\"). Any new or revised accounting standards, rules and interpr etations issued by the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) could also result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect the Group's financial results. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 33- 36-40620607 Sanofi' s pension liabilities are affected by factors such as the performance of plan assets, interest rates, actuarial data and experience and changes in laws and regulations. Sanofi's future funding obligations for its main defined -benefit pension plans depend on changes in the future performance of assets held in trust for these plans, the interest rates used to determine funding levels (or company liabilities), actuarial data and experience, inflation trends, the leve l of benefits provided for by the plans, as well as changes in laws and regulations. Adverse changes in those factors could increase its unfunded obligations under such plans, which would require more funds to be contributed and hence negatively affect its cash flow and results (see Note D.19.1. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F). Risks Relating to the Group Structure and Strategy Sanofi's strategic objectives for long -term growth may not be fully realized. In November 2015, Sanofi outlined its strategic roadmap for the period 2015 -2020. Its long term strategy rests on four pillars: reshape the portfolio, deliver outstanding launches, sustain innovation in R&D and simplify the organization. Sanofi may not be able to fully realize its strategic objectives and, even if it is able to do so, these strategic objectives may not deliver the expected benefits or within the expected timeline. Sanofi will look to reshape its portfolio through acquisit ions and divestitures and may not reach this objective if it is unable to identify opportunities, or enter into agreements in a timely manner or on sufficiently attractive terms. In addition, Sanofi may fail to (i) adopt the best strategy for its acquisitions/ divestitures or (ii) compete in an intensively competitive, increasingly focused market environment (see \" - Sanofi may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from its strategic investm ents\" below and \" Sanofi's research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing its product portfolio\" above). Sanofi may also not have the necessary flexibility to appropriately reallocate resources towards its priority businesses. The successful launch of a new pharmaceutical product involves substantial investment in sales and marketing activities. Sanofi has up to 18 new medicines and vaccines on track to arrive on the market between 2014 -2020; including six key launches (Toujeo\u00ae, Pra luent\u00ae, Dengvaxia\u00ae, sarilumab, LixiLan and dupilumab). However there can be no assurance that all of these products will be approved, or with the targeted indications, and/or within the expected timeline or that, if approve d, they will achieve commercial s uccess. The launch strategy Sanofi develop s (in terms of timing, pricing, market access, marketing efforts and dedicated sales forces) may not deliver the benefits that the Group expect s. The competitive environment for a given product may also have change d by at the time of the actual launch, modifying the Group's initial expectations. The need to prioritize the allocation of resources may also cause delays in the expected launch of some of the Group's products (see also \" - Sanofi's research and developmen t efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing its product portfolio\" above). Sustaining innovation in R&D is inherently risky due to the high rate of failure and Sanofi may not be able to allocate its resources to obtain optimal results (see also \" - Sanofi's research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing its product portfolio\" above). Sanofi's ongoing simplification of its global organization through the implementation, starting from January 2016 (pending relevant mandatory lab or group consultations) of five global business units (GBU) to meet significant growth objectives requires substantial attention from its management. There is no guarantee that it will be able to fully implement this new organization within the targeted ti meline, that it will enable the Group to concentrate its efforts around the businesses most likely to deliver growth or that these GBUs will grow in line with anticipated growth rates or will deliver the expected bene fits. Failure to successfully implemen t and meet the Group's strategic objectives would have an adverse impact on its business, prospects and results of operations. Sanofi may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from its strategic investments. Sanofi pursue s a strategy of selective acquisitions, in -licensing and collaborations in order to reinforce its pipeline and portfolio. The implementation of this objective depends on the Group's ability to identify business development opportunities 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 34- 36-40620607 and execute them at reasonable cost and on acceptable financing terms. Moreover, entering into in -licensing or collaboration agreements generally requires the payment of significant \"milestones\" well before the relevant products reach the market, without any assurance that such investments will ultimately become profitable in the long term (see Note D.21.1. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 2 0-F and also \" - Sanofi relies on third parties for the discovery, manufacture and marketing of some of its products\"). For newly acquired activities or businesses Sanofi's growth objectives could be delayed or ultimately not realized, and expected synergi es could be adversely impacted if: - Sanofi is unable to quickly or efficiently integrate those activities or businesses; - integration takes longer than expected; - key employees leave; or - Sanofi has higher than anticipated integration costs. Sanofi may miscalculate the risks associated with business development transactions at the time they are made or not have the resources or ability to access all the relevant information to evaluate them properly, including with regards to the potentia l of resear ch and development pipelines, manufacturing issues, compliance issues, or the outcome of ongoing legal and other proceedings. It may also take a considerable amount of time and be difficult to implement a risk analysis and risk mitigation plan after the ac quisition of an activity or business is completed due to lack of historical data. As a result, risk management and coverage of such risks, particularly through insurance policies, may prove to be insufficient or ill -adapted. Because of the active competit ion among pharmaceutical groups for such business development activities, there can be no assurance of the Group's success in completing these transactions when such opportunities are identified. In December 2015, Sanofi announced its intention to acquire Boehringer Ingelheim's consumer healthcare (CHC) business with an enterprise value of \u20ac6.7 billion in exchange for the Group's animal health business (Merial). The transaction would also include a gross cash payment from Boehringer Ingelheim to Sanofi of \u20ac4.7 billion. The transaction would allow Sanofi to become a global leader in CHC but there is no certainty that the transaction will be ultimately completed as contemplated, within the expected time frame or at all. Sanofi cannot guarantee that Boehringer Ingelheim's CHC business will be successfully integrated with the Group's and that it will be able to retain key personnel. The expected benefits of the transaction may never be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. The globalizatio n of the Group 's business exposes it to increased risks in specific areas . Sanofi continue s to focus on Emerging Markets. However, difficulties in operating in Emerging Markets, a significant decline in the anticipated growth rate in these regions or an unfavorable movement of the exchange rates of these countries' currenci es against the euro co uld impair Sanofi's ability to take advantage of these growth opportunities and could affect its business, results of operations or financial condition (see also \" - Global economic conditions and the unfavorable financial environment could have negative co nsequences for Sanofi's business\"). The expansion of the Group's activities in Emerging Markets also exposes Sanofi to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, competition from multinational or locally based companies that are already wel l established in these markets, the inability to adequately respond to the unique characteristics of Emerging Markets (particularly with respect to their underdeveloped judicial systems and regulatory frameworks) difficulties in recruiting qualified person nel or maintaining the necessary internal control systems, potential exchange controls, weaker intellectual property protection, higher crime levels (particularly with respect to counterfeit products (see \" - Counterfeit versions of Sanofi's products harm its business\")), and compliance issues including corruption and fraud (see \" - Claims and investigations relating to compliance, competition law, marketing practices, pricing and other legal matters, could adversely affect the Group's business, results of op erations and financial condition\"). Sanofi may also face compliance and internal control systems issues in mature markets due to increased competition and more complex and stringent regulations. As a global healthcare leader, Sanofi is exposed to a number of risks inherent in sectors in which the Group was previously less active such as the generics and consumer healthcare sectors, whose business models and trade channels are different from Sanofi's traditional pharmaceutical business, in particular regard ing promotional efforts and trade terms. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 35- 36-40620607 Sanofi's success depends in part on its senior management team and other key employees and its ability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel and qualified individuals in the face of intense competition. Sanofi depend s on the expertise of its senior management team and other key employees. In addition, Sanofi relies heavily on recruiting and retaining talented people to help it meet its strategic objectives. Sanofi faces intense competition for qualified individuals for senior management positions, or in specific geographic regions or in specialized fields such as clinical development, biosciences and devices. In addition, Sanofi's ability to hire qualified personnel also depends in part on its ability to reward performance, incentivize its employees and to pay competitive compensation. Laws and regulations on executive compensation may restrict Sanofi's ability to attract, motivate and retain the required level of talented people. The inability to attract, integrate and/or retain highly skilled personnel, in particular those in leadership positions, may weaken the Group's succession plans, may materially adversely affect the implementation of its strategy and its ability to meet its strategic objectives and could ultimately impact its business or results of operations. Environmental Risks of Sanofi's Industrial Activities Risks from the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect Sanofi's results of operations. Manufacturing activities, such as the chemical manufacturing of the active ingredients in the Group's products and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes, expose the Group to various risks, including: - fires and/or exp losions; - storage tank leaks and ruptures; or - discharges or releases of toxic or pathogen substances. These operating risks can cause personal injury, property damage and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and/or the imposition of civil, administrative, criminal penalties and/or civil damages. The occurrence of any of these events may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and adversely affect Sanofi's operating results and reputation. Although Sanofi maintain s property, business interruption and casualty insurance that we believe is in accordance with customary industry practices, this insurance may not be adequate to fully cover all potential hazards incidental to Sanofi's business. Environmental liabilities and costs related to compliance with applicable regulations may have a significant adverse effect on Sanofi's results of operations. The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on the Group to remediate contamina ted sites. These obligations may relate to sites: - that Sanofi currently own s or operate s; - that it formerly owned or operated; or - where waste from its operations was disposed. These environmental remediation obligations could significantly reduce Sanofi's operating results. Sanofi accrues provisions for remediation when its management believes the need is probable and that it is reasonably possible to estimate the cost. In particular, the provisions for these obligations may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying these provisions prove incorrect or if Sanofi is held responsible for additional, currently undiscovered contamination. These judgments and estimates may later prove inaccurate, and any shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition. Sanofi is or may become involved in claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. Some current and former Sanofi subsidiaries have been named as \"potential ly responsible parties\" or the equivalent under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (also known as \"Superfund\"), and similar statutes in France, Germany, Italy, Brazil and elsewhere. As a matter of statutory or contractual obligation, Sanofi and/or its subsidiaries may retain responsibility for environmental liabilities at some of the sites of its predecessor companies, 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 36- 36-40620607 or of subsidiaries that Sanofi demerged, divested or may divest. Sanofi has disputes outstanding regarding certain sites no longer owned by the Group. An adverse outcome in such disputes might have a significant adverse effect on its operating results. See Note D.22.e) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F and \"Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\" of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F. Environmental regulat ions are evolving (i.e., in Europe, REACH, CLP/GHS, SEVESO, IPPC/IED, the Waste Framework Directive, the Emission Trading Scheme Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Directive on Taxation of Energy Products and Electricity and several other reg ulations aimed at preventing global warming). Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to the Group and could subject its handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of subs tances or pollutants, site restoration and compliance to more rigorous scrutiny than is currently the case. Consequently, compliance with these laws could result in significant capital expenditures as well as o ther costs and liabilities, thereby adversely affecting the Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. Natural disasters prevalent in certain regions in which Sanofi does business could affect its operations. Some of Sanofi's production sites are located in areas exposed to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. In the event of a major disaster Sanofi could experience severe destruction or interruption of its operations and production capacity. As a res ult, its operations and employees could suffer serious harm which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Financial Markets 3 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect Sanofi's results of operations and financial condition. Because Sanofi sells its products in numerous countries, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Sanofi is particularly sensitive to movements in exchange rates between the euro and the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, and to currencies in Emerging Markets. In 2015, 36% of its aggregate net sale s were realized i n the United States, 32% in Emerging Markets (including countries that are, or may in future become, subject to exchange controls), and 6% in Japan. While Sanofi incurs expenses in those currencies, the impact of currency exchange rates on these expenses d oes not fully offset the impact of currency exchange rates on its revenues. As a result, currency exchange rate movements can have a considerable impact on its earnings. When deemed appropriate and when technically feasible, Sanofi enter s into transactions to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks. These efforts, when undertaken, may fail to offset the effect of adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations on its results of operations or financial condition. 2. Risk factors associated with Notes issued u nder the Programme The trading market for debt securities may be volatile and may be adversely impacted by many events. The market for debt securities issued by issuers is influenced by economic and market conditions and, to varying degrees, interest rates , currency exchange rates and inflation rates in European and other industrialised countries. There can be no assurance that events in France, Europe or elsewhere will not cause market volatility or that such volatility will not advers ely affect the price of Notes or that economic and market conditions will not have any other adverse effect. An active trading market for the Notes may not develop. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the Notes will develop, or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop or is not maintained, the market or trading price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. The Issuer is entitled to buy the Notes, as described in Conditio n 7(h), and the Issuer may issue further notes, as described in Condition 15 ( Further Issues and Consolidation ). Such transactions may favourably or adversely affect the price development of the Notes. If additional and competing products are introduced in the markets, this may adversely affect the value of the Notes. 3 Information in this section is supplementary to Note B.8.8. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of t he 2015 Annual Report on Form 20 -F with respect to information required by IFRS 7, and is covered by the independent registered public accounting firms' report on the consolidated financial statements. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 37- 36-40620607 The Notes may be redeemed for tax reasons prior to maturity. Unless in the case of any particular Tranche of Notes the relevant Final Terms specify otherwise, in the event that the Issue r woul d be obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of any Notes due to any withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties of whatever nature imposed or levied, by or on behalf of the Republic of France or any political su bdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, the Issuer may, and in certain circumstances shall be obliged to, redeem all outstanding Notes in accordance with the \"Terms and Conditions of the Notes\". Any early redemption at the option of the Issuer, if provided for in any Final Terms relating to a particular issue of Notes, could cause the yield anticipated by Noteholders to be considerably less than anticipated. The Final Terms for a particular issue of Notes may provide for early red emption at the option of the Issuer. Such right of early redemption is often provided for bonds or notes in periods of high interest rates. If the market interest rates decrease, the risk to Noteholders that the Issuer will exercise its right to redeem ear ly increases. As a consequence, the yields received upon redemption may be lower than expected, and the redeemed face amount of the Notes may be lower than the purchase price for the Notes paid by the Noteholder. As a consequence, part of the capital inves ted by the Noteholder may be lost, so that the Noteholder in such case would not receive the total amount of the capital invested. In addition, investors that choose to rei nvest monies they receive through an early redemption may be able to do so only in s ecurities with a lower yield than the redeemed Notes. The Issuer has the option, if so provided in the relevant Final Terms, to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, or in whole but not in pa rt, as the case may be, under a call option as provided in Condition 7(c), a clean -up call option as provided in Condition 7(d) and/or, unless specified as not being applicable in the relevant Final Terms, a make -whole redemption option as provided in Condition 7(f ). In particular, wit h respect to the clean -up call option, there is no obligation under the Terms and Conditions of the Notes for the Issuer to inform investors if and when the limit needed to exercise the clean -up call option has been reached or is about to be reached, and t he Issuer's right to redeem will exist notwithstanding that immediately prior to the serving of a notice in respect of the exercise of the c lean-up call option, the Notes may have been trading significantly above par, thus potentially resulting in a loss o f capital invested. Partial redemption of Notes at the option of the Issuer or at the option of the Noteholders may make the market illiquid. Depending on the number of Notes of the same Series in respect of which a partial redemption of the Notes at the option of th e Issuer or at the option of the Noteholders is made, any trading market in respect of those Notes in respect of which such option is not exercised may become illiquid. The market value of Fixed Rate Notes depends on the evolution of market interest rates. For Notes bearing interest at a fixed rate, investment in those Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market int erest rates may adversely affect the value of such Notes. Investors will not be able to calculate in advance their rate of return on Floating Rate Notes. A key difference between Floating Rate Notes and Fixed Rate Notes is that interest income on Floating Rate Notes cannot be anticipated. Due to varying interest income, investors are not able to determine a definite yield of Floating Rate Notes at t he time they purchase them, so that their return on investment cannot be compared with that of investments having fixed interest periods. If the Final Terms provide for several interest payment dates, investors are exposed to the reinvestment risk if mar ket interest rates decline. That is, investors may reinvest the interest income paid to them only at the relevant lo wer interest rates then prevailing. Zero Coupon Notes are subject to higher price fluctuations than non -discounted bonds. Changes in market interest rates have a stronger impact on the prices of Zero Coupon Notes than on the prices of ordinary Notes becaus e the discounted issue prices are below par. If market interest rates increase, Zero Coupon Notes can suffer higher price losses than other Notes having the same maturity and credit rating. Due to their leverage effect, Zero Coupon Notes are a type of inve stment associated with a particularly high price risk. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 38- 36-40620607 The Issuer's obligations under Subordinated Notes are subordinated The Issuer's obligations under Subordinated Notes will be unsecured and subordinated and will rank junior in priority of payment to un subordinated creditors . If any judgment is rendered by any competent court declaring the judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) of the Issuer or if the Issuer is liquidated for any other reason, the rights of payment of the holders of the Subordina ted Notes will be subordinated to the payment in full of all present and future unsubordinated creditors and, subject to such payment in full, holders of the Subordinated Notes will be paid in priority to any pr\u00eats participatifs granted to the Issuer, any titres participatifs issued by it and any deeply subordinated obligations of the Issuer. In the event of incomplete payment of unsubordinated creditors in case of a liquidation, the obligations of the Issuer in connection with the Subordinated Notes will b e terminated. Holders of Subordinated Notes will be responsible for taking all steps necessary for the orderly accomplishment of any collective proceedings or voluntary liquidation in relation to any claims they may have against the Issuer. Although Subor dinated Notes may pay a higher rate of interest than comparable Notes which are no t subordinated, there is a risk that an investor in Subordinated Notes will lose all or some of his investment should the Issuer become insolvent. Exchange rate risks and exc hange controls. The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in the Specified Currency (as defined in \"Terms and Conditions of the Notes\" below). This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities or financial statements are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the \" Investor's Currency \") other than the Specified Currency. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of t he Specified Currency or revaluation of the Investor's Currency or central bank interventions in the relevant currency markets) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An apprecia tion in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the Specified Currency would decrease (1) the Investor's Currency -equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency -equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investo r's Currency -equivalent market value of the Notes. Furthermore, Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result , investors may receive les s interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal. Conflicts of Interest may arise between the calculation agent and the Noteholders. Potential conflicts of interest may arise between the calculation agent (including where a Dealer acts as calculation agent) , if any, for a Tranche of Notes and the Noteholders, including conflicts which may arise as a result of certain discretionary determinations and judgements that such calculation agent may make pursuant to the Terms and Conditions, the o utcome of which may affect the amount receivable by the Noteholders upon redemption of the Notes. Credit ratings may not reflect all risks. One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes or to the Issuer. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. Changes of law may occur in the future that will impact the conditions of the Notes. The conditions of the Notes are based on the laws of France in effect as at the date of this Base Prospectus. No assurance ca n be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to the laws of France or administrative practice (or to th e interpretation thereto) after the date of this Base Prospectus. French insolvency law Under French insolvency law as amended by ordinance no. 2008 -1345 dated 18 December 2008 which came into force on 15 February 2009 and related order no. 2009 -160 dated 12 February 2009 and law no. 2010 -1249 dated 22 October 2010 which came into force on 1 March 2011 and related order no. 2011 -236 dated 3 March 2011 and ordinance no. 2014 -326 dated 12 March 2014 which came into force on 1 July 2014, holders of debt securi ties are automatically grouped into a single assembly of holders (the \" Assembly \") in order to defend their common interests if a safeguard procedure ( proc\u00e9dure de redressement judiciaire ) is opened in France with respect to the Issuer. The Assembly comprises holders of all debt securities issued by the Issuer (including the Notes), whether or not under a debt issuance programme (EMTN) and regardless of their governing law. The Assembly deliberates on the proposed safeguard plan ( projet de plan de sauvegarde, projet de plan sauvegarde or projet de plan de redressement ) applicable to the Issuer and may further agree to: increase the liabilities (charges) of holders of debt securities (including the Noteholders) by rescheduling and/or writing -off debts; establish an unequ al treatment between holders of debt securities (including the Noteholders) as appropriate under the circumstances; and/or decide to convert debt securities (including the Notes) into shares. Decisions of the Assembly will be taken by a two -third majority (calculated as a proportion of the debt securities held by the holders attending such Assembly or represented thereat). No quorum is required to hold the Assembly. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions relating to the Representation of the Noteholders described in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes set out in this Base Prospectus will not be applicable with respect to the Assembly to the extent the y conflict with compulsory insolvency law provisions that apply in these circumstances. Risks relating to Notes denominated in Renminbi A description of risks which may be relevant to an investor in Notes denominated in Renminbi (\" Renminbi Notes \") are set out below . Renminbi is not freely convertible and there are significant restrictions on the remittance of Renminbi into and out of the PRC which may adversely affect the liquidity of Renminbi Notes Renminbi is not freely convertible at present. The government of the PRC (the \" PRC Government \") continues to regulate conversion between Renminbi and foreign currencies, including the Hong Kong dollar. However, there has been significant reduction in control by the PRC Government in recent years, particularly over trade transactions involving imp ort and export of goods and services as well as other frequent routine foreign exchange transactions. These transactions are known as current account items. On the other hand, remittance of Renminbi by foreign investors into the PRC for the settlement of capital account items, such as capital contributions, is generally only permitted upon obtaining specific approvals from, or completing specific registrations or filings with, the relevant authorities on a case -by-case basis and is subject to a strict moni toring system. Regulations in the PRC on the remittance of Renminbi into the PRC for settlement of capital account items are being developed. Although starting from 1 October 2016, the Renminbi will be added to the Special Drawing Rights basket created by the International Monetary Fund, there is no assurance that the PRC Government will continue to gradually liberalise control over cross -border remittance of Renminbi in the future, that the schemes for Renminbi cross -border utilisation will not be disconti nued or that new regulations in the PRC will not be promulgated in the future which have the effect of restricting or eliminating the remittance of Renminbi into or out of the PRC. In the event that funds cannot be repatriated out of the PRC i n Renminbi, t his may affect the overall availability of Renminbi outside the PRC and the ability of the Issuer to source Renminbi to finance its obligations under Notes denominated in Renminbi. There is only limited availability of Renminbi outside the PRC, which may affect the liquidity of the Renminbi Notes and the Issuer's ability to source Renminbi outside the PRC to service Renminbi Notes As a result of the restrictions by the PRC Government on cross -border Renminbi fund flows, the availability of Renminbi outside the PRC is limited. While the People's Bank of China (\" PBoC \") has entered into agreements on the clearing of Renminbi business with financial institutions in a number of financial centres and cities (the \" Renminbi Clearing Banks \"), including but not limit ed to Hong Kong and are in the process of establishing Renminbi clearing and settlement mechanisms in several other jurisdictions (the \" Settlement Arrangements \"), the current size of Renminbi denominated financial assets outside the PRC is limited. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 40- 36-40620607 There a re restrictions imposed by PBoC on Renminbi business participating banks in respect of cross -border Renminbi settlement, such as those relating to direct transactions with PRC enterprises. Furthermore, Renminbi business participating banks do not have dire ct Renminbi liquidity support from PBoC. The Renminbi Clearing Banks only have access to onshore liquidity support from PBoC for the purpose of squaring open positions of participating banks for limited types of transactio ns and are not obliged to square f or participating banks any open positions resulting from other foreign exchange transactions or conversion services. In such cases, the participating banks will need to source Renminbi from outside the PRC to square such open positions. Although it is expected that the offshore Renminbi market will continue to grow in depth and size, its growth is subject to many constraints as a result of PRC laws and regulations on foreign exchange. There is no assurance that new PRC regulations will not be promulgate d or the Settlement Arrangements will not be terminated or amended in the future which will have the effect of restricting availability of Renminbi outside the PRC. The limited availability of Renminbi outside the PRC may affect the liquidity of the Renmin bi Notes. To the extent the Issuer is required to source Renminbi in the offshore market to service its Renminbi Notes, there is no assurance that the Issuer will be able to source such Renminbi on satisfactory terms, if at all. Investment in the Renminbi Notes is subject to exchange rate risks The value of Renminbi against other foreign currencies fluctuates from time to time and is affected by changes in the PRC and international political and economic conditions as well as many other factors. Recently, t he PBoC implemented changes to the way it calculates the Renminbi's daily mid -point against the U.S. dollar to take into account market -maker quotes before announcing such daily mid -point. This change, and others that may be implemented, may increase the v olatility in the value of the Renminbi against foreign currencies. All payments of interest and principal will be made in Renminbi with respect to Renminbi Notes unless otherwise specified. As a result, the value of these Renminbi payments may vary with th e changes in the prevailing exchange rates in the marketplace. If the value of Renminbi depreciates against another foreign currency, the value of the investment made by a holder of the Renminbi Notes in that foreign currency will decline. Investment in t he Renminbi Notes is subject to currency risk If the Issuer is not able, or it is impracticable for it, to satisfy its obligation to pay interest and principal on the Renm inbi Notes as a result of Inconvertibility, Non -transferability or Illiquidity (each, as defined in the Conditions), the Issuer shall be entitled, on giving not less than five or more than 30 calendar days' irrevocable notice to the investors prior to the due date for pay ment, to settle any such payment in U.S. Dollars on the due date at t he U.S. Dollar Equivalent (as defined in the Conditions) of any such interest or principal, as the case may be. Investment in the Renminbi Notes is subject to interest rate risks The PRC Government has gradually liberalised its regulation of interest rate s in recent years. Further liberalisation may increase interest rate volatility. In addition, the interest rate for Renminbi in markets outside the PRC may significantly d eviate from the interest rate for Renminbi in the PRC as a result of foreign exchang e controls imposed by PRC law and regulations and prevailing market conditions. As Renminbi Notes may carry a fixed interest rate, the trading price of the Renminbi Notes will consequently vary with the fluctuations in the Renminbi interest rates. If hol ders of the Renminbi Notes propose to sell their Renminbi Notes before their maturity, they may receive an offer lower than the amount they have invested. Payments with respect to the Renminbi Notes may be made only in the manner designated in the Renminb i Notes All payments to investors in respect of the Renminbi Notes will be made solely (i) for so long as the Renminbi Notes are represented by global certificates held with the common depositary for Clearsteam Banking S.A. and Euroclear Bank SA/NV or any alternative clearing system, by transfer to a Renminbi bank account maintained in Hong Kong, (ii) for so long as the Renminbi Notes are represented by global certificates lodged with a sub -custodian for or registered with the CMU, by transfer to a Renminbi bank account maintained in Hong Kong in accordance with prevailing CMU rules and procedures or/, (iii) for so long as the Renminbi Notes are in definitive form, by transfer to a Renminbi bank account maintained in Hong Kong in accordance with prevailing rules and regulations. The Issuer cannot be required to make payment by any other means (including in any other currency or by transfer to a bank account in the PRC). Gains on the transfer of the Renminbi Notes may become su bject to income taxes under PRC tax laws Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law , the PRC Individual Income Tax Law and the relevant implementing rules, as amended from time to time, any gain realised on the transfer of Renminbi Notes by non -PRC resident e nterprise or individual Holders may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax (\" EIT\") or PRC individual income tax (\" IIT\") if such gain is regarded as 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 41- 36-40620607 income derived from sources within the PRC. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law levies EIT at the rate of 20 per cent. of the gains derived by such non -PRC resident enterprise or individual Holder from the transfer of Renminbi Notes but its implementation rules have reduced the enterprise income tax rate to 10 per cent. The PRC Individual Income Tax Law levies IIT at a rate of 20 per cent. of the gains derived by such non -PRC resident or individual Holder from the transfer of Renminbi Notes. However, uncertainty remains as to whether the gain realised from the transfer of Renminbi Notes by non -PRC resident enterp rise or individual Holders would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC and become subject to the EIT or IIT. This will depend on how the PRC tax authorities interpret, apply or enforce the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law , the PRC Individua l Income Tax Law and the relevant implementing rules. According to the arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong, for avoidance of double taxation, Holders who are residents of Hong Kong, including enterprise Holders and individual Holders, will not be sub ject to EIT or IIT on capital gains derived from a sale or exchange of the Notes. Therefore, if non -PRC enterprise or individual resident Holders are required to pay PRC income tax on gains derived from the transfer of Renminbi Notes, unless there is an a pplicable tax treaty between PRC and the jurisdiction in which such non -PRC enterprise or individual resident holders of Renminbi Notes reside that reduces or exempts the relevant EIT or IIT, the value of their investment in Renminbi Notes may be materiall y and adversely affected. In certain circumstances Noteholders may be subject to U.S. withholding tax The United States has enacted rules, commonly referred to as \"FATCA, \" that generally impose a new reporting and withholding regime with respect to certain payments made by entities that are classified as financial institutions under FATC A. The United States has also entered into an intergovernmental agreement regarding the implementation of FATCA with France (the \"IGA\"). Sanofi does not expect payments made on or with respect to the Notes to be subject to withholding under FATCA. However, significant aspects of when and how FATCA will apply remain unclear, and no assurance can be given that withholding under FATCA will not become relevant with respect to payments made on or with respect to the Notes in the future. Any such withholding would not apply before 1 January 201 9. Also, Notes issued prior to the six -month anniversar y after final regulations that define the term \"foreign pass thru payment\" are filed with the U.S. Federal Register and that ar e classified as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes are generally exempt from these rules. In the event that any withholdin g imposed because of FATCA, the Issuer will have no obligation to make additional payments in respect of such withholding. The proposed financial transactions tax (\"FTT\") The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common FTT i n Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the \" Participating Member States \"). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. The proposed FTT has very broad scope and could, if i ntroduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt. Under current proposals the FTT could apply in cert ain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution , and at least one party is established in a Participatin g Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, \"established\" in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the fin ancial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 42- 36-40620607 CONSENT TO USE OF BASE PROSPECTUS In the context of any o ffer of Notes that is not within an exemption from the requirement to publish a prospectus under the Prospectus Directive (a \" Non-exempt Offer \"), the Issuer accepts responsibility, in the Member State for which it has given its consent referred to herein, for the content of this Base Prospectus in relation to any person (an \" Investor \") to whom an offer of any Notes is made by any financial intermediary to whom it has given its consent to use this Base Prospectus (an \" Authorised Offeror \", as set out in the F inal Terms or on the website of the Issuer as set out in the paragraph below), where the offer is made during the period for which that consent is given and where the offer is made in the Member State for which that consent was given and is in compliance w ith all other conditions attached to the giving of the consent.

Notes (except Notes which are to be consolidated ( assimilables for the purpose of French law) and form a single se ries with Notes issued before 1 March 2010 having the benefit of Article 131 quater of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts) will fall under the French withholding tax regime pursuant to Article 125 A III of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts. Payments of in terest and other revenues made by the Issuer on such Notes will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts unless such payments are made outside France in a non -cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non coop \u00e9ratif) within the meaning of Article 238 -0 A of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts (a \"Non-Cooperative State \"). If such payments under the Notes 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 47- 36-40620607 are made in a Non -Cooperative State, a 75 per cent. withholding tax will be appli cable (subject to certain exceptions described below and the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts. Furthermore, interest and other revenues on such Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer's taxable income, if they are paid or accrued to persons established in a Non -Cooperative State or paid in such a Non -Cooperative State. Under certain conditions, any such non -deductible interest and other revenues may be recharacterised as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts, in which case such non-deductible interest and other revenues may be subject to the withhol ding tax set out under Article 119 bis of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts, at a rate of 30 per cent. or 75 per cent. subject to the more favourable provisions of a tax treaty, if applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Law provides that neither the 75 per cent. withholding tax nor the non -deductibility will apply in respect of a particular issue of Notes if the Issuer can prove that the principal purpose and effect of such issue of Notes was not that of allowing the payments of interest or other revenues to be made in a Non -Cooperative State (the \" Exception \"). Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel de Finances Publiques an issue of Notes will benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any proof of the purpose and effect of such issue of Notes if such Notes are: (i) offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L.411.1 of the French Code mon \u00e9taire et financier or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a state other than an Non -Cooperative State. For this purpose, an \"equivalent offer\" means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign secur ities market authority; or (ii) admitted to trading on a regulated market or on a French or foreign multilateral securities trading system provided that such market or system is not located in a Non -Cooperative State, and the operation of such market is ca rried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or entity is not located in a Non -Cooperative State; or (iii) admitted, at the time of their issue, to the clearing operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561 -2 of the French Code mon \u00e9taire et financier , or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non -Cooperative State. 3. Interest and other revenues on Notes which are to be consolidated (assimilables for the purpose of French law) and form a single series with Notes issued prior to 1 March 2010 will continue to be exempt from the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts. In addition, interest and other revenues paid by the Issuer on Notes which are to be consolid ated ( assimilables for the purpose of French law) and form a single series with 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 48- 36-40620607 Notes issued prior to 1 March 2010 will not be subject to the withholding tax set out in Article 119 bis of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts solely on account of their being paid in a Non -Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in a Non -Cooperative State. Pursuant to Article 125A of the French Code g \u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp \u00f4ts and subject to certain exceptions, interest and other similar revenues receive d by individuals who are fiscally domiciled in France are subject to a 24 per cent. withholding tax, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied by way of withholding tax at an aggregate rate of 15.5 per cent. on interest and other similar revenues paid to individuals who are fiscally domiciled in France. Negative Pledge : The terms of the Unsubordinate d Notes will contain a negative pledge provision as further described in Condition 4 ( Negative Pledge ).

For the purposes of this sub -paragraph (A), \" ISDA Rate \" for an Interest Period means a rate equal to the Floating Rate that would be determined by the Fiscal Agent under an interest rate swap transaction if the Fiscal Agent were acting as Calculation Agent for that swap transaction under the terms of an agreement incorporating the 2006 ISDA Definitions published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. as amended from time to time (the \" ISDA Definitions \") and under which: (1) the Floating Rate Option is as specified in the relevant Final Terms; (2) the Designated Maturity is a period specified in the relevant Final Terms; and (3) the relevant Reset Date is either (i) if the applicable Floating Rate Option is based on the London inter -bank offered rate (\" LIBOR \") or on the Euro -zone inter-bank offered rate (\" EURIBOR \") for a currency, the first calendar day of that Interest Period or (ii) in any other case, as specified in the relevant Final Terms. For the purposes of this sub -paragraph (A), \" Floating Rate \", \"Calculation Agent \", \"Floati ng Rate Option \", \"Designated Maturity \" and \" Reset Date \" have the meanings given to those terms in the ISDA Definitions; the definition of \" Banking Day \" in the ISDA Definitions shall be amended to insert the words \"are open for\" in the second line after the word \" general \"; and \" Euro -zone \" means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro. When this sub -paragraph (A) applies, in respect of each relevant Interest Period the Fiscal Agent will be deemed to have discharged its obligations under Condition 5(b)(iv) in respect of the determination of the Rate of Interest if it has determined the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest Period in the manner provided in this sub -paragraph (A). Investors should consult the Issuer should they require a copy of the ISDA Definitions. (B) FBF Determination for Floating Rate Notes Where FBF Determination is specified in the relevant Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each I nterest Accrual Period shall be determined by the Calculation Agent as a rate equal to the relevant FBF Rate plus or minus (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any). For the purposes of this sub -paragraph (B), \" FBF Rate \" for an Interes t Accrual Period means a rate equal to the Floating Rate that would be determined by the Calculation Agent under a Transaction under the terms of an agreement incorporating the FBF Definitions and under which: (1) the Floating Rate is as specified in the relev ant Final Terms, and (2) the relevant Floating Rate Determination Date ( Date de D\u00e9termination du Taux Variable ) is the first calendar day of that Interest Accrual Period unless otherwise specified in the relevant Final Terms. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph (B), \" Floating Rate \" (Taux Variable ), \"Calculation Agent \" (Agent ), (Date de D\u00e9termination du Taux Variable ) and \" Transaction \" (Transaction ) have the meanings given to those terms in the FBF Definitions, provided that Euribor means the rate calculated for deposits in euro which appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01, as more 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 64- 36-40620607 fully described in the relevant Final Terms. \" FBF Definitions \" means the definitions set out in the 2007 FBF Master Agreement relating to tran sactions on forward financial instruments as supplemented by the Technical Schedules ( Additifs Techniques ) as published by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Bancaire Fran\u00e7aise (together the \" FBF Master Agreement \"), unless otherwise specified in the relevant Final Terms. Investors should consult the Issuer should they require a copy of the FBF Definitions. (C) Screen Rate Determination for Floating Rate Notes Where Screen Rate Determination is specified in the relevant Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will, subject as provided below, be either: (1) the offered quotation (if there is only one quotation on the Relevant Screen Page); or (2) the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal p lace, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of the offered quotations, (expressed as a percentage rate per annum) for the Reference Rate which appears or appear, as the case may be, on the Relevant Screen Page as at 11.00 a.m. (London time) in the case of L IBOR or 11.00 a.m. (Brussels time) in the case of EURIBOR on the Interest Determination Date in question plus or minus (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any), all as determined by the Fiscal Agent. If five or more of such offered qu otations are available on the Relevant Screen Page, the highest (or, if there is more than one such highest quotation, one only of such quotations) and the lowest (or, if there is more than one such lowest quotation, one only of such quotations) shall be disregarded by the Fiscal Agent for the purpose of determining the arithmetic mean (rounded as provided above) of such offered quotations. If, in the case of (1) above, such rate does not appear on that page or, in the case of (2) above, fewer than two such rates appear on that page or if, in either case, the Relevant Screen Page is unavailable, the Fiscal Agent will: (A) request the principal financial centre office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of the Reference Rate at approximately the relevant time on the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the Relevant Financial Centre interbank market in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time; and (B) determine the arithmetic mean of such quotation s. If fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, the Fiscal Agent will determine the arithmetic mean of the rates (being the nearest to the Reference Rate, as determined by the Fiscal Agent) quoted by major banks in the principal financial c entre of the Specified Currency, selected by the Fiscal Agent, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (local time in the principal financial centre of the Specified Currency) on the first calendar day of the relevant Interest Period for loans in the Specified Currenc y to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time. If the Reference Rate from time to time in respect of the Floating Rate Notes is sp ecified as being other than LIBOR or EURIBOR, the Rate of Interest in respect of such Notes will be determined as provided in the relevant Final Terms. For the purposes of this sub -paragraph (C), \" Reference Banks \" means four major banks selected by the Fis cal Agent in the market that are most closely connected with the Reference Rate, unless otherwise specified in the relevant Final Terms. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 65- 36-40620607 (iii) Minimum and/or Maximum Interest Rate If the relevant Final Terms specify a Minimum Interest Rate for any Interest Perio d, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest Period determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii) above is less than such Minimum Interest Rate, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be such Min imum Interest Rate. If the relevant Final Terms specify a Maximum Interest Rate for any Interest Period, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest Period determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii) above is greater than such Maximum Interest Rate, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be such Maximum Interest Rate. (iv) Determination of Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amounts The Fiscal Agent will at or as soon as practicable after each time at which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, determine the Rate of Interest for the relevant Interest Period. The Fiscal Agent will calculate the amount of interest (the \" Interest Amount \") payable on the Floating Rate Notes in respect of the Sp ecified Denomination for the relevant Interest Period. Each Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Rate of Interest to the Specified Denomination, multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction and rounding the resultant figure to t he nearest sub -unit of the relevant Specified Currency, half of any such sub-unit being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention. \"Day Count Fraction \" means, in respect of the calculation of an amount of interest for any Interest Period: (1) if \"Actual -Actual \" or \" Actual -365 (FBF) \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the actual number of calendar days in the Interest Period divided by 365 (or, if any portion of that Interest Period falls in a leap year, the sum of (A) the actual number of calendar days in that portion of the Interest Period falling in a leap year divided by 366 and (B) the actual number of calendar days in that portion of the Interest Period falling in a non -leap year divided by 365); (2) if \"Actual -365 (Fi xed)\" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the actual number of calendar days in the Interest Period divided by 365; (3) if \"Actual -Actual (FBF) \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the fraction whose numerator is the actual number of calendar days elapsed during such period and whose denominator is 365 (or 366 if 29 February falls within the Interest Period). If the Interest Period is of a duration of more than one (1) year, the basis shall be calculated as follows: (x) the number of complete years shall be counted back from the last calendar day of the Interest Period; and (y) this number shall be increased by the fraction for the relevant period calculated as set out in the first paragraph of this definition; (4) if \"Actual -360\" is specified in the rel evant Final Terms, the actual number of calendar days in the Interest Period divided by 360; (5) if \"30-360\", \"360-360\" or \" Bond Basis \" is specified in the relevant Final Terms, the number of calendar days in the Interest Period divided by 360, calculated on a formula basis as follows: Day Count Fraction = 360) ()] (30[)] ( 360[1 2 1 2 1 2 D YYx 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 66- 36-40620607 where: \"Y1\" is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first calendar day of the Interest Period falls;

(v) Notification of Rate of Interest and Interest Amounts The Fiscal Agent will cause the Rate of Interest and each Interest Amount for each Interest Period and the relevant Interest Payment Date to be notified to the Issuer and any stock exchange on which the relevant Floating Rate Notes are for the time being liste d and notice thereof to be published in accordance with Condition 12 ( Notices ) as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Paris Business Day (as defined in Condition 5(b)(i)) thereafter. Each Interest Amount and Int erest Payment Date so notified may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without prior notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Period. Any such amendment will be promptly notif ied to the Issuer, each stock exchange on which the relevant Floating Rate Notes are for the time being listed and to Holders of Notes in accordance with Condition 12 ( Notices ). (vi) Certificates to be Final All certificates, communications, opinions, determina tions, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of this Condition 5(b), whether by the Fiscal Agent or, if applicable, the Calculation Agent, shall (in the absence of wilful default, bad f aith or manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Fiscal Agent, the Calculation Agent (if applicable), the other Paying Agents and all Holders of Notes and Coupons and (in the 3601 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 68- 36-40620607 absence as aforesaid) no liability to the Issuer, the Holders of Notes and t he Coupons shall attach to the Fiscal Agent or the Calculation Agent (if applicable) in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions pursuant to such provisions. (c) Accrual of Interest Each Note (or in the case of the redemption of part only of a Note that part only of such Note) will cease to bear interest (if any) from the date for its redemption unless, upon due presentation thereof, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such event, interest will continue to accrue until whichever is the earlier of: (i) the date on which all amounts due in respect of such Note have been paid; and (ii) five calendar days after the date on which the full amount of the moneys payable has been received by the Fiscal Agent and notice to that effect has been given in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices ). (d) CNY Notes Notwithstanding the foregoing, each CNY Note which is a Fixed Rate Note bears interest from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date at the rate per annum e qual to the Rate of Interest. For the purposes of calculating the amount of interest, if any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day unless it would thereby fall into the next calendar month in which case it shall be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest will be payable in arrear on each Interest Payment Date. The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Hong Kong time) on each Interest Determination Date, calculate the amount of interest payable per Specified Denomination for the relevant Interest Period. The determination of the amount of interest payable per Specified Denomination by the Calculation A gent shall (in the absence of manifest error and after confirmation by the Issuer) be final and binding upon all parties. The Calculation Agent will cause the amount of interest payable per Specified Denomination for each Interest Period and the relevant I nterest Payment Date to be notified to each of the Paying Agents and to be notified to Noteholders as soon as possible after their determination but in no event later than the fourth Business Day thereafter. The amount of interest payable per Specified Den omination and Interest Payment Date so published may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Period. If the Notes become due and p ayable under Condition 10 ( Events of Default and Repayment Events ), the accrued interest per Specified Denomination shall nevertheless continue to be calculated as previously by the Calculation Agent in accordance with this provision but no publication of the amount of interest payable per Specified Denomination so calculated need be made. Unless otherwise agreed in the relevant Final Terms, interest shall be calculated in respect of any period by applying the Rate of Interest to the Specified Denomination, multiplying such product by the actual number of calendar days in the relevant Interest Period or, as applicable, other period concerned and dividing it by 365, and rounding the resultant figure to the nearest Renminbi sub -unit, half of any such sub -unit being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention. 6 PAYMENTS (a) Dematerialised Notes Payments of principal and interest in respect of Dematerialised Notes shall (in the case of Dematerialised Notes in bearer dematerialised form or administered registered form) be made by transfer to the account denominated in the relevant currency of the relevant Account Holders for the benefit of the Noteholders and, (in the case of Dematerialised Notes in fully registered form), to an account denominated in the relevant currency with a Bank (as defined below) designated by the Noteholders. Any payment validly made to any such Account Holders, or to any such Bank (as defined below) designated by any Noteholder, will be an effective discharge of the Issuer in respect of such payment. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 69- 36-40620607 (b) Materialised Notes Payments of principal and interest in respect of Materialised Notes shall, subject as mentioned below, be made against presentation and surrender during usual business hours of the relevant Material ised Notes (in the case of all other payments of principal and, in the case of interest, as specified in Condition 6(f)(v)) or Coupons (in the case of interest, save as specified in Condition 6(f)(v)), as the case may be, at the specified office of any Pay ing Agent outside the United States by a cheque payable in the relevant currency drawn on, or, at the option of the Noteholder, by transfer to an account denominated in such currency with, a Bank (as defined below). \"Bank \" means a bank in the principal fin ancial centre of the country for such Specified Currency or, in the case of euro, in a city in which banks have access to the TARGET 2 System.

This overview is based on the laws in force in France and the PRC as of the date of this Base Prospectus and is subject to any changes in law. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. Each pro spective holder or beneficial owner of Notes should consult its tax advisor as to the tax consequences of any investment in or ownership and disposition of the Notes and should not apply information set out below to other areas including (but not limited t o) the legality of transactions involving the Notes. French Tax Considerations 1. Pursuant to Article 125 A III of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts , payments of interest and other revenues made with respect to the Notes (other than Notes (described below) which are consolidated (assimilables for the purpose of French law) and form a single series with Notes issued prior to 1 March 2010 having the ben efit of Article 131 quater of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ) will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts unless such payments are made outside France in a non -cooperative State or te rritory (Etat ou territoire non coop\u00e9ratif) within the meaning of Article 238 -0 A of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts (a \"Non-Cooperative State \"). If such payments under Notes issued by the Issuer are made in a Non -Cooperative State, a 75 per cent. withh olding tax will be applicable (subject to certain exceptions and to the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts . Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the Fre nch Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts interest and other revenues on such Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer's taxable income, if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non -Cooperative State or paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State. Under certain conditions, any such non -deductible interest and other revenues may be recharacterised as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4 ts, in which case such non -deductible interest and other revenues may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts , at a rate of 30 per cent. or 75 per cent. (subject to the more favourable provision s of any applicable double tax treaty). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Law provides that neither the 75 per cent. withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts , nor the non -deductibility for tax purposes as set out under Article 238 A of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts to the extent the relevant interest and other revenues relate to a genuine transaction and are not abnormal or exaggerated in their amount, will apply in respect of a particular issue of Notes i f the Issuer can prove that the principal purpose and effect of such issue of Notes was not that of allowing the payments of interest or other revenues to be made in a Non -Cooperative State (the \" Exception \"). Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel de Finances P ubliques an issue of Notes will benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any proof of the purpose and effect of such issue of Notes if such Notes are: (i) offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L.411 -1 of the French Code mon\u00e9taire et financier or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a state other than an Non -Cooperative State. For t his purpose, an \"equivalent offer\" means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market authority; or (ii) admitted to trading on a regulated market or on a French or foreign multilateral securitie s trading system provided that such market or system is not located in a Non -Cooperative State, and the operation of such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or entity is not located in a Non -Cooperative State; or (iii) admitted, at the time of their issue, to the clearing operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561 -2 of the French Code mon\u00e9taire et financier , or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non -Cooperative State. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 102- 36-40620607 2. Payments of interest and other revenues w ith respect to Notes which are to be consolidated ( assimilables for the purpose of French law) and form a single series with Notes issued (or deemed issued) outside France as provided under Article 131 quater of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts , before 1 March 2010, will continue to be exempt from the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts . In addition, interest and other revenues paid by the Issuer on Notes which are to be consolidated ( assimilables for the purpose of French law) and form a single series with Notes issued (or deemed issued) outside France as provided under Article 131 quater of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts , before 1 March 2010 will not be subject to the withholding tax set out in Articl e 119 bis of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts solely on account of their being paid in a Non -Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in a Non -Cooperative State. 3. Pursuant to Articles 125A and 125 D of the French Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts and subject to certain exceptions, interest and other similar revenues received as from 1 January 2013 by individuals who are fiscally domiciled in France are subject to a 24 per cent. withholding tax, which is deductible from their pers onal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied by way of withholding tax at an aggregate rate of 15.5 per cent. on interest and other sim ilar revenues paid to individuals who are fiscally domiciled in France. PRC Taxation The holders of CNY Notes who are not resident in the PRC for PRC tax purposes will not be subject to withholding tax, income tax or any other taxes or duties imposed by a ny governmental authority in the PRC in respect of their CNY Notes or any repayment of principal and payment of interest made thereon. 193229 -3-1-v6.0 - 103- 36-40620607 SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE The Dealers have in an amended and restated dealer agreement (the \" Dealer Agreement \") dated 24 March 2016, agreed with the Issuer a basis upon which they or any of them may from time to time agree to subscribe or procure subscribers for Notes.
