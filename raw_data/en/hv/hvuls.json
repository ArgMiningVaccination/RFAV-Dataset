Thank patient. 5 Outline for Eliciting Medical History Introductory Data Patient name Age Personal physician Source of history and estimation of reliability HISTORY 1. Chief Concern/Co mplaint Elicit in the patient's own words, including the duration and elicit why the patient seeks help now (e.g., \"How can I be of help today? What would you like help with today? or, I unde rstand that you're here for...Cou ld you tell me more about that? \"-- \"What else?\") 2. History of the Present Illness Characteristics (OPQRST U) Onset Precipitating, Palliating,Place Quality Radiation Severity Temporal Understanding 6 Chronology Date and time of on set Tempo or mode of on set (acute, subacute, gradua l) Setting/Conte xt (physical setting, life change s) Duration Course since onset (stable, intermittent, progressive) Dete rmine if history of similar symptoms in the past Modifying Factors Precipitating and aggravating factors Relieving factors Effect of medications or treatment (self- prescribed or by others) Associated Symptom s Symptoms of the same organ system Symptoms of other organ systems Understanding : Elicit the Patient's Perspective [SEE APPENDIX 1] 1. Assess the patient's point view (\"explanato ry model(s) of hea lth & illness\") 2. Ask for the patient's ideas about his/her problem. 3. Ask about the patient's experiences. 4.

Do you think your health problems might be related to your work? Are your symptoms different at work and at home? Are you currently exposed to chemicals, dusts, metals, radiation, noise or repetitive work? Have you been exposed to chemicals, dusts, metals, radiation, noise or repetitive work in the past? Are any of your co-workers experiencing similar symptoms? If the answers to one or more of the se questions sugge st that a patient's symptoms are job related or that the patient has been exposed to hazardous material, a comprehen sive occupational history should be obtained. History (Note: this subject will be addressed in greater detail during PCM 2's Human Sexuality week): Number of relationships and duration [SEE APPENDIX 5] Sexual history - adapted from http:// www .aafp.org/afp/2002/1101/p1705.ht ml Questions about sexual health should be asked in a straightforward, yet sensitive manne r. If you are uncomfortable or believe the patient may feel uncomfortable discussing the sexual history, an explanation may be helpful. For example, consider saying, \"Sexual health is important to overall health; therefore, I always ask pat ients about it. If it's okay with you, I'll ask you a few questions about sexual matters now.\" Assurances of confidentiality may help, especially with adolescent patients or patients with more than one sexual partner. Avoid using terms that make assumptions about sexual beha vior or orientat ion. Ask about a patient's sexual orientation and use the term \"partner\" rather than \"boyfriend,\" \"girlfriend,\" \"husband,\" or \"wife.\" Ask patients how many partners they have rather than whether or not they are married and/or monoga mous. Patients will gene rally say that they are married and monog amous, if that is the case, when asked about partners. 13 Examples of que stions: Are you dating anybody? Are you currently in an intimate relationship? What's your level of commitment to your partner? Gender of significant other or partner Are you sexually active? Do you have sex with men, women, or both? Domestic Violence - when asking, normalize and be specific: e.g. \"Dome stic violence has become a public hea lth epidemic. It is important to ask pat ients about possible violence in their relationships. Within the past year, have you been kicked, slapped, or otherwise physically hurt by someone?\" In taking a sexual history, remember the five \"Ps\": Partners Sexual Practices Past STDs Pregnan cy history and plans Protection from STDs. 14 The following guidelines may be helpful in eliciting concerns about sexuality or gender identity: Do you have any sexual concerns or questions you'd like to discuss? Do you have any concerns or questions about your sexuality? Sexual identity? Or sexual desires? Are your sexual desires for men, women, or both? Do you feel comfortable with your sexuality and sexual identity? Use language mirroring the patient's language Sexual Orientat ion How do you identify in terms of sexual orientat ion? Do you think of yourself as: o Lesbian, gay or homosexual o Straight or heterosexual o Bisexual o Something else o Don't know 15 Are you attracted to/Have you had sexual contact with: Men Women Transgender Men Transgender Women Another Gender Identity \"In addition to sexual orientat ion, I also talk to all my patients about gender identity. Do you know what I mean by that?\" \"Some peop le may feel like their physical bodies do not match with the gender they most identify. For example, a biological male may identify as a woman. Knowing your gender identity also will allow me to care best for you.\" SEE APPENDIX 5 for follow-up gender identity questions 16 Military Service History Tell me about your military experience When and where do you / did you serve? What do you / did you do while in the service? How has military service affected you? If yes to above, obtain more detailed military health history (http:// www .va.gov/oaa/po cketcard/) WARRIORS [SEE APPENDIX 6] W - War and Military Experience A - Affect R - Relationships R - Risk Factors and Responses I - Injuries/Illnesses/Injustices Experienced O - Opportunities and Challenges Faced R - Resources, Suppo rts, and Interventions S - Service Delivery Experiences Developed : Robert C. Like, MD, MS, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Rutgers RWJMS 17 Habits - Health Promo tion and Disease Prevention What do you do to stay healthy and well? What beha vioral risk factors do you have? Exercise e.g. \"What is the most physically active thing you do in the course of a day? What ph ysical activities do you enjoy and how often do you do them?\" Diet (restrictions, consumpt ion of fast foods, attent iveness to labels on foods, calcium intake, caffeinated beverages) Sleep (is patient getting sufficient sleep? Is the difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep? Daytime sleepiness? Snoring? Tobacco (past or present, when started and quit, how many packs per day, chewing tobacco) Alcohol consumpt ion (drinks per day, the beverage ); present and past use Illicit Drugs marijuana, heroin, cocaine, etc; present and past use Screening for alcohol problems CAGE mnemonic Have you ever felt you shoul d Cut down? Have peopl e Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? Have you ever felt Guilty abou t your drinking? Have you ever neede d an Eye-opener (first drink in morning to steady nerves or get rid of hangove r) 18 Functional Status Assess ment [SEE APPENDIX 7] Are there any physical, beha vioral, or developmental disabilities? ADL's (activities of da ily living) are basic activities such as bathing and showering, personal hyg iene and grooming, dressing, toilet hygiene, functional mobility (e.g., transferring, walking, moving from one place to another, and self-feeding IADL's (instrumental ADL's) are more complex tasks requiring a combination of ph ysical and mental function such as using the telephone, preparing meals, arranging transportation, manag ing finances Any other mobility or functional challenge s? Patient Engagement (SEE APPENDIX 8) Health Confidence : How confident are you that you can control and manage most of yo ur health problems? (rating scale 1 -10) Health Information : How understandable and use ful is the information your doctors or nurses have given you about your health problems or concerns? (rating scale 1 -10).19 Commun ication Needs Assess ment: Heal th Literacy/Language/Disa bilities How comfortable are you with your ability to read, write, and/or unde rstand documents? Health Literacy Assessment Single Item L iteracy Screener (SILS): \"How often do you need to have someone help you when you read instructions, pamphlets, or other written material from your doctor or pharmacy?\" \"How comfortable do you feel with your ability to read? What is your primary or preferred language? What languages are spoken at home? Any special communication need s? (e.g., vision, hearing, kinesthetic, or other sensory challenge s) Any other intellectual or cognitive challenge s? Socio-Cultural History How would you self-identify in terms of your ethnicity/race/socio-cultural background? Birthplace/Count immigrant/refugee experiences? How was/is information about health, illness, and wellness communicated in your family and community? 20 Health promotion/disease prevention/wellness beha viors? What were your health and illness seeking beha viors? Any use of alternative/complementary medicine or folk healers? Spiritual History Faith and belief Importance and influence Member of group Wishes regarding palliative and end of life care/resuscitation Mnemonics for taking a spiritual history: FICA mnemonic F: Faith & Belief I: Address in Care http:// www .mywhatever.com/cifwriter/library/70/4966.ht ml HOPE mnemon ic H: Sources of hope O: Organized religion P: Personal spirituality & practices E: Effects on medical care and end-of-life issues (http:// www .aafp.org/afp/20010101/81.ht ml) 21 How to Elicit a Review of Systems (ROS) The purpose of the Review of Systems is to pursue symptoms which may be related to an undete rmined disease. It serves to remind patients of symptoms which they may have forgotten and to allow the physician to systematically review each organ system so that no significant symptoms will be overlooked. Some parts of the Review of Symptoms may be more appropriately elicited when determining the history of the present illness. The following list gives both the lay terms and the medical terms which should be used when completing the write-up. This list is not meant to be all-inclusive. A head to toe approach is used. A good way to begin the ROS is to ask the patient, \"How would you rate your overall health?\" (rating scale: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor) 22 General Heal th Energy level Weight loss or

(e.g., thought or sensory disturbances) THE PERFOR MANCE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE ADULT The written physical exam sequen ce follows a conventional order (see end of this book), but the actual physical examination may be pe rformed with multiple sequen ces depending upon the clinical situation , context, and venue . The gene ral principle is to develop your own approach, the one with which you are the most comfo rtable and the one that minimizes pat ient position change s. Ensuring comfo rt and patient privacy and commun icating what you are doing to the patient are paramount. Principles of Draping Patients for Physical Exams https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6oCdxISRCE Pay attention to the following 10 principles : consent, privacy, exposure, security, control, comfort, warmth, cult ural considerations, age & gender, respect 32 Here are several important tips : Always wash your hands before examining the patient . Explain what you are going to do and ask for permission to proceed with the physical exam . Briefly preface each part of the exam. Try to do as much of your exam as possible standing on the patient's r ight side. Use touch appropriately - a hand on the patient's shoulder while auscultating the heart can make the patient feel more comfortable. Be cognizant that your body parts are not inadvertently touching the patient. Maintain appropriate eye contact to assess for patient pain or discomfort during the exam . Do not take the patient's clothes/gown off, ask them to do it. You can offer to assist them in retying the gown after the exam is completed. Female patients should lift their left breast if you need t o examine the PMI. For breast exam s, one side should be draped while the other side is examined. The only time both sides should be simultaneously undraped is if you are specifically examining for symmetry. If a patient is wearing a gown and you need to ex amine the abdomen, it is more practical to drape the pelvis and bring the gown up (instead of draping the chest and bringing the gown down). For pelvic exam s, the patient should be fully gowned (with the gown extending as distally down the thighs as will a llow for a comprehensive exam). 33 The following is a sugge sted sequen ce when you encounter a patient lying supine in bed Patient lying supine in bed General appearance Facial expression Vital signs- (Use correct cuff size for blood pressure) Palpate blood pressure right arm Auscultate blood pressure right arm Auscultate blood pressure left arm Patient sitting up in b ed Orthostatic vital signs Orthostatic changes left arm Patient sitting with legs dangling o ff side of bed Vital signs Radial pulse for rate and regularity Respiratory rate and patte rn Head Inspect cranium (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital) Palpate cranium Inspect hair Palpate hair Inspect scalp 34 Face Inspect face Inspect skin on face Eyes Visual acuity both eyes (pocket Snellen's Chart) Inspection of external eye structures Visual fields both eyes Eye alignment both eyes Pupillary response to light both eyes Extraocular muscle function both eyes Test for convergence Ophtha lmoscopic examination both eyes Ears Inspect external ear structures both sides Palpate external ear structures both sides Check auditory acuity both sides Perform Rinne's test both sides Perform Weber's test Perform otoscopic examination both sides Inspect external canal both sides Inspect tympanic membrane both sides Nose Inspect nose Palpate nasal skeleton Palpate frontal ethmoid and maxillary sinuses 35 Inspect nasal septum both sides Inspect turbinates both sides Test olfactory nerve function (this will not typically be part of routine testing) Mouth Inspect outer and inner surfaces of lips Inspect buccal mucosa Inspect gingivae Inspect teeth Observe Stenson's and Wharton's ducts Inspect hard palate Inspect soft palate Inspect tongue Test hypoglossal nerve function Inspect floor of mouth Palpate floor of mouth Palpate tongue Inspect tonsils both sides Inspect posterior pharyngeal wall Observe uvula as patient says \"Ah\" Test gag reflex Rema inder of Cranial Nerve exam should be done as part of the Neurologic Exam. 36 Neck Inspect neck both sides Palpate neck both sides Evaluate position of trachea Palpate lymph nodes of head and neck (occipital, posterior posterior cervical, auricular) Palpate thyroid thyroid gland by posterior approach Palpate supraclavicular lymph nodes both sides Posterior chest Inspect back Palpate back for tende rness on vertebral column and both sides Test for costovertebral angle tende rness Evaluate chest excursion both sides Test for tactile fremitus both sides Percuss posterior chest both sides Evaluate diaphragmatic excursion right side Auscultate posterior chest to mid -axillary line both sides 37 Sacrum Test for edema Test for sacroiliac joint tende rness Anterior chest Inspect posture Inspect configuration of the chest (sternum, ribs) Inspect chest both sides Test for tactile fremitus both sides Auscultate anterior chest both sides Female Breast (dune under supervision) Inspect breasts, both sides Inspect breasts du ring maneu vers to tense pectoral muscles Heart (sitting) Inspect for abno rmal chest movements Palpate for point of maximal impulse -

A mnemonic that can help you remember the exam is ABC STAMP LICK (adapted from Robinson, D.J. (1997 ). Brain calipers: A guide to a successful mental status exam. London, Ontario: Canada. Rapid Psychler Press.) A Appearance 1. Overall gestalt: What impression does the patient make? 2. Note particular aspects of appea rance (grooming, dress) B Behavior/Psychomotor activity 1. Note nonverbal beha vior during the exam 2. Note beha vior/attitude toward the exam C Cooperation Take note if/how coope rative patient is S Speech and Language Evaluate stream of speech and comprehen sion T Though t Ideat ion (HI)? Delusions? A Affect Evaluate affect (affect quality is your impression on how he/she feels). 42 M Mood Evaluate mood (ask patient to rate on scale of 1- 10). P Perceptions Is the patient experiencing hallucinations? illusions? L Level of consciousness Evaluate orientat ion to person, place and time I Insight 1. Assess \"good\" versus \"limited\" C Cognitive (Higher Order) Functioning 1. Assess recent and remote memory 2. Assess attent ion 3. Assess judgment 4. Assess abstract thought, calculation ability, object recognition, praxis K Knowledge base (Be aware that some questions may be culturally biased). Depression Screening [SEE APPENDIX 8] Neurologic: Mental Status Exam overlaps with components assessed in Psychiatric Mental Status Exam. Cranial Nerves: Optic, Oculomotor, Trochlear and Abducens Cranial Nerves assessed Exam. Assess muscles of mastication and forehead/ maxillary perioral/chin regions for sensation (trigeminal). Assess eyelids closure and smile strength/ symmetry (facial). 43 Hearing assessed per Ears Exam (Vestibulococclear). Assess symmetric palate elevation (Glossopha ryngea l; Vagus). Assess head turn (sternocleidomastoid) and shrug (trapezius) strength (Spinal Accessory, Hypoglossal). Motor: Palpate to assess muscle bulk and tone. Observe for extra movements at rest and with actions (e.g. tremor). Use confrontat ion testing to assess muscle strength at each deltoid, elbow, wrist, grip, hip, knee, ankle and big toe. Assess finger dexterity. Reflexes: Test using reflex hammer at each tendon of triceps, biceps, brachioradialis, patella, Achilles posterior ankle. Elicit for Babinski response. Coordination/Cerebellar : Assess for hands rapid alternating movements, finger-to-nose, heel- to-shin. Sensation: Assess for distal limbs primary sensation using cold tuning fork, light touch, two-point discrimination, pin sharp vs. dull, vibration, and joint proprioception. Assess cortical higher order senses by double simultaneous sensation of light touch on limbs (extinction, neglect), graphe sthesia (tracing number on palm), ability to ID dime versus quarter in fingers with eyes closed (stereogno sis). Assess Romberg sign. 44 Gait/Stance: assess stance, posture, stability, leg swing, tandem gait, heel and toe walking. Muscu loske letal: It is fine to comb ine elements of sensorimoto r neurologic exam with musculoskele tal exam when assessi ng at shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, hip, knee and ankle. Neck (Musculoskele tal System) Test range of motion and strength both sides Hands and Wrists (Musculoskele tal) Inspect hand and wrist both sides Inspect nails both sides Palpate shoulder joint both sides Palpate interphalangeal joints both sides Palpate metacarpopha langeal joints both sides Elbows Inspect elbows both sides Test range of motion both sides Palpate both sides Shoulders Inspect both sides Test range of motion both sides Palpate shoulder joint both sides 45 Shins Inspect both sides Test for edema both sides Feet and Ankles (Musculoskele tal and Nervous System) Inspect feet and ankles Test range of motion both sides Palpate Achilles tendon both sides metata rsal heads both sides Palpate ankle and foot joints both sides Knees (Musculoskele tal and Nervous System) Inspect both sides Test range of motion both sides Palpate patella both sides Ballot patella if effusion is suspected Test patellar reflex both sides Patient standing with back to exami ner Hips Inspect hips Test range of motion Spine (Musculoskele tal) Inspect spine Palpate spine Test range of motion 46 In this course the exami nation of the genitalia will only be performed under supervision. The following suggests a method to include these examinations within the sequence of the full exam. While still lying supine with bed flat Male genitalia Inspect skin and hair distribution Observe inguinal area while instructing patient to bear down Inspect penis Inspect scrotum Palpate for inguinal nodes both sides Elevate scrotum and inspect perineum Have man stand in front of seated examiner Male genitalia Inspect penis Inspect external urethral meatus Palpate shaft of pen is testicle both sides Palpate epididymis and vas deferens both sides Observe inguinal area while instructing patient to bear down Test superficial cremasteric reflex 47 Transilluminate any masses Palpate for hernias both sides Have man turn around and b end o ver bed Rectum Inspect anus Inspect anus stool for occult blood Rectum can also be examined with patient lying on side (Sim's position) in both males and females. 48 Help woman to the lithotomy position Female Genitalia Inspect skin and hair of Bartholin's glands both sides Inspect perineum Test for pelvic relaxation Perform speculum examination Inspect cervix Obtain Pap smear Inspect vaginal walls Perform bimanual examination Palpate cervix and body rectovaginal septum Check stool for occult blood 49 The Pediatric Patient History and Physical Examination General: Pediatric patients are represented by four major clinical distinct age catego ries: 1) Newborn - 0-6weeks 2) Infant -toddler- 8weeks- 3 years 3) Child - 3-10 years 4) Adolescent - 10 - 17 years Major differences in the history and physical examination for pediatric patients are the following: - History is given by parent or caregiver - Growth and developmental are essential parts of the history and physical assessments - Vital signs vary with age - Examination for congenital abno rmalities is important Consideration of the developmental stage of the patient is key in performing a successful pediatric examination. 50 THE PERFORMANCE OF A NEWBORN HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION History: It is important to start with the mother's prenatal history and maternal history as any factor that affects the mother may have manifestations in the newborn. Maternal history - Any chronic illnesses Prenatal History: Ident ify any risk factors such as - smoking, medications, alcohol, drugs of abu se, prescription drugs, non- prescription medications, any sexually transmitted diseases, HIV status, Hepat itis immunity, Rube lla immunity. Prenatal care - duration, complications, abno rmal bleeding, restrictions, surgeries Illnesses during pregnancy diabete s, hypertension, seizures Previous pregnancies - Twins, multiple births. Gravida # #living Type delivery - vaginal, caesarean section Complications 51 Newborn History: Birth weight - and approximate gestational age Nutrition -Breast or formula fed Problems in the newborn period such as prematurity, respiratory distress, jaund ice (if yes when and how treated?) and infections. Immunizations given Surgeries Medications and allergies Physical Exami nation of Newborn The challenge for performing the newborn exam is to remember three important points: 1) Look for congen ital abno rmalities 2) remember to keep newborn warm while examining 3) Gentle hand ling Plot parameters - head circumference, weight, and length see if infant is Appropriate for gestational age (AGA) , small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA) 52 The newborn exami nation can be performed in the crib, bassinet or on the examining table. Approach to newborn: Appearance: 1) observe newborn in resting state- gene ral appea rance, color, size, morpholog ic features 2) look for signs of acute or chronic illness as evidenced by skin color, respiration, hydration ,cry Vital signs: - Look at variation in respiratory rate, heart rate for newborn, refer to table for upper and lower limits of normal General Physical exami nation: We often recommend starting with the heart while the infant is quiet in order to fully appreciate any abno rmal heart sounds such as murmurs. HEENT: Head: - Observe measure, and describe head size and shape, symmetry, facial features, ear position, dysmorphic features - Palpate Anterior fontane l, posterior fontanel and sutures 53 Eyes: - Ident ify the red reflex Nose: - Patency of na res, flaring, mucus Mouth : - Abnormalities in development palate, lip, gums Neck: - Any abno rmal clefts, ral tympanic membranes usually not visualized, look for normal shape, external - Observe, measure and interpret rate, patte rn and effort of breathing - Ident ify normal variations of respiration and signs of respiratory distress, grunting, flaring, retractions - Listen to breath sounds - Observe and describe breast tissue- 54 Cardiovascular: Heart: - Listen for heart sounds S1,S2, any extra heart sounds - (can be normal in newborn) listen for Murmurs, rubs - Ident ify pulses in upper and lower extremities - Observe precordial activity - Ident ify central versus peripheral cyanosis - Assess capillary perfusion Abdom en: - Assess observation, auscultation, palpation - Palpate, liver, spleen Umbilical: - hernia, infection Genitalia: - Examine for appea rance of Lab ia majora, genitalia) - Males palpate of pen is for placement of urethra - Look for any misplaced urethral open ing (hypospadias) 55 Rectal: - Examine for paten and tissue appea rance (imperforate anus) Extremities: - Examine the hips of a newborn for developmental dysplasia of the hip using Ortolani and Barlow maneu vers. Back: - Examine the back for any defects and abno rmal tufts of ha ir, sacral dimples, pits, or masses Neurologic: - Elicit the primitive reflexes- Moro, Palmer and - - - - Plantar grasp, suck, rooting, babinski - Assess the tone- in gene ral should be able to form a \"C\" when held by stomach, and arms should not slip through grasp - Assess developmental for age- fix and follow Skin: - Describe and assess turgor, perfusion, color, hypo and hyperpigmented lesions and rashes through and palpation - Ident ify jaund ice, petechiae, purpura, bruising, vesicles 56 THE PERFORMANCE OF AN INFANT-TODLER (8 WEEKS TO 3 YEARS) HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Infant -Toddler - (8weeks - 3 years) History: As with the newborn history it is important to review mother's prenatal history and the birth history and neonatal course. Growth: Any problems with weight, height, head growth Developmental history is important and should focus on relevant milestones for gross motor, fine motor, social, and communication. Nutrition history should include type of feedings- breast, bottle, - frequen cy and amounts. If solids are included in the diet it is important to know what they are eating, when, how (spoon, bottle) and quant ity. Any problems noted with particular foods. Sleep history is important where does the infant/child sleep, how many hours, naps Elimination - frequen cy of urination, stools and description. 57 Behavior, tantrums, difficulties, how parents perceive their beha vior. Immunization history and preventive screenings. Physical Examination: It is important to consider the developmental stage in determining how to approach the physical examination. With infants the focus of examination is to detect any congen ital defects or acquired problems. In gene ral most infants can be examined on the table without difficulty until around 9 months. After 9 months infants might have stranger anxiety and separation from the parent may not be tolerated. In this case examination may be performed while the child is held by the parent for most of the examination. In gene ral the examination should include: Growth parameters - Head circumference (until age 2 years), weight and length should be measured and plotted on the growth curve. General appearance - How does the infant/todd ler appear Head - Anterior fontane lle, size -shape (closes 12- 18 months), posterior fontane lle closes 6 weeks. Observe head shape. 58 HEENT- Eyes - red reflex-, papillary response to light (strabismus- around 4 months age) , track and follow all ages. Fundo light bony landmarks Nose - position and contour of septum, color of mucous membranes, inferior and ates, site of maxillary and ethmoid sinuses Neck - adenopath y, mobility, masses Chest - asymmetry - Lung s- auscultate breath sounds Heart - Listen for murmurs, Normal heart sounds -S1S2 Abdom en - masses, capillary of ha ir, dimples, curvature. 59 THE ADOLESCENT HEALTH HISTORY HEADSS: The \"Review of Systems\" for Adolescents H - Home E - Education A - Activities/Employment D - Drugs S - Suicidality S - Sex http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2005/03/ cprl1-0503.ht ml 60 THE WRITTEN P HYSICAL EXAMINATION (The written history follows the framewo rk and should precede the written physical examination.) Objective recording of findings of inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation. TIPS: be specific about abno rmalities, use drawings, metric measurements of lesions, report findings not diagno stic impressions. The following gives a gene ral framework to record your examination. It is by no means meant to be all inclusive. General appearance (statement of gene ral appea rance and gene ral health) Vital signs temperature-record route, blood pressure both arms, orthostatics, respiratory rate, pulse Skin (skin, nails, hair)-color, temperature, turgor, moisture; presence of skin lesions, fields, (size in mm, equa shape, reactivity to light and accommodation PERRL) ophtha lmoscopic findings including disc (sharpness of disc margin and cup to disc ratio), vessels, retina, macula 61 Ears-gross assessment of hea ring, external (pinnae, canal, (air sinuses Throat-breath if indicated, quality of voice, color of lips, buccal mucosa, presence and quality of and elevates normally), is gag reflex intact Neck -range of motion (full or limited) trachea (midline), neck vein distension, carotids (pulse, bruits), thyroid (gene ral enlargement, mass) Chest-AP diameter (increased or decreased), respiratory excursion, percussion (resonant or dull), tactile fremitus increased or decreased, auscultation (clear, listen of breathing Breasts-symmetry, masses, dimpling, discharge 62 Heart-location of po int of maximal impulse, presence of heaves or thrills, is rhythm regular with regular rate or irregularly irregular, intensity and duration of S1 S2, splitting, presence of S 3 S4, murmurs with their grade, site of loude st intensity, radiation, presence of rubs, gallop Vascular-quality of pu lses (carotid, arteries, edema en-scapho id or obese, distension, skin lesions, visible pulsations, presence and quality of bo wel sound s, note guarding, tende rness, rigidity, percussion note, span of liver, is spleen tip palpable, are kidneys palpable Back size and consistency of prostate gland, sphincter tone, masses, bleeding, check for occult blood (Generally deferred during routine examination) Genitalia-Defer during your routine examination Male: circumcised, lesions, discharge, testicular or epididymal mass, inguinal hernia 63 Female: comment genitalia, speculum visualization of cervix and vagina, bimanual exam motion tende rness, uterus, adne xae Lymph atic-note presence of adenopathy in all chains.

For the purpose of this course, you should just synthesize information regarding the chief comp laint and attempt to construct a differential diagnosis for the chief concern/complaint. Ultimately as you progress through your training and into clinical practice, the history and physical will take a more focused form. For patients who have multiple medical problems, you may need to do this for each problem. After eliciting historical data and performing a physical examination, you need to \"put it all togethe r.\" After documenting the history and the physical examination, write a summary synthesizing the information gathe red in the history of the present illness, including findings, pertinent negat ive and positive. Enumerate a Problem List (after the summary) Develop an Assessment for each problem Include a differential diagno sis. The differential diagno sis should include the most likely, the most serious, the most treatab le and the unusual for a patient of this age. Consider also the potent ial unde rlying pathoph ysiology Include a brief diagno stic/manage ment plan. Consider biopsychosocial hypothe ses you gene rated as you elicited the history. 66 The mnemonic SCUT can be helpful: Serious - what is serious? Common - what is common? Unusual - what is unu sual? Treatab le - what is treatab le? Another useful differential diagno sis mnemonic is I VINDIC ATE: I - Iatrogenic I - Infection/In flammatory N - Neop lasm D - Degenerative I - Idiopathic C - Congen ital A - Autoimmune E (metabolic) http://www.fammedref.org/mnemonic/differential -diagnosis abno rmal findings? Can they be clustered? E.g. fever, cough, chest pain and wheezing Interpret the findings and give the likely differential Consider tests you would want to perform and initial manage ment. 67 EXAMPLE: In summa ry, the patient is a 24 y/o fema le with a history of mild asthma presenting with two days of fever, productive cough, and right-sided chest pain with diffuse whee zing and rales on the right side posteriorly. PROBLEM LIST: 1. Cough/Fever 2. History of Asthma The most common etiology for these findings is an acute exacerbation of asthma precipitated by pneumon ia. The most serious is acute anaph ylaxis. The most unusual is super infection or rheumato logic disorder. The most treatab le is a comm unity acquired pneumon ia with asthma. DX: Diagno stic plan includes : pulse oximetry, measurement of peak expiratory flow, a PA and Lateral CXR, sputum for gram stain and culture. RX: Managemen t/treatment albuterol inhaler , oral ant ibiotics. ED: Patient education - assess patient's health confidence and understanding of and ability to adhere with management/treatment p lan for pneumonia and asthma, insure adequate hydration, recommend any needed home or environmental assessments/ interventions, address any additional questions or concerns patient may have . DISP: Disposition - schedule appropriate follow -up visits and wh at to do if symptoms persist or worsen . 68 [These Appendices are frameworks and not meant to be memorized.] APPENDIX 1 Elicit the Patient's Perspective 1. Assess the patient's point of view (\"explanatory mod el(s) of health \"Inquiring about a patient's or family's explanato ry model works best in the context of a meaningful relationship. The inquiry is best initiated with a statement of respect such as, \"I know different peop le have very different ways of unde rstanding illness...Please help me unde rstand how you see things.\" EPERC - End of Life/Palliative Resource Cente r.

Selected Illness Explanatory Model Questions \"What do you call your problem?\" \"What do you think is causing your problem?\" \"Why do you think it started when it did?\" \"How bad is your illness? Do you believe it will last a long or short time?\" What does your illness do to you? How does it work?\" Arthur Kleinman, MD, Harvard M edical School 69 2. Ask for the patient's ideas about his/her problem. \"Is there anything special about your problem that worries or concerns you?\" (\"hidden agendas\") 3. Ask about the patient's experiences. \"Have you ever had this problem before? What have you done to treat this so far?\" \"Has anyone else in your family, friends, or other peop le you know had this problem? What did they do?\" \"Have you ever read or heard anything about this problem in the media?\" 4. Explore the impact on the patient's life. Check context: \"How has the illness affected your daily activities/work/family?\" \"What are the main problems your illness has caused for you?\" \"What do you fear most about your illness?\" Elicit patient specific requests and goals. Determine the patient's goal I seeki ng care: \"When you were thinking about this visit, how were you hoping I could help.\" or \"What type of treatment do you think you should receive? What are the most important results you want to achieve?\" 70 APPENDIX 2 ETHNIC: A FRAMEWORK FOR CULTURALLY COMPETENT CLINICAL PRACTICE E: Explanation What do you think may be the reason you have these symptoms? What do friends, family, others say about these symptoms? Do you know anyone else who has had or who has this kind of problem? Have you heard about/ read/see it on TV/radio/newspape r/internet? (If pat ient cannot offer explanation, ask what most concerns them about their problems.) T: Treatment What kinds of medicines, home remedies or other treatments have you tried for this illness? Is there anything you eat, drink, or do (or avoid) on a regular basis to stay healthy? Tell me about it. What kind of treatment are you seeking from me? 71 H: Heale rs Have you sough t any advice from a lternative/folk healers, friends or other peop le (non-doctors) for help with your problems? Tell me about it. N: Negotiate Negot iate options that will be mutually acceptab le to you and your patient and that do not contradict, but rather incorporate your patient's beliefs. I: Intervention Dete rmine an intervention with your patient. May Include incorporation of alternative treatments, spirituality, and healers as well as other cultural practices (e.g. foods eaten or avoided in gene ral, and when sick). C: Collaboration Collaborate with the patient, family members, other Health care team members, healers and community resources. Adapted from: Levin, SJ, Like, RC and Gottlieb, JE.

A: Affect (The feeling state) Asking \"How do you feel about what is going on?\" or \"What is your mood?\" allows the patient to report and label the current feeling state. T: Trouble \"What about the situation troubles you the most?\" helps the physician and patient focus, and may bring out the symbolic significance of the illness or event. H: Handling \"How are you hand ling that?\" gives and assessment of functioning and provides psychological suppo rt. From: Stuart MR, Liebe rman, JA (FRW).
