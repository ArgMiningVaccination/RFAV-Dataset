This community assessment results from a joint project of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) and the County of Hawaii Research and Development Department, to understand the market potential of this underserved area to incent and support broadband infrastructure investment. The assessment study was funded through the use of planning funds awarded to DCCA under a federal State Broadband Initiative grant. The community assessment is intended to serve as a resource for potential broadband service providers and for other stakeholders who may use it to identify possible public-private projects to extend service residents in the Hamakua District. It provides a comprehensive list of community characteristics and broadband needs. Information in the report was collected from, among other sources, public listening sessions held in the Hamakua District. We hope that you will find this community assessment useful. Please feel free to contact DCCA through its Cable Television Office ((808) 586-2620) ifthere are any questions regarding this project, as well as to discuss other opportunities to collaborate on broadband adoption and infrastructure projects to extend broadband service to consumers in underserved areas across the State.

Community institutional inventory 303Executive Summary In December 2014, the Hawai'i County Research and Development department, in cooperation with the state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA), commissioned the present study in order to better understand the probability of broadband adoption if services become available in previously unserved and underserved areas of Hawai'i Island. The district of H\u00e4m\u00e4kua, given its remote location and low population density, was selected as the site of the study. The economics of broadband usually drives availability and this study sought to identify hidden pockets within the community that appeared more prepared than others to adopt broadband service at market prices and determine whether a nascent e-commerce community exists. In order to address these questions, a comprehensive list of community characteristics and district needs were developed based on state and county data, public listening sessions and project team visits to the area. The study found H\u00e4m\u00e4kua in transition from its former agricultural economy to a service economy, anchored by the regional flavor of the district and geared toward authentic visitor experiences. H\u00e4m\u00e4kua appeared to be generally well served by Internet service providers, particularly in the area surrounding Honoka'a, the district's population and commerce center. However, communities on the northern and southern fringes of the district, such as \u00c4hualoa, Waipi'o Valley, Pa\u00ffauilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4, are either unserved by service providers or paying for broadband service but experiencing average Internet speeds far below 4 Mbps. But community leadership in support of technology in Pa\u00ffauilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4, in particular, is vibrant, suggesting that a collaborative community effort could be leveraged to market high-speed broadband services in the area. 4Introduction The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) published the Hawai'i Broadband Strategic Plan providing information and a framework for the creation of policies and programs to address the challenges faced in meeting both state and national broadband goals. One of the three primary goals identified in the plan is to ensure availability of broadband to all Hawai'i residents at affordable prices. The plan reported that the gap in availability of high-speed service among Hawai'i communities is decreasing, but the challenge for ubiquitous access remains significant, particularly in areas on the islands of Hawai'i, Lana'i, Moloka'i, and isolated areas of Maui. This study examines broadband availability and adoption factors associated with communities unserved or underserved by privately owned fiber optic Internet networks because their distance from urban centers and low population densities make wired service unavailable or too expensive to provide relative to high-density urban areas. As was the case historically with electricity and telephone utilities, Internet providers generally do not extend service to distant and sparsely populated areas because of high fixed costs they are unable to distribute over a large enough ratepayer base in order to offer a price consumers are willing to pay. As a part of this study, community assessments were conducted to show the potential in these areas to supplement and support infrastructure investment in unserved and underserved communities. Broadband Economics In a typical market for Internet service, providers do not extend service to distant, topographically-challenged and sparsely populated areas because the total costs of providing broadband service exceeds expected revenue. Given this, it is unlikely (other things equal) that incumbent service providers will extend service to the more remote communities in Hawai'i without supplemental public or private funding for both upfront and ongoing expenses. Supply: the investment gap and population density In broadband economics, the investment gap is the difference between the total costs of developing a fiber optic network and the expected revenue to the utility for providing the service. Total costs are typically a function of initial capital expenses plus ongoing costs including (a) ongoing capital expenditures; (b) network operating expenses; and (c) selling, general and administrative expenses. 5Ongoing costs represent slightly more than half of total costs, such that subsidies (public or otherwise) underwriting the infrastructure costs of broadband alone are often insufficient to extend the service to unserved areas. Given this relationship, \"last mile\" (the distance between a terminal fiber optic network node in a community and a household) connections tend to depend more on the number of potential subscribers in an area, than the availability of supplemental funds. Thus, the investment gap (total cost > expected revenue) is greater in less densely populated communities. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimated that Hawai'i County has an investment gap of up to $20 million, which is reflective of its relatively low population density of 45.9 persons per square mile as compared to 211.8 persons per square mile statewide. Demand: pockets of unserved households in served communities. In most markets demand calls out supply and the market for broadband services is no different, except that, given the large investment gap, a significant increase in the demand for broadband Internet services is required before the service is extended across the last mile in less population-dense areas. Accordingly, unserved or underserved pockets can exist within a community otherwise served by an Internet provider. According to the 2011 Pew Internet and American Life Project, about 66% of U.S. adults have broadband Internet in their home. Although broadband adoption rates in Hawai'i are difficult to estimate (detailed subscriber data is considered proprietary), DCCA estimated Hawai'i adoption rates at about 75% based on service provider (Oceanic Time Warner Cable and Hawaiian Telcom) estimates of 70-80%, FCC estimated adoption rates at 74%, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) census survey data estimates a 69% adoption rate. The NTIA survey data, which includes Hawai'i, suggests that a majority (45.6%) of households in the sample did not have broadband by choice, and only 28.4% of the households without broadband cited availability (3.1%) or affordability (25.3%) for their non-adoption choice. 6 Reasons for Non-Adoption Don't Need/Not Interested 45.6% Too Expensive 25.3% No/Inadequate Computer Can Elsewhere 4.9% Not Available 3.1% Other 6.9% The NTIA report included a sub-sample of non-adopting households that use the Internet elsewhere. These data are particularly interesting because respondent's behavior reveals their demand for Internet service, but they do not seek an Internet connection at their home. In this sub-sample, a majority (38.7%) of respondents lack home broadband because it's expensive even as it appears to be available and 37.2% are not interested in a home connection or have inadequate home computers. Reasons for Non-Adopters Using the Internet Elsewhere Too Expensive 38.7% Don't Need/Not Interested 22.6% No/Inadequate Computer 14.6% Can Use Elsewhere 13.7% Not Available 1.7% Other 8.8% It's also interesting to note that only 13.7% of these households are non-adopters because they have access to high speed Internet outside of the home. Based on these results, reductions in Internet service prices combined with an effort to educate the market about trends toward e-commerce and the provision of other basic services online could increase broadband demand by shifting more than half of the non-adopters toward adoption of broadband services. An increasing demand for home broadband will provide a larger ratepayer base over which last mile fixed costs can be distributed resulting in, other things equal, increased broadband availability. 7H\u00e4m\u00e4kua Broadband Assessment Study The purpose of the study The Hawai'i County Research and Development department, in cooperation with the state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA), commissioned this study in order to (1) understand the probability of broadband adoption if services become available at market prices in previously unserved/underserved areas of Hawai'i Island; (2) identify and rank factors correlating with a high probability of broadband adoption; (3) identify underserved areas in a given community with large factor endowments correlated with a high probability of adoption; and (4) examine the potential for community collaboration and market development to expand broadband services. The H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district on the northeast corner of Hawai'i Island was selected as the sight of this study. Methodology The present study employed a two-phase data gathering approach. The first phase included the development of an inventory of businesses, public and private meeting places, government services, community organizations, and schools and libraries. The second phase included a description of community characteristics, which was derived from public listening sessions. These sessions provided residents and business owners the opportunity to share their thoughts regarding the need for broadband Internet in their community and the factors contributing to its adoption. Sessions were schedule by district in order to focus the discussion on local concerns as opposed to district-wide issues. The Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 session was particularly well attended, with participation dropping off substantially for the Honoka'a and \u00c4hualoa session. The Kukuihaele and Waipi'o Valley session did not attract any participants. Combined, 42 people (representing every community in the district except Waipi'o Valley) either participated in person at the sessions or through email responses to follow-up questions. Additional information for community characteristics was developed on the basis of information from the Hawai'i County Community Development Plan (CDP) planning process and by project team visits to the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district. H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district characteristics The H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district on the Island of Hawai'i is a remote location relative to large population centers in the Hilo and Kona districts and has a low population density in outlying areas such as Pa'auilo, Kal\u00f6p\u00e4, 8Waipi'o Valley and parts of \u00c4hualoa. These factors create pockets of unserved or underserved areas across the district. Demographics For the purposes of the present study, \"H\u00e4m\u00e4kua\" is bounded by the communities of Pa'auilo to the south and Waipi'o Valley and \u00c4hualoa to the northeast and north respectively, and inclusive of all the communities in between. The district's population and commerce center is the town of Honoka'a. The population of the district suffered a decline with the closing of the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua Sugar Co. in 1993 and stabilized by the 2010 U.S. census. Honoka'a and \u00c4hualoa (2,258 people) account for a large majority of the district population with significantly lower populations in outlying areas such as Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 (571 people) and Kukuihaele and Waipi'o Valley (317 people). Current residents sense an increasing trend in population growth evidenced by an influx of new neighbors and the re-opening of many Honoka'a town storefronts. The state of Hawai'i projects a 1.7% annual growth rate for the district over the next 20 years, slightly outpacing the projected Hawai'i county annual growth rate of 1.6% and double the projected statewide population growth rate (0.8%) over the same period. The increase in population is coincident with a shift in land use for the district. Historically, requests for county building permits reflected development in the agricultural zone. However, in 2010, building permits in the residential zone surpassed those issued in the agricultural zone, signaling a trend toward a residential (as opposed to farming) lifestyle. Additionally, newer H\u00e4m\u00e4kua residents appear to have higher levels of disposable income (based on anecdotal evidence of conspicuous consumption) and the propensity to maintain a home office or conduct home-based businesses, as evidenced during the listening sessions. Availability of broadband in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua on Hawai'i Island In the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district, Waipi'o Valley and parts of \u00c4hualoa are distinct for being unserved by broadband providers. On the other side of the district, Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 are served by Hawaiian Telcom who offers DSL broadband service but in practice delivers less than broadband speeds. By contrast, Honoka'a and nearby areas have access to high speed Internet at reported download rates at least as high as 30 Mbps. 9The project team further assessed the availability of broadband in Pa'auilo, \u00c4hualoa and Kukuihaele by engaging Hawaiian Telecom and Oceanic Time Warner Cable websites to determine whether services are available at randomly selected addresses in these communities. The Hawaiian Telcom online system prompts customers in Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 to contact a sales representative by phone for Internet plans, mirroring claims made by participants in the listening sessions. Figure 1. Areas shaded in red represent regions unserved by broadband service. The Oceanic Time Warner Cable online system offered service for Kukuihaele and most of \u00c4hualoa with download speeds ranging from 15 Mbps to 100 Mbps depending on the plan. Broadband service in \u00c4hualoa appears to be restricted to addresses along or closely adjacent to the vicinity of the highway commonly advertise high speed Internet on the premises, and bed and breakfasts significantly off the highway (such as Waianuhea) advertise satellite Internet service, which (at residential levels) is significantly more expensive and less consistent than other wireline options, suggesting its adoption is related to the unavailability of a wireline alternative. It's worth noting that several addresses in Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4, including one known by the project team to receive Internet service from Oceanic Time Warner Cable, were not recognized by either online system, suggesting that inaccurate (Google-based) maps of these areas may be partially responsible for the results of these online searches for Internet availability. Community development plans The 2005 County of Hawai'i Revised General Plan established the Community Development Plan program (CDP). Community development plans translate broad General Plan goals, policies, and standards into actions as they apply to specific geographic regions around the island. The plans are also intended to serve as a forum for community input into land-use, delivery of government services and any other matter relating to the planning area. As represented in the CDP, H\u00e4m\u00e4kua includes all of the communities bounded by the present study, and thirteen other communities south of Pa'auilo including the district of North Hilo. According to the Hawai'i County Planning Department, previous plans were \"expert-driven\", but the present planning process recognizes that wide community involvement creates a plan where the community is empowered to contribute to the vision of their own future. And contrary to former practice, the county general plan now requires CDPs be adopted by the County Council as an ordinance, giving the plan the force of law. This is in contrast to plans created over past years that were adopted by resolution and served only as guidelines for decision-makers. The H\u00e4m\u00e4kua CDP planning process began in September 2009 and continues today. Current plan elements include land use, transportation, local economy, natural and cultural resource management, public access, public facilities and disaster readiness. The H\u00e4m\u00e4kua CDP is slated to be released in early summer 2015 and will consist of policy statements subject to the review of the CDP steering committee, community members and the County Council. 11Although the \u00c4hualoa Community Association identified the need for broadband Internet for the district as part of their contribution to the CDP process, telecommunications (including broadband) is presently neither a major component of the plan or mentioned as a necessary condition for implementing any of the plan elements. County planners recognized the omission, and the Department of Planning reports they are working on plan addenda about technology and the Internet, and draft statements will soon be available online at the county Planning Department website. Community leadership and support of technology At the present, community leadership and support for technology in the district appears strongest in the Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 communities in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua based on input gained from those communities during the listening sessions. The president of the Pa'auilo Mauka - Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 Community Association, Joe Clarkson, was instrumental in encouraging participation from its membership at the sessions and with follow-up requests for information made by the project team via email after the session. Overall, community members attending the session revealed a high degree of awareness of the issues resulting in their pocket of the district being underserved by the incumbent service provider, in this case Hawaiian Telcom. Although they all reported engaging with the utility in efforts to improve their Internet service (DSL), Clarkson in particular, displayed a sophisticated understanding of the constraints on the system that, according to the utility, is presently at full capacity, and offered potential solutions allowing for more DSL connections in the area. The \u00c4hualoa Community Association is led by Connie Fay who helped advertise and encouraged participation in the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua listening sessions. As previously noted, the association identified the need for high speed Internet access for H\u00e4m\u00e4kua during a visioning activity in support of the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua CDP. However, the \u00c4hualoa community participated in the sessions and follow-up requests for information to a far lesser degree than their Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 counterparts. Most areas in \u00c4hualoa, particularly along or adjacent to Old M\u00e4malahoa Hwy, appear to be adequately serviced by Oceanic Time Warner Cable, perhaps contributing to their relative indifference to the present study. Additionally, the community was engaged relatively late in the study and that may also have contributed to their reduced participation. Finally, it's believed that some residents in the district may be so frustrated by previous failed attempts to 12work with incumbent utilities to extend Internet service to their communities that they deem the present exercise hopeless. The study did not reveal any obvious instances of community leadership surrounding technology and the Internet other than in the unserved and underserved communities of Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4. As previously reported, current drafts of H\u00e4m\u00e4kua CDP plan components are silent on the technology or broadband needs in the district. Perhaps additional community leaders will rally around the need for improved technology and broadband service in the area as a result of the present county effort to include such references in future versions of the CDP. Economic base and instances of e-commerce Prior to the closing of H\u00e4m\u00e4kua Sugar Company in 1993, plantation scale mono-crop (sugar) agriculture and ranching activities formed the base of the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua economy, and local commerce revolved around the typical basic services required of small communities. Immediately following the closure, the local economy suffered as the population declined and the real and nominal income of those who remained decreased dramatically. The H\u00e4m\u00e4kua economy has rebounded since 1993 and the present study identified 264 total businesses registered to addresses in the project area. Current residents envision the foundation of their future economy as a vibrant local food production sector that generates economic opportunities while sustaining the rural lifestyle and sense of community in the district. H\u00e4m\u00e4kua hopes to capitalize on its unique \"regional flavor\" and encourages their business community to provide experiences that attract people to live in or visit the area and help stimulate local economic growth. In the district, many businesses are clustered around Honoka'a town with another smaller cluster in Pa'auilo, and a handful in Waipi'o Valley. And numerous other businesses operate from home offices dispersed throughout the community. In Honoka'a, which shares a zip code with \u00c4hualoa, Waipi'o Valley and Kukuihaele, 230 businesses were identified with the following stated primary purposes: services (83), retail (48), farms and ranches (32), production and wholesale (20), accommodations (10), tourism/entertainment (11), restaurants (11), health (8), and other (7). 13In the Pa'auilo zip code (which includes Kal\u00f6p\u00e4), 34 active businesses were identified representing the following sectors: services (10), farms and ranches (12), retail (7), and other (5). From this, it is evident that service (35.3%) and retail (20.8%) sectors are an important part of commerce for H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district, with food service, health, and tourism comprising 27% of district commerce, and agriculture and ranching accounting for just 16.7% of business registrations. Of the 264 registered businesses in the district, 99 Honoka'a entities and seven in Pa'auilo conduct business from a storefront or farm gate. And due to the rural nature of the community, many people have their own home businesses or offices, work on farms, provide a mobile service or sell their products to other H\u00e4m\u00e4kua businesses and in markets outside of the district. These types of businesses, without a storefront, account for 57% of all businesses registered in Honoka'a and 80% of the registered businesses in Pa'auilo. In addition to their storefronts, 20 businesses in Honoka'a and six businesses in Pa'auilo have websites soliciting online sales, representing about 25% of H\u00e4m\u00e4kua storefront sales. Additionally, 2 of 11 caf\u00e9s and restaurants in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua offer free Internet service for their customers. Of the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua businesses with an online presence, four use the Internet for taking reservations (e.g., B&B, Waipi'o ATV tours,) and about half of the remaining businesses offer a single specialty product (e.g., coffee, salt, clothing), while the other half sell multiple product lines (e.g., tea, skin products, wooden gifts, ceramics and furniture). The most common products offered for sale online are coffee and other value-added local agricultural products; clothing; health/beauty products; artisan goods; and assorted media such as books, CDs, MP3s. Additionally, one business sells unprocessed agricultural products (e.g. fresh fruit) and another sells \"adopted\" koa trees. Revenues for online sales in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua are not available, so it's difficult to compare the instances of online sales in the district to national e-commerce sales data. That being said, online sales revenue in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua as a percent of total sales may actually exceed national totals. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that online sales in the 3rd quarter of 2014 account for just 6.6% of total sales during the period. Whether H\u00e4m\u00e4kua online sales actually exceed national sales depends on the value of the products offered for sale through their websites. 14Existing work places of H\u00e4m\u00e4kua residents According to draft CDP documents from 2012, about 86% of the district labor force was employed, with most holding jobs in education, health, social services, arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodations or food service. And approximately 33% of these people travel more than an hour to work, suggesting that some of the employed travel as far as Hilo, Kona or beyond to their workplaces, even as a majority (67%) of H\u00e4m\u00e4kua residents work closer to home. Additionally, in a sub-sample of 12 employed people attending listening sessions in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua, 10 reported that they work from a home office at their residence. Although only a small percentage of H\u00e4m\u00e4kua jobs are presently in agriculture (8%), the community has identified diversified, sustainable farming as the focus of its preferred economic future. The goal is to capture some of the food dollars spent on produce grown in other communities while also creating an agro-tourism visitor base in support of local farms, ranching activities, and related agriculture experiences. Additionally, the natural and cultural resources in the district may present an opportunity to capture a visitor market and re-direct it to the expanding commerce experiences in Honoka'a town. Draft CDP documents indicated that very few visitor dollars are currently being spent in the district. Public access to broadband Public access to broadband in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua is extremely limited. A thorough inventory of public meeting places, private meeting places and businesses revealed just two public locations with general public access to broadband during regular operating hours: the Honoka'a Public Library and North Hawai'i Education and Research Center (NHERC). The Honoka'a Public Library offers Internet for Hawai'i State Library cardholders at four computer stations and Wi-Fi for personal laptops. The four computers connected to the Internet are used throughout the day, often with a person or two waiting in the queue. The facility's 5.23 Mbps download speed is slightly faster than the broadband threshold of 4 Mbps but the 0.22 Mbps upload speed is significantly slower than broadband standards of 1 Mbps. NHERC is a branch of the University of Hawai'i at Hilo located in Honoka'a. It primarily serves the people of Hmkua and North Hawai'i by providing access to college-level educational opportunities. NHERC provides unlimited Internet access at a rate of $60/year for community members that include access to a 12-station computer lab and Wi-Fi for personal computers. The download speed is 92 Mbps and the 15upload speed is 91 Mbps. In most instances, the computer lab has sufficient workstations to accommodate demand since many people bring in their personal laptop computers. In addition to NHERC and the library, there are two H\u00e4m\u00e4kua businesses offering Internet service for their customers. The Honoka'a People's Theater (and caf\u00e9) offers access to their private Wi-Fi network for customers. The wireless signal extends to the caf\u00e9's outside seating areas, and people are known to gather there during non-business hours to connect to the Internet. Similarly, The Landing Restaurant has Wi-Fi available for customers through Kokua Wireless, which offers free Wi-Fi access, in 30-minute increments, after setting-up a free account. Staff at the restaurant reported that some people patronize the restaurant specifically to access the Internet, and are known to wait outside the restaurant until they open just to connect. Digital literacy training opportunities Digital learning opportunities were assessed through reviewing NHERC and Hawai'i State Public Library System websites and project team visits or phone calls to each facility. Electronic databases were also searched to determine if classes were offered elsewhere in the community. The following training opportunities were identified in the district, exclusive of digital literacy programs that may be conducted in area public schools for students. According to its website, NHERC offers Computer Science 135, a credit course providing an introduction to programming with user-friendly software. Students use storyboarding design strategies and create Disney/Pixar-like animation with objects in three-dimensional virtual worlds. These animations promote an understanding of basic programming constructs including control structures and object-oriented programming. NHERC also offers a non-credit course called Creating a Personal Archive: History & Storytelling Through Photography. A description of the course says, \"History is in the making, even in our small town of Honoka'a. Learn about heritage through photo archiving, scanning & preserving old photographs. Record history as it happens, using digital photography and editing. Scan, retouch and print an old photograph, learn techniques for taking photos of events and people, and create memorable photo presentations 16through archival printing, website creation, book publishing, and slideshows.\" Private, one-to-one computer training lessons are also available at NHERC by individual appointment in increments of two, four and eight hour sessions depending on the specific needs of a student. Digital learning opportunities are not available onsite at the Honoka'a Public Library, but the state library system offers online access to the Microsoft IT Academy, which provides free access to 250 self-paced digital literacy and technology activities. H\u00e4m\u00e4kua District Needs Assessment An inventory was conducted of all public and private meeting places, government services, community organizations, and schools and libraries in order to determine baseline broadband needs of the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua District. The following describes the methods employed while compiling these comprehensive lists. A summary of the inventory follows and the complete inventory and a full description of the methods employed are included in the Appendix. The inventory was developed by (1) downloading the DCCA active business entity list for Pa'auilo and Honoka'a zip codes, identifying their purpose, coding these business for storefronts and online sales and cross-checking these results for businesses and non-profits; (2) searching online and hardcopy Yellow Pages for relevant businesses and government services in the district; (3) reviewing archives and online records of the Honoka'a Business Association, H\u00e4m\u00e4kua Times, \u00c4hualoa.net and Honokaatown.com for businesses and community organizations; (4) project team visits to Honoka'a, Pa'auilo, \u00c4hualoa and Kukuihaele to complete the inventory of businesses, government services, and community organizations; (5) local knowledge shared by community members with the project team and (6) in person, online, and telephone interviews with individuals at schools, libraries, and meeting places. Businesses As previously mentioned, there are 264 registered businesses in the district, 106 of which have a physical location from which they conduct business. Fifty-seven percent of the registered business entities comprise individuals who have their own home business or office, work on farms, provide a mobile 17service, or sell their products in stores or markets outside of the district. Of the 106 businesses with physical locations, 14 had websites capable of soliciting online sales, and an additional 12 businesses operating without a physical location also conducted sales and transactions online. Private and public meeting places The ability to quickly access, share, investigate, update and disperse information in real time when working with others is a great advantage while conducting business and community meetings, and has almost become an expected amenity at meeting places. In the inventory phase, three private meeting places were identified of which two made the Internet available for customers. The Honoka'a People's Theater (and Caf\u00e9) is available for events at the owner's discretion during off-hours. They provide Wi-Fi over their private network at a download speed of 6.29 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.99 Mbps. Additionally, the Waianuhea Bed and Breakfast can be rented for retreats or other events and advertises Internet service via satellite. The bed and breakfast receives their service from HughesNet, and a representative of the business told the project team that the service was adequate for their business needs, but was unaware of either download or upload speeds. Eleven publicly owned meeting places were identified including NHERC and the district's four public schools, two local gymnasiums, the Senior Center, the Young Farmer's Barn, Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 State Recreation Area, and the library. Of these locations, Internet service was only available at NHERC and at the Honoka'a Public Library. The elementary and intermediate schools were included as public meeting spaces because they often host public events. However, the schools restrict public Internet access. Government services Twenty-one government services with physical addresses or landline telephone numbers in the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district were identified, with four in Pa'auilo and 17 in Honoka'a. These included the fire and police stations, recreation centers and gymnasiums, health services, transportation services and post offices. Community organizations A total of 72 community organizations were included in the inventory. These included 14 charitable, cultural, or health and education nonprofit organizations; 11 neighborhood and environmental 18associations; six local business associations or non-profits; 11 community service and ethnic organizations; and at least four sports, dance, and martial arts-related organizations. Further, there are 14 religious organizations, 12 of which have a physical location and meeting place. Of the 72 community organizations identified, only 20 have a website suggesting there is room for increased broadband adoption among the remaining organizations in the community. Several of these organizations are worth noting because they have a strong and active presence and a mission to advance their communities. The list includes the Honoka'a Business Association; Hmkua Agricultural Cooperative; Mauka - Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 Community Association and Olohana Foundation. These organizations, in particular, may be able to assist in community collaboration and in market development for expanded broadband services. Schools and libraries Broadband for Honoka'a Elementary School, Honoka'a High and Intermediate School and Pa'auilo Elementary School is coordinated through the Pa'auilo - Kona Complex, which reportedly shares 4 Gbps of broadband. Each of these schools has a Cisco router on a fiber optic network and uses Oceanic Time Warner Cable as a backup. According to Chris Zane, Manager of Network Engineering at University of Hawai'i and one of the points of contact for the federally funded Broadband Technologies Opportunities Program (BTOP) project, all public schools and libraries, statewide, received a minimum of 1 Gbps of circuit capacity to the respective entity's network, how the entity (i.e. schools and public libraries) decided to use it or how much actual bandwidth it decided to provide to the end user was up to them. Circuit capacity to the site does not necessarily equate to bandwidth that an end user will see, which is reflected in every instance noted below. At Honoka'a Elementary School, there is a reported 20-25 Mbps allotted, and tests measured an 18.5 Mbps download speed and a 25.86 Mbps upload speed. The school has approximately 240 PC and Mac computers, with one physical computer lab and eight mobile labs. The school's IT coordinator suggested that more bandwidth is needed, especially as they move towards a 1:1 device to student ratio. 19 Similarly, Pa'auilo Elementary School reports a 20-30 Mbps wireless connection in almost every classroom. They have an estimated 300 Mac computers with two labs of 30 computers for testing and laptop carts for classrooms, including iPad notebooks. They are active users of Google Apps for education and have internal email addresses for students in the 4th through 6th grades. Honoka'a High and Intermediate School has a reported broadband speed of 40-50 Mbps. Combined, they have an estimated 600 computers for students and faculty, with six computer labs and seven mobile carts containing PCs and Macs. Two preschools were included in the inventory, Kamehameha Preschool and Ka Hale O Na Keiki, and both restrict broadband service for staff use. NHERC receives Internet service through the UH Hilo system. As previously mentioned, the facility has download speed of 92 Mbps and an upload speed of 91 Mbps. For student and other approved users, there is a computer lab with 12 PCs and a student lounge with three Macs and one PC. The Internet is restricted to students and faculty and for organizations or people who pay to rent the facility (classrooms, conference room, computer lab, pavilion). As reported above in the Public access to broadband section, any community member may join for $60/year, allowing access to the computer lab and Wi-Fi for their personal computers. The public library in Honoka'a is the only library in the district. As noted earlier in Private and public meeting places, the library has a download speed of 5.23 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.22 Mbps. Anyone with a Hawai'i state library card can access the Internet during business hours on one of their four PC computers or with a personal laptop. Listening Sessions Three public listening sessions were conducted by the project team between January 5 and January 8, 2015 at NHERC in the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district. The sessions were publicized in the media a week in advance through the (1) Hawai'i Tribune Herald; (2) H\u00e4m\u00e4kua Times; Mauka - Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 and \u00c4hualoa community associations also alerted their members to the sessions. The sessions were fruitful and 20provided a deep understanding of the issues surrounding broadband service in the community. Data gathered during this phase of the study was largely incorporated into foregoing sections of this report but some particularly notable highlights are included below. A total of 42 people participated and provided input either in person or via email as a follow-up to the sessions. Twenty-five participants are currently using a digital subscriber line (DSL) broadband service from Hawaiian Telcom. Seven participants have satellite Internet service provided by Exede, four receive an Internet connection on their mobile phone through Verizon LTE, three participants have broadband access through Oceanic Time Warner Cable and one participant accesses the Internet via dial-up. Two others reported Internet service between 1 Mbps and 4 Mbps but did not indicate the name of their service provider. One participant from the Pa'auilo - Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 session reported Exede satellite Internet service in the range of 21 to 31 Mbps (download) and 2.5 to 3.5 Mbps (upload), which exceed advertised speeds of 12 Mbps and 3 Mbps respectively. One-third of the participants are presently living off the Hawai'i Electric Light Company (HELCO) power grid, generating some form of renewable energy on their property instead. Participants accessing the Internet via Hawaiian Telcom uniformly reported download speeds below the rates they expected to receive when they purchased their Internet plan from the provider. Hawaiian Telcom\u00ffs lowest speed Internet plan advertises speeds up to 7 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload. In practice, most subscribers in the district reported download speeds of around 3 Mbps during off-peak hours, deteriorating to less than 1 Mbps during prime time. The actual download speeds of the Hawaiian Telcom Internet service leaves most of these subscribers frustrated since they are usually unable to view movies or use their connection for other high bandwidth services due to frequent \"timeouts\". Participants operating a business from their home (architect, photographer and consultant) are particularly frustrated because the slow connection prevents them from downloading or uploading images that are a routine part of their work. They believe that other home offices or businesses in the area are equally frustrated and that improved broadband service could result in an expansion of the home office sector in the district. A majority of the Hawaiian Telcom subscribers participating in this study reside in Kal\u00f6p\u00e4. Subscriber locations are mapped in Figure 2 based on addresses provided by approximately half of the participants. 21 Figure 2. Hawaiian Telcom Subscribers The Pa'auilo Mauka - Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 Community Association has been actively trying to remedy the present situation with Hawaiian Telcom. Association members attending the listening sessions reported two primary deficiencies with their current service (1) insufficient capacity to provide DSL service for area subscribers that already have a Hawaiian Telcom telephone connection and (2) digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAM) in the community have just a 50 Mbps capacity that must be shared by all users. Participants wondered why DSLAM capacity is low when (they assert) the DSLAM in question is served by twelve single-mode optical fibers with a capacity of 40 to 60 Gb per fiber. The association hopes to determine the cost of upgrading two DSLAMs in their community and seek funding on their own to underwrite the expense. Participants from the Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 communities represent a pocket of underserved subscribers who are paying for broadband service but accessing the Internet at less than broadband speeds. Listening session participants residing in Honoka'a, \u00c4hualoa and Kukuihaele appear to be much more satisfied with their Internet service, with few complaints even among the handful paying the satellite premium for Exede. The sessions did not attract any participants from Waipi'o Valley, so the study cannot 22report whether any of their residents are accessing the Internet via satellite or Verizon, given that neither Hawaiian Telcom nor Oceanic Time Warner Cable offer Internet service in the area. That being said, it is safe to describe the valley as a severely unserved pocket of the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district. Additionally, listening session participants noted the resurrection of commerce in Honoka'a town and a representative of the Honoka'a Business Association reported that the group is hopeful of providing free Wi-Fi connections across roughly five blocks of the downtown business district along Mamane Street, the locus of commerce in the area. They are currently seeking public funding to underwrite infrastructure costs at key locations on the route so that uninterrupted wireless service is available in this portion of their business district. The group sees this as a \"value-add\" to the downtown Honoka'a experience that may attract more visitors off the highway as they travel between Hilo and Waimea. Potential for Community Collaboration Because of relatively low population density, topographical barriers, and great distances, broadband service is often more difficult to obtain in rural and remote areas like the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district. Given the high degree of reported broadband need, awareness and capacity in Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4, the potential for community collaboration in that segment of the district appears particularly ripe. In attempting to address similar challenges in other remote areas across the country, rural communities have found it helpful to develop a strategic plan for broadband deployment that includes creating a comprehensive business proposal to broadband providers. Such a plan, for example, could demonstrate to broadband providers that deployment is a sound business decision that would benefit both the provider and the community. The overall goal of the plan is to demonstrate that the community is characterized by factors consistent with broadband adoption. A plan could include the following elements and strategies: 1. Educating the community about the potential benefits of broadband service and creating a local campaign to increase awareness and demand. 2. Creating partnerships among community organizations and institutions that might benefit from broadband deployment. 3. Assessing and prioritizing the community's needs for broadband service. 4. Aggregating demand within the community to make service profitable for broadband providers. 23 5. Identifying an \"anchor tenant\" in the unserved area with adequate demand to spur infrastructure investment in broadband. 6. Forming a community cooperative intended to fund last mile connections through competitive federal funding (grants and low interest loans) for rural areas such as the Community Connect Grant program, Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program and Farm Bill Broadband Loan program. Findings The present study revealed a community that is at the tipping point of its transformation from an agricultural economy typical of former Hawai'i \"plantation towns\" to a service economy desiring to infuse visitor experiences with the regional flavor of the H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district. Projected population growth (1.7%) over the next 20 years slightly outpaces countywide growth projections (1.6%) and doubles statewide projections of .08%. Once shuttered storefronts are re-opening, 13% of which have websites capable of soliciting online sales, and just over half (57%) of all registered businesses in the area operate from a home office or another remote location. Given its desire to build a future service economy around unique visitor \"experiences\" in the area, and with improved access to consistent high speed Internet service, H\u00e4m\u00e4kua is a potentially emerging e-commerce community. Additionally, H\u00e4m\u00e4kua is becoming an increasingly attractive residential community for professionals interested in providing services and operating businesses remotely, but growth in this emerging sector is constrained by the lack of broadband availability across the full breadth of the district. One participant in the Pa'auilo - Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 listening session told the project team that he would not have purchased his house if he knew in advance of the sub-standard Internet service in the area. Probability of broadband adoption in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua Broadband service to the more densely populated or less remote areas of the district (Honoka'a, Kukuihaele and \u00c4hualoa) appears to be sufficient to support the growth of an e-commerce community. Listening session participants from these areas seemed largely satisfied with their current broadband service. However, people living on the fringes of these communities as well as in Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 signal, through their comments and behaviors, their willingness to subscribe to broadband services when they become available, or their desire for enhancements to their current DSL service that will allow them 24access to the full range of download speeds for which they are already paying. Other things equal, the probability of broadband adoption in underserved pockets of the community appear to be high. Factors of broadband adoption National studies reveal a variety of factors correlated with broadband adoption, (1) price; (2) speed; (3) platform competition; (4) Internet content; (5) population density; (6) income and (7) education. The first four, supply-side factors, are binding constraints on the adoption/non-adoption decision-making process, and consumers have little influence over them. The remaining, demand-side, factors provide a yardstick against which instances of underserved pockets in the area can be compared to served areas in the same community. Models employing these factors have been used to explain the distribution of broadband service in other U.S. markets. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population density of Honoka\u00ffa (which is well served by providers) is 1,820.5 persons per square mile, while the density in Pa'auilo (underserved) is 572.1 persons per square mile. County CDP data report a mean annual household income of $45,952 in Honoka'a and just $34,792 in Pa'auilo. And although most people in both communities appear to have at least attained a high school degree (Honoka\u00ffa, 73.1%; Pa'auilo, 70.5%), county data shows the percentage of Honoka\u00ffa residents with a bachelor's degree or higher (11.6%) is nearly double the rate in Pa'auilo (6.5%). The county CDP data is five years old, and recent anecdotal evidence suggests that mean household income, particularly in Pa'auilo, may have substantially increased since then, given the recent influx of new residents in Pa'auilo Mauka where property values are consistently higher than those in makai areas of the community. It's ironic that these new residents, with higher levels of disposable income and willingness to pay, are without broadband access because the local system lacks additional capacity. Based on these results and with the foregoing caveat in mind other things may be not equal (density, income, education). A model employing the factors noted in the previous paragraph would correctly predict Pa'auilo to be underserved, relative to Honoka'a, by Internet providers. Does the model apply? A simplified application of the above model suggests areas such as Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 will likely be underserved by Internet providers; an outcome validated by this study. But the finding is confounding 25when compared to community behavior, revealing a group highly motivated for access to high speed Internet. A possible explanation is that, although widely advertised, the listening sessions only attracted participants interested in broadband and the overwhelming desire for improved or extended service. This may reflect just a small pocket of demand within a community that may otherwise be indifferent to the need for broadband services or unprepared to take advantage of it. Reconciling the outcome The probability of broadband adoption in H\u00e4m\u00e4kua in general appears high and consistent with its own vision of a future economy driven by a robust service sector. However, forecasting adoption rates in an area such as Pa'auilo or Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 is complicated because they appear to be \"typical\" of communities underserved by Internet providers. That being said, it's difficult to determine the degree to which these predictive factors are important in the absence of competition. A 2007 study by University of Florida researchers Sangwon Lee and Justin S. Brown shows that platform competition among different technologies (DSL, cable and ber optics) is often the leading factor of broadband adoption, and it is not surprising that more consumer options leads to more broadband penetration in any particular area. For example, Honoka'a, the most population dense community in the district, boasts the highest available broadband speeds and is serviced by two providers. By contrast, Pa\u00ffauilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4, on the southern edge of H\u00e4m\u00e4kua, have some of the lowest speeds and are only served by Hawaiian Telcom. Competition among service providers in this area would provide more Internet capacity (two providers instead of one means more available bandwidth) and platform alternatives (DSL and cable). But the absence of competition renders the present status quo of substandard Internet service for these communities relative to their better-served neighboring community of Honoka'a. Potential for community collaboration and market development The aforementioned model does not account for a significant intangible factor of broadband adoption, for example the willingness of a community to solve the issue for itself. Residents in Pa\u00ffauilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 have been exceptionally active in seeking a remedy from the utility, and when that left them unsatisfied, they sought to determine the costs of enhancing their Internet service so they might underwrite the expense through funds raised on their own. With a little help from public and private sources, and perhaps Hawaiian Telcom, Internet service to these communities can be significantly improved and perhaps help 26nudge H\u00e4m\u00e4kua closer to an e-commerce economy that would better support its aspirations for the future than its present economic structure. Internet service providers rely on a strict calculus when deciding to extend service into any particular community. The marginal cost of the service should at least equal the marginal revenue. When it doesn't, the \"investment gap\" must be bridged by supplemental public or private funds, or through the development of the market, guided by a strategic plan for local broadband adoption. A previous section of this study identified Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 as \"ripe\" for both community collaboration and market development and offered an outline of a proposed plan. Conclusion The intention of the present study was to understand the probability of broadband adoption if services become available at market prices in previously underserved areas of Hawai'i Island, determine factors influencing adoption and identify an underserved community poised to adopt broadband service. The H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district was selected as the test bed. The district includes pockets of exceptionally well-served (Honoka'a) and underserved (Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4) communities allowing for a direct comparison across a set of factors derived from well-regarded national studies. Comparing the relative endowments of the factors in these communities correctly predicted the relative distribution of Internet service between them. On the surface, it appears that Pa'auilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 will be chronically underserved because they lack factor endowments that naturally drive the broadband market to their door. However, the residents of those areas display an intangible factor that has them actively attempting to solve the investment gap in their community on their own, and the present study concludes that Pa\u00ffauilo and Kal\u00f6p\u00e4 are communities particularly ready to adopt enhanced or improved broadband service at market prices. 27APPENDIX A: Community Institutional Inventory Methodology Registered businesses The majority of the business inventory was compiled by using the Hawai'i Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) business entity list builder (https://hbe.ehawaii.gov/listbuilder/) to download all active businesses registered in the zip codes for Honoka'a (96727) and Pa'auilo (96776), the two postal codes encompassing the entire H\u00e4m\u00e4kua district. This search returned 240 records for Honoka'a and 59 records for Pa'auilo. Sixteen of these records were incomplete and one business cooperative was re-categorized (for the purposes of the study) as a community organization along with all 39 non-profits on the initial list. Since the list generated from DCCA data did not account for businesses that are operating in Honoka'a but registered out-of-state, a separate search was conducted via online and hardcopy versions of the Yellow Pages. Additionally, businesses were also identified by reviewing the Honoka'a Business Association online site, searching online records in the Hmkua Times, Ahualoa.net, Honokaatown.com and Honokaa.com. Finally, project team visits to both Honoka'a and Pa'auilo business districts filled in the inventory gaps by documenting Honoka'a and Pa'auilo town storefronts. The purpose of each business was documented, and all businesses were coded to determine whether they had (1) storefronts, defined as a place of business that the general public can visit for business purposes; (2) online sales, determined by a web search for their product and a website containing an online shopping cart and (3) Internet service. In a few instances, a business may not have been included in the inventory if (1) no physical address existed and contact information was unavailable; (2) information on the purpose of the business was unavailable and there was no physical or online presence for the entity; (3) a business was clearly not operating in Honoka'a or Pa'auilo zip codes; (4) the records returned were further labeled as inactive; (5) the business was a family limited partnerships used for estate planning purposes; and (6) the business was intended to hold/rent real property and did not have a storefront. 28Private meeting places Private meeting places were defined as privately owned (i.e., not owned by the government) places available to the general public for meetings. The inventory of four private meeting places was developed using local and project team knowledge of facilities in Honoka'a and Pa'auilo and from gathering information during the business inventory search. Attempts were made to determine if these places had Internet availability and, when possible, a speed test was conducted by the project team or the entity itself. Public meeting places Public meeting places were defined as meeting places owned by federal, state or local government. The inventory of 10 public meeting places was developed by compiling a list of government services and identifying facilities on the list that are open to the general public for use as a meeting location. This information was confirmed and supplemented by local and project team knowledge of the places organizations routinely held meetings in the area. Internet availability at these locations was determined through in-person or telephone interviews, and a speed test was conducted by the project team or by the person in charge of the information technology services at the facility. Government community services The government community services inventory of 21 entities was compiled through online and hardcopy searches of the Yellow Pages and other online lists of government services in the district. Schools and libraries The inventory of seven schools and libraries was compiled by locating public schools, libraries and private pre-schools with Honoka'a and Pa'auilo zip codes. Interviews were conducted to determine their Internet availability, speed, hardware, operating systems, public access and general usage. Community organizations Community organizations were defined as charitable non-profits, religious organizations and other entities operating in the Honoka'a and Pa'auilo zip codes on a year-round basis. The majority of this inventory of 59 organizations consisted of non-profit organizations identified in the business entity list-builder search. 29Thirty-nine active non-profits were located in this search and after further research, 14 were excluded from the final inventory because contact information was unavailable or there was no other evidence in the community that the organization was active. Other organizations were excluded if they were ad hoc committees organized for a single event. Additional community organizations were identified by (1) project team and local knowledge; (2) visiting business district storefronts and other meeting places and noting organizations sponsoring local events; (3) reviewing community calendars located at the Honoka'a Senior Center, NHERC and signs and fliers displayed throughout Honoka'a town. hualoa.net, Honokaatown.com, Honokaa.com and H\u00e4m\u00e4kua Times were also searched for evidence of active community organizations. 30APPENDIX B: Community Institutional Inventory Business Inventory The following is an inventory of Hmkua district businesses organized in alphabetical order by zip code.
