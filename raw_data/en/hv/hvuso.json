In times of fear , trauma, and stress, MAPS' mission of developing technologies of healing becomes even more critical. While our efforts to initiate psychedelic and medical marijuana research are primarilydirected at the treatment of patients with diagnosable psychiatric and medical illnesses, collateralbenefits are anticipated. Psychedelic and medical marijuana research can also contribute to thetreatment of cultural pathologies. These include the divisive and counterproductive Drug War andthe prioritization of ideology and fundamentalism over science, common sense and compassion,as evidenced by the federal prosecution of medical marijuana patients and providers in California.Societies more open to psychedelic experiences are likely to be less blind to their own demons andprejudices, and perhaps less likely to wage wars of all types. The sort of blind prejudice I mean istypified by a stock reply of ex-Drug Czar General Barry McCaffrey that he once offered me, withoutobvious irony, admitting \"I may frequently be wrong, but I am never in doubt.\" Suppressingresearch may temporarily keep doubt at bay, but it isn't healthy public policy. Open-mindedness is not a hallmark of societies at war, making the research approval process much more difficult. Yet another Institutional Review Board (IRB) has seemingly been influencedby non-scientific social prejudices in its review of Dr. Michael Mithoefer's MDMA-assisted psycho- therapy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (p. 4). In addition, we are meeting increasingly stubborn and unjustifiable resistance from the Drug Enforcement Adminis-tration (DEA) in regards to Dr. Mithoefer's 10-month wait for a license to possess and administer3 grams of MDMA to patients in his study. Similarly, DEA has been obstructing Prof. Lyle Craker'sefforts to obtain a license for a MAPS-funded medical marijuana production facility at UMassAmherst (p. 12). Even the International Narcotic Control Board (INCB), the body that monitorsand enforces compliance with international drug control treaties, issued in its 2002 annual reporta cautionary statement about MAPS' efforts to support MDMA/PTSD research. In paragraphs 171 -172, under the heading \"Provision of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of posttrau-matic stress disorder,\" the INCB warned the signatory parties to the treaty (which include virtu-ally all the countries in the world) to beware that \"While the Board has been encouraging allGovernments to support sound research on the medical use of controlled drugs, it has also beenconcerned over the possible misuse of research activities for the propagation of the non-medicaluse of drugs.\" I haven't determined whose fingerprints are on these paragraphs, but it's probablyeither the DEA or the Spanish Antidrug authorities (p. 7). Despite these political pressures, MAPS stands on the verge of blossoming into a non-profit pharmaceutical company, in actuality as well as in intent, to develop psychedelics and medicalmarijuana into government-approved prescription medicines. Though we've been on the verge fora long, seemingly interminable time, I'm more convinced than ever that the non-profit researchapproach offers substantial promise. For example, on March 31, 2003, the Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation announced it would donate $60 million to a non-profit organization to develop atopical gel to block the transmission of HIV. For-profit pharmaceutical companies considered theprofit potential to be small and weren't doing the research. The abortion pill, RU-486, was alsodeveloped into an FDA-approved medicine by a non-profit organization. In the midst of war, visions of healing must be sustained and developed. The MAPS staff is deeply grateful for your support in these difficult, challenging and promising times. \u2014 Rick Doblin, Ph.D. MAPS President4 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): A Second Update on the Approval Process. Michael Mithoefer, M.D. (mmit@bellsouth.net) \"On November 2, 2001, we received FDA permission toconduct a MAPS-sponsoredstudy of MDMA-assistedpsychotherapy for thetreatment of posttraumaticstress disorder (PTSD). \"About a year and a half ago, on November 2, 2001, we re- ceived FDA approval to conduct a MAPS-sponsored study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stressdisorder (PTSD). This is the first Phase 2 MDMA study approved inthe U.S. In the last issue of the MAPS Bulletin (volume XI number3), I reported that the FDA was on the verge of granting permissionfor us to change the proposed study location from a universityinpatient unit to an outpatient office setting with extensive emer-gency equipment and additional back-up medical personnel. On June14, 2002 we did receive approval for that change. The FDA Divisionof Neuropharmacological Drug Products, in consultation with the Division of Cardiorenal Drugs, concluded that with the agreed upon provisions, we would be ableto respond to any medical emergency in this setting at least as effectively as in a hospital. Wewere impressed by the FDA's careful attention to patient safety and their professional approach todiscussing and evaluating modifications in our protocol. The next step was to submit an application for protocol review to a private institutional review board (IRB), as well as applications to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and theSouth Carolina Bureau of Drug Control (SCBDC) for a Schedule I research registration. The chronol-ogy of events has been as follows: June 19, 2002: We submitted an application with accompanying copies of our protocol and literature review to The Western IRB (WIRB) in Olympia, Washington, one of thebest known private IRBs in the U.S.July 3, 2002: I submitted Schedule I applications to DEA and the South Carolina Board of Drug Control. July 10, 2002: We received notification that our protocol had been approved by the WIRB withsome modifications to the informed consent formbut no other changes. We were pleased to have received IRB approval, and we started to work actively to track, and hopefullyexpedite, the processing of my DEA application. I hada number of helpful conversations with the DEA fieldoffice in Columbia, SC about the security requirementsfor storing MDMA. In preparation for a site inspectionby the DEA field officers we have made arrangements 5 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 to have a safe and an alarm system installed in the office. However, before the DEA fieldoffice or the SCBDC can act, they need ap-proval from the DEA central office in Wash-ington. The only information we have beenable to get from that office, now ninemonths after my application was submit-ted, is that it is still under review and thatthe DEA has enlisted the involvement of aconsultant outside the DEA. In phone con-versations with DEA officials on January 14I was told that they had concerns about \"safety\"but that the review should be finished \"soon\"and on Febuary 19 that it \"should not be long\"before they come to a decision. It is my under-standing that the DEA's mission is to guardagainst drug diversion in pharmacological re-search, whereas the FDA is the agency with re-sponsibility and expertise regarding safety. Ittherefore seems inappropriate that safety con-cerns are holding up my DEA application. RickDoblin wrote the DEA in January to remind themof this. A more troublesome series of events occurred with the WIRB: September 5, 2002: I received a phone call followed by a letter stating that the WIRB had decided to withdraw their approval of the proto-col. At the request of \"a WIRB affiliated physi-cian\" the board had met to reconsider our appli-cation. We were not informed of this meetinguntil after the fact. The physician (who remainsunidentified to us) reportedly raised concernsbased largely on telephone conversations withthree scientists. We prepared a very thoroughresponse to the WIRB addressing each of the con-cerns and including additional letters of supportfrom prominent researchers (details available athttp://www.maps.org/research/mdma). Duringthis process, MAPS president Rick Doblin spoketo two of these scientists and to a co-author ofthe third in order to foster as much open discus-sion as possible. We informed the FDA and in-vited their input. The FDA, has not, as of yet,requested any changes in the protocol. October 3, 2002: Rick Doblin had a detailed discussion with the Executive Director of the WIRB. Rick requested that he and I have theopportunity to address the board at their Octo-ber 30 meeting, when, we were told, they wouldconsider our appeal. October 15, 2002: We submitted our formal, detailed appeal to the WIRB, addressing all the concerns they had raised in their letter. October 17, 2002: R i c k w a s i n f o r m e d b y phone that the WIRB would not be reviewing the scientific aspects of our appeal on October30. Instead, the WIRB's Executive Policy Com-mittee would decide whether there would evenbe a scientific review at all, at a November 19,2002 meeting which would address their gen-eral policy on \"this kind of research,\" presum-ably Schedule I drug research. November 20, 2002: I received a letter from the WIRB stating that, \"Western Institutional Review Board, Inc. (WIRB) has made the deci-sion to not provide institutional review boardservices for the Multidisciplinary Association forPsychedelic Studies (MAPS). Please find encloseda refund of your previously paid fees, along withthe material you submitted for review.\" Therewas no explanation for their unusual behavior:first approving our protocol, then two months \"Not only did they waste a lot of our time, their actions do not appear to be consistent with the responsibility of an IRB to review research protocols based on scientific and safety considerations.\"6 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 later withdrawing approval for alleged scientific reasons, and, when we exercised our right toappeal, declining to review our response to theirstated concerns, instead making the decision toterminate their involvement. Not only did theywaste a lot of our time, their actions do notappear to be consistent with the responsibilityof an IRB to review research protocols based onscientific and safety considerations. This is an-other disturbing example of non-scientific in-fluences constraining academic and scientificfreedom of inquiry. December 17, 2002: Less than a month after the WIRB returned our application, MAPS sub- mitted the MDMA/PTSD protocol for review to anew IRB in California, Independent Review Con-sulting, Inc. (IRC-IRB). The IRC-IRB has readthe entire correspondence between MAPS andthe Western IRB and has indicated its willing-ness to carefully review the protocol on its mer-its without bias due to the controversial natureof MDMA-assisted psychotherapy research. Theirreview of our protocol on January 3 resulted ina long list of questions and concerns. We sub-mitted a thorough written response on January21, and on January 28 Rick Doblin and I at-tended the weekly meeting of the review boardto respond to their questions and discuss anyconcerns in person. The board told us they ap-preciated the thoroughness of our written re-sponse, and the meeting had a tone of mutualrespect. They asked challenging questions andwe had the impression that we had come toagreement on most of the issues raised. To our surprise, what followed was an eight page letter which, while it indicated a willing-ness to continue to work toward possible ap-proval, raised two major new obstacles: 1) Theidea that we must hire an outside \"Contract Re-search Organization\" (for which we got an esti-mate of $ 178,000) to monitor data collection,and 2) That we start with a multi-site trial. Wefeel strongly that neither of these measureswould be appropriate at this stage of our re-search (an initial pilot study). The first is un-necessary and very expensive. The second is im-possible because before a multi-site study canbe done, the treatment must be standardized inpilot studies. Although subsequent communica-tions with the IRC-IRB has have indicated thatthe board may not insist on these measures, theyhave thus far been unable to reach a decisionabout either of these issues and have tableddiscussion, pending a request that MAPS payfor consultants to address some unrelated ques-tions about study design. MAPS is understandably reluctant to spend this additional money when the board cannot tellus how or when it might reach a decision aboutthe other two major outstanding issues. There-fore, in late February we discussed the study witha third IRB, fully informed them about what hastranspired thus far, and were told they would bewilling accept our application for review. We sub-mitted that application on March 7, having aftertwo weeks not received anything from the IRC-IRB regarding the promised estimate for the costsof the consultants. We then waited an additionaltwo and half weeks without receiving the esti-mate before notifying the IRC-IRB on March 25of our decision to pursue other options. I am optimistic that our persistence will result in both IRB and DEA approval within thenext few months. We appreciate the continuedsupport and hard work from MAPS that makesthis persistence possible, and we're looking for-ward to moving beyond this application phaseand to beginning subject recruitment and theexperimental sessions themselves. \"We feel confident that, with persistence and responsiveness, we will be able to secure the approvals we need to move ahead with the study by Summer 2003.\"7 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 On February 17, 2000, our research team, whose members are lo- cated at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid and at the Hospital Psiqui\u00e1trico de Madrid, Spain, received approval from the AgenciaEspa\u00f1ola del Medicamento (the Spanish Medical Agency, equivalent tothe US FDA) for an MDMA psychotherapy study. The study, funded byMAPS, is designed to assess the safety of different doses of MDMA in apopulation with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a psychothera-peutic setting. So far, we have treated just six patients. All patientstolerated the treatment well, and there were neither physical complica-tions nor remarkable side effects during the experimental sessions. Noneof them developed any psychological disturbance or distress associatedwith the effects of the drug nor suffered any psychopathological reac-tion, and we had no drop-outs during the treatment phase. Unfortunately, we are having some problems with the continuationof the study. I have always been reluc-tant to discuss this project with themedia \u2014 at least until it was finished\u2014 because some politicians tend tothink that any discussion of the thera-peutic potential of illegal drugs dimin-ishes the risk perception of casual us-ers. They tend to view illegal drugs asnecessarily more dangerous than prescription drugs, basing their ideas on unscientific notions. It isobvious that the risks of a drug are not defined by its legal status but by its pharmacologicalproperties. Hence, no drug is free from risks, whatever its legal status. In fact, prescription drugshave higher indices of mortality than illegal drugs, which represent only about 20 per cent of alldrug-related deaths. The key when we propose clinical trials is to have a good balance between risksand benefits, and in the case of MDMA treatment it is quite clear than one or two doses of MDMAadministered in a clinical setting would have a very low health risk while the benefits for patientsmay be quite high. The abuse potential of one or two doses of MDMA is also very low. But last May, the Spanish media reported the news that we were conducting a study in which we administered MDMA to treat PTSD. The next day, we suffered a rude and unexpected inspectionfrom the Health Department of the State of Madrid. Though the Spanish Ministry of Health is respon-sible for approving clinical trials in Spain, the inspections are carried out by the health departmentsof each state, with prior notice being given to the researchers. We received no such notice. They alsohave one month to submit a report from the inspection, but it too was never sent. Obviously, theinspection was meant to intimidate us. The day after the inspection, the manager of the Psychiatric Hospital of Madrid met me to say that he received pressure from the Vice President of the Health Department to stop the study.

A report on MAPS' 1999 international conference on clinical research with MDMAand MDE, held at the Dead Sea, can be found on the MAPS website at: http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v09n3/09309isr.html On November 14, 2002, MAPS presented a seminar about MDMA/PTSD research at Beer Yakov Hospital near Tel-Aviv. Attending were officials from the Israeli Ministry of Health, Israeli Societyof Addiction Medicine, and the Israeli AntidrugAuthority. Organizing the event on the Israeliside was Dr. Jorge Gleser, Deputy Director, Men-tal Health Services, Director, Department forthe Treatment of Substance Abuse, Israeli Min-istry of Health. Costs of the seminar were cov-ered by a donation to MAPS from Tim Butcher. Speakers at the seminar were Dr. Michael Mithoefer, principal investigator for the MAPS-sponsored and FDA-approved MDMA/PTSD study (p. 4); June May Ruse, of MAPS'MDMA/PTSD treatment manual; Jose Carlos Bouso, Ph.D. candidate, principal investigator in theMAPS-sponsored MDMA/PTSD study in Spain (p.7); Peter Cohen, Ph.D., Director of the Centre forDrug Research (CEDRO) - Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Universiteit van Amsterdam(see www.cedro-uva.org), and myself. The seminar was favorably reported in Maariv, a majorIsraeli newspaper, (www.maps.org/media/maariv11.15.02.html). Dr. Cohen spent several days af-ter the seminar in meetings with the Israeli Antidrug Authority, while I had an opportunity tomeet with Antidrug Authority Director, General Haim Messing. On November 17, MAPS organized a smaller protocol design meeting with several psychia- trists in the Ministry of Health including Dr. Moshe Kotler, the principal investigator of the IsraeliMDMA/PTSD study; Dr. Rakefey Rodrigez, who is interested in working as a co-therapist on theproject, and Dr. Gleser. Tentative agreement was reached on protocol design, with the researchplan calling first for a small (N=4) non-blinded (\"open label\") pilot study to be conducted inpatients with war or terrorism-related PTSD. The purpose of this study would be to train treatingtherapists in conducting MDMA-assisted therapy and to gather initial information about MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in this population. If the open label study generates promising results, itwill be followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation in a slightlylarger sample of people (N=12) with war or terrorism-related PTSD. The placebo would be a verylow dose of MDMA, as compared to a full dose. In both studies, treatment includes two extendedMDMA-assisted therapy sessions within the context of a twelve-week course of psychotherapy. The Israeli team has indicated that it will be ready to seek Ministry of Health approval for the Israeli pilot study as soon as the US MDMA/PTSD study is approved both by the FDA and an IRB.We're hoping the Israeli study will be ready to start before the end of 2003.MAPS-Supported MDMA/PTSD Research in Israel: An Update Rick Doblin, Ph.D. \"The open label study will be followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with people whohave war or terrorism-related PTSD.\"10 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 MAPS funding to our laboratory ($12,000) is now being ap- plied to a new pilot study we have undertaken to investigate whether repeated use of illicit MDMA induces functionally signifi-cant neurocognitive damage. Much like our prior study comparingNavajo members of the Native American Church who ingest peyotewith Navajo who ingest peyote, have a history of extensive alco-holism only orhave no history ofsignificant drugor alcohol use,our blinded rateradministers anextensive battery of neurocognitive tests to users and non-users ofMDMA. Our study is distinct from prior publishedreports in that we are securing volunteers who haveminimal to no exposure to any other drug of abuseor alcohol. Moreover, we are carefully assessing forpast and current evidence for psychopathology, andthus we will be able to control for extent of de-pression and anxiety at time of testing, for ex-ample. Psychiatric conditions must be screened for, since we already know that these illnessesnegatively impact cognitive performance. Few controlled studies of MDMA users' cognitive perfor-mance have also carefully tested for these illnesses. In order to also control for possible differ-ences between groups due to sleep deprivation, we have chosen control subjects who also experi-ence a comparable amount of sleep deprivation from sharing in the same all-night-party lifestyle.By controlling for sleep patterns, we increase the likelihood that any differences are due to Ecstasybut not to the lifestyle which accompanies it (and we do know that sleep deprivation causesimpairments on many of these tests). At present, 15 controls and 25 MDMA users have completedthis protocol. Preliminary results will first be used in an NIH grant application to expand the studyto eventually test approximately 200 individuals. Interim results may be presented at a relevantscientific conference as well as in a further update to the MAPS Bulletin.

Conducted by Chemic Labs, this$30,000 feasibility study indicated that the Volcano does produce re-markably clean vapor containing THC and other cannabinoids. We haveraised an additional $25,000 from a grant from the Marijuana PolicyProject (first grant proposal rejected, second approved) and have just completed a follow-up \"protocol\" study conducted according to FDA standards. This is the firstvaporizer study designed to detect a broad spectrum of toxins in the gas phase of cannabis smoke orvapor, and will provide the necessary quantitative data toapply for FDA approval of human trials using the vaporizer.The results show that the vapor contains no detectablelevels of a wide range of toxins present in marijuana smoke,but does contain substantial amounts of cannabinoids. This study was urgently needed to keep smoked and/ or vaporized natural cannabis on track for FDA approval inthe face of competition from other, non-smoked deliverysystems, notably GW Pharmaceuticals' oral spray. A humanvaporizer study would likely be of interest to the CaliforniaCenter for Medicinal Cannabis Research (CMCR), of whosescientific advisory board I am a member. Dr. Donald Abrams,UC San Francisco, has worked closely with us to develop aresearch protocol which would for the first time demon-strate how effectively vaporizers deliver cannabinoids intothe human bloodstream. This study, for which Dr. Abramssubmitted a grant proposal to the CMCR on April 1, 2003,could in turn pave the way for further medical studiesusing the vaporizer. Dr. Abrams will submit the protocol to the FDA in early April. In the meantime, however, the DEA is pushing to discourage CMCR from further research with the cannabis plant, on the grounds that smoking is an unsatisfactory method of drug delivery.Furthermore, GW Pharmaceuticals has shown interest in approaching the CMCR about conductingresearch with its cannabinoid extracts, as a substitute for the cannabis plant. If vaporization re-search does not proceed, there is a good chance that the DEA or NIDA will succeed in blockingadditional Phase II and eventual Phase III efficacy studies using the cannabis plant, studies whichare needed to obtain FDA approval for rescheduling cannabis for medical use. Obtaining FDA permission to use a vaporizer in human clinical trials is the first of two critical milestones to be achieved prior to embarking in earnest on a medical cannabis drug developmentprogram. The second milestone is obtaining an independent, non-governmental source of high-potency cannabis for FDA-approved research. MAPS is developing a project of this kind in associationwith Prof. Lyle Craker, Director of the Medicinal Plant Program, Department of Plant and Soil Sci-ences, UMass Amherst (p. 12). 12 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 DEA Finally Replies After 18 Months Since 1992, MAPS has been working to sponsor a privately-funded medical marijuana drug development research program. In late 1999, MAPS and Prof. Lyle Craker, Director of the Medicinal Plant Program, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, UMass Amherst, began working together toestablish a Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA)-licensed medical marijuana production facility. The facility is to be funded by a grant toUMass Amherst from MAPS and is intended to produce high-potency marijuana for use exclusivelyin federally-approved scientific research. In June 2001, Prof. Craker submitted his license applica- tion to the DEA, with full support from the UMassAmherst administration. For a complete, documentedhistory of this effort, see http://www.maps.org/mmj/mmjfacility.html On December 16, 2002, several DEA agents went to UMass Amherst to meet with Prof. Craker and sev-eral senior members of the UMass Amherst adminis-tration. Unfortunately, it turned out that the pur-pose of the meeting was to persuade Prof. Craker andUMass Amherst to withdraw the application, whichthey declined to do. On March 4, 2003, DEA responded in writing for the first time to Prof. Craker's application, more than20 months after the application was originally sub-mitted (it had been \"lost\" for over a year). The let-ter, from Frank Sapienza, Chief, Drug and ChemicalEvaluation Section, stated that DEA was inclined toreject the application because it believed that NIDA can supply marijuana \"acceptable to the research community.\" The testimony of Dr. Ethan Russo,who wrote to DEA to say that he found the quality of NIDA material to be substandard, wasdiscounted since Dr. Russo \"has not been registered by the DEA to conduct research with mari-juana.\" Ironically (at least to us), Dr. Russo was not registered with DEA to conduct human clinicalresearch with marijuana (though he is registered with the DEA to conduct laboratory research withmarijuana) because NIDA and the Public Health Service (PHS) didn't like his privately-funded,FDA-approved protocol and refused to sell him marijuana, effectively preventing his study fromtaking place.

As this is an FDA Phase I study, our first and foremost goal is to demonstrate safety and tolerability of psilocybin in human subjects. At the sametime, we are collecting pilot data regarding psilocybin's efficacy in treating OCD. The latter effort is based on anecdotal andtheoretical evidence whichsuggests that psilocybin re-lieves the symptoms of OCDin some patients. Thus far, we have had 7 subjects and a total of 22psilocybin dosing sessions. All sessions have been tolerated well with no significant adverse effects. All 7 subjects have saidthat they would, if given the chance, repeat their session experience again. We are still lookingfor volunteers to participate as subjects in the study, and hope to finish the study before July 2003. Preliminary findings willbe made available in May at theAmerican Psychiatric Associa-tion meeting in San Francisco. Potential subjects must meet the following criteria: age21-65 years old, must have pre-vious experience withpsychedelic drugs, and musthave OCD which istreatment resistant (e.g. havetried one or more first-linemedications at adequate dosagefor a minimum of 4 weekswithout significant improve-ment in OCD symptoms).Those interested in at 626-7708 orvia e-mail: participate,travel defrayed if you assistance.Effects Psilocybin Wiegand, M.D., Co-Investigator (cbw@u.arizona.edu) \"As this is an FDA Phase I study, our first and foremost goal is to demonstrate thesafety and tolerability of psilocybin inhuman subjects.\" I would like to thank MAPS for their support of my trip to Switzerland and Germany.

In its capacity as a tool of divination, the predomi-nant known use of this plant (aside from general problem solving, suchas finding lost objects) occurred in the context of healing ceremonies,for the treatment of disease. Typically, these healing rituals involved the oral consumption of large doses (50-100 leaves) of the plant in order to induce alteredstates of consciousness that fostered the detection of specific ailments.Significantly, the means of such identification of a specific conditionwas often through self-report. The Mazatec Indians, who referred tothis herb by a number of names, most commonly 'ska Maria pastora' ('leaves of the Virgin Mary, theShepherdess'), also employed this plant medicinally for the management of such conditions asheadache, diarrhoea, rheumatism and anaemia (Valdez, Diaz & Paul, 1983). Recent investigations have isolated the neoclerodane diterpenes Salvinorin A, B and C as the main constituents (Ortega, Blount & Manchand, 1982; Valdez et al., 2001; Roth et al., 2002), andthe psychoactivity of this herb, identified by earlier investigators (Wasson, 1962), has been clearlydelineated only recently (Siebert, 1994). Like other plant substances (e.g. nutmeg) and many pre-scription medications (e.g. belladonna alkaloids), there may be considerable variation in thepsychoactivity of Salvia divinorum depending on dosage and method of ingestion. Oral consumption of Salvia divinorum requires that the herb material be brought into extended contact with the oral mucosa (held in the mouth for 15-30 minutes), producing significant effects lasting up to an hour. Clinical use In December, 1997, following discus- sions some months earlier concerning thepossible healing potential of various plantsubstances in psychiatric conditions, atreatment-resistant depressed patient (Ms.G) under the care of the author reportedthe serendipitous management of her symp-toms of depression with use of Salvia divinorum obtained via a mail-order herbal supplier (Hanes, 2001).

Hanes, Ph.D. (khanes@rocketmail.com), Cognitive-Behavioural Treatment Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia \"Although it is too early to drawdefinitive conclusions regardingthe antidepressant potential ofSalvia divinorum , initial results are promising, with the majority ofpatients reporting lasting benefitsfrom their use of this herb.\" Salvia divinorum19 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 tion, the author has treated several patients with refractory (or treatment-resistant) depressionsince that time, adapting to varying circum-stances and requirements the broad protocolfollowed by Ms. G in the self-management ofher symptoms of depression, namely oral doseof 2-3 Salvia divinorum leaves (1/2 to 3/4 of a gram of leaf material) three times per week. Priorto the prohibition of Salvia divinorum in Austra- lia in June 2002, I had introduced the herb tosix additional patients, five of whom have pro-vided valuable feedback regarding their use. Ihave also had contact with over 20 individualsfrom around the world who report beneficial ef-fects of this herb in their lives, including relieffrom depressive symptoms. Although it is too early to draw definitive conclusions regarding the antidepressant poten-tial of Salvia divinorum , initial results are prom- ising, with the majority of patients reportinglasting benefits from their use of this herb. Inaddition to significantly reduced scores on quan-titative measures of depression, some of thereported benefits of the herb include mood en-hancement and increased feelings of relaxationand self-awareness. In the case of a severelydepressed 24-year old patient, who has sincediscontinued use of the herb, the use of Salvia divinorum o v e r s e v e r a l m o n t h s s t i m u l a t e d a nongoing interest in meditation and hypnogogic/hypnopompic states. The author has receivedno reports of any deleterious effects arising fromthe use of this herb. Only occasional feelings of'lightheadedness' have been reported as a sideeffect, with some patients also expressing dis-like for the bitter flavor of the leaf material. Among the initial barriers to such work is the lack of availability of Salvia divinorum in a standardised form, the relative sparsity of re-fractory depression cases, the difficulty control-ling for the possible benefits of self-adminis-tered larger doses of the herb, and the apparentdifferential sensitivity of patients to the herb'seffects. Notably, the emphasis in this work thusfar has been largely on patient management,and not on producing results, even if this werepossible, commensurate with a clinical trial. Finally, several patients have reported ben- efits of a broadly 'psychospiritual' quality fromtheir unsanctioned occasional use of larger dosesof this herb, incorporating such experiences asloss of body awareness (e.g. becoming numbers,household objects), being present in an alter-nate reality, ineffability (difficulty describing theexperience with words), nature mysticism, andincreased intuitive insight (Hanes, 2001). Theseexperiences certainly fall outside the parametersof mainstream mental health practice. However,the personal growth and healing significance ofintegrating such experiences into the lives ofthose bearing such symptoms as hopelessness,worthlessness, loss of interest/pleasure in allactivities and difficulty finding 'meaning' in theirlives cannot be underestimated. Discussion The use of plant substances for the treat- ment of depression has a long history in herbal medicine, and herbs such as St John's Wort arenow well recognised treatments for this condi-tion (Linde et al., 1996). Given also that thereis an extensive literature supporting the use ofpsychedelic agents in psychiatric conditions,including depression (see Riedlinger & Riedlinger,1994 for a review), it would not be surprisingthat herbs demonstrating short-acting andunique psychoactivity, such as Salvia divinorum, may find some application in this broad inter-face between such disciplines as psychiatry, psy- \"Furthermore, this herb demonstrates a very broad and uniquespectrum of psychoactivity, ranging from very mild 'mood-altering effects' to purportedly more profound experiences....\"20 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 chopharmacology and herbal medicine. In terms of future directions, exploring the effect of this herb on specific receptor and neurobehavioural systems (eg. Ukai, Suzuki &Mamiya, 2002), and its propensity to uncoverunderlying emotional or psychic conflicts, con-sistent with its traditional use to detect illness,also merits study. Furthermore, this herb dem-onstrates a very broad and unique spectrum ofpsychoactivity, ranging from very mild 'mood-altering effects' to purportedly more profoundexperiences such as 1) 'becoming objects', sug-gesting possible overlap with attainmentsof 1994). Correspondingly, the future pros-pects for this herb may extend beyond its clini-cal use for conditions such as refractory depres-sion toward the unfoldment of human potential(Walsh & Vaughan, 1993; Tart, 1997).

Native American Church (NAC) leaders are find- ing it increasingly difficult to obtain adequate supplies for theirchurch meetings, and even when they succeed, the peyote buttonsare smaller and the price is higher. Why is this happening? The dwindling of peyote populations is in part attributable to agricultural practices such as rootplowing, which totally annihilatespopulations of peyote and other plants, and permanently destroysthe habitat by converting it into \"improved\" pasture. Almost as damaging is improper harvesting by the agents of the peyoteros who are licensed to collect and sell peyote to mem-bers of the NAC. \"Proper\" harvesting means cutting off the consum-able crown (or head) of the cactus at ground level, leaving the rootintact to sprout one or more \"pups\" that will grow into new adult crowns over a period of a fewyears. But some of these contract peyote harvesters are digging whole peyote plants up by theroots, which the peyoteros then cut off and discard (or give to their customers as lagniappe, to beused for making tea). This practice obviously precludes regeneration and any subsequent produc-tion from the uprooted plants. Replenishing the dug-up population by seed is also difficult;peyote is an extremely slow-growing species, and it may take a peyote plant ten years fromgermination to reach a harvestable size under natural conditions. The harvesting of peyote for illicit use almost certainly occurs, as well, but because it is illegal, it is also unregulated. There are no records to provide quantitative data, so its extent isunknowable. The other major source of depletion is chronic over-harvesting. Faced with steady to increasing demand for peyote by the NAC, and a decreasing number of ranchers willing to lease peyote harvest-ing rights, the peyoteros or their agents are returning too soon to harvest peyote from rancheswhere they harvested previously, without waiting for adequate regrowth to occur from plants thatwere properly harvested the last time. The vis-ible result of this hurried reharvesting at ever-smaller time intervals is that the peyote but-tons offered for sale by the peyoteros havemarkedly decreased in size in recent years. Themore subtle result of this repeated too-frequentharvesting is that eventually the rootstocks ofthe peyote plants are exhausted, and no fur-ther regeneration of new sprouts occurs - theplants simply die. Is there a solution to this problem in sight? There are as yet no U.S. regulations toPeyote Population Genetics Study Martin Terry, Ph.D., Department of Biology, Texas A&M University (mterry@txcyber.com) \"There are as yet no U.S. regulations to protect peyote as a species, as it does not (yet) meet the criteria of the Endangered Species Act for 'threatened' or 'endangered' status.\" 25 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 Rick Doblin (RD): I found out about your autobiogra- phy [Hello Darlin': Tall (And Absolutely True) Tales About My Life by Larry Hagman with Todd Gold] after my mother- in-law sent me a book review, which mentioned your experiences with LSD. When you wrote the book, whatthoughts did you have about whether or not to includethose stories? Larry Hagman (LH): There was never any thought of not including it. LSD was such a profound experience in my life that it changed my pattern of life and my way ofthinking and I could not exclude it. I didn't write thebook to sell the book, but to tell my experiences. RD: Did you have anybody advise you not to put that in, that it might hurt your reputation?LH: No, not at all.RD: Has it influenced your reputation?LH: I'd say it probably has. Now people can dump me in that big ashcan of Hollywood kooks, instead of someone who's experimenting with self-awareness. Now they can brush me off as oneof those people who are not like them. And I'm not. Again, of course we know I am one of themas they are me. RD: Would it be fair to say that you don't regret putting that in the book?LH: Not so far. I'm sure I will when they haul me off to jail for something I did over 30 years ago.RD: Had you thought about talking about it at earlier stages in your career?LH: It's never bothered me. I've always talked about it, though I haven't talked about it on Larry King or any of those kinds of things. Actually, in a way I did. I alluded to it when I was on hisshow talking about having an out-of-body experience and a white-light experience. I didn't sayLSD, but anybody who had the experience could see that it was exactly what I was talking about. RD: Near the end of your book, you talked about an experience after your transplant and said that \"on medication, I was able to blend into the bigger picture, the way I had done on my first acidInterview with Larry Hagman: Star of Dallas and I Dream of Jeannie Rick Doblin, Ph.D. 26 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 trip.\" Earlier in the book, you wrote about your first LSD experience and said \"more than any-thing else, the experience changed my way oflooking at life and death.\" LH: Especially death... Here's a bit of my his- tory. Before I tried LSD, I'd been going to a psy-chologist for a couple of years. I found out aboutsuccess that you have to fight for it a lot, thenwhen you achieve it you can't give up the fight.I was kind of like flogging a dead horse. I'dachieved what Iwanted to anddidn't know how tostop. I had to to-bacco and mild form of am-phetamine, doctor-prescribed of course. I'd comeout here to California and run out of my pre-scription. I went in to have it refilled and theysaid, well, we can't do that until you get adoctor's prescription, which I got, and they gaveit to me. On the bottle it said, Caution, thismedication may become habit forming. I thoughtthat's a lot of shit, I've been taking it every dayfor five years for weight control for crying outloud. It never occurred to me that I was ad-dicted to something like that. Well, I decided tostop. And I did. I stopped smoking, and I stoppedspeed at the same time. My body and my psychesaid, What the fuck's going on here? We can't dothis without punishing you. I was having spellsof anger and depression, like you go through whenyou quit smoking. Quitting those two drugs putme in a state when one day, on the set, I startedcrying and I started shitting and my nose wasrunning, ear wax was coming out, I was like ex-ploding, or imploding, and every kind of impu-rity in my body was leaving my body. They threwme in the back of a pickup truck because nobodywanted to put me in their car. They didn't want to touch me because I was just covered in excrement, and I mean justeverything. They took me to a friend of mine'spsychologist, Sidney Prince, a wonderful guy.He cleaned me up, I took a shower, and he satme down and said, What's the problem? I said Ihonestly don't know. It just never occurred tome that withdrawal was causing this stuff. Ididn't know anything about drugs. I had smokedmarijuana before that, but that was the onlydrug I had been familiar with, except tobaccoand alcohol of course. We had a good couple ofhours session and I had gotten a lot of stuffout. At the end of that session, he said he wanted to tell mesomething and thatI might not agreewith him, but oneof these days Imight. I said, God,what is it? Give me the answer. He says, Don't worry about it. Itwas such a simple statement and so profoundthat I just kind of dismissed it as a panacea.Don't worry about it. Sure, don't worry. Don'tworry about it. Here I am at the height of mysuccess at that time making a lot of money. Thenhe also said, Well, look at it this way. You're ina golden prison and they let you out on week-ends, and you go home to Malibu and you swimand play with your children. And then on Mon-day through Friday you're in this golden prisonwhere everybody loves you and takes care ofyou and admires you and nurtures you. That'snot so bad. I didn't get the picture. It took mea couple of years. He was dead right of course.I mean when you look at the suffering aroundthe world and here was this rich asshole whowas having problems. I did successfully kick tobacco at the age of 34. I smoked for like 20 years, from 14 to 34.Then I kind of reached a point where I was prettyhappy with everything. So Sidney asked me howmuch further did I want to go with this? Hesaid, Larry, you've gotten to a point now whereyou're repeating yourself and you know you'relying about a lot of stuff, lying through just nottelling me. I said, yeah, you're right, there are a \"I think you need some sort of catalyst...I think you ought to drop acid.\"28 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 said, just go with it. Don't fight it, don't pull away from it and if it's a wonderful experiencedon't try to grab it and keep it because it willdisappear and leave you. I couldn't understandwhat he was talking about. I looked up to myleft, about eight feet in the air right up againstthe ceiling was sitting my grandmother in thesame robe. I mean exactly the same robe. She'scommunicating with me, not verbally but she'slooking down at me very benignly. She was sosweet and so kind andsupportive. She was tell-ing me not to fear theportal, not to worry aboutit, not to care whether Iwent in it or not, not tofight being pulled into it,and not to hold onto apleasurable experiencedown the line. She mademe relax, and I went[NOISE] through this tun-nel. Sure enough at theend was this brilliantwhite light. I got to the end of it and I kind ofstepped out into this wonderful light that waswarm. It felt like blood, you know, it felt likebody temperature. It was the perfect place. Therewas a figure, kind of a presence there sayingsomething like how are you feeling? Are youfeeling OK? I said, yeah, everything's wonder-ful. I got this great feeling of love and onenesswith everything. I had seen the Aurora Borealisone time, and I had the feeling that it was madeup of atomic particles and electrons and mag-netism, and there were these waves of brilliantlight and beauty, and I became part of that. Ifelt that it was so natural, so familiar like I'dalways been there. It wasn't anything new. Itwas just coming home. Then the presence kind of said, OK, you've had a glimpse of this. I don't really know whatit said, it was this inner feeling. It said, that'sall for now, but you're familiar with it. You knowwhere you've been. I went out sitting in front ofthis cave opening that was closed up and thereweren't any more horrible animals and figures.My grandmother was still there and she justlooked down at me and kind of nodded and justkind of faded away. Well, it was the most im-pressive thing that ever happened to me. I'dread about people having religious experiencesand that would be my religious experience. Idon't like the use of the word religious, becausereligions have been handled by too many inter- pretations, too many cor-ruptions. It was like thebasic teachings of theuniverse, of the onenessof the universe. Then Istarted getting up andwandering around, and Iwas really very strong. Imean I was invincible.My friend gave me anorange and I peeled theorange, and as I waspeeling it I could see itmoving like maggots un- derneath my fingers. I could see that it was dy-ing, it wasn't replacing itself. In other words,it wasn't rejuvenating itself or regenerating it-self. It was a piece of dead flesh, but it wasmoving all the time in my hands, moving. ThenI looked up in the mirror, which was a big mis-take, and I saw that my face was doing the samething only it was dying and regenerating itself.All the skin was sloughing off, not down to theskeleton or anything like that, but it was justlike it was dying and being reborn. In otherwords, the cellular structure was not dead likethe orange. It was rejuvenating itself. It wasmoving very well. I had to take a few breathsbecause it was a new experience to see yourselfdying, literally dying. Then all of a sudden Ifelt that the whole experience had been of dy-ing, and it was wonderful. I don't know how youput it scientifically - loss of ego, loss of self,combining with everything, being part of ev-erything, being part of the mirror, being part of \"My grandmother was telling me not to fear the portal, not to worry about it, not to care whether I went in it or not, not to fight being pulled in it, not to hold on to a pleasurable experience....\"29 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 the woodwork and being part of the air. It was the most familiar feeling I've ever had. Then myfriend and I got in a car and he gave me a 16-millimeter camera and we went around SantaMonica and Beverly Hills, him driving and melooking at people. It also had a zoom on it, andI could zoom into people's eyeballs with thisthing. I could see what they were thinking, Icould read their thoughts, I could anticipatetheir moves. It was a very psychic experience.Then I was them, I could anticipate what theywere doing even before they did it. Well, thatwas kind of a wonderful experience, too, anddisturbing in the sense that I could see a lot ofsadness. Then I went home and I didn't eat thatday. I just wasn't hungry. My solar plexus andmy pubic area, I mean that chakra was just ex-hausted. I can't remember ever being so tiredwithout physically being tired from exercise. ThenI had three months of introspection, I guessthat was what it was, trying to analyze what I'dbeen through. Of course I told everybody and Ibecame the prognosticator. I was the guy whosaid the world's got to do this. It'll save theworld. Of course, that was what was going on inthose years, the decade of love, with so manypeople going through those experiences andtransferring them onto other people and trad-ing off on them and wanting to include every-body because it was a gift. I'm sure it was Jesusor Mohammed or Buddha, those people who hadthis gift and they wanted to give it to peopleand they couldn't stop themselves. Well, ofcourse I told some wrong people, including mybosses and so forth. [LAUGHTER] They were an-other generation, like 20 years older than I, andof course it made them scared of me. It madethem feel like I was generating that light youget in your eyes when you're out there, prosely-tizing. I was kind of na\u00efve at the time, too. In essence, next to being born which I don't remember at all (I mean I suppose I could trace itback if I were to try), my first acid trip was themost illuminating experience of my life. I wouldhighly recommend it for people who study andprepare for it and who are not neurotic or psy-chotic. I don't know what it would do to psy-chotic people. I know what it does to neurotic people who can't handle that. They getterrified and do crazy things like jump-ing out of windows and stuff like that.That's happened to a couple of friendsof mine. RD: Now that you've had all these years to look back on it, does it still seem like a valid experience? Have you beentempted to dismiss it as an aberrationor a mental illness? LH: No. Fuck no. I took it three times after my first experience. None of themwere of that intensity, but it did bringme back to the place. The whole thingwas so familiar that I know I've beenthere before many times, maybe in re-incarnation, which I don't particularlybelieve in because nobody's ever con-vinced me that it's possible. But I cer- Aurora BorealisLASP/University of Colorado there's another level....\"\"I don't fear death because I know30 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 tainly knew that I had reached a level that was familiar to me, and that the next level of exist-ence and awareness is not necessarily the only.There could be trillions. There could be infinitelevels of these types of experiences. For one thing, the experience was of ultimate love, of ultimate oneness, of ultimate understanding ofnature. There was still a sense of discovery atthe same time, but the love was so familiar. Thatdidn't happen on the same level on the otherthree occasions because I had taken it withsomeone else. Well, to tell you the truth, mywife, I took her through her first experience.She had exactly the same thing, so we had some-thing to compare it to. Then we took it to-gether a couple of times after that. It was neversensual, although it is the ultimate sensuality.It was never a sexual thing. I've never gotteninto that. I was 34 and I was old enough not tohave been drawn into the fun and games thatmany people experienced. I never found it tobe fun and games. I found it to be enlighten-ing and mind expanding. It does take a toll,because it takes some time for me to digest thatexperience. Just now, when I was telling youabout the experience, I was there. I was abso-lutely there emotionally, physically. It was verymoving. RD: What's amazing to me is that it is so vivid in your memory. Is there anything from thatsame period of time that is as imprinted? LH: Well, of course the Vietnam war. There was always that trauma of the war. I always felt guiltythat I had not been more vocal about it. I wasplaying an astronaut in the United States AirForce, and they were always asking me to go toVietnam and entertain the troops. I couldn't doit. We went down to a location at Coco Beachin Florida where the launches eventually started, and they wanted me to wear a Major's AirForce uniform like the one I was wearing inI Dream of Jeannie. I couldn't do it. I hadmade a dark, dark blue navy suit and I hadan enameled dove that I had gotten, a littledove. I wore that to the Officer's Club atCocoa Beach. Well, boy, talk about na\u00efve. Ihad a woman come up to me at the bar andsay, what are you wearing? I said a peace dove. She says, you son of a bitch, my husband'sover there (and he was eventually killed in Viet-nam), and he's giving his life and his family foryou, to protect you from the commies. You comeinto this place, you cocksucker... And they hadto kind of drag that poor woman off. I've neverbeen confronted quite like that before. Of courseshe was absolutely right. I should have worn anice dark blue suit and shut my fucking mouthand played the game, but I didn't do that. Butthat was about the only protest that I made,because I was scared like everybody else. I wasscared like everybody is now. Anyhow, that whole period of time was my psychedelic time. I also experimented withmushrooms and peyote once, never again. RD: Because of the vomiting?LH: No. I did it in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with an Indian, an old man. He says come and haveone of our religious meetings. I said sure. Ididn't know it was peyote. I didn't know whathe was talking about. So I went out there. Iwas interested in religion and everything of thatsort. I went to this old Quonset hut, and therewere about eight Indian boys there and a coupleof guys my age who were familiar with it andthis old shaman. His name was TellusGoodmorning. He had an empty can and a cof-fee can full of peyote beans or buttons and a \"Just now, when I was telling youabout the experience, I was there. Iwas absolutely there emotionally,physically. It was very moving.\" can of water. He says, you're going to eat these peyote buttons slowly and chew them and theywill not taste good. Boy, was he ever right.They were slimy and really awful. I said to my-self, what the fuck am I doing this for? Well, Igot about half of them down. They were big andI got sick like I've never been sick before, but asI was being sick it was like purifying my body. Icould feel things going from my fingertips, badthings going all over my body and in throughmy bowels and up through my vomit and intothis empty can. Then I had tremendous thirst,so I would drink the water and then vomit, theneat some more buttons and vomit. I was doingwhat I was told and I was starting to have aninteresting experience. I became this kind ofwarrior bird like a hawk only it had fur insteadof feathers on it. I'm looking down at my feet,which are like animal claws, not bird claws butanimal claws like dog feet or wolf feet. Then Itook off and flew around and I flew right throughthe walls of the Quonset hut. I was flying aroundand looking down and seeing through the wallsand seeing the Indian boys freaking out. I meanthey thought they were going to go and get drunkor sniff gasoline or something. Their entire ori-entation was just suddenly - there wasn't anyorientation. I thought they it might have beenprepared better by the shaman. Well, anyhow acouple of them had to be taken to the hospitaland the other boys were like, I mean screamingand crying and having a terrible, terrible time. Iflew around, and I flew around the mountainsup there looking down. Everything was like sun-light, but not sunlight. Everything was notbright but seeable and beautiful. Oh, my God, Icould actually fly, I mean the feeling of beingable to fly. I'm sure you've done it in dreams, itwas just almost sexual. Then I got back to earthand went through a series of things where I foundmy song, I found myself. That gave me some-thing to hold onto in real life when I had mytransplant. After the transplant I was disori-ented and so forth, and I was drugged withmorphine and all kinds of things. I found mysong again, which helped me get through thosetimes. It was a wonderful experience, not that I'veever wanted to do that again. I wouldn't want to do it.It was too, too, I don't know. It wasn't as good as theLSD experience or any of the mushroom experiences. RD: I've had experience with a fair amount of pure mescaline, which has a lot of warm bodyenergy without the nausea. \"I became this kind of warrior bird like a hawk, only it had fur instead of feathers on it...not bird claws but animal claws like dog feet or wolf feet....Then I took off and flew around and I flew right through the walls of the Quonset hut....Then I got back to earth and went through a series of things where I found my song, I found myself.\"32 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 LH: Oh God, energy. All of these experiences are accompanied by tremendous physical power.That's why you often find yourself bruised andknocked about afterward, because you do thingsyou wouldn't normally do. Your brain says don'tjump off that tower, don't jump off the secondstory building because you can. Well, somepeople jump from a little too high. RD: C a n y o u d e s c r i b e t h e song more?LH: Oh, I can even sing it. The lyrics I can't sing, but thesong is about ancient things,ancient animals that were ancient before man washere. It was before man knew what to do withhimself. It was all kinds of animals that I'd neverseen before. And it goes [HUMMING]. That man,Tellus Goodmorning was a great shaman. Hetook a lot of people through that ceremony, andhe was my mentor. When I'm in trouble I think ofthis old Indian as one of my life mentors. RD: Can you understand in a way how he could be in touch with such spiritual power and yetstill be a drunk? LH: I don't know. I met Alan Watts one time up at Esalen. I wondered in there with my son. Wewent on a father-son trek up to San Franciscoand on the way back down I stopped at Esalen.I'd been there once before with my wife, whenAlan Watts was there. I thought that this guywas brilliant. I'd never heard anybody talk aboutZen, nor did I know anything about it. It was avery nice experience meeting him, actually get-ting to know him, and bathing in the hot springswith him. It was really a great experience. Thena couple of years later he came down to Malibuand a friend of mine wanted Watts to take himthrough the LSD experience, which he did. Well,I was all psyched up to see him again. I had myengineer Bill outfit, which is striped overalls,striped coat and an engineer drill hat. It wasone of those periods of time. It had peace dovesall over it and feathers. I was going to make animpression. I thought that that was the cat'smeow, and it was. I felt good in it. So AlanWatts comes in and he sits down at the bar andhe says, \"I'd like a very strong gin martini, thankyou very much,\" and proceeded to drink aboutfive of them and was absolutely gone. Here wasanother mentor of mine. Oh, by the way, after the LSD experience I totally understood what his book was about, The Joyous Cosmology, be- cause it was so much fun even though it wasscary. It was so illuminating and so fun. It wasa joyous cosmology that we live in that's avail-able to us at all times. [LAUGHTER] Then Ithought, oh God, here's this guy coming to takethis guy through a spiritual experience and getsshit-faced the first minute he walks through thedoor. I thought that was kind of interesting. Idon't know. People do strange and exotic things.In a conversation I had with him one time Iasked him how would he like his room to be? Hesaid \"I'd like to be in a room, a teak wood room,ancient, ancient boards and ancient cupboards.I'd like to crawl all over the rroom with drawerswith all kinds of spices and smells and sightsand drugs in them,\" you know, everything avail-able to mankind that was known at the timeand some that weren't. He says that's my room.That's not too shabby. I wouldn't mind thatmyself. [LAUGHTER] RD: You mentioned going to Esalen with your son to expose him to some of these ideas anddoing LSD with Maj. One of the main motiva-tions and rationalizations for the war on drugsis to protect the kids. I'm wondering how didyou educate your kids, how did you share theseexperiences with them? Or, did you even? \"That man, Tellus Goodmorning, was a great shaman. He took a lot of people through that ceremony, and he was my mentor.\"33 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 LH: Well, we didn't make any bones about smok- ing pot or anything like that. We always did it in front of them, especially when we'd go camping.I never really thought about it much. RD: Did you feel that it would be worse to try to hide it from them? LH: Of course it is.RD: Virtually none of my friends who smoke pot will do that infront of their kids. LH: I know, and their kids are smoking potand they didn't wantto do it in front oftheir parents. Youknow, really, that'stoo bad because it is a wonderful experience tohave that closeness that you achieve there, fromthose kind of herbs. RD: It's also a way to educate kids about ap- propriate and responsible use. LH: Of course.RD: What about your grandkids? Have you spo- ken to them about drugs or have they asked youabout the LSD? LH: Well, I have spoken about it to my 17-year- old granddaughter. I've asked her if she smokedpot and she says she hasn't. She's been heavyinto volleyball and I think that's one thing tokeep kids off drugs. I don't think anybody underthe age of 35 should do anything until they'vegot a certain mindset and they've got as mucheducation as they can. RD: Well, now you're talking just like Jewish mysticism, because the idea is that you don'teven deal with mysticism until you're 40. That'sthe tradition. LH: Really?RD: B u t i f y o u l o o k a t t h e N a t i v e A m e r i c a n Church culture, if you look at the cul-tures that useayahuasca, theydon't have age lim-its on drugs. Theyinvite their kids tothe ceremonies andtheir kids learn acertain kind of re-spect and thatthere's a time and aplace for it. Theyalso offer them smallamounts if they're interested in it. I think the cultures that havesuccessfully integrated psychedelics in particu-lar, the young grow up in it. If they're called toit, they try it; if they aren't, they don't. LH: How about the technological influence? It seems we're talking about a pretty primitiveculture, in the sense of technology. Perhaps ina religious sense or from the psychic sense anda metaphysical sense, they might be long be-yond us. But they don't also have the pressuresof music, cars, and television, films, dancing,sounds and interaction with complicated cul-tures. RD: In Brazil, the ayahuasca religion has moved out of the jungles into middle-class, upper classsociety. That's one of the reasons why it wasable to be declared legal in Brazil, because therewere some advocates there who had mainstreamconnections like physicians and lawyers. Ourtechnological culture is different than the na-tive cultures but I think we do have some ex-amples where young people are brought up \"I was about 34 when I first smoked marijuana...I remember my best friend offering me the joint and I went home and I burst into tears. I said, my best friend's a junkie. I swear to God, because that's the way people were taught.\"35 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 drink more, made them more aware of it. It increased the excitement of it and, of course,alcohol is violence-making. Tobacco, of course,just plain old kills you, slowly and painfully. Out-lawing those things doesn't work. Education, Iguess, is the only way to do it. I'm also an ad-vocate for drug courts, which gives your 18 year-old daughter a choice not to have to go prisonfor two years for getting caught with an ounceand a half of marijuana. It gives her a chance togo and clean up her act and take drug testingand pay for it herself and walk away after sixmonths or a year, or two years, or whatever ittakes. Drug Court gives them a choice, givesthem some sort of out. RD: I'm still curious about how LSD helped you reduce the fear of death. LH: T otally , absolutely gone from my life , at this stage. I don't know what it's gonna bewhen that moment comes. You can't ever pre-dict that, but I don't fear it now. I do fear painand immobilization and all the things that gowith being old, but I don't fear death, becauseI know there's another level. I've been there.I've been there twice. The other time was mytransplant, when I went through a slightly dif-ferent way. I had the out-of-body experience,looking down at myself, floating, and I couldhear everybody's conversation and I knew whatwas going on and I could see them and me,wide open down there and then I went into thatnext level, that warm, familiar love level anddidn't worry about it again. I mean, it was won-derful. And there was one extra thing in thatparticular out-of-body experience, psychic ex-perience, that I envisioned - that we're all likethose ferns that curl up and they get bigger andbigger and bigger and they grow up and thenthey explode, you know, and they're beautiful?I envision us as all of that and all of the lifeforce that we have. It was kind of a mixture ofanimistic and soul and we are all of that, every-thing with soul, in there, inside where we haveblooming guts and so forth inside of us. We'regrowing all the time. And that pulse went alongwith my song, which was a pulse, da-da-da-da-na, da-da-da-da. And this thing would explodeand the life force like sperm would come out ofthat explosion and then it'd wrap back up againand I'd get the song going and it would pulseand pulse and pulse and pulse and pulse andthen, boom! Spread our seed through the uni-verse. Woo! Boy! That was different. You everhad anything like that? RD: Not just like that, no.LH: The pulsating and the striving to spread our seed, the striving for survival of existenceof our genes, whatever it is. Oh, God! That wastremendous! It was sexual, a real sexual experi-ence and there I was, lying wide open. I couldsee myself having that experience at the sametime. It was very odd and very, kind of comfort-ing, in a way, to have a new experience, one Ihad never even envisioned before, that we wereanimal, vegetable and the desire and the strengthand the striving to survive was always there, inus. That wears you out! Boy! The human race,unless we totally destroy ourselves, which isn'tquite imminent, might possibly become, alreadyis a strong, strong pulse in the universe. Godhelp us, I think, actually, somebody knows thatwe're fucking up down here. We're so infinitesi-mal in the whole scheme, in the universe. Ifyou look out there and you see hundreds of bil- lions and trillions of stars with systems as big as our whole Milky Way, it's just infinite, I guess.Could there be a finite end? I think that deathand LSD go hand and glove. If you have a largechance of having an enlightening, life-enhanc-ing experience, or making death easier for you,even enjoyable and something to look forwardto, what's wrong with that? \"Death and LSD go hand and glove....\"37 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 Sandra Karpetas, Higher Knowledge Network (windforme@graffiti.net)Ground Central Station at the Boom Festival: Creating a Safe Space for Working with Psychedelic Crises \"Ground Central Station was set inside a 16-foot diameter geodesic dome covered by white parachutes and decorated to be a cozy and inviting environment.\"Over the last few years, there have been ever-increasing numbers of young people attending large music events, raves and trance festivals around the world. This global emergence of events, although mostly focused on music and the arts, has also seen an increase in the use of psychoactive substances.Progressive promoters are beginning to respond by including harm reduction elements in the organiza-tion of their events, such as chill-out rooms for dancers to rest and safe spaces for those undergoing psychedelic crises. With the support of MAPS and festival promoters, we have been creating a model for services which reflects the needs ofthose who choose to use drugs at these events, thereby, directlymeeting users \"where they are.\" Our intent is to provide spaces inwhich people can safely allow their psychedelic experiences tounfold, as well to provide central and reliable sources of informa-tion for those who seek to deepen their awareness of alteredstates. This is one of the emerging faces of harm reduction beingput into practice. The Boom Festival During the August 2002 full moon in Idanha-a-Nova, Portugal, the Boom Festival was a 5-day, 12,000 person, psychedelic trance festival. It was set up as a temporary autonomous zone for an intentional gathering of the global trance/dance community. The organizers created an environment in which to explore the music, dance, time-as-art mindframe, and the ever evolving andchanging culture bornout An excerptfrom many expressions andshapes it assumes. A cul-tural event as an expres-sion does not just focuson one of the aspects ofthe Art, but in thewhole.\" This statement The serene location for the 2002 Boom Festival, on the shores of the Barragem de Idanha-a-Nova, in Portugal.38 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 helped to create the general mindset of those par- ticipating, to become involved in the event as aco-created space in which to explore the manypotentials inherent within a community focusedon creating art to express itself. Aspects of the festival included the main stage, an Ambient Garden chill-out area, a Psy-artgallery, a Dreamspell/Mayan calendar workshopdome, Psynema (showing movies and video fromthe psytrance community during the evenings), amarket, chai tents, and an interactive daytime con-ference area known as the Dynamic MythologiesTent. Organized by InVisible Productions, the Dy-namic Mythologies Tent was intended to generatedialogue with festival participants on the nature,implications and integration of the psychedelic ex-perience. Hosting presentations, workshops, anddiscussions over the course of the festival withthe exploration of such themes as: consciousnessand the nature of and the inte-gration of the psychedelic landscape into every-day life. Presentations and workshops from suchnotable psychedelic visionaries as Erik Davis, JonHanna, Alex Grey, Wilbert Alix, Zoe Seven, Charles Hayes, Morgan Brent and next-generationneuronaut linguists Sijay and Delvin made for avery interesting, interactive experience unlike anyother offered at a music festival. Ground Central Station The creation of a safe space for Boom Festi- val participants was an excellent foresight of the Good Mood Productions team, organizers of theBoom Festival. It was named \"Ground Central Sta-tion\" to give it the sense of an easily accessible,welcoming space to which Boom participants couldcome to 'ground' themselves if needed. GroundCentral Station was intentionally created to be aplace to which those undergoing difficult psyche-delic experiences could come if they required so-lace from the constant stimulus and continuoustrance music of the festival. Hosted by experienced volunteer facilitators from the Higher Knowledge Network and a certi-fied Holotropic Breathwork practitioner and un-derground psychedelic to facilitate journeyers while minimizing in-terference with the flow of the user's experience.In May of 2002 MAPS hosted a similar space calledthe Serenity Tent at the Hookahville festival inColumbus, Ohio, which I also helped to facilitate.(For details see the article written by Brandy Doylein the fall edition 2001 of the MAPS Bulletin orhttp://www.maps.org/ritesofpassage/difficultexperiences.html) Ground Central Station was set inside a 16- foot diameter geodesic dome covered by white para-chutes and decorated to be a cozy and invitingenvironment. It was supplied with informationabout MAPS, including articles about how to treatdifficult psychedelic experiences (seewww.maps.org/ritesofpassage/anonther.html), thePsychedelic Crises FAQ from Erowid.org(www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crises_faq.shtml), and drug info froma Portuguese harm reduction organization calledConversas Da Rua (Street Talk). This provided anopportunity for people to inform themselves aswell as find a safe space for challenging psyche-delic mind states. The space was designed to operate not only as a safe zone, but also as an interactive explor-atory dimension for interested trippers. It includedart supplies for nonverbal expression, bottled wa-ter, fresh fruit and other snacks, as well as a col-lective altar space for objects which represent theSacred, including galactic trading cards providedby Dew Press, aromatherapy oils, and incense. Theseelements made the environment more interactiveand helped to create an atmosphere of comfortand grounding. The Role of the Facilitators:\"Response-abilities\" While the job of assessing physical emergen- cies remained in the hands of the medic team, it39 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 was our job to deal with crises situations of a more psychological nature. We worked in conjunctionwith the medics, security, and festival organizers,and whenever anyone was found needing our as-sistance, we were instantly contacted by radiohandset. People came to the tent under the super-vision of festival staff, some were brought in byfriends, and some wandered in on their own. Those who did experience difficulties with their trips almost immediately calmed down onceinside the tent and were often able to enjoy theirexperiences afterward. Some retreated to an inter-nal state to reflect upon their journey and taketime to integrate whatever it was that they werefeeling and experiencing. Others seemed to appre-ciate the support we had to offer and many en-gaging discussions were generated about the na-ture of the psychedelic states being explored. Allin all, the benefits of creating this space werereadily apparent and many of those who had hadneed of the service affirmed it by coming back ata later time to saythanks. A part of our job as facilitators was towalk around the festi-val grounds to see if wecould find anyoneneeding help. On thefifth day of the festi-val, I found a youngman seated on theground in the blazingsun. He looked disori-ented, dehydrated andseemed to be talkingaloud to himself. I ap-proached him calmly and offered him some waterto drink. I sat there with him trying to establishrapport, and when we did begin to communicate,he seemed very comfortable with me. He told mehe had taken LSD for the first time in years alongwith a little MDMA. He said he was \"pretty high\"but that he was enjoying his experience. He ex-plained to me that he had been addicted to heroinfor a few years and that he and his girlfriend weretrying to kick the habit together. They had cometo the Boom Festival to get away from their usualscene and to try to have some fun while goingthrough the harsh withdrawals together. He wasquite proud that they hadn't used in the last twoweeks on their trip there, and was really glad to have an opportunity to be at an event like the Boom Festival. He felt the LSD and MDMA werehelping him that day to work through the issueshe had around his addiction, such as; his reasonsfor using heroin, his family life, the pressure heplaced on himself, and issues with physical pain. \"As a facilitator of the Ground Central Station tent, my experience at the Boom festival has had a very positive effecton my life. I not only got to make many new friends, but alsohad yet another opportunity to witness the powerful effectsthat psychedelics can have on us.\" A mural in spray paint at the 2002 Boom Fest40 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g As we walked around the festival we had an op- portunity to discuss the insights that he felt hewas gaining from the experience and what he com-municated to me was indeed a testament to thepotential therapeutic benefits of consciously usedpsychedelics and entheogens. For reasons I can only guess, we only had a small number of people come in for assistance. Itwas amazing to see that at a festival of 12,000people, the majority of the participants had veryfew problems with psychedelic usage. It may bebecause the population was mostly made up ofexperienced trippers who knew the effects, qual-ity, choices, and combinations of the substancesthey were taking (such as hash, LSD, DMT, and set & setting of the eventitself probably had a positive effect as well. As a facilitator of the Ground Central Station tent, my experience at the Boom festival has hada very positive effect on my life. I not only got tomake many new friends, but also had yet anotheropportunity to witness the powerful effects thatpsychedelics can have on us. I gained skills thatenable me to be a better facilitator, listener andfriend. It opened me up to the patterns involvedin the process of communication as well as in thecontent, and to using the skills of intuition, em-pathy, respect and understanding that I had be-come more attuned to through personal use ofpsychedelics and entheogens in the past. The experience of facilitating gave me the chance to explore and recognize that eachindividual's reality or model of the world enablesus to cherish, rather than judge or fear, the differ-ences that make us unique, and made me moreaware of the amazing and wonderful diversity ofhumanity. The Next Level... The Ground Central Station project was a great success in that all those who participated in or used the services felt it was a beneficial and re-warding experience. I can only speculate as to whatwould've become of those who needed help if wehadn't been there. Nobody should ever have to gothrough a difficult psychedelic journey withoutknowing that support can be found if needed. The potentials for a project like this are vast and multifaceted. The Serenity tent / Ground Cen-tral Station model can be adapted to each eventdepending on its specific needs and situations.Factors influencing this might be location, type ofevent, age / demographic of participants, and avail-ability of substances. Some events will require morefocus on crisis situations, others may involve moredetailed information booths and others may re-quire something more interactive and play oriented.Pill testing would also be an extremely valuablefunction of this project. The task of designing anoverall safe space and environment would be abenefit to any gathering where people are involvedin psychedelic exploration. It would be of great value if every music fes- tival and event promoter /organizational team wereto take this safe space model into consideration intheir future planned events. It shows great dedi-cation to the spirit of community and demonstratesa shared response-ability to look out for and takecare of each other. Perhaps in the future, through education, support and other opportunities to learn and com-municate about this vast landscape of the psyche-delic experience, the benefits and healing that canresult from psychonautic exploration will be com-mon knowledge. Until then, addressing and reduc-ing the potential harms associated with the unin-formed use of drugs is an important step to take.Ground Central Station offers an excellent modelto move the culture in that direction, and in themeantime, offers those who choose to usepsychoactives the support they need in times ofcrises.41 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 In the Summer of 2001, while doing anthropological research on ayahuasca healing in Iquitos, Peru, I had the opportunity to attend some meetings of a newly formed healers' organi- zation, ASMEVEI (Asociacion de Medicos Vegetalistas de Iquitos). I made the acquaintance ofseveral of its members, who assisted me with my research and remain my friends to this day. I brought the existence of the group to the attention of MAPS, which has generously offered them a donation of $500 to help support traditional plant-based psychedelic healing. The group, whose name means Association of Plant-based Healers of Iquitos, formed on June 17 th, 2001, with several important goals in mind. These are: 1) To strengthen and reestablish the value of traditional cultural practices and the socialvalues represented in the treatment of illness with medicinal plants of the PeruvianAmazon2)To gain recognition and support from public and private institutions3)To contribute to improving the state of public health, holistically, by using knowledgeand practice of traditional treatments with medicinal plants from the region4)To promote the training of new herbal doctors in order to disseminate and perpetuatemedicinal uses of plants.5)To contribute to the promotion and diffusion of traditional medicine6)To promote, coordinate and support the development of projects for the benefit ofmembers and the community7)To promote the conservation, cultivation, management, and careful use of medicinalplant resources so as to avoid overexploitation of the forest8) To formulate and carry out holistic development plans, through the activities of theassociation so that they may con-tribute to profitable use by theircountry. This group of curanderos was formed with the assistance of Elsa Rengifo, a biologist working with thePeruvian governmental research insti-tution IIAP (Institute for Research onthe Peruvian Amazon). Currently thereare 32 members of the association, 21men and 10 women who practice thevegetalista tradition.

In a typical healing ceremony, both thepatient, the healer, and in some cases, thepatient's family or friends will take ayahuasca tounderstand the cause of the illness and as a meansof purifying the body and spirit. These healersoften treat other kinds of illnesses as well, andtend to be knowledgeable about a variety of me-dicinal herbs. Ayahuasca and similar plants also play a vital role in training to become a curandero.The process of training involves learning thecuring techniques directly from the spirits ofteacher plants, in a process called dieting. Dur-ing the diet, the apprentice abstains from sexand all but very bland foods (without sugar, saltor spices), and isolates himself in the forest toconsume a particular healing plant, along withayahuasca and tobacco, which also facilitate thelearning process. To become a curandero, onemust usually go through four or five such diets,although many healers continue to learn moreby dieting throughout their career. The varietyof plants considered capable of teaching medi-cine is large, and many of these plants have notbeen well studied scientifically. Much work re-mains to be done in understanding their chemi-cal constituents and their potentialpsychoactivity. For more information on thebotanical identity of some of these plants, andtheir cultural uses, see McKenna et al., 1995,and Luna, 1984. Since its formation, ASMEVEI has held meet- ings weekly. It has ratified its bylaws in orderto obtain official recognition as an organiza-tion by the Peruvian government. It has alsoheld workshops as a format for exchange ofknowledge about healing practices among itsmembers. As one of their first projects, the as- sociation conducted surveys of its mem-bership, in order to collect and archiveinformation about their personal history,training as healers and their current heal-ing practices. A couple selections fromthese archives will serve to give thereader a better understanding of thishealing tradition. Norma Panduro Navarro, the vice president of the association, for example,became acquainted with the healing pathwhen she was seventeen years old. Shewas living in Iquitos, the city of her birth,when she became ill with tuberculosis. Hermother took her to visit a curandero liv- ing on the Ucayali river, who cured her illnesswith plant-based medicine. She writes \"from thatmoment on, I firmly embraced natural medicine.\"Since then, she has learned much about medici-nal plants, their healing barks and resins, aboutayahuasca and the magical songs called icarosthat healers use in their curing. Norma recountsthat during her first experience taking ayahuasca,she saw the pot that was used to boil the brewshine a brilliant gold, and she could smell thefragrance of flowers in its smoke. Then the spiritof ayahuasca approached her whistling its magi-cal song. It sat before her with its eyes closed.When its eyes opened they were shining with thebrilliance of the moon. It asked her if she wantedto learn good or bad magic, and she acceptedthe former. Currently, Norma is working on build-ing a healing center outside of Iquitos to treataddiction and other kinds of illness.

Others speakers included Christian Raetsch, Ph.D.,ethnopharmacologist and cognitive anthropolo-gist, author, explorer from Hamburg, Germany wife, Claudia art his-torian and who successfully defended theSanto Daime church in Holland. And there were the shamans, masters of the ayahuasca experience, to present, the help of ayahuasca. These rituals lastedthrough the night....which made sitting throughthe conference in the day a challenge. Kajuyali Tsamani sat in the center of a mandala carefully constructed of differently col-ored sand. Symbolically, the Sun Jaguar, red linesof energy, was within the center of Pachimama, adeep earthy brown, the four directions spiralingout in gold. This was an ancient design, the de-sign of the cosmos, from the Orinoco tradition.Kajuyali told us the old story of the origins ofayahuasca and of yopo, the sacred snuff. And hesang the old songs, the icaros, of peace and love.A foot-high crystal occupied the circle and a songwas sang to call the celestial crystal to bless theconference. It was a magical beginning. Then Eduardo Luna, Ph.D. described Wasiwaska, the House of the Vine. This is Luna'sbreathtakingly beautiful retreat center in Brazil.Here he brings groups to do ceremony and deeptranspersonal work. Luna is a \"neo-shaman,\" com-bining the ancient ways and the experience ofayahuasca with modern methods such asHolotrophic Breathwork, artistic expression, andeclectic music. The participants maintain a strictdiet and observe certain behavioral guidelines asthey immerse themselves in the deep journey ofthe soul. Arno Adelaar was a strong presence asthe host of the conference. He also filled in forHans Bogers, giving a presentation on the safetyaspects of Santo Daime and other similar rituals.Hans could not attend the conference due to pres-sure from the local Santo Daime church which isintent on protecting its legal status. Christian Raetsch, the one I think of as the wild man of the group, gave an excellent talkabout tobacco and its history as a sacred herb,an herb always used in the preparation ofayahuasca. I call Christian a wild man because hewill endure any circumstance to obtainethnopharmacological information. Dr. Raetschis able to communicate his knowledge beauti-fully and intelligently. He is the author of over40 books and many articles on the subject ofentheogens and ayahuasca. One of the most interesting comments about ayahuasca was given by Jace Callaway. Jace is anexpert in psychedelic neurochemistry the researchers, along with Dennis McKennaand Eduardo Luna, who extensively researchedmembers of the Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal in the '90s.Jace said that he felt now that DMT was not thewhole story, perhaps not the main story inayahuasca. \"It is the vine that all the myths arewound around.\" It is the vine that carries thespirit, he speculated. Some brews have very littleDMT, but the caapi vine is always the main ingre- dient. There is still so much to be learned aboutayahuasca, he said, the many different forms ofcaapi, the role of each of the additive plants, Shaman Kajuyali Tsamani, Ph.D., ceremonially opens the Psychoactivity III conference46 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 how the variance in the metabolites and the po- tency affect the experience. Yatra of Friends of the Forest made it clear that she did not agree with the assessment ofJurema as an \"ayahuasca analog\" but as a brewwith a history and tradition that very much par-allels ayahuasca. She pointed out that the songsof Jurema were very different than ayahuasca,that the spirits of the plants were very different.Both healers, she felt,but with different per-sonalities, different en-ergies. Her commit-ment to using Juremato treat addictions andmaking the ceremoniesfriendly to those whoneed it most is com-mendable. Those whodrank with the Friendsof the Forest group dur-ing the conferencefound it a valuable and rewarding experience. Sharing the role of MC, Claudia Mueller- Ebeling was a very charming and knowledgeableperson. She presented on \"Synaesthetic Patterns\"where colors are heard, sound is felt, music andimagery join in kaleidoscopic flow. This is a pro-cess experience during an ayahuasca experienceand is found in the patterns of art produced bythe indigenous people. Since first hearing Claudiapresent some years ago I have become increas-ingly aware of how the inner visions experiencedduring entheogenic journeys permeate both shaman, Hilario Chiriap, gave a deeply reverent talk about his apprenticeship andsubsequent work with ayahuasca. His relation-ship with the healing brew spans two decades.He spoke of the wisdom of the plants, of theirpower to connect one with the earth, with thecosmos, and with the Divine Nature of all livingbeings. Ayahuasca, he said, could heal anything.During the night he conducted magical ceremonyand encouraged each of us to give voice to thespirit of the vine as we journeyed in its spell.This night I was given my own song to ayahuasca,my own icaro: \"Ayahuasca, ayahuasca...Vente me.Ayahuasca, ayahuasca...Vente yo te amo mucha, Espiritu Divine.\" For many of those attending it was a rare opportunity to experience the shamanic ceremo-nies from three different cultures. Many attend-ees managed to attend each of the ceremonies and still make their appearance duringthe lectures in the day\u2014a phenomenalfeat. Kujuyali Tsamani, fondly called\"William,\" a ceremony marked bygentleness and power. His icaros floatedover the participants and guided theirjourneys. And as the ayahuasca experi-ence mellowed out, he invited membersto take yopo, the magical snuff. Oneman from Germany said the yopo tookhim in to a space of bliss and cosmicunion. During Don Hilario's ceremony par- ticipants were encouraged to sing and make mu-sic as the spirit of the vine came to visit. Therewas immense energy in the brew and it was notrouble at all to sing and chant throughout thenight into dawn. And Yatra's jurema ceremonywas distinctly different also. The cadence andthe rhythm of the songs, the visions, and herpresence led people into a unique and specialexperience. For those who participated in thenight's activities, a special \"chill room\" betweenthe lecture hall and the vendor's area provided ahaven of quietness, an opportunity to rest, andto commune quietly with others. Participants wereeager to talk with one another, share experiences,and gain information in animated conversationsof many languages. And at night, the hotel hostedpsychedelic trance dances for those not immersedin ceremony. There was something for everyone'staste and style.

Unlike, say, the psy- chedelic performance artist Terence McKenna (whose writings I enjoy), Shanon's authorialpersona is earnest, serious, straightforward, absolutely trustworthy. He is a true scientist,dedicated to precise reporting and careful analysis rather than to entertainment. Not thathis book is dull. Far from it. Antipodes is suffused with a sense of genuine adventure, of a kind that has virtually vanishedfrom modern science. Plunginginto the depths of his ownayahuasca-intoxicated mind,Shanon resembles one of thegreat Victorian explorers trek-king into uncharted wilds,maintaining his equilibriumand wits even in the face ofthe most fantastical sights.Like Darwin on the voyage of the Beagle, Shanon is concerned primarily with collecting andcategorizing data rather than theorizing. At the end of his book, however, he ponders hisand others' experiences and draws some tentative conclusions. Ayahuasca, he asserts, canbe both truth-revealing and \"the worst of liars.\" Shanon remains skeptical of the occultclaims often made for the drug that it puts us in touch with spirits, makes us clairvoyant,lets us leave our bodies and travel astrally. He suggests that ayahuasca visions are productsof the imagination rather than glimpses of a supernatural realm existing in parallel to ourown. This proposal will sound reductionistic to some, but it is actually quite provocative,and raises many questions requiring further consideration. Why does the imagination, whenstimulated by ayahuasca, yield visions so much stranger and more powerful than those weencounter in, say, ordinary dreams? Why do ayahuasca-drinkers from widely disparate cul-tures so often hallucinate similar phenomena, such as jaguars and snakes, or palaces androyalty? Why are the visions of even an atheist like Shanon so often laden with religioussignificance? Antipodes will no doubt be eagerly seized upon by the psychedelic intelligen-tsia. But it deserves to be read by anyone interested in religion, mysticism, and conscious-ness\u2014and who is not? It should be required reading for psychologists, psychiatrists, andneuroscientists, because it shows how absurdly simplistic are the biochemical, Darwinian,and genetic models now dominating mind-science. Inner space, Shanon reminds us, truly isthe last great frontier of science, and its reaches are vast and wild and strange.Mapping Out the Ayahuasca Netherworld: A Review of Benny of the Mind John Horgan (jhorgan@highlands.com, www.johnhorgan.org) Antipodes of the Mind was published in 2002 by Oxford University Press.

Goldsmith, Ph.D., (neal@inch.com) and John H. Halpern, M.D. (john_halpern@hms.harvard.edu) Andrew Tatarsky, an innovative clinical psychologist practicing in Manhattan, has produced a timely and targeted professional document-of-practice. Timely, because the idea of harm reduction (making drug policynot based on punishment, but on the broadest possible assessment of thenet-least harm to society) is just beginning to be accepted in policy and practice. Targeted, because it is a document of and for clinical practice,one that cuts across theoretical orientations. Each of the ten chapters iswritten by a different practitioner, each with a client case study (fivedealing with alcohol, one with opiates, one with amphetamines and threewith multiple substances) and each with an analysis by Dr. Tatarsky. Thenet effect is to bring the audience into the authors' process and experi-ence as professionals: This is a book by clinicians and for clinicians (andstudents), only secondarily for the policy makers and the lay-activist au-dience, and only indirectly meant to communicate with the scientific com-munity. One complaint that can be made about the book concerns its applica- tion to policy. In practice, an \"N of 10\" is actually a good-sized data set forcase-based clinical research. (As an old methods professor used to intone: \"One subject to hypothesize; two to validate; three to publish.\") Yet Tatarsky attempts little policy-directed scientific generalizing from the quite rich database the book presents. Of course, one bookcan't be all things to all audiences and this volume doesn't try to be, but rather offers an expert anddeeply felt clinical manual and roadmap for the dissemination of operational harm reduction prac-tices to the psychotherapeutic community. Twelve-Step Degrees of Separation Harm reduction diverges sharply from the currently accepted treatment model for alcohol and drug problems: abstinence and twelve-step treatment. According to Tatarsky (2002a) however, the Big Book of AA is \"the original harm reduction text\" and abstinence can be the best harm reduc-tion approach. In fact, the 12-step approach pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) does notactually require abstinence - only the \"desire\" to stop. The original idea was that talking withother recovering alcoholics made it easier to not drink, that night. Tatarsky believes that today'sAA, with its embarrassing \"day counting\" (as in, \"Hi, I'm Joe, and I've been sober for [only] oneday...\") and advice to \"stick with the winners\" (i.e., avoid those who still drink) reflects a con-tamination of the original spirit of AA by competitive, shaming trends in the larger culture. What if the \"abuser\" is not sure he or she wants to stop? Paradoxically, to tap a 12-step 49 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 community for support in making this decision, the user must already have the \"desire to stop.\"Since most alcoholics and drug addicts are, bydefinition, not at a point where they can con-sistently choose to stop, AA's abstinence require-ment in essence skims the cream off the top ofthe pool seeking to be cured. Alcoholics Anony-mous outcome data look better as a result, asdoes its reputation and funding options. With onlyfive percent of those who come to AA stayingwith it, is AA successful? It's hard to say - re-member, AA is \"anonymous\" - but Tatarsky be-lieves that formany, has success.And these individu-als should not beforgotten; they arejust as deserving ofa brighter future inwhich their de-structive patternsof drug and/or al-cohol abuse are re-duced, if not eliminated. Alcoholics Anonymous is a highly structured program with specific, enforced requirements forthinking and acting. These cult-like qualities canpotentially be used for the good, but frequentlydo enormous damage to those who don't remain.In the world of AA - and so, in most treatmentprograms - if you are not abstinent, then \"Youstill must have to hit a lower bottom.\" Alcoholics Anonymous has changed from a community of peer assistance to something muchmore akin to the \"disease concept\" of medicine.Once the user has been \"in disease\" with anysubstance, then any future use of any intoxicat-ing substance is evidence of \"relapse.\" Thebeauty of harm reduction is its \"compassionatepragmatism.\" Harm reduction psychotherapiestake no a priori position about drug use; what matters is the way that use may be harmful tousers, family, community - a net-least detriment,systems approach.Policy Implication: First Do No Harm One of the more profound conclusions fre- quently raised by the book's authors is simplythat we must return to \"good clinical practice\"in the treatment of addicts. Why should peoplehaving difficulty with their (albeit unprescribed)medications be treated any differently than anyother patients? Psychotherapy for drug abuseis no different than other forms of treatment,and a major accomplishment of Harm Reduction Psychotherapy is to humanize the face of the drug user, who hasbeen the only pa-tient told: \"I'llonly treat you harm re- duction practicehas grown so rap-idly is all the moreimpressive whenone considers that essentially all government funding and programlicensing require user abstinence. There is nowa multi-billion dollar drug and alcohol treatmentindustry, paid for by the government, that setsup failure with its high hurdle of absolute absti-nence. When they can't - or don't choose to -comply, many end up feeling even worse - likefailures - resulting in further escalation in theirsubstance abuse. Such lapses are then viewedas moral failures, with the implicit message fromthe authorities to go even lower, to hit bottom,in order to be allowed treatment. Even whenthis policy ends in long-term abstinence asclaimed, it makes treatment more volatile, elic-iting more harmful, costly behavior on the roadto success than the more moderate harm reduc-tion approach. Strengths and Weaknesses This is a book whose weaknesses are truly \"Harm reduction psychotherapies take no a priori position about drug use; what matters is the way that use may be harmful to users, family, community - a net-least detriment, systems approach.\"50 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 also its strengths. Chapter One over-view of harm re-duction reviewsthe literature, butthe reference listat the end of thechapter doesn't in-clude many of the studies cited. There is littleeffort to draw generalizations across the tencases or to integrate the book's findings withthe literature review in Chapter One. The bookcomes with theoretical foundations, but doesnot attempt to extend that theoretical scaffold-ing. Harm Reduction Psychotherapy never pur- ports to be a college text, yet in foregoing thepotential to contribute to the policy researchliterature, it limits its utility in all but clinicaltraining courses. As William James famously said, \"The cure for dipsomania is religiomania,\" that is, alco-holism can be cured by peak spiritual experi-ence. Yet while the authors frequently discuss\"dual diagnosis\" (substance abuse in additionto another psychological or physical ailment)and the implications of multiple substance use,the book doesn't discuss the extensive litera-ture on the use of psychedelics to treat sub-stance abuse, for example, Dr. Evgeny Krupitsky's2002 research with Ketamine at the LeningradRegional Center for Alcoholism and Drug Addic-tion Therapy. Similarly, while the \"self-medica-tion\" concept isdiscussed psyche- delic psychotherapy, as shown in the researchon the use of peyote in the Native AmericanChurch to assist alcoholics, most recently by anauthor of this review, Dr. John Halpern (2001,1996). Yet in part by focusing on practice rather than research, Harm Reduction Psychotherapy emerges as a groundbreaking, heartfelt and ul-timately successful book. It takes as its formi-dable task the promulgation of a new treatmentparadigm for therapy with substance users - not necessarily for substance abuse . This is a field manual for psychotherapists and trainees which,if followed, has the potential to make \"goodclinical practice\" the normative experience forsubstance abusers and users. Tatarsky's Path Harm reduction is a new and controversial movement and most government agencies and HMOs still view it with hostility or suspicion. It isnot surprising then that earlier in his career as apractitioner, Tatarsky experienced great anxiety and uncertainty about how to navigatethis issue. His outpatient practice was fully caught up in the require-ment for abstinence. Tatarsky\"felt like an imposter,\" unable todiscuss the things he was notic-ing and feeling with his clinic su-pervisor. He was alienated, un-certain - conceptually, \"in thecloset\" - and in conflict. Afterstarting a private practice,Tatarsky felt more freedom to ex- \"One of the more profound conclusionsfrequently raised by the book's authorsis simply that we must return to 'goodclinical practice' in the treatment of ad-dicts.

Lenderts, M.D. (luz_do_sol@amigo.net) The persistence of the terms \"hallucinogen,\" \"hallucinogenic,\" and \"hallucination(s)\" in our attempts to describe the effects of consciousness-enhancing substances, whether natural or synthetic,is puzzling and frustrating. While appropriate to describe one of thepossible effects of LSD use, these terms rarely or never apply to mostof the other chemical entities which, unfortunately, have becomewidely known as \"hallucinogens.\" Most readers of MAPS are wellaware of the real beneficial effects which can be realized from theappropriate use of substances like ayahuasca, peyote, psilocybinmushrooms, MDMA, cannabis, etc. They are also aware of the unin-formed, fearful, and organized resistance to the use of these sub- stances that comes from much of the government, academia, and the public. This attitude applieseven to scientific experimentation with consciousness-enhancing substances (most often referredto by the pejorative term \"drugs\"), even if the purpose of such research is to determine theirindications, mechanism of action, safety, and efficacy. In strong contrast to this, other categories of consciousness-altering or mood- and affect- altering substances are generally accepted, and even powerfully promoted. Drugs such as ethylalcohol, nicotine in various tobacco products, and caffeine in coffee have nearly achieved thestatus of social icons, though tobacco has recently lost some of its luster. This exalted statusexists despite the fact that alcohol and tobacco, combined, are directly responsible for the prema-ture deaths of approximately 600,000 people per year in the United States. Other consciousness-altering substances have earned the term \"medications,\" though even the term \"drug,\" in thecontext of medical use, carries the authority of the medical and pharmaceutical establishment(\"drugstore\" for example). These medications include four categories of anti-depressants, anti- manic (bimodal) agents, four cat-egories of sympathomi-metics/stimulants/anorexiants. While impugning the ef- ficacy and benefit of many ofthese medications, it can be ar-gued that many if not most ofthem serve the purpose of cover-ing up or assuaging a psychic dis-equilibrium rather than aiding thesearch for the source of the dis- \"My substantial experience with at leastone combination of these sacred plants,hoasca, is that these substances cangive us a clearer vision of reality, andthus are not hallucinogenic, despitetheir capacity to produce profoundvisual alterations in what we maynormally perceive.\"Point - Counterpoint53 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 equilibrium. Once recog- nized, the issues can beresolved, creating a moreconscious, healthier, andmore equilibrated humanbeing. And this, fact,is potential of-fered by the currentlyvilified consciousness-enhancing or \"psyche-delic\" drugs. But, in the ultimate irony, evensome of the people who best understand thesedrugs, who wish to promote greater freedom fortheir investigation and use, continue to usepejorative terms such as \"hallucinogen\" to de-scribe them! In contrast, and to its credit, the orthodox (allopathic) medical establishment has had out-standing success in promoting its own acceptedforms of substance use in nearly every area oflife. This success is due in large part to deliber-ate attention to language. When careful, accept-able terms are chosen to describe a crediblemechanism of action or effect of a substanceproposed for use, whether correct or incorrect,this use is accepted. A hallucination is defined as \"the percep- tion of something which does not exist in ob-jective reality.\" How, then, do \"hallucinogens\"fit into science, the method by which we cometo understand reality? Indeed, how do we gainknowledge through the experience of unreality?Yet, with all due respect, this seems to be whatis being advocated, and even by the most es-teemed pioneers and scientists in our field. Anexample only slightly removed from the presentis the seminal book Plants of the Gods, Their Sacred, Healing, and Hallucinogenic Powers , by Richard Evans Schultes and Albert Hofmann(1992). On the back cover our friend Dr. MarkPlotkin endorses it as \"the best book ever writ-ten on hallucinogenic plants.\" Michael R. Aldrich,Ph.D. also uses the term \"hallucinogenic plants\"in his endorsement, which includes the opinion\"carefully researched.\" The back-cover description by thepublisher states: of thoseplants, which are knownto transport the humanmind into other states ofconsciousness, have al-ways been regarded assacred.\" That statementI do accept. However, the prior language is then used over and overagain by the distinguished authors, includingthe term \"sacred hallucinogens\" in describingthe phytochemicals written about in the text. Without question, Plants of the Gods is a brilliant work. But, at the substantial risk ofsounding condescending, I offer that not onlyis \"hallucination\" an inaccurate term to describeone of the key effects of using these substances,but that the term \"sacred hallucinogen\" is anoxymoron. Sacred, as I understand it, refers toThe Reality. A hallucinogen, as previously de-fined, produces \"a perception does NOTexist in reality.\" Thus, we have: \"the unrealityproducer of The Ultimate Reality.\" My substantial experience with at least one combination of these sacred plants, hoasca, isthat these substances can give us a clearer vi- sion of reality, and thus are not hallucinogenic,despite their capacity to produce profound vi-sual alterations in what we may normally per-ceive. Isn't the appropriate term for what is hap-pening not \"hallucinations,\" but \"visions?\" I likethe terms \"visions\" and \"vision-inducing\" be-cause they open one to contemplate a large rangeof possibilities within the powers of the humanvisual apparatus, including not only the eyes,and the optic nerves and tracts, but also thevisual cortex in the occipital lobes, its inter-connections, and the human visual experience.Moreover, the term \"vision\" has a much morepositive connotation within human thought than\"hallucination.\" As a practicing physician in Emergency Medicine, I have certainly seen many people hal- \"Our unfortunate choice of descriptive language is one reason why research into and use of these substances are being so strongly resisted.\"Point - Counterpoint54 m a p s v o l u m e x i i i n u m b e r 1 s p r i n g 2 0 0 3 lucinating. Hallucinations are caused by some induced disturbance of the normal function ofthe brain such as dehydration, metabolic dis-turbances, exhaustion, alcohol and certain pre-scription, over-the-counter or street drugs, fe-ver, mental illness, etc. This medical association makes it a daunt- ing task to explain to a grand jury of commoncitizens, to federal prosecutors, or to a federaljudge the logic behind granting legal protec-tion for a religious practice which uses a con-sciousness-enhancing substance commonlycalled a \"hallucinogen.\" Indeed, from Septem-ber 1999 to November 2001, I argued in each ofthe above forums, as a plaintiff and scientificexpert in the UDV v. Ashcroft, et al. case, thathoasca is not a hallucinogen. My belief is thatthe UDV's determined effort in this case to clarifyand defend what we feel are the real effects ofhoasca was an important factor in the favorabledecision we recently received in federal districtcourt. This decision compelled the U.S. govern-ment to allow us to resume our religious prac-tice, which is based on the sacramental inges-tion of hoasca. Gaining permission from the Food and Drug Administration to perform research into the useof \"hallucinogenic\" drugs is equally difficult. Ourunfortunate choice of descriptive language isone reason why research into and use of thesesubstances are being so strongly resisted. Clearly, there is a far deeper discussion behind all of this. It relates to how we eachunderstand and can describe this \"invisible land-scape\" which has been so courageously exploredby so many people. A better sense of how weunderstand and present ourselves will help usregain more extensive social license to investi-gate this realm. It will also help us apply theknowledge we gain to solving real problems ofhuman existence, and to enhance our ability toperceive the peace, the beauty, the joy, and thelove which are inherent in life.

Bravo, M.D. (glbravo@aol.com) and Charles S. Grob, M.D. (csgrob@aol.com) Dr. Lenderts raises important and thought-provoking points in the ongoing dialogue over the proper nomenclature for these plants and chemicals which are the subject of scientific inquiry inthe pharmacological, medical, psychological, anthropological and sociological literatures. Wehave no issue with his thesis that the term \"hallucinogen\" is in some ways reductionistic andmisleading as to the myriad and profound effects these substances may potentially manifest inthe brains, minds and souls of users. However, the issue as we see it is to identify a usefulterminology which can be agreed uponby all who care to communicate aboutthese protean substances and be rec-ognized by those receiving these com-munications. The term \"hallucinogens,\" whether rightly or wrongly, and much to the chagrin of many who would prefer terms such as \"entheogens,\" \"psychedelics,\" or \"visionary plants and drugs,\" hasbecome the accepted nomenclature in the scientific and anthropological literature. For example,an Internet search of the biomedical literature using the words \"entheogenic,\" or even \"psyche-delic,\" would probably not generate the desired results for the inquirer, whereas the term \"hallu-cinogenic\" most likely would. In their classic text Plants Of The Gods: Their Sacred, Healing and Hallucinogenic Powers, Rich- ard Evans Schultes and Albert Hofmann do not equivocate in their use of what they consider to bethe appropriate term.
