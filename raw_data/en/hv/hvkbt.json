Dropletscan land in the mouths or noses of people who may be close by. Spr ead is more likely when people are within 6 feet of distance of eac h other. Infection may also oc cur when a person come s in contact with a surface contaminated by the referenced droplets. I understand that as of the date of this of this consent, vacc ination is expected to be among the most effective means of slowing the spread of the COVID-19 infection and ending the ongoing global pandemic. Further, I understand the vaccine is intended as a t wo-shot series to maximize efficacy. The second vaccine administration must be given approximately 21 or 28 days (depending on the specific vaccine administered) after the initial administration. I also understand that between the first and second administrations of the COVID-19 vaccine, I should not have any other vaccines administered. I have received a copy of the COVID-19 vaccine Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers and been given an opportunity to review it prior to vaccine administrati on. I may also access such vaccine fact sheet online through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at: www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-dis ease-2019-covid-19/covid-19- vaccines I acknowledge that such fact sheets, among other things, provid e the following: o The FDA has authorized the emergency use of the COVID-19 Vacci ne o The significant known and potential risks and benefits of the COVID-19 Vaccine, and the extent to which such risks and benefits are unknown o Information about available alternative vaccines and the risks and benefits of those alternatives I understand that the COVID-19 vaccine, like all medicines, can cause side effects. Most side effects are mild and short-term and not everyone experiences them. Base d on recent CDC guidance, I understand that anaphylaxis, itching, swelling or respiratory d istress within 4 hours of COVID-19 vaccine administration, is a contraindication for receiving a f uture dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. CDC guidance also states that a second vaccine should only be consi dered after an evaluation by an allergist-immunologist who would determine if I can safely rece ive the second vaccine. If I experience severe side effects, I should immediately call 9-1-1 or seek me dical attention. Further, I understand that severe side effects may have to be reported to relevant regulat ory authorities, and as such, I will report all severe side effects to CTCA as the entity who administered my vaccine. I understand that the COVID-19 vaccine is a two-part vaccine s eries. By signing this consent, I am agreeing that I will receive the first and second part of the v accine series.
