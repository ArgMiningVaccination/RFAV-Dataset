We use Her symbols as a map to channel Her energies through our own energy system. The Sekhmet Ritual Meditation begins in her lands, the grounding and meeting place of our guided, embodied meditation. Her lands are the root, the meeting place and source of Her power, and it's the place where we tap in. In this ritual meditation, we go through 5 ritual symbols of Sekhmet. We begin with the Sekhem (Staff) which translation means Power. Ankh (Key) is the portal for our Life Force Energy. The Iaret (Cobra) is the Kundalini channel which runs the length of your spine. The Udjat (Third Eye) is the seat of consciousness for our human form. The Aten (Solar Disk) is the connection to universal forces, our higher self and connections to God/Goddess energy. The meditation takes participants through this channel connecting our own power with that of Sekhmet, opening ourselves to greater life force energy, clearing our \"spirexual\" (a word coined by Ali meaning Spiritual/Sexual nexus) channels to connect to the divine in a pure orgasmic form. Our Sex is worship, our orgasm is offering. This ritual is a celebration of connection between the nexus of spiritual and sexual energy creating opening and healing. Ritual is offered monthly on the First Tuesday after the New Moon at 5pm PST, please check eventbrite for upcoming rituals. Sekhmet Ritual Meditation Intensive Imagine diving deep into the Mediation for your own purposes of clearing, clarity and manifestation. The meditation is utilized my for many purposes and you are trained to go through each symbol with a self-selected intention intensively focused on a desired purpose each week. Learning how to utilize each symbol individually for grounding, clarity, clearing and manifestation and the Ritual as a whole fluid process for clearing the system and channeling orgasmic energy. SRM Trauma Release Over the years I have been approached regarding the impact of the Ritual on their energy system, psyche along with many extraordinary experiences. I like to tell people \"each ritual experience is unique\", I am in awe of the rich and diverse experiences which come about through the Ritual. The common theme is the experience which opens and clears channels directly related to sexuality leaving us with orgasmic energy flowing throughout our body. On the other side of that pleasure is the pain that many of us have history related to sexual trauma specifically female identified bodies. For this reason and the multitude of requests I have been called to lead individuals on the journey through the Sekhmet Ritual Meditation to address the root of historical trauma to become fully embodied. These are currently offered as a one on one process due the nature of topics. The Ritual is slowed down which intensifies the manifestation of each symbol and participants are assisted to navigate the symbols in a deep and personally meaningful manner while they energetically release learn to release their own trauma from their body systems. This minimally eight week process will take you through a different symbol each week: Grounding in Her Lands, Claiming Power, Harnessing Life Force Energy, Claiming Kundalini, Awakening Your Seat of Consciousness and Opening Connection to the Universal working to open and clear your channels and trauma. Time commitment is individually determined due to the nature of the process. "}
