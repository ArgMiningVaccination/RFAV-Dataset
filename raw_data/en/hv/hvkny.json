Shirodara 60 min-$100 Ionic Foot $140 Series 6- $200 Monthly Unlimited- $250 * All prices subject to change without notice * SHIRODARA Shirodara is an ancient Ayurvedic hair and scalp treatment that has been practiced in India for at least 2000 years. To give a heightened sense of inner calm, the treatment begins with a gentle dripping of warm herbal oil to the 'third eye' & quiets the mind, as well as balances the nervous system. This blissful therapy is designed to purify the mind, alleviate anxiety, reduce headaches, & expand awareness as the oil is massaged into the scalp, down the neck, & over the shoulders. IONIC FOOT DETOX The ionic foot bath is a therapeutic took that uses the natural health properties of negatively charged ions to help your body remove toxins. The client places their feet into a tub of warm water, then salt is added to improve conductivity. An array is then placed into the tub to produce a gentle electrical current, which breaks the water into positively or negatively charged ions with either hydrogen or oxygen gases. By the end of the session, the water will have changed color, & each different color indicates a unique area of the body being detoxed. INFRARED SAUNA An infrared sauna heats your body directly without warming the air around you. Regualr saunas cause reactions like those caused by moderate exercise, such as vigorous sweating and an increased heart rate, whereas an infrared sauna gives these results at lower temperatures. Studies have shown that saunas can be useful for anyone suffering from high blood pressure, heart failure, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, headache, type 2 diabetes, & arthritis, as well as anyone simply looking to relax. A natural way to heal! Empowering individuals to live a life of Well Being. "}
