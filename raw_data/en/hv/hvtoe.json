Submitted by DSchmitt2 on Wed, 2010-03-17 - 17:20 I have a 3/12 year old daughter that started having seizures 9 days after her 1st MMR vaccine at 21 mon. But that is not the first sign of something wrong with these vaccines. At 2 months just after her vaccines she started crying uncontrollably the Dr., said it may be from the DTap shot so we decided not to give the pertussis part of the shot in the future. With her 3rd round I waited until she was 19 months and only got the Hep B and PCV, she had no reaction. Then the 4th round at 21 months is when she got the MMR and the Hep B. This is when she had what they say is a febrile seizure, she was not sick and no one in the house was. She just woke up with a fever and she was having a seizure, strange. Funny how the 2 vaccines (pertussis and MMR) they say may cause seizures are the ones my daughter had reactions to. I have not given her any more vaccines since then as I truly believe that this is what has triggered the seizures. She had another seizure at 3 years of age on her birthday, which lasted at least 40 minutes and they had to use drugs to bring her out of it. She has since been on Keppra and was doing fine until I missed a couple of doses in a row and today she had another seizure which lasted just a couple of minutes. The Dr's will not even go there in saying that the vaccines are the cause, when I bring it up they just move on to something else. This is what is frustrating, can't they just say well maybe but that would mean going against the BIG Drug companies. I will not give my child any further vaccines. They say there is evidence that says they don't cause Autism or any other problems, well I am sorry but you can't take a vaccine out of a child once they have been given it, so how can they prove this?

Submitted by tonialpha on Tue, 2010-01-19 - 19:58 When I was being trained as a Neurodiagnostic Tech. , I only saw one young child w/ a reaction. I am sorry to read of others that have had reaction. I pray things get better. When I had my first baby, I questioned this and the pediatrician reassured me that they would be fine and gave me a small ratio of 2:100,000 would get a reaction. That was in a ratio of normal patients and then told me 3,4:100,000. He reassured me that I was very healthy not worry about it. My second child, I was on more medication, she is very healthy and is going to high school next year. My first is my son, he is going for his Eagle Scout and is rebuilding storage units, for people in transition during this time period.

He did not have any fever, actually has never had a febril seizure ever, but has had a multitude of others. We did not have any more innoculations given to him. When he started school we signed an exempt form due to medical reasons. He has been in school now for 3 years. I also read \"A Shot in the Dark\" 51/2 years ago. It scared the &?%& out of me!

YOU CAN REPORT it even if your doctor won't. keep a copy of the report and your report number for reference. in fact, keep a whole file with all medical records, reports. you will no doubt need all this reference again. again, i am so sorry. i am so, so angry about what is happening to my child and yours, and the countless other well meaning parents who faithfully trust their doctors and allow these vaccinations only to watch their child suffer the consequences. people are profitting off this. it makes me sick. i wish i had known better. please feel free to private message me. i am so so very sorry and angry for what has happened to your daughter. i am also new to epilepsy, about 6 months since my daughter's 1st seizure. i know how scary, confusing, devastating it can be. and when children like yours and mine have a seizure after a vaccination and then all doctors involved refuse to even discuss a possible connection, it is an outrage. all i ever wanted was a conversation. i have yet to get one from any conventional doctor, whether a pediatrician, neurologist. according to the package insert of the shot my daughter received, seizures ARE LISTED AS A SIDE EFFECT. in light of that, we deserve a conversation. unfortunately, i beleive that no matter what doctor you see, they will never admit a connection due to liability. i was able to have a conversation with an integrative m.d., who is also a trained DAN doctor in our area. i would suggest that you find a DAN doctor for your daughter to see. they WILL discuss what has happened, and they do have treatments to help your child. we see our DAN doctor in conjuction with our local pediatric neurologist (who by the way does not agree with DAN protocol). we are the parents so it is our choice how to treat our child. unfortunately, our health insurance does not cover most of the DAN doctor's services, due to his independent, non-pharmaceutical stance. we pay for the services out of pocket. i would also suggest that you get a copy of your child's medical record, including the name, lot # of the shot she received prior to the seizure. take all your info and contact a vaccine lawyer (personal injury type lawyer dealing specifically with vaccine injury). yes, there are actually VACCINE lawyers due to the high numbers of injury from vaccines. there is a special vaccine court set up by the fed. gov't to hear these cases. you very well may have a case. this will cost you nothing. the lawyers are paid out of a fund set up by the gov't. it is worth it to try. also, you should go to the VAERS website and report the incident.
