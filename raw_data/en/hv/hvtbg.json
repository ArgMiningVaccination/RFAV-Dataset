Both modalities stimulate the body's own innate healing ability. By employing more ways to communicate with the body we find more avenues to address issues both internal and external. This allows for healing on both physical and emotional levels. Each session is customized to you based on a Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment plan. The [methods](https://www.centerofbalanceacu.com/methods) to be used will be selected according to your individual diagnosis and needs, to achieve the best possible results. By using acupuncture and massage, as well as associated techniques like cupping, gua sha, auricular therapy, reiki, kinesiology taping and herbs, we can affect both the underlying cause of what ails you as well as its physical manifestation.

Testimonials I am a dental professional in the Twin Cities. Teeth are in a very inconvenient position. In order to work on them I can put my body in some pretty creative positions. After only a few years of practice my body was starting to really feel the impact. I have sought the assistance of many different practitioners, but Alexis is far and away the most knowledgeable, passionate and intentional practitioner I have worked with. After a brief conversation with her it became clear she not only was interested in my issues, but she had the knowledge and drive to help me correct them with massage and acupuncture. She was even kind enough to research some exercises to help strengthen my postural muscles to help prevent the issues from worsening. Her office is clean and thoughtfully decorated, and the environment is calm and relaxing. I would highly recommend Alexis and Center of Balance to anyone. She is truly a top-notch professional. \u2014 R.H. GET IN TOUCH - Conveniently located in the First Minnetonka City Bank building - Free parking - Elevator access 11500 Highway 7 "}
