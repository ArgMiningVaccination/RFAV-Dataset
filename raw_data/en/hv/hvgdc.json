Founded in community -based legacies of compassionate healing, we provide the highest quality comprehensive continuum of integrated health care, supportive housing and community services, especially for the needy and vulnerable. The Mission of the schools The mission of St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing and Samaritan Hospital Sc hool of Nursing is to prepare students for entry into the profession of nursing as competent, caring practitioners. HISTORY - St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing Albany St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing has been educating and preparing students for fulfilling careers in nursing for more than a century. Initially known as the Training School of the Homeopathic Hospital of Albany, it was the first in record to be registered with the New York State Board of Regents, graduating the first class in 1906. The names of the hospital and school were changed in 1923 establishing the Memorial Hospital School of Nursing. In 2015 the name was changed to Memorial College of Nursing. In 2019, the name was changed to St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing. The St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing is registered by the New York State Education Department. The curriculum adheres to the National League for Nursing's Educational Outcomes of Associate Degree Nursing Programs. St. Peter's Hospital is certified by the New York State Department of Health. The Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing was founded in 1898, only 25 y ears after the establishment of the nation's first nursing school. In 1902, the School of Nursing graduated its first class of 10 students. To date, more than 2,500 students have graduated. The school was chartered in 1903 by the State University of New York to \"instruct for the successful practice of nursing\". Today, over a century later, the mission and philosophy of the school and faculty continue to reflect the intent of the original charter while progressively advancing program offerings to meet the unprecedented demands in the profession. Quality education for students has always been the school's primary focus. HISTORY - Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing In 1989, the Samaritan Hospital Board of Directors received authority to grant a two -year associate in science degree for the registered nurse program. In January 1995, the school expanded its offering with the addition of the practical nursing (LPN) certificate program. The Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing is registered by the N ew York State Education Department. The curricula for the nursing programs adhere to the National League for 8 Nursing's educational outcomes for nursing programs 1. Samaritan Hospital is certified by the New York State Department of Health. PHILOSOPHY 1 National League for Nursing. (2010). Outcomes and competencies for graduates of practical/vocational, diploma, associate degree, baccalaureate, master's, practice doctorate, and research doctorate programs in nursi ng. New York, NY: The National League for Nursing . 9 WE BELIEVE The practice of nursing is... An art and science Dedicated to promoting, maintaining, restoring and supporting health and well -being of individuals living and dying Holistic Caring Accountable: legally, ethically and morally The application of theoretical knowledge, reasoning, and technical competence Accepting and respecting individuals regardless of religion, race, creed, color, age, gender, culture, ability, mental status, or socioeconomic status, or political affiliation Partnership with: Individuals and significant others with actual or potential health needs and Health care team members Education... Is a partnership involving shared accountability between faculty and students. Requires open, honest and timely communi cation by faculty and students. Recognizes students' unique abilities, life experiences, and learning preferences. Is committed to providing a variety of resources and active learning experiences to support individual learning preferences and rates. Builds from simple to complex. A minimum level of competency is critical before progressing in a sequential curriculum. Given additional time and resources, students establish a stronger foundation from which to build. In consultation with faculty, students identify corrective measures necessary to move to a higher level of competence and negotiate the time needed. Flourishes in an environment in which there is freedom of expression, creativity, and innovation. Is a lifelong endeavor. DEFINITION OF SCHOLARSHIP The faculty of the both Schools of Nursing have defined scholarship as: \"Professional endeavors which advance the art & science of nursing and nursing education.\" THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The nursing community of St. Peter's Health Partners has adopted Jean Watson's theory of Human Caring/Caring Science as their theoretical framework for Nursing practice. As a member of this community, the College subscribes to this theory. Watson's Ref ined Carative Processes 1 include: Practice of loving -kindness/compassion and equanimity with self/other 10 Being authentically present; enabling belief system and subjective world of self/other Cultivating own spiritual practices; beyond ego- self to authenti c transpersonal presence Sustaining a loving, trusting, and caring relationship Allowing for the expression of feelings' authentically listening and \"holding another person's story for them\" Creative solution seeking through caring processes, full use of s elf; all ways of knowing/doing/being; engage in artistry of human caring- healing practices and modalities Authentic teaching- learning within context of caring relationship; stay within other's frame of reference; shift toward health- healing -wellness coachi ng model. Creating healing environment at all levels; physical/nonphysical, subtle environment of energy, consciousness, wholeness, beauty, dignity, and peace are potentiated Reverentially and respectfully assisting with basic needs, holding an intentional , caring consciousness of touching the embodied spirit of another as sacred practice, working with life force/life energy/life mystery of another Opening and attending to spiritual, mysterious, unknown, and existential dimensions of all the vicissitudes of life, death, suffering, pain, joy, transitions life change; \"allowing for a miracle\" All of this is presupposed by a knowledge base and clinical competence Furthermore, the theoretical framework is informed by our understanding of the work of Patricia Benner. Benner theorized that nurses must have a strong foundation of knowledge and develop expertise through repeated practice and breadth of experience. It is our intent that students attain a sound theoretical basis and have ample opportunity to develop competence in nursing practice sufficient to prepare them for entry into practice. Finally, all faculty members are encouraged to reflect on the work of ma ny nursing theorists and are supported in their incorporation of relevant components of these theories. 11 OVERVIEW CURRICULUM GOALS The curriculum is prepared by the faculty with the following goals in mind: Graduate a caring, accountable nurse, adaptable to a variety of settings and changing environments.

PURPOSE: To assure that students with disabilities receive reasonable accommodations. The purpose of providing accommodations is not to create a competitive advantage for disabled students, but to eliminate any competitive disadvantages that may exist. RESPON SIBILITY : Dean, Dean of Student Services, Faculty PROCEDURE : A. Newly accepted students will be sent a form on which they may state the need for accommodations for disabilities. The form and supporting documentation is submitted to the Dean. The form is also available on MESA for a student who wishes to request accommodations at any time during his or her time as a student. B. Any student requesting accommodations must provide recent documentation concerning his or her disability. For those students entering immediately following graduation from high school, the documentation should be no more than three years old. For those who have been tested with adult scales, the documentation should be no more than five years old. C. In the absence of documentation, or in the instance of a newly identified disability, the Dean will use best judgment as to the provision of accommodations. D. The Dean will inform faculty of the accommodations to be made, but will not disclose confidential information as to the nature of the disability. E. The Dean will work with faculty to arrange details of the accommodations (e.g. scheduling an adjunct faculty as a reader). F. Every course overview will contain the following statement: \"Students with disabilities who wish to have special accommodations are expected to inform the faculty of any special needs in a timely manner. If the student has previously identified him or herself to the Dean, accommodations will be made as agreed upon between the student and the Dean . If this is a newly identified disability, plans for accommodation will be made on a case- by-case basis.\" G. Each course chair will review the above statement with students at the time of course orientation. It is the student's option to request accommodations. 28 ACADEMIC INFORMATION PROGRESSION Nursing courses build from simple to complex and are taken in order. Prerequisite courses must be compl eted prior to the next nursing course in the sequence as described in the program of studies. A student may not withdraw from a co- requisite course while maintaining enrollment in the nursing course. Current registration in the nursing course MUST be accompanied by current registration in all co- requisite courses, unless those courses have already been successfully completed in a p rior semester. If a student is enrolled in a nursing class and chooses to withdraw from a required co - requisite course for that nursing class, the student must also withdraw from the nursing class. The courses required for the degree can be found in the Catalog, provided to all students at Orientation. GRADING An accepted minimum level of competency is required for progression in the program of studies and has been defined as a grade of C or better in the support courses and B or better in the nursing c ourses. Midterm grade reports are generated for each student. Students who are experiencing academic difficulty are encouraged to meet with their academic advisors to formulate a plan for successful completion. GRADING SCALE for Nursing Courses Excellen t A 90-100% 4.0 Very Good D 60-64 1.0 I Incomplete F Failure W** Withdrawal on or before the last day to withdraw Z Failure due to absence without withdrawal CC*** Course Canceled *Any grade below a B is equivalent to course fail ure. Students who earn less than a B are unable to progress to the next nursing course. **The last date to withdraw from a course is published each semester. Please note, the last day to withdraw from a nursing course may differ from the last day to withdraw from an HVCC course. ***This grade was introduced Spring 2020 as a result of COVID -19. It does not count towards attempted credits and is not calculated in GPA. 29 ACADEMIC INFORMATION Hudson Valley Community College Grading Scale GRADES NUMERICAL EQUIVALENT QUALITY POINTS PER CREDIT HOUR A Excellent 90 - 100 4 B Very Good 80-89 3 C Average 70-79 2 D Passing 60-69 1 F Failure Below 60 0 I Incomplete IP Course in Progress P Pass S Satisfactory W Withdraw NGS No Grade Submitted Z Absent Without Withdrawal EXM Excused Medical (Physical Education courses only) The Grading Scale for the College of Saint Rose can be viewed at www.strose.edu. DEAN'S LIST DEAN'S LIST status is determined by a semester GPA of 3.75 or higher and is noted on the student's transcript. GRADUATE HONORS Graduates with a cumulative GPA of 3.75- 3.94 are listed in the graduation program as Magna Cum Laude. The honor also appears on the graduate's final transcript Graduates with a cumulative GPA of 3.9 5 or higher are listed in the graduation program as Summ a Cum Laude. The honor also appears on the graduate's final transcript. 30 ACADEMIC INFORMATION ACADEMIC/ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES Listed below are excerpts taken from Academic Policy statements. Complete policy statements are available in the college' s Main Office, in the Health Sciences Library , and on the MESA Portal. ACADEMIC PROBATION A student is place d on academic probation wh en he/she: earns less than a B in any nursing course earns less than a C - (D, F, or Z) in any support course withdraws from a s econd nursing course (semester) or support course* *If a student has previously withdrawn from any course or course category , a withdrawal from a subsequent course or course category will a t least result in academic probation or may result in academic dismissal if the student has previously failed or withdrawn from any course or course category . Course categories are: 1. Nursing courses , 2. Science c ourses: Anatomy & Physiology I & II, Microbiology 3. Non-Science support courses: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, English Composition I, a S ocial Science course, an English elective and the directed elective. PROCEDURE AFTER NURSING COURSE FAILURE If a student wishes to repeat the course after the failure, t he student must submit a Request to Repeat a Nursing Course form W:\\SON - StudentServices \\FORMS \\Edited Repeat request form.doc . Students will include with that form an essay explaining the reason for the failure and his/her strategy for success should they be permitted to return . The A dmissions and Progression committee will render a decision. The committee's decision is final and will be communicated in writing to the student . If permitted to repeat, the student must repeat the course in its entirety , both the theory and clinical portions of the course. The repeating student will be placed on academic probation until successful completion of the course. If the repeating student is unsuccessful in a second attempt, the student will be academically dismissed. If the repeating student is successful he/she will be listed in good academic standing. Failure of a subsequent nursing course or semester will result in academic dismissal. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL A student may only attempt any given course twice. After two unsuccessful attempts at the same course, the student will be dismissed. 31 ACADEMIC INFORMATION A grade of less than B is considered to be failure of a nursing course. A grade of less than C is considered to be failure of a non- nursing course. A student who is not approved to repeat a failed nursing course is academically dismissed. Failure of a second course in any nursing, science or non -science support course category will result in academic dismissal. See examples below: 1. If a student fails A&P I and subsequently fails Micro, then he/she will be dismissed. 2. If a student fails PSY 100 and then fails the English elective, he or she wi ll be dismissed (as these are both in the category of non- science support courses). 3. If a student fails NSG 1 and subsequently fails NSG V, then he/she will be dismissed. Dismissal will result for those students who have failed a nursing course at any other school of nursing, including our sister school, if they fail ONE nursing course at this school. Dismissed students are not eligible for readmission. ACADEMIC DISMISSAL WAIVER An academic dismissal waiver will be considered if personal circumstances, unexpected crisis or hardship is encountered by the student leading to the failure. A faculty member, advisor or student services representative MUST have been informed of these circumstances prior to the end of the course. WITHDRAWAL (see below for Nursing or HVCC course withdrawal) Withdrawal is designed for students who are unable to continue with a course(s) in any given semester. Students may withdraw from one course or course category only once without academic penalty. A subsequent withdrawal will at least result in Academic Probation and may result in dismissal (if the withdrawal is from a course already attempted) . A third withdrawal from a course category will result in dismissal. Each semester , a last date to withdrawal without penalty is published. The nursing course withdrawal deadline may be different from the HVCC withdrawal deadline. If a stu dent withdraws on or before the date published as the \"last day to withdraw\" the student will receive a W grade. Withdrawals will not be allowed after the published withdrawal date. Please refer to Refund Schedule for the financial consequences of withdrawing from a course. Any withdrawal after the refund period has ended does not qualify for a refund. (See page 75 for the Refund schedule). A withdrawal prior to 60% completion of the semester may result in repayment of financial aid taken for the semester. Please speak with the Financial Aid Director before finalizing your withdrawal form. WITHDRAWAL FROM NURSING COURSES Students who wish to withdraw from a nursing course must meet with the Dean of Student 32 ACADEMIC INFORMATION Services, the Bursar, and the Financial Aid Director to complete a nursing course withdrawal form . It is also recommended that the student discuss withdrawal with his/her academic adviso r and course chair. Students enrolled in nursing courses AND co -requisites who wish to withdraw from a course or courses, at the beginning of the semester, must withdraw from the nursing course and may withdraw from the co -requisite course(s). Students who wish to withdraw from a cou rse or courses a t the end of the semester, may be permitted to continue in the nursing course and withdraw from the co- requisite course(s). In this instance, the decision is made by the Dean on a case- by-case basis. The effective date of the withdrawal w ill be the date the form is submitted to Student Services with all required signatures. A student on academic probati on cannot repeat a course that he/she withdrew from without the approval of the Admissions and Progression Committee. To repeat, the student must submit a \" Nursing Course Repeat Request\" fo rm. WITHDRAWAL FROM HUDSON VALLEY COURSES Withdrawal policies of Hudson Valley Community College are applied to courses taken at that school. Please review the Hudson Valley Communit y College Catalog regarding their Grading Policy and other implications of withdrawing from a course. Students must refer to the Hudson Valley Community College catalogue and calendar each semester for specific information regarding policies on registrati on, registration changes, tuition and grading. Students must complete an HVCC withdrawal form available from Student Services and here W:\\SON -StudentServices \\FORMS \\HVCC course -withdrawal -form.pdf . The form must be completed and signed by Student Services and the student must take the form directly to the Registrar's Office at HVCC for the change to go into effect. PLEASE NOTE: All withdrawals from HVCC courses MUST be approved by the Student Services Office at St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing. INCOMPLETE GRADE At the end of the semester, if course requirements have not been completed, an Incomplete grade (I) may be issued. A learning plan to address all outstanding course requirements must be established with the course chair. The student has 2 weeks after the semester ends to complete the outstanding course requirements. Otherwise, the I grade converts to an F grade. In exceptional circumstances, the student may appeal to the Dean for an extension. Incomplete grades in support courses are subject to the policy of Hudson Valley Community College or the institution at which the support course is taken. LEAVE OF ABSENCE (LOA): The LOA policy allows students to interrupt continuous enrollment for one semester without having to re- apply for enrollment and without changing conditions of their academic program. The leave of absence policy covers both involuntary and voluntary interruptions (personal, financial, medical, military) and is meant to ensure program completion within a 3 -year time -33 period. Exceptions to the time limit may be granted by the Dean of the School or Dean of Student Services under extenuating circumstances. To apply for a LOA, a student must submit the required Application for a Leave of Absence formW:\\SON -StudentServices \\FORMS \\Application for Leave of Absence Form.docx to Student Services prior to or during the semester for which the student is requesting the leave. All necessary documentation should accompany the Application. Once official grades have been recorded, no change to enrollment status w ill be accepted. In the event a student is incapacitated, the application may be submitted by a designee of the student. The associate degree program is designed to be completed in no more than three- years. Therefore, the requests for an LOA shall not put the student beyond the three - year completion deadline. If so, the request may be denied. If the LOA is approved, Student Services will notify the Bursar and Financial Aid Office. Students will be contacted fo r registration by Student Services. REPEATING A NURSING COURSE AT OUR SISTER SCHOOL Students who have failed a nursing course and who have been approved to repeat a nursing course in our school may be required to do so at the campus of the sister school . The decision of where the student r epeats the course rests solely with the school administration. All relevant policies are equally applied at both schools. The student who repeats a nursing course at the sister school will continue to be matriculated at their home school. All billing, financial aid and other student services will be provided by the home school. Failure of a subsequent nursing semester will result in academic dismissal, regardless of where the student repeats the course. The student's transcript will show the course tak en at the host school, with the actual grade recorded and computed into the student's GPA. ACADEMIC RECORD Students access their grade report at the end of each semester through Campus Anyware Online Services . The Grade Point Average (GPA) is obtained by adding the quality points achieved by the student in each course and dividing the sum by the total number of credit hours for those courses. If a failed course is repeated, the original grade will always appear on the transcript but will show as repeated. The new grade will be used to calculate the GPA . Transferred courses are not calculated in cumulative averages at the Schools. Any non- nursing grades below a C - are not accepted for transfer credit . MASTERY LEARNING This is a process designed to assist students in attaining the highest level of competency by recognizing learning style preferences and variations in time to acquire a deeper understanding. The curriculum builds from simple to complex. To support a stro nger 34 foundation, all students are required to attain a minimum of 80% or better in all nursing courses. If a student does not meet the minimum standard on a nursing exam, he/she must complete corrective measures, as discussed with that student's facult y. ATTENDANCE Scheduled learning experiences are designed to enhance each student's success and support deeper understanding. Attendance at classroom/lecture, all clinical, lab and observational learning experiences is required. Students are responsible for reporting late arrival or any planned or unplanned absence. Students are required to notify the clinical site and the clinical instructor when they will be late or absent. Additional information about notification of absences will be prov ided in each individual course orientation by the course chair. (See Attendance Policy) When a student is absent for three or more days as a result of an extended illness or has undergone childbirth or surgery of any kind, a written release from the student's health care provider must be provided to indicate the student's readiness to return to scheduled classroom and/or clinical experiences. Excessive absences, multiple failures to report absences, or lateness may result in course failure and/or termination from the program (see Dismissal Policy). Students at risk will be advised accordingly and informed in writing of actions that may be taken . CLINICAL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES In addition to course work at the Schools of Nursing, students will be assigned to clinical learning experiences at other health care agencies in the Capital District . These agencies may include, but are not limited to the following: St. Peter's Hospital, S amaritan Hospital, St. Margaret's, The Eddy Cohoes Rehabilitation Center, Heritage House or other agencies. These assignments will be scheduled during day and/or evening hours on weekdays and/or weekends. PREPAREDNESS FOR CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES Students are responsible for coming to clinical learning experiences prepared to participate in those experiences , including dressed in the school clinical uniform . Inadequate preparation may result in a faculty member denying an unprepared student the opportunity to participate in the learning experience (dismissed from the clinical setting for that day). Missed clinical learning experiences must be made up. EVAL UATION OF CLINICAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES Data or information used to formulate the student's clinical evaluation may include, and may not be limited to, the following sources: direct observations by the student's clinical faculty, patient statements, the student's written care plans and assignments, the student's demonstration/performance of psychomotor skills, the student's ability to discuss human illness or conditions, the student's ability to plan and provide organized, safe, efficient nursing care for same, the student's ability to provide patient teaching, the student's participation in clinical conferences, review of the student's documentation in the medical 35 ACADEMIC INFORMATION record, the student's professional behavior and appearance, and statements from other members of the health care team and preceptors' (if any) evaluations College of Nursing administration and faculty and/or members of the heath care team. CLINICAL LEARNI NG EXPERIENCE MAKE -UP Missed clinical learning experiences must be made up. Make- ups will be scheduled at the convenience of the facult y, but are not guaranteed. Students who miss more than one clinical experience will be required to make up the clinical experience at the end of the semester after the final exam. In that case, students will be assessed additional fees to augment expenses related to make up experiences beyond routine scheduling or semester calendars. The fees will be billed by the Bursar and payment must be made within 10 business days. Due to the uniqueness of some learning experiences, certain clinical make -ups may not be possible. After an absence, arrangements for make- ups of any type of missed experiences should be done in a timely manner with the faculty . Excessive absence or lateness may result in an administrative termination from the program and/or may be reason for course failure. Some clinical experiences begin at 7 a.m. or during evening hours or on weekends. If a clinical learning experience is cancelled, it may be rescheduled at a later date. 36 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR MEETING OUTCOMES IN THE CLINICAL PORTION OF A NURSING COURSE A student who successfully meets outcomes...

We strive to provide students with the knowledge, skills, judgment, and wisdom they need to function in society as educat ed adults. By accepting admission into the College of Nursing, the student affirms the commitment to uphold the values of the School's Honor Code and the standards of the nursing profession. Academic integrity at the St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing, Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing, and St Peter's Health Partners is based on a respect for individual achievement that lies at the heart of academic culture. Every faculty member and student belongs to a community of professionals where academic integrity is a fundamental commitment. DEFINITIONS Academic Integrity is defined in terms of a commitment to five fundamental values and to the principles that flow from those values. At the College of Nursing, five values are fundamental to the academic process: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Academic integrity is the commitment to stand up for these five values, even in the face of adversity. Academic Dishonesty is defined as any action or practice that provides the potential for an unfair advantage to one individual or one group. Academic dishonesty includes misrepresenting facts, fabricating or doctoring data or results, representing another's work or knowledge as one's own, disrupting or destroying the work of others, or abetting anyone who engages in such practices. Academic dishonesty is not absolute because the expectations for collaboration vary. In some courses, for example, students are assigned to work on team projects. In others, students are given permission to collaborate on homework projects or to have written materials present during an examination. Unless otherwise specified, however, the College of Nursing requires all work to be the result of individual effort, performed without the help of other individuals or outside sources. If a question arises about the use of external materials that may be used or the amount of collaboration that is permitted for a given task, each individual involved is responsible for verifyi ng the rules with the appropriate faculty before engaging in collaborative activities, using external materials or accepting help from others. 40 Actions constituting violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, the following: Plagiarism : the use of another's work, ideas, data, or product without appropriate acknowledgment, such as copying another's work, presenting someone else's opinions and theories as one's own, or working jointly on a project and then submitti ng it as one's own. Cheating: the use or attempted use of unauthorized materials, information, or study aids; or an act of deceit by which a student attempts to misrepresent academic skills or knowledge; unauthorized copying or collaboration. Fabricatio n: intentional misrepresentation or invention of any information, such as falsifying research, inventing or exaggerating data, or listing incorrect or fictitious references. Collusion: assisting another to commit an act of academic dishonesty, such as paying or bribing someone to acquire a test or assignment, taking a test or doing an assignment for someone else, or allowing someone to do these things for one's own benefit. Academic Misconduct : the intentional violation of school policies, such as tamp ering with grades, misrepresenting one's identity, or taking part in obtaining or distributing any part of a test or any information about the test. SANCTIONS All proven cases of academic dishonesty will be penalized as appropriate under the circumstances. Sanctions other than a reduced or failing grade may be imposed by the chair of the course. The imposition of any sanction other than a private reprimand will include a statement of reasons supporting its severity. A student may appeal any finding or sanction. Sanctions may include but are not limited to: Reduced or failing grade on an assignment, test, or course. A letter of reprimand A defined period of probation, with or without the attachment of conditions Withdrawal of College of Nur sing funding A defined period of suspension, with or without the attachment of conditions Expulsion (or dismissal) from the College of Nursing Notation on the official record Revocation of an awarded degree Any combination of the sanctions above The administrators of the College of Nursing will be responsible for tracking any occurrences of academic dishonesty and meeting with any student who fails to follow the honor code. 41 PROGRAM DISMISSAL/TERMINATION A student may be dismissed from the college when there is sufficient evidence to show: violations of The College of Nursing code of honor (see Academic Integrity policy) academic failure (see Academic Progress and Grading policy) unsafe clinical practice a failure to comply with College/Hospital/Agency policies and procedures excessive absences with failure to initiate a plan for make- up experiences, or absences beyond the school's ability to accommodate the make- up experiences behavior which is unprofessional/inappropriate conduct that jeopardizes the safety of self, students, patients or others failure to meet financial obligations or health requirements violation of the drug/alcohol policy behavior that violates one or more policies, such as Conduct on Campus or Sexual Harassment/Sexual Assault policies abuse of s ocial networking Faculty, staff or students who recklessly or intentionally endanger the mental or physical health of others at the college will be subject to corrective action up to and including termination or dismissal. Any communication (statement or photo) which may cause actual or potential harm or injury to another or to the college may be grounds for termination or dismissal. If a student is unsuccessful in a nursing course due to mental or physical illness, a plan of treatment and written proof of completion, by an appropriate authority, must be submitted before the student will be considered for readmission. 42 APPEALS STUDENT APPEAL PROCESS The Student Appeal Process is designed to facilitate conflict resolution. Students have a right to appeal decisions that impact their educational experiences or create conflict with their program objectives. Remedy is sought through the following steps: Solve the problem at the source. Meet with the indi vidual or persons involved in the conflict to attempt to resolve issue(s). Take the problem to next level. When a conflict remains unresolved, seek assistance through an advisor, or curriculum team member. When all avenues have been exhausted, a written statement of appeal may be submitted to the Admission and Academic Progres s Committee within eight (8) working days of the issue being disputed. A student who is appealing a clinical failure which is determined prior to the end of the semester may not attend class, clinical or lab while the appeal is pending. A student who is appealing a dismissal may not attend class, clinical or lab while the appeal is pending. To appeal, a student will submit a written request to the Dean of Student Services within 8 days. An ad-hoc subcommittee of the Admission and Academic Progress Committee will be convened, comprised of the Dean of Student Services or designee, two faculty representatives, and two students. Where possible, the Appeals Committee wil meet within 5 business days to hear the appeal and make a recommendation to the Dean. T he student will be invited to appear before the appeals committee to state his/her case. The faculty member of the course the student was unsuccessful in will also be invited to present information in support of the grade issued. The committee will vote to either uphold the grade or dismissal , or reverse it. The appeals process does not guarantee that a decision will be reversed.

It is the policy of this institution and the school s that ALL patient information is confidential and that access to that information is a privilege which carries with it ethical and legal responsibilities and sanctions. Student Access Students are eligible to access the EPIC on a \"need- to-know\" basis. The purpose of this access is to obtain patients' information directly related to clinical objectives in nursing courses, as well as to utilize the word processing and internal email capabilities of the system. This is a privilege which facilitates clinic al learning. Student Employees Some students of the college are also employees of the SPHP. If you hold this dual status, as an employee, while working in your employed status, you are eligible to use the computer system in whatever capacity your employ er deems appropriate for your position. Please NOTE: Students who are also employees will not receive a separate EPIC account. They will access EPIC with the same 4X4 whether working as a student or employee. It is the student's responsibility to t ell the school if they leave their employment so a new account can be created. Printed Material Students may NOT remove any printed information with patient identification on it from the building - this is removing a chart. Patient lab reports and medic ation lists may be taken out of the hospital only if all patient identifiers have first been removed from these documents. Students may not photocopy any part of a patient's chart. 61 REGULATORY Passwords No one is to allow anyone else access to the EPIC system on her/his password. If the person asking for use of the system is an eligible user, they can access the system through their own password. Do not \"buddy up\" while using the computer. Those who share their password may be dismissed from the college. Do not allow anyone who does not have a password into the system to \"show them what it can do\". This is not a reference library system - it is confidential information. Sanctions Please be mindful of the sanctions that apply to breach of confidentiality. These are listed in the Personnel Policies of the hospital. The final sanction for any behavior which violates these rules is termination of employment/dismissal from the school. In addition, violation of HIPAA regulations is a felony and may prohibit applicants from licensure as a nurse, or loss of license for those who already hold a license. FAMILY RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act af fords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. An eligible student under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution. In addition, parents are afforded the same rights as students, as l ong as the student is claimed as a dependent on either of their parent's Federal Income Tax Return, and there is proper presentation of the dependency condition. These rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records wi thin 45 days after the day the Schools receive a request for access. A student should submit to the Dean or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to w hom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading. A student who wishes to ask the school to amend a record should write the college official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the school decides not to amend the record as requested, the school will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to provide written consent bef ore the school discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. 62 The schools discloses education records without a student's prior written cons ent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the Schools in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law en forcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance com mittee. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the schools who performs an institutional service or function for which the schools would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the schools with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educa - tion record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the school . Upon request , the school may also disclose education records without consent to offi cials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. SPHCON and SHSON have designated the following information as \"directory information\": student's name, address, telephone listing, participation in officially recognized activities, major, dates of attendance, date of birth , enrollment status, and degrees and awards received, and digitized image/photograph/video.

The difference between these figures is the student's demonstration of \"need. \" Cost of Attend ance : The table below illustrates the estimated expenses for a first year, full time RN student of different status: All numbers are U. S. Dollars. COMMUTER OUT OF STATE Tuition and Fees $11,998 $15,398 Living Expenses $11,600 $11,600 $80 Cost of Attendance: The table below illustrates the estimated expenses for a first year, full time PN student of different status: All numbers are U. S. Dollars. COMMUTER OUT OF STATE Tuition and Fees $9,641 $11,440 Living Expenses $11,600 $80 VERIFICATION PROCESS The Department of Education uses a system of edits to select student financial aid applications for verification. This process involves the collection of additional supporting documentation to compare and cor rect inaccurate information that may have been supplied on the financial aid application. Students' whose applications are selected for verification will be notified by the Financial Aid Office and informed of any additional documentation/forms that must be completed. 71 Once the verification process is completed, any necessary changes will be made and the student's expected contribution will be recalculated. The Financial Aid Office will make necessary adjustment, if warranted, and send notification to t he student. In addition to the verification process, all student financial aid applications are compared with other databases to ensure accurate information and to flag potential problems. The matches include the Selective Service Agency files, Immigr ation and Naturalization files, Social Security Administration files and the National Student Loan Database System (NSLDS). Errors or problems are indicated on the student's Student Aid Report OR ISI R and must be resolved prior to the disbursement of any federal funds. The Financial Aid Office will notify students of any database match problems and the process to resolve the issues. DEPENDENCY OVERRIDE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID This is for students classified as \"dependent\" by the U.S. Department of Education's definition of a dependent student. The college recognizes that the awarding of federal student aid is based on the assumption that the primary responsibility of meeting college expenses rests with the student and the student's parents. Using a nationwide need analysis formula, the federal government requires both student and parent income and resources information in determining aid eligibility. The family's ability to pay for college is based on the information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Occasionally, due to \"unusual circumstances\", students should not be considered dependent. The federal government has given financial aid professionals authority to use their \"professional judgment' in determining if a dependency override is warranted in unusual circumstances. The dependent student can request a waiver of federal regulations requiring parental information if he/she can document why they should be considered independent. Th e student should contact the Financial Aid Coordinator for what required documentation will be requested for a Dependency Override as well as the policy and procedures guidelines.

Earned Title IV Aid: Students earn their federal financial aid by attending classes. Federal regulations, according to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, require the College of Nursing to recalculate a student's financial aid eligibility if the student withdraws from or stops attending his/her classes before completing at least 60% of the semester. After the 60% point of the semester, 100% of the Title IV aid is considered \"earned' by the student. The earned percentage is applied to the total amount of the Title IV grant and loan assistance that was disbursed (or could have been disbursed) to the student Unearned Percentage: Any amount in excess of the allowed percentage must be returned to the appropriate Title IV program by the school, the student or both. The school must return the lesser of the unearned Title IV assistance or an amount equal to the total liability incurred by the student multiplied by the unearned percentage. Tuition Liabilit y: If a student officially or unofficially withdraws after the end of the school's refund period, the student is liable for al l his or her tuition and fees, even if the student's financial aid is decreased. If the student's financial aid previously covered his or her bill, but no longer covers it after the Return of Title IV Aid calculation, the student will be expected to pay for his or he r outstanding tuition and fees. In addition, if the student receives a disbursement of financial aid, and the Return of Title IV Aid calculation shows that the student was not entitled to the funds, the student will be billed for the funds, and the overpayment information will be forwarded to the U. S. Department of Education. It will be the student's responsibility to repay the funds before he or she is eligible to receive any further federal student aid, even if the student attends another college. This overpayment will appear on the Student Aid Report until the overpayment is repaid. Definitions for Title IV Program: The following is an explanation of the difference between a refund and a repayment: Refund: The difference between moneys originally paid for institutional charges by financial aid and or cash payments and the amount retained by the institution after withdrawal. If a student received federal financial aid, a portion of the refund must be returned to those programs. Repayment: The amount that a student must pay back to the school if federal financial funds were received, in excess of institutional charges. The school will return the Student Financial Aid (SFA) program portion of the refund/repayment to the source of funding in the follow ing order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan Subsidized Federal Direct Loan Federal Plus Loan Federal Pell Grant 79 Federal Academic Competitiveness Grant Other sources Student The refund/repayment disbursal will be 100% to the SFA programs in order of the priority listed until the funds are exhausted. Determination of Date of Withdrawal Official Withdrawal: The date the student began the withdrawal process or the date the st udent officially notifies the School in writing that he/she is withdrawing from the program. The percentage of eligibility will be directly related to the percentage of the semester completed. For example: if a student completes 10% of the semester, he/she will be eligible for 10% of his/her financial aid. If he/she completes 30% of the semester, he/she will receive 30% of his/her financial aid etc. Unofficial Withdrawal: If the student leaves school without giving notice, the student's last recorded day of attendance as documented by the school will be used. In the absence of attendance records, the midpoint of the semester will be used. Process for Determining Refunds/Repayments Student's date of withdrawal will be calculated using the federal wi thdrawal record. For both Federal Financial Aid Recipients and Non- Federal Financial Aid Recipients the Refund policy of the school will be applied for tuition, fees and other charges. Repayment/refunds will be determined by using the federal softw are provided by the U. S. Department of Ed ucation governing the money involved. Allocation of a refund/repayment to the SFA program sources will be within 45 days of the withdrawal date to the federal programs, within 60 days to the lender and within 30 days to the student. If a repayment is required by the student, he/she will be notified of the need to repay the FFELP programs. Verification of Process When a student withdraws from t he school, the calculation work sheet will be completed and filed in the st udent's Financial aid folder/billing records as a record of this policy's applicat ion and the record of returned refund/repayment as required. All students will have the following documentation attached to their final bill: Withdrawal Record - with copy of change of status/written note or attendance sheet. Refund calculation sheet If nece ssary - refund/repayment/prorated sheets per federal policy A sample of all forms are available upon request. Once a refund/repayment is determined, the Bursar will att ach all paperwork to the bill, and process through accounting so that distribution is made within 30 days of the refund/repayment calculation date. 80 CERTIFICATION/REGISTRATION St. Peter's Hospital College of Nursing /Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing is registered by the New York State Education Department, approved by the Board of Regents.

The Federal P ELL Grant Program is a federal financial aid program providing financial assistance to needy post -secondary students. The 2022- 2023 Federal Pell Grants range from $711 to $6,895 for the year. Federal Pell grant eligibility is determined when a student files the FAFSA. Once processed, the FAFSA will result in a Student Aid Report (SAR), which is sent directly to the stu dent by the central processor. The SON also draws the ISIR data down electronically for all students who list the SON as a college on the FAFSA. When the ISIR data is received from the Central Processor, a file is established. When the file is complete and the information is verified and determined to be accurate, the college can pay on the Pell Grant. Funding is based on the num ber of credits the student is registered for each semester and is credited to the student's account on a semester -by-semester basis. The Federal Pell Grant program is available to full -time, three quarter time and half -time students. When federal regulations for funding permits, awards may be made to less than half -time students. Federal Direct Loans: 81 Application Process : a FAFSA must be completed to determine eligibility.
