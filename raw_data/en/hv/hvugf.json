This ten - dency has displayed itself throughout the history of the chiropractic profession, with disagreements over phil-osophy and nomenclature dominating the agenda 1 whilst external detractors have looked on with the smug satis-faction of knowing that internal tensions are perpetuating division and stunting growth 2. In an era of health system transformation it is clear that the climate is changing.3 Just as western society has gradually realised the impact of global ecological change and has adapted its behaviour accordingly, so must we as chiropractors realise that the healthcare environment is changing. While this presents challenges, it also gifts us unprecedented opportunities to evolve. What is essential is that we accept that climate change is happening and commit ourselves to bravely tackling the issues before us. Identity I have consistently argued that for the profession to prog-ress and be a key player in modern healthcare systems, it must jettison some of the historical baggage that has weighed it down over decades and commit itself to mod-ern, evidence-based, research driven healthcare. 4 This does not of course mean that chiropractic should suddenly turn its back on the philosophies and practice that has shaped its development and assured its survival since 1895. The power of the spinal adjustment, the con-sideration that the integrity of the spine has a direct impact on human health and the view that as living organisms we are more than simply the sum of our parts have all been guiding principles. However, the language in which we cloak our profession often suggests an archaic mindset and a refusal to move away from pseudo-religious con-cepts often embraced by complementary and alternative medical practices. It is therefore of paramount importance that the chiro-Climate change: global challenges for the chiropractic profession Richard Brown, DC, LL.M, FRCC* *President, British Chiropractic Association The profession agrees a universal identity which is consistent around the world. Back in 2005, the WFC pub-lished the results of its identity consultation. 5 At this time, it was decided that the most appropriate public identity for the chiropractic profession was that they should be the spinal healthcare experts in the healthcare system. This was the result of two years of intensive work including a grass roots electronic survey of chiropractors worldwide. It is widely considered that are seven pillars upon which chiropractic's identity should be grounded. 1. An ability to improve function in the neuro- musculoskeletal system and have a distinct im-pact on the overall health, wellbeing and quality of life. 2. A specialised approach to examination, diagno- sis and treatment which must be based on the best available research and clinical evidence, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between the spine and the nervous system. 3. A tradition of effectiveness and patient satisfac- tion. 4. An avoidance of drugs or surgery, enabling pa- tients to avoid these where possible. 5. Expertly qualified providers of spinal adjust - ment, manipulation and other manual treat - ments, exercise instruction and patient educa - tion. 6. Collaboration with other health professionals 7. A patient-centred and biopsychosocial ap- proach, emphasising the mind-body relation - ship in health, the self-healing powers of the body and individuals' responsibility for health and encouraging patient interdependence. Late in 2012, Palmer College released its own iden - tity statement.6 This had many similarities with the WFC 2005 statement, positioning chiropractors as the primary health care professionals for spinal health and well being. The synchronisation of identity statements from two of the world's leading organisations must surely gift us the opportunity to create a global message for the consum-ers and potential consumers of spinal health care services. Now is the time to bring together educators, academics, researchers and clinicians to finally agree how chiroprac - tic should be portrayed to the world.EducationWhile we gladly accept that education in any discipline may be delivered in a range of formats, with differing emphases on individual components, there are inevitable boundaries. Inspectorates of schools, prisons and other state institutions ensure that minimum standards of edu-cation are attained, which correspond to nationally agreed frameworks. In medicine and dentistry, despite different emphasis on delivery (traditional didactic learning ver - sus problem-based learning, for example) there is a broad consensus when it comes to required levels of compe - tency and professional standards. However , the evolution of the chiropractic profession, historically characterised by private educational institu - tions, has meant that a largely self-regulating mechan - ism has prevailed. The various Councils on Chiropractic Education have set their own accreditation criteria 7, but flexibility of interpretation has meant that the delivery of chiropractic education between institutions remains start- lingly different. While some focus on a strictly science-based and biomedical model, others steer their students towards more philosophical tenets. W ithin the chiropractic profession many celebrate the diversity of educational approaches in chiropractic, laud-ing it as being symbolic of the various strands of develop-ment that have woven their way into the fabric of our pro-fession. At the same time, others bemoan the fact the dis-parity and differences between programmes of study have created an indistinct image of chiropractic education, one where examples of excellence are interspersed with less robust programmes of study. The long term survival of chiropractic education outside the mainstream university network appears in some regions uncertain and this has been reflected in declining student numbers. There may be a number of factors at play . The costs of education and training are such that in a global reces-sion, they may have become prohibitively expensive. Op-portunities for graduates may be more limited. Adverse media coverage and tarnished reputations of the profes-sion in some areas may have reduced the demand for chiropractic. But perhaps one of the biggest challenges to the profession is that other manual therapy professions have realised the market for skilled spine care services and have focused their attention on what is seen as a vast untapped market. The harmonisation of education throughout the world 108 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Perspective must surely, therefore, be one of the goals of the chiro- practic profession. As the world demands evidence-based, research driven healthcare 8, there can no longer be a place where historical concepts are portrayed as fact and where students are expected to swear an undying allegiance to the theories of yesteryear. I am not cal ling for every chiropractic centre of learn- ing to become clones of one another; it is crucially im-portant that schools, colleges and universities providing chiropractic education retain their own identity. However, in order to facilitate and foster information exchange, har - monisation of procedures and policies and attainment of comparable qualifications, there must be a robust review of the acceptab ility of programmes in the context of mod- ern educational frameworks if they are to be deemed ac-ceptable within the wider healthcare community. In tandem with this, we must also see an expansion of the numbers of available programmes of study. The growth of the chiropractic profession materially depends upon the number of its practitioners being represented in adequate numbers over the face of the globe. We must not, therefore, be afraid of adopting new approaches to growing chiropractic in areas that are under-represented. Research It is often said that research is the currency of the profes-sion. For the profession to compete and attain the cultural authority it strives to achieve, it is essential that there is an international commitment to research. This should first examine what we do primarily as chiropractors - spine- based care using manipulation - as well as the other com-ponents that make up a modern chiropractor's package of care: supervised and home based exercise, spinal stabil-ization programmes, medical acupuncture and soft tissue techniques. W e must become the default spinal care experts and to be so we must be active - and be seen to be active - in the field of spinal research. Canada is one of the world leaders in grasping the nettle of spinal research and com- mitting funds to it. The production of clinical guidelines9, the funding of Research Chairs and the willingness to col-laborate with other stakeholders, both within the outside the profession, demonstrate clear leadership. World class chiropractic researchers are being heard and respected within forums that our ancestors would never have con-sidered possible. Following leads set by Canada and Denmark, other chiropractic research organisations are now appearing in Europe. The UK, Norway, Sweden and France have all now set up their own national research organisations, but in every nation where chiropractic exists we need to be sure that data is collected and the knowledge base is wid-ened. We need to know how chiropractic care may impact on Africans, on Asians and Middle Eastern populations as well as in our own well-developed North American and European regions. In a challen ging environment where funds for chiro- practic are lim ited, priorities need to be identified to en - sure maximum effectiveness and utilisation of outcomes. Collaborations may provide an excellent platform for developing international research and ongoing work is being done to develop the North Atlantic Research Col-laboration. This is an affiliation of the national associa - tions of the UK, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland and Sweden and it is hoped that a shared research agenda between the parties will facilitate knowledge that will en-hance service delivery and mainstream integration. W ith enormous costs associated with sickness ab- sence10, demonstrating chiropractic's role in the preven- tion of occupational injuries and disability carries huge potential societal and economic advantage. Research directed at preventative care for specific and general populations also feeds into the health policies of many developed and developing nations. Cost ef fectiveness will undoubtedly be the driver in terms of chiropractic's role in health systems. Politicians can make all the right noises about how concerned they are about clinical effectiveness and life saving care, but the bottom line is how much it will all cost and where the best deals are to be had. Anything that shows that chiropractic is cheaper than the competition will attract the attention of key decision-makers. Reduced costs, re-duced waiting times, and the satisfaction of patients, who of course are those who elect politicians to office, will get chiropractic noticed in the healthcare marketplace. Widening access In developing the chiropractic profession, we must con- stantly endeavour to widen access to care beyond those who can afford it. If we are to become the spinal health and wellbeing experts, we must strive to ensure that the services that we offer are available to everyone in society.J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) 109R Brown W idening access to care will increase the exposure of chiropractic to groups otherwise unable to benefit from what we as healthcare professionals can offer. This is rel- evant not only here in Canada on a socioeconomic level, but also internationally, and initiatives by Scott Haldeman and World Spine Care in Botswana and India as well as humanitarian missions to disaster zones and other de-veloping areas of the world have helped to illustrate the compassionate nature of chiropractors in the delivery of healthcare. On a local level, the involvement of chiropractic or - ganisations in public health must be prioritised. As neuro-musculoskeletal experts, governments, organisations and society expect chiropractors to be active in the field of public health. Here, there is of course no instantaneous reward; no queues of patients starting to form in an order - ly fashion outside chiropracto rs' offices and no dramatic upturn in terms of universal acceptance. However, what engagement in public health initiatives achieves is author - ity through altruism. The identification of back pain as the single leading cause of disability worldwide, with MSK disorders as a group being the second greatest cause after cardiovascu - lar conditions, should propel us all to become involved in health promotion. The Lancet' s December report 11, sup- ported by the WHO, should be a clarion call to the chiro-practic profession to take ownership of the responsibility to educate populations in the area of spinal health. Whether it be safer lifting campaigns, perfect posture initiatives or spinal exercise drives, chiropractors should be at the forefront of any and all spinal health education. If we are to satisfy the weight of expectation that soci-ety will place on us as experts, we must address that ex-pectation, not just by the effectiveness of our adjustments or diagnostic techniques, but by showing that we have a concern for health prevention strategies. Again, this is something that should be the product of effective leader - ship and strong collaboration. The Straighten Up and Just Keep Walking campaigns are examples of excellent work but we must dedicate funds and energy to ensuring that with the opportunities before us chiropractic is positioned as a public health leader in enhancing and improving the health of our nations. Policy input and research As a profession, it is imperative that we not only reach the spines of the public, but also the minds of our politicians. Engagement in health policy and involvement in helping to steer the direction of health transformation is vital if we are to secure recognition and credibility. In the changing climate of health systems, the challenge for the chiroprac - tic profession is to have a voice on matters of policy and decision makin g, particularly in the field of neuromuscu - loskeletal care. This is lar gely a factor of resource allocation and pol- itical knowledge. The lack of formal regulation in many nations makes Government links difficult to for ge and the relative immaturity of the profession in certain regions makes inroads a distinct challenge. With opportunities opening up in the brave new world of modern healthcare, it may therefore be relevant for future international con-gresses to consider sharing knowledge and skills in the fields of lobbying and political networking. Developing leadership skillsThe outdated view of leadership are that leaders are marked out for greatness from an early age and that if you are not a born leader, there is little that you can do to become one. The persistence of this view in some quarters is a great pity, but the modern view, and one that I wholeheartedly support, is that with perseverance, determination, passion and hard work, anyone can become an effective leader. But leadership in chiropractic seems to be something that, certainly when I was a student, was missing from the curriculum. We were taught to assess, diagnose, adjust, x-ray and write reports, all essential attributes in clinical practice, but we were not given any advice on how to be leaders. Of course, it might be argued that to teach leadership is not the responsibility of the educational institutions, and they may be right. Their role is to produce safe, compe - tent, confident graduates. So whose role is it to ensure that there is a legacy of effective and strong leadership that is passed on to future generations of chiropractors? The truth is that probably we all have a duty to com - municate leadership. We must display strength during periods of adversity and humility during periods of cele - bration. We must have a vision for the future and turn that vision into a reality. And we must have a passion for what we do such that we may get up early and go to bed late, we stay excited about what we do, we see potential in others and be thrilled when they succeed.110 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Perspective I beli eve that there is scope for a leadership programme in chiropractic. This can be organised on a regional, na-tional or global level but its essence must be that we can be assured of strong, committed leadership to develop the profession worldwide. This calls for investment, both fi - nancially and in time, but such an investment will be re-warded many times over. Guidance, mentoring and stew-ardship should be as much a feature of graduate develop-ment as practice management. We are not all destined to become leaders of national or Provincial organisations, but every graduate chiropractor will be need leadership skills as they navigate their way through the intricate windings of their careers as clinicians, clinic owners and beyond. Strategy In light of the changing climate in healthcare what should be our key strategies to overcoming the challenges that lay before us? Strategy is all about shaping the future and for us as chiropractors we must develop a strategy that is future focused and looks at the unmet needs of patients and society. The area of spinal health is a vast, largely untapped and currently mismanaged global burden but for chiropractic to seize opportunities it must carefully plan its strategy. In an era of climate change, our profession must be prepared for all weathers and must plan accordingly. We must continually monitor the external environment and however cosy we might feel in our own cocooned en-vironment, we must be mindful of the conditions outside. Conclusion We must consider a strategy that best serves the political, economic and healthcare climate of our times. We have important choices to make. Darwin or Dogma? Progres-sion or regression? Survival or submission? Events around the globe are conspiring to make this one of the most dynamic periods of chiropractic's his-tory. Great strides have been made. Regulation, educa-tion and research have flourished. Y et divisions persist. For chiropractic' s sake, let us meet our global challenges with fortitude, ensure sound professional governance and be ready to adapt as the healthcare climate changes.References 1. Phillips R.

Part 1 presents an overview of KT and discusses some of the common barriers to successful KT within the chiropractic profession. Part 2 will suggest strategies to mitigate these barriers and reduce the evidence-practice gap for both the profession at large and for practicing clinicians. Introduction New knowledge is created at such a rapid pace that health care professionals find it difficult, if not impossible, to keep up to date. In a single day alone, 75 clinical trials and 11 systematic reviews are published.1 As a result, it is incredibly difficult to keep up to date with the literature in order to implement new knowledge that may optimize patient care, increase benefits, or reduce harm. In an ef - fort to promote evidence-based practice, many research-ers and funding agencies are now focusing on processes to deliver emerging evidence successfully to clinicians and other stakeholders; this process has been termed KT. What is KT? KT is defined by the Canadi an Institutes of Health Re - search (CIHR) as 'a dynamic and iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically 1 Associate Professor and Canada Research Chair in Spinal Function, F aculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta 2 Assistant Professor and CCRF Research Chair in Neuromusculoskele tal Health, Faculty of Kinesiology and Health Studies, University of Regina 3 Assistant Professor , Department of Anesthesia, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada 4 Assistant Professor and CCRF Research Chair in Rehabilitation Epide miology, School of Physical and Occupational Therapy, McGill University.

What KT is not... A commonly held misconception is that the process of KT is a pipeline that transports information generated by aca-demics to awaiting clinicians. Knowledge translation does not involve just two parties, or the simple exchange of in-formation. In reality, KT (and knowledge exchange) is a roadmap of two-way streets that creates a system of inter - connections between researchers and clinicians, patients, government, policy makers, regulators, payers, guideline developers, and other stakeholders. Through these inter - connections, it is hoped that all involved will use shared knowledge to improve health care delivery in a measur - able way (e.g. effectiveness, cost, access to care, etc.). 3 As such, creating structured two-way avenues for collab-oration between chiropractic clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and others is a vital element in the facilitation of effective and efficient KT in the chiropractic profession. In contrast, activities such as technology integration, commercialization of a product, and continuing educa - tion (i.e. professional development) may not necessarily constitute KT if they do not engage the appropriate stake-holders and/or do not result in improved outcomes. 3 Why is KT important?In 2000 and 2001, two landmark reports were published that clearly defined the importance of KT . Published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), 'To Err is Human'4 and 'Crossing the Quality Chasm',5 drew attention to the gap between what clinicians know as opposed to what clinicians actually do. This gap was seen as an import-ant cause of overuse, misuse, and underuse of health care services. In addition to defining the impacts arising from this gap, the second IOM report proposed a reason for the existing gap, namely that health care delivery has fallen well short in its ability to translate research into practice and policy, and to apply new technology safely and ap-propriately. 5 A major implication arising from this observation is that patients don't always receive safe and effective health care and, if they do, it may not be delivered in a timely manner. As a result, many feel that much of soci-ety's investment to date in biomedical, clinical, and health research has had limited impact. To better understand the extent of how the evidence-practice gap contributes to adverse effects on population health, social welfare, and economic productivity, various global organizations are now cataloguing gaps in primary care, specialty care, and in-patient care provided by most health disciplines. 6 Stud- ies in industrialized countries including North America, Australia, and Europe have identified that up to 30 to 40% of patients do not receive treatments of proven effective - ness, while approximately 25% receive care that is un - necessary or potentially more harmful.7,8 While little is known regarding similar gaps for chiropractic care, there are no compelling reasons to suggest that the magnitude of these gaps are any different within the chiropractic pro-fession. In fact, the management of back and neck pain is recognized as having poor adherence to, and wide varia - tions in, established best practices. 9-13 Understanding KTThe CIHR Knowledge-to-Action model 14 helps concep- tualize ways in which evidence-practice gaps can be ad-dressed toward changing professional behavior with the ultimate outcome of improving health (Figure 1). Recom - Figure 1. The Knowledge-to-Action process developed by Graham et al. (2006). The funnel represents know-ledge creation, and the cycle represents the application of knowledge (action).J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; M Erwin, S Passmore, J Srbely mended steps to identifying and addressing knowledge- practice gaps include problem identification, selection of best practices relevant to the problem, and assessing barriers to practice change. Together, these steps suggest strategies that can potentially narrow research-practice gaps (Part 2). In practice, the Knowledge-to-Action mod-el ident ifies selected strategie s which are then dissemin - ated or implemented using various means; changes in practice and other trends can then be monitored. The im-pact of these strategies are then evaluated and additional strategies are implemented to help improved practices become sustained. 14,15 This process is not foolproof, and adapting the model to specific situations can be a difficult task before success is realized. The size of the evidence-practice gap in chiropracticNarrowing the evidence-prac tice gap is an ongoing ex- ercise for any health profession. While there are several approaches to reducing a profession's evidence-practice gap (Part 2), it is critical to assess the size of the gap to determine what strategies to use and whether current KT strategies are effective. Several different approaches exist with respect to measuring the size of the gap in the chiropractic profes-sion. While it is not our intent to provide an exhaustive list, some approaches are easier to appreciate than others. For example, one simple way of assessing the size of the evidence-practice gap in chiropractic is to ask yourself: \"What has changed in practice since I graduated?\" Al-ternatively, another simple approach is to contrast what is done in your practice to what recent clinical practice guidelines recommend. No matter how the gap is measured, it would appear to be significant. Addressing our own evidence-practice gapWhile the profession may not presently have an informed, planned, and measurable approach to reducing the evi-dence-practice gap, there are examples where our ability as a profession to generate new, meaningful knowledge and our willingness to incorporate it into our clinical practice has succeeded. For example, it can be argued that chiropractic clinicians' understanding of the relation be-tween manipulation and adverse events is current and in-formed by research. Unfortunately, there are many other examples where meaningful knowledge has been gener - ated in our profession, but has not been adopted into prac-tice. Specifical ly, the Neck Disability Index was created by chiropractic researchers Sil Mior and Howard Vernon in 1991. This simple tool has become the international standard for measuring neck function. Yet, a recent sur - vey suggests that many chiropractors do not use this tool in daily practice. 16 Additionally, investigations related to the prediction of short-term and long-term outcomes in back pain patients receiving chiropractic care have shown that early improvement in the course of treatment ap-pears to be a crucial factor, 17-22 and is a strong predictor of outcome at 3 and 12 months.23-25 Despite this body of evidence, we suspect that many chiropractors do not use this criteria (i.e. lack of improvement within the first few treatments) as an indication that the patient may best be served through an alternative treatment strategy. As a re-sult, there is an increased probability that a single patient may receive very different care, with different results, if they were to see a number of different chiropractors 26 (a phenomenon present in many other clinical disciplines). Understanding the reasons why practice variations exist and the barriers to optimizing care are extremely import - ant in regard to effectively reducing practice gaps. Barriers to KT in the chiropractic community A systematic approach to KT can help understand why a specific gap persists between what is known to be ef fect- ive, what is done in chiropractic practice and how this gap might be reduced. Several studies have itemized the primary barriers to implementing evidence in clinical practice in general. These include a lack of time and the lack of skills to navi-gate and appraise literature. While these are two important barriers, over 250 others have been identified with respect to specific KT activities involving physicians alone.27 Quite often, these barriers are easy to appreciate if they are grouped into those affected by individual clinicians (e.g. lack of awareness, lack of familiarity, lack of agreement, lack of self-efficacy , lack of outcome expectancy , and in - ertia of previous practice), and those external to clinicians (e.g. patients, guidelines, and practice environment). 28 While these general barriers are common in many health professions, there are additional barriers which (although not specific to the chiropractic profession) are certainly well-known characteristics of our profession.114 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Commentary On the supply side, there is limited research capacity to generate knowledge within the profession, with ap-proximately 1% of the chiropractic profession conducting research in Canada.29 While this figure is nearly twice as much among physician-scien tists in the US, the numbers of full time MD researchers has remained rather stable in the past decade. 30 Another barrier for our profession is the suggestion that when compared to other professions, the chiropractic profession places a lower value on scientific knowledge as compared to individual expertise.31,32 Chiropractic is also characterized by a large percentage of clinicians practicing in solo practice, which can limit opportunities to interact with colleagues and other professions. 33,34 Additionally , the profession tends to have a short his- tory with decision support systems (e.g. clinical decision rules, guidelines, etc), and may trivialize their use. A lim - ited number of chiropractic guidelines have been pub-lished since the Mercy Guideline in 1993, 35 and divergent recommendations among available guidelines may only serve to confuse clinicians. 36 Finally , like most other professions, chiropractic has yet to develop coordinated efforts to address KT issues between researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders while ongoing debates, legislation, and internal evolution about the chiropractic profession's own identity 37 result in low coherence of beliefs and evidence-based practices. Summary In this commentary, we described the process of KT and its importance in optimizing health care delivery through the ef fective and efficient integration of available and new knowledge into practice and policy. In addition, we high- lighted several barriers to KT, including those that are common to most health care disciplines, and those that are of particular relevance to the chiropractic profession (e.g. limited research capacity, a greater emphasis on in-dividual expertise than scientific knowledge). In Part 2, we will suggest strategies to narrow the evidence-practice gap in our profession, as well as some tools that may pro-vide early success in this regard.

Taylor, DC, DACBR3 We report a case of transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH) in a 59-year-old man including the clinical presentation, diagnostic studies, management and clinical progress. TOH is a rare self-limiting condition that typically affects middle-aged men or, less frequently, women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Affected individuals present clinically with acute hip pain, limping gait, and limited ranges of hip motion. TOH may begin spontaneously or after a minor trauma. Radiographs are typically unremarkable but MR imaging studies yield findings consistent with bone marrow edema. TOH is referred to as regional migratory osteoporosis if it travels to other joints or the contralateral hip. TOH often resembles osteonecrosis but the two conditions must be differentiated due to different prognoses and management approaches.

These individuals present without a his-tory of major trauma but usually developed an acute onset of hip pain accompanied by decreased ranges of motion, and a limping gait. 1-6 Radiographs of TOH are frequently unremarkable, but may display diffuse osteo-penia of the femoral head and neck. The affected area appears \"warm\" on bone scans; however, this test is sel-dom used due to its low specificity for T OH.1 Computed tomography findings include reduced bone density of the af fected area and loss of thickness with continuity of vertical primary compressive trabeculae.2 Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging yields findings consistent with bone marrow edema - low signal intensity of bone mar - row on T1-weighted sequences and high signal intensity of bone marrow on fluid-sensitive (T2-weighted and fat- suppressed) sequences.3 The edema affects the subchon- dral bone of the femoral head and can extend toward the neck and intertrochanteric region. Unlike osteonecrosis, TOH does not result in collapse, fragmentation, or re-modeling of the cortical bone of the femoral head nor does it progress to arthritis. 1 Cases of TOH have been reported with and without the co-existent presence of subchondral stress fractures of the femoral head. 1-4 The susceptibility to stress fractures may be partly due to diminished bone density secondary to increased osteoclastic activity. 3 There has been debate within the literature whether TOH is a consequence of a stress fracture or vice versa, since not every patient with TOH also has subchondral stress fractures. 3,4 Although the specific risk factors for T OH are poorly understood, it is generally agreed that they differ from the risk factors associated with osteonecrosis.1,3-7 For ex- ample, it is postulated that there may be a relationship between T OH and reflex sympathetic dystrophy , also known as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).3,5,6 The two conditions share similar signs and symptoms of pain, edema, and inflammato ry soft tissue changes, how - ever, the hypersensitivity, vasomotor dysfunction, tem-perature and skin changes typically observed in CRPS are not characteristic of transient osteoporosis. 3,5 A small retrospective study6 (n=17) reported that physicians had a higher incidence of TOH compared to osteonecrosis or transient bone marrow edema syndrome and postulated that this may be due to long hours of standing. T OH may eventually migrate to other joints, especially the contralateral hip, a condition referred to as regional migratory osteoporosis (RMO). 5 The signs and symptoms of RMO are identical to TOH and both eventually resolve without treatment, suggesting that these are variations of the same or a similar condition. 8 T OH is also similar to a condition termed transient bone marrow edema (TBME) syndrome. Within the lit - erature, authors may either use the terms interchangeably 3 or choose to differentiate the two conditions. According to some authors 5,7, TBME syndrome should be reserved for cases where radiographs do not show osteopenic changes of the femoral head and neck, whereas the term TOH is typically reserved for cases where radiographs do demonstrate osteopenia. Aside from this minor distinction the clinical presentation and MR findings of TBME syn - drome and TOH are equivalent.5 Case HistoryA 59-year-old male presented to a chiropractic clinic with a chief complaint of acute left hip pain after building a dock. The pain began two to three days after the building project during which he repeatedly carried 16-foot long, two inch by six inch planks of lumber on his left hip down a steep incline to the beach. The pain was a constant ache with sharp, stabbing pain when moving from sitting to standing and after prolonged walking, sitting or lying su-pine. Following prolonged standing or walking, the se-verity of the patient's pain prevented him from lying in a neutral left hip, knee extended posture. In order to avoid pain he would assume a supine lying position of 45\u00b0 hip and knee flexion. At night he would frequently wake up to \"walk of f the pain\". Physical ExaminationUpon examination, the patient had difficultly arising from sitting and ambulated with an antalgic gait and limp favoring his left hip. His left groin and hip region were tender to palpation and demonstrated painful limitation of passive ranges of internal rotation, external rotation, flex - ion, and extension. Log roll, FABER Patrick, and FADIR (hip impingement) tests were all exquisitely painful with soft end feel restriction associated with muscular guard-ing rather than with a hard end feel restriction suggestive 118 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Transient osteoporosis of the hip: A case report Figure 1. Anter oposterior (A) and frog-leg lateral (B) radiographs reveal normal bone density, trabeculae and only minor hip joint space narrowing.Table 1 Relevant Orthopedic Examinations14 Orthopedic Exam Description Interpretation Log Roll Patient is supine, the examiner places both hands on the patient's mid-thigh and passively externally rotates each hip maximally.Test is positive for intra-articular pathology if greater external rotation is noted on the affected side. FABER Patrick Patient is supine, the examiner flexes, abducts, and externally rotates the af fected hip so that the ipsilateral ankle is placed just proximal to the unaffected knee. While stabilizing the anterior superior iliac spine, the affected leg is lowered toward the table.Test is positive for intra-articular hip pain if the maneuver reproduces the patient's symptoms. FADIR Hip ImpingementPatient is supine, the examiner flexes the hip and knee to 90\u00b0, then adducts and internally rotates the af fected hip in the flexed position.Test is positive for intra-articular hip pathology if the patient's symptoms are reproduced. Ober's test Patient is side-lying with the affected side up, the examiner flexes the patient's knee to 90\u00b0 and abducts and extends the hip. The examiner allows gravity to adduct the hip as much as possible.Test is positive if the hip is unable to adduct to the neutral position. Positive test is indicative of iliotibial band pathology. Trendelenberg Patient is standing and lifts one foot off the ground. Test is positive if the non-stance hip drops. Positive test is indicative of gluteus medius weakness on the stance 1 19K Taylor of joint pathology. Ober test and Trendelenberg tests were negative (refer to Table 1 for a summary of the relevant orthopedic examinations). Conventional AP (Figure 1A) and frog-leg lateral (Figure 1B) radiographs of the left hip were interpreted as normal. Initial Diagnosis and Management The initial clinical impression was of an acute capsular lesion of the hip. The patient's primary care clinician pre-scribed analgesic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication for six weeks which provided only minimal relief. A brief three visit course of conservative physical therapy triggered acute exacerbations of pain lasting 48 to 72 hours following each therapy session and was there - fore discontinued. Despite the patient's optimistic expect - ation of a gradual self-resolution of the complaint, at six weeks post-injury his pain and disability appeared to be increasing. As a result, the patient was referred for MR imaging with intra-articular gadolinium (MR arthrogram) to assess the hip joint and intra-articular structures.MR Imaging and Final DiagnosisMR imaging was ordered to rule out internal derange - ment or osseous pathology (i.e. labral tear, osteoarthrosis or osteonecrosis respectively). The MR images revealed extensive edema within the medullary bone of the head and neck of the left femur with an associated joint effu-sion. No findings suggestive of avascular necrosis, labral tear or intra-ar ticular lesion were identified. Further T1- weighted MR images were obtained after intravenous injection of gadolinium, revealing minor signal enhance - ment of the femoral head. The radiologist's report con-cluded that these findings were most consistent with tran - sient osteoporosis of the hip (Figure 2A). The cornerstone of management involved education of the patient to the benign, self-limiting nature of the con-dition. This included a cautionary warning regarding the heightened risk for fracture of the femoral neck second-ary to transient osteoporosis and the risk of migration of the condition to the contralateral hip. Pain reduction strat-egies included utilization of analgesics on an as-needed Figure 2.A) Initial coronal fluid-sensitive (STIR) MR image ob- tained 3 months after initial onset of pain reveals hyper - intense bone marrow signal within the left femoral head and neck (arrows) consistent with the bone marrow edema associated with transient osteoporosis. A joint effusion is also present. The right femoral head and neck exhibit nor - mal bone marrow signal. (*) B) Follow up coronal fluid-sensitive (STIR) MR im- age obtained 3 months after the initial MR study reveals complete resolution of the abnormal bone marrow signal within the left femoral head and neck as well as resolution of the initial joint effusion. The right femoral head and neck exhibit normal bone marrow signal. 120 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Transient osteoporosis of the hip: A case report basis and the adoption of hip sparing postures and activ - ities to decrease loading. The radiologist requested follow-up MR imaging to confirm that the edema had resolved satisfactorily , to ex - clude the presence of subchondral stress fracture, and to ensure that the contralateral femoral head and neck re-mained normal. MR imaging obtained four months post-diagnosis demonstrated complete resolution of the find - ings of bone marrow edema and joint effusion. There was no evidence of contralateral hip involvement or complica - tions such as fracture (Figure 2B). The patient reported a full resolution of his symptoms at the follow-up appoint-ment just prior to his second MRI. Regular and moder - ate manual labor provoked no symptomatic flair or recur - rence. Discussion T OH is a self-limiting condition which develops spontan- eously or may be triggered by minor trauma and is char - acterized clinically by acute hip pain, limping gait, and limited range of motion. 1,3 It is three times as likely to af- fect males5 who are typically between the ages of 32 and 551. A subset less frequently affected by TOH are women in the third trimester of pregnancy.1,2,5 Most cases of TOH are spontaneous3,5 while others occur following minor trauma1,6 such as a \"groin pull\" or a slip. It is thought that minor trauma may cause a transient ischemic period which triggers an episode of TOH. 6 In the current case it can be postulated that the repetitive compressive loading of the left hip may have been sufficient trauma to result in transient ischemia which progressed to TOH. Conventional radiographic studies are generally in - sensitive to TOH and contribute little value to the diagno-sis. 1,3 The radiographs in the current case were unremark - able, exhibiting no degenerative (osteoarthritic) changes of either hip, despite the patient's age of 59 years. Some cases of TOH report diffuse osteopenia of the femoral head and neck, however , this finding may not be detected radiographically until up to eight weeks post-injury.1-5 Our patient underwent radiographic examination within four weeks of the onset of acute hip pain, perhaps explain - ing the absence of osteopenia on his images. MR imaging findings of bone marrow edema are the diagnostic hallmark of TOH - low signal intensity of bone marrow on T1-weighted images and high signal on STIR and fat saturate d T2-weighted , fluid sensitive sequences.3 Hip joint ef fusion (seen in this study) is a consistent find - ing in many cases of TOH.1,3,5 Although not present in the current case, another finding frequently associated with T OH is a subchondral stress fracture.3,4 The absence of subchondral stress fractures in some cases may suggest that TOH is a cause rather than a consequence of such fractures. T OH often presents clinically in a pattern similar to early stage osteonecrosis.1,3,7 Osteonecrosis is an irrevers- ible condition that can be categorized as primary or secondary. 3 Secondary osteonecrosis is caused by an is- chemic lesion and is associated with trauma, alcoholism, corticosteroid use, and hematological disorders. Primary (or spontaneous) osteonecrosis is idiopathic and there-fore not associated with the aforementioned risk factors. 3 Early osteonecrosis of the femoral head will display the radiographic signs of subchondral sclerosis of the rim of the femoral head which is known as the crescent or half-moon sign. 3,9 MR imaging of early osteonecrosis typically reveals a low signal intensity serpentine band surround-ing a normal appearing epiphyseal area on T1 weighted images; while advanced cases reveal epiphyseal collapse, subchrondral fractures, and subchondral cysts. 9 T OH spontaneously resolves within a four to nine month period with conservative treatment which focus-es on hip sparing activities and postures which decrease loading on the hip joint. 4 Surgical decompression is oc- casionally performed to shorten the healing period but is unnecessary. 3 Ringe et al10 found that administering an intravenous dose (four mg initial dose with an optional second two mg dose at three months) of ibandronate, a potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, decreased visual analogue pain scales by an average of 94.3% with a decrease of at least 75% in all patients (N=12). Further - more, the bone mineral density between the affected and unaffected femoral neck regions (N=7) decreased from 10.1 to 2.6% at the six month follow-up. T OH does not result in osteoarthritic changes to the bone or joint1 and does not progress to osteonecrosis3. It is therefore impera- tive that TOH be differentiated from osteonecrosis in the early stages as the prognosis and treatment of these two conditions differs substantially (refer to Table 2 for dif-ferential diagnoses). 1 The most common treatment options for osteonecro - sis are rotational osteotomy, core decompression, and the patient's age, etiology, stage of osteonecro- sis, size, and location of the necrotic lesion. Conserva-tive treatment (e.g. partial weight bearing) of early stage osteonecrosis has been proven inef fective in 80 to 90% patie nts.11 Osteotomies attempt to realign the femoral articulating surface to reduce the weight-bearing zone of the necrotic area. Hasegawa et al 12 reported five and ten year transtrochanteric rotational osteotomy survival rates without failure as 71% and 61%, respectively . Core decompression is an alternative treatment option that is one of the least invasive surgical procedures to manage osteonecrosis. Malizos et al 11 reported further surgical intervention was necessary in 16%, 37%, and 71% after core decompression of osteonecrosis stages I, II, and III, respectively. Decompression procedures have higher suc-cess rates with segmental lesions prior to articular col-lapse. Free vascularized fibular grafting is a procedure that has a survival of 61%-96% at mid-term (4-7 years) follow-up.13 Yoo et al13 followed 110 patients (124 hips) who underwent vascularized fibular grafting for a min - imum of 10 years. The average Harris hip score improved from 72 to 88 while 13 patients (13 hips) failed treatment and had to undergo total hip arthroplasty. The ultimate purpose of osteotomies, decompression procedures, and grafts is to prevent or delay total hip arthroplasty. 10 ConclusionTOH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of middle-aged males presenting with acute hip pain, limp-ing gait, and limited ranges of hip motion. Early radio-graphic findings of T OH are usually unremarkable, but may show dif fuse osteopenia of the femoral head and neck beyond six to eight weeks post-onset of pain.

Wong1, BSc, DC, FCCS(C) Brad Muir2, HBSc after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery are rare. To our knowledge, this case documents the first insufficiency fracture of the tibial plateau after ACL reconstruction, which presented three weeks after the procedure. A 25-year-old female recreational soccer player suffered an insufficiency fracture of the tibial plateau, extending 1.5 mm into the anterior wall of tibial tunnel and medial compartment under the anterior horn of medial meniscus, which presented as a diagnostic challenge. Clinically, the fracture mimicked a low-grade infection of the surgical site, while radiographically, the fracture resembled an avulsion fracture, later confirmed as a tibial tunnel fracture with computed tomography. With the ACL graft integrity not in jeopardy, four weeks of non-weightbearing and a delayed post-operative rehabilitation program was effective in allowing the fracture to heal. Good functional outcome was achieved after conservative management, with minimal loss of terminal knee extension and minimal pain at 22-month follow-up. key words: tibial plateau, fracture, ACL reconstruction, complication, conservative management 1 Graduate Student, Clinical Sciences, Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 2 Assistant Professor , Division of Undergraduate Studies, Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Corresponding author: Jessica J.

The incidence of ACL injury ranges from 0.06-3.7 per 1000 hours of training and par - ticipation in soccer, and accounts for thousands of ACL tears annually. 1,2 Female soccer players have up to 6-times greater risk of an ACL tear than male counterparts.3 In light of this, between 50,000 and 100,000 ACL recon-structive surgeries are performed annually in the United States 4, while the rate of revision ACL reconstruction in Denmark is 4.1% after five years5. Post-surgical compli - cations after ACL reconstruction vary widely and include stiffness, wound complications, infection, graft failure, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, osteone-crosis and peri-articular fracture. 6-8 Peri-articular fractures involving the tibia plateau are rare, as only a few case reports describe this specific complication.9-19 Post-sur gical complications related to ACL recon-struction have important clinical implications. In a retro-spective hospital database review from 1997-2006, it was found that of 70,547 ACL reconstructive surgeries per - formed, 6.5% of cases had subsequent sur gery on either knee within one year .5 Predictors of subsequent knee sur - gery included female gender, concomitant knee surgery, and operation by lower-volume surgeons, while predict - ors of subsequent ACL reconstruction included age of less than 40 years, concomitant meniscectomy or other knee surgery, and surgery in lower-volume hospitals. 5 This suggests that while ACL reconstruction is a relatively safe procedure, there remains a noted risk of subsequent oper - ation on either knee, which is increased by a number of predictors, including those who are younger and female. It is therefore important to conduct timely assessment of those presenting with knee complaints after ACL recon-struction surgery to facilitate appropriate management, in aims to minimize the need for subsequent operation. To our best knowledge, this case report details the first published case of an insufficiency fracture of the tibial plateau presenting three weeks after ACL reconstructive surgery. It was a diagnostic challenge, as its clinical pres-entation mimicked that of an infection or septic arthritis, but appropriate and timely imaging and investigative pro-cedures detected the fracture. The early detection may have also mitigated its severity and allowed for uncompli - cated non-invasive management of the fracture. Discus-sion will surround the incidence, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, imaging and management of this post-sur - gical complication. Case Report A 25 year-old female recreational soccer player sustained a left knee injury while playing soccer. During the game, she received an impact from another player to the medial aspect of her knee as her foot was planted, taking a varus force to the left knee. There was no audible pop or click during this injury, though she was unable to weightbear immediately after and had to use crutches to ambulate. She also reported noticeable swelling at the left knee. The patient did not report any previous injuries to this knee and did not experience any numbness or tingling into the lower extremity. She was otherwise healthy with no known medical conditions. Past medical history was re-markable for a wrist fracture fifteen years ago and a frac - ture of the right lateral malleolus ten years ago. She was taking oral contraceptive pills and doxycycline for acne, was a social drinker and did not smoke. The patient immediately followed RICE principles and went to a chiropractic clinic two days after the injury for an assessment. Based on history and physical examination findings, the initial diagnosis was a left lateral collateral ligament (LCL) sprain with a suspected lateral meniscal tear and the patient was referred to a family physician for an MRI. The subsequent MRI found a full thickness ACL tear and suspected partial LCL tear in the left knee and the patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon for consul-tation. Prior to the surgical consultation, the patient was treated with tolerable rehabilitation exercises and laser therapy at the chiropractic clinic twice a week for four weeks in aims to minimize muscle atrophy. At her sur gical consultation four weeks later, the pa- tient was able to ambulate with a cane, but experienced recurrent mild dull pain at the anteromedial knee and epi-sodes of instability when the left knee was in extension. Physical examination by the orthopedic surgeon revealed no swelling or effusion within the knee and no tenderness along the joint line. Left knee range of motion was pas-sively full, but mildly lacked terminal flexion with active motion and lacked 5 degrees of genu recurvatum when compared to the right knee. It was difficult to perform ligamentous testing due to patient apprehension, though varus and valgus stability appeared intact. There was a J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) 125JJ Wong, B Muir grade 1 positive Lachman test and a grade 1 positive pivot shift test with soft end feel. Anterior drawer test, dial test-ing, examination of other ligaments and lower limb neuro-vascular examination were unremarkable. While clinical examination did not show prominent laxity, the patient's left knee ACL deficiency was deemed symptomatic and confirmed on MRI. Due to the patient' s desire to return to sport and her good candidacy for ACL reconstruction using a hamstring autograft, surgery was agreed upon. Af-ter ACL reconstruction, the patient had an uncomplicated recovery, and was discharged home by the orthopedic sur - geon with pain medication, rehabilitation protocol and a follow-up appointment in 3-5 weeks' time. At three weeks post-surgery, the patient began experi - encing tenderness at the surgical site, with redness, swell-ing, warmth and decreased knee range of motion due to pain. There was no preceding trauma, and the patient had not yet returned to sport. She was also closely adhering to her rehabilitation protocol of daily open chain range of motion and light strengthening exercises of the knee with-in pain tolerance. At the chiropractic clinic, knee radio-graphs were ordered, which found moderate joint effu-sion and soft tissue swelling at the medial joint space, and suggestion of cortical offset at the medial tibial epiphysis (Figures 1a and 1b). Upon further review , these radiographs showed a small FIGURE 1a. AP Knee View Significant soft tissue swelling is observed at the medial aspect of the left knee, near the pes anserine attachment. There is evidence of ACL reconstruction with a tibial tun-nel (triangle) at the medial tibial plateau and a ligament anchor (Endobutton device) at the lateral femoral condyle (arrowhead). A cortical offset at the medial tibial epiphy - sis is suggested at the entrance of the tunnel (arrow). FIGURE 1b: Lateral Oblique Knee View Moderate joint effusion is detected in the left knee with fullness of the suprapatellar recess and blurring of the posterior portion of the Hoffa' s fat pad. A cortical defect at the proximal tibia (arrow), the tibial tunnel (triangle), and a ligament anchor (Endobutton device) at the lateral femoral condyle are noted (arrowhead).126 Can Chiropr Assoc of plateau after anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery triangular shaped fracture fragment well marginated pos- teriorly and laterally by an oblique lucent line traversing the anteromedial aspect of the tibial plateau. This resulted in the cortical offset noted at the articular surface of the medial tibial plateau. The oblique lucent line is just super - omedial to the tibial tunnel created by the orthopaedic surgeon to fix the reconstructed ACL. Due to the amount of soft tissue swelling and joint ef- fusion noted in radiographs, possible low-grade infection or septic arthritis could not be ruled out at the time, so she was sent to the emergency department for blood tests, which were unremarkable. A follow-up appointment with the orthopedic surgeon was advised. At her follow-up appointment with the orthopedic surgeon five weeks post-sur gery, the patient continued to report pain and persistent warmth around the surgical site. On examination, the patient walked with slightly flexed knee gait, though passively she could extend her knee fully and flex to within 10 degrees of the other side. While she had a moderate-sized effusion at the left knee, her wounds were well healed and she was afebrile. Her quadriceps femoris were contracting but moderately in-hibited, and there was noted tenderness proximal to the tibial wound. Lachman test and pivot shift of her left knee were negative. Computed tomography (CT) of her left knee revealed a 1.5 mm cortical defect into the anterior portion of the medial compartment, underneath the anterior horn of the medial meniscus, with mild joint effusion present (Fig-ures 2a and 2b). The CT images, read by a medical radiol - ogist, confirmed the presence of a subacute, undisplaced intra-articular fracture involving the anteromedial corner FIGURE 2a: CT Knee - Sagittal Slice A cortical defect is noted at the anterior portion of the medial compartment, underneath the anterior horn of the medial meniscus, confirming the presence of an intra-articular fracture (arrow). Mild joint effusion is present. FIGURE 2b: CT Knee - Axial Slice The cortical defect is shown extending into the tibial tun-nel by 1.5 mm without displacement tibial plateau and extending into the tibial tunnel by 1.5 mm. Joint effusion was also noted and the ACL graft was intact. W ith the ACL graft integrity intact, non-weightbearing for four weeks with use of crutches, with a delay in the rehabilitation protocol, was prescribed to see if the frac-ture would heal. A follow-up appointment was given in four weeks' time. At follow-up, physical examination of her left knee found no swelling or pain on palpation, with only minimal loss of terminal knee extension. A repeat CT scan of the left knee revealed that the tibial plateau fracture was healed, and the patient was allowed to re-sume her rehabilitation protocol. At 13 months post-sur gical follow-up, the patient re- ported minimal pain of 1/10 intensity localized to the fracture site at the medial-anterior tibial. On palpation, a small bony abnormality is noted at the fracture site. Full knee range of motion was noted, with the exception of a 5 degree loss of genu recurvatum with the injured knee. The orthopaedic surgeon suspected that the surgical screw was slightly protruding from the tibial tunnel and leading to the residual pain. A lidocaine injection into the medial joint line of the knee was effective in eliminating the pain temporarily. At this point, the patient opted to tolerate the minor degree of pain without pursuing further interven - tions, and was able to return to certain sports (volleyball and basketball) on a regular basis. At 22 months post-sur gical follow-up, the minimal pain of 1/10 intensity at the fracture site remained, with aggravation of pain only after prolonged sitting (2 hours or more), or long distance running (5 km or more), where the intensity would increase to 3/10. The patient deemed this pain tolerable and continued with her recreational sports without difficulty. Discussion Incidence: Tibial plateau fracture presenting as a complication fol-lowing ACL reconstruction surgery is rare, with only ten English-language case reports documenting this oc-currence. 9-18 Thietje et al described a tibial fracture after ACL reconstruction surgery, but as the article was writ-ten in German, details could not be obtained. 19 Although rare, it is important to be aware of this post-operative complication, as most cases required sur gical fixation of the fracture.10-12,15,16 This warrants an in-depth under - standing of the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of this post-surgical complication to aid in recognition and management. Pathogenesis: Although its pathogenesis is not completely understood, there are contributing factors that predominantly relate to bone strength, tibial tunnel and graft harvest site. It has been proposed that in young healthy individuals with ACL reconstruction, the loss of trabecular cancellous bone is greater than cortical bone loss after the operative procedure. Even though trabecular cancellous bone con-stitutes only 20% of bone mass, there is a decreased tran - sosseous bone strength as a result of the normal surgical procedure. 20-22 While there are no studies that specifically measure bone strength of the tibia following graft harvest or tibial tunnel drilling, biomechanical studies have found that bone defects, such as screw holes, can concentrate stress and decrease bone strength to torsional loading. 23,24 For instance, diaphyseal drill holes with a diameter great - er than 20% of the bone have been shown to reduce bone strength by 55-90%.23,25-27 This can be further complicated by additional factors. Authors have also suggested that other biomechanical factors, such as motion of the graft within the tunnel and fixation metho ds/devices, and biological factors, such as graft swelling and use of allograft tissue, may also con- tribute to tunnel enlargement.28,29 Further, with patel - lar tendon grafts, authors suggest that the tibial harvest site, combined with the tibial tunnel, may synergistic - ally act as stress-risers to reduce proximal tibial bone strength. 9-11,14 In four of the cases of tibial fractures after ACL reconstruction, the patellar tendon autografts were involved. 9-11,14,16,18 In our case, the patient suffered a tibial plateau fracture with a gracilis-semitendonosis autograft, which was similar to two other cases found in the litera - ture. 13,15 This may suggest that the tibial tunnel plays a larger role as a stress-riser when compared to the harvest graft site. Clinical Presentation: The details of previous relevant case reports on tibial pla-teau fractures after ACL reconstruction are outlined in Table 1. Cases had an age range of 20-61 years, with 4 cases involving females and 8 cases in males. Most cases 128 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Insufficiency fracture of the tibial ligament reconstructive surgery used patellar tendon autograft9,11,14,16,18, with two autograft13,15, one case using double strand semitendonosis graft17 and using a freeze-dried graft harvest/donor site14,16. The described by Polyzois et al had femoral and tibial fractures in the opposite direction of the ACL femoral and tibial tunnels, but it should be noted that the injury was preceded by high ener gy trauma from a road traffic accident, with the patient suffering multiple fractures.15 All cases presented with knee pain and a degree of swelling, and were preced-ed by some form of trauma, namely falls or motor vehicle accidents. One case was preceded by minimal trauma of running backwards during soccer, though it cannot be de-termined whether the onset of fracture occurred before or after the minimal trauma. 17 Three cases involved patients who could not weightbear after the incident.11,14,18 In our case, the patient also presented with pain and swelling, though there was no preceding trauma. To our best knowledge, this is the first published insufficiency fracture of the tibial plateau after ACL reconstruction Table 1: Published Case Reports on Tibial Plateau Fractures after ACL Reconstruction Author(s), YearAge, gender, type of fracture, fracture extending into tibial tunnel, allograftPain, swelling after road traffic accident, 18 monthsCT Open reduction and internal fixation of fracture, full recovery at 7 months Moen et al., 1998 1429 year-old female, tibial fracture at graft harvest site, patellar tendonPain, swelling, inability to weightbear after minor fall, 6 weeksX-rays Protected weightbearing with cast and crutches, outcome not reported Morgan and Steensen, 1998 930 year-old male, minimally displaced tibial platearu fracture extending into tibial tunnel, patellar tendonPain, swelling after direct trauma from baseball bat, 7 monthsX-rays Non-weightbearing for 4 weeks, full recovery at 4 weeks Delcogliano et al., 2001 1027 year-old male, displaced tibial plateau fracture extending into tibial tunnel, patellar tendonPain, swelling after motorcycle accident, 7 monthsX-rays Open reduction and internal fixation of fracture, mild quadriceps weakness at 1 year , early knee degeneration at 2 years Mithofer et al., 2004 1161 year-old female, bicondylar tibial plateau fracture extending patellar tendonPain, swelling, inability to weightbear, crepitation after falling down stairs, 7 monthsX-rays and CTMinimally invasive surgical fixation, mild decrease in motion at 3 months Sundaram et al., 2005 1340 year-old female, undisplaced tibial plateau fracture extending into tibial tunnel, gracilis-semitendonosisPain, swelling, hemarthrosis after falling onto knee when walking, 12 monthsMRI (not detected with x-rays)6-week non-weightbearing cast and 6-week weightbearing knee brace, mild decrease in motion at 3 months Thaunat et al., 2006 1824 year-old male, fracture at tibial site, patellar non-weightbearing cast and 2-week weightbearing knee brace, full recovery at 7 months V oos et al., 2007 1643 year-old female, oblique metaphyseal tibial fracture extending into donor site, patellar tendonPain, swelling after falling while jogging on treadmill, 4 yearsX-rays and CTOpen reduction and internal fixation of fracture, full recovery at 12 months Polyzois et al., 2009 1543 year-old male, distal femoral and tibial plateau fracture, gracilis-semitendinosisPain, swelling after road traffic accident, 2 weeksX-rays Open reduction and internal fixation of fracture, full recovery at 12 months Gobbi et al., 201 11741 year-old male, tibial plateau fracture involving medial condyle and extending into tibial tunnel, semitendinosisPain, swelling, giving way after running backwards in soccer game, 4.5 yearsX-rays and CTOpen reduction and internal fixation of fracture, full recovery at 12 monthsJ Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) 129JJ Wong, B Muir surgery, presenting only three weeks after the surgical procedure. Other authors have noted that it is import - ant to rule out more sinister causes of swelling, includ-ing wound complications 8 and septic arthritis30,31. In a prospective consecutive cohort of subjects with primary ACL reconstruction in England from 2008-2010, it was found that a small percentage subsequently suffered from symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (0.30%), pulmon - ary thromboembolism (0.18%) or wound complication (0.75%).8 Our patient was sent to the emergency depart- ment by the chiropractor to undergo blood tests and in-vestigate the possibility of an infection or septic arthritis. This suggests that pain at the surgical site with persistent swelling should heighten the clinician's suspicion for a post-surgical complication, such as septic arthritis or peri-articular fracture, regardless of whether there was preced - ing trauma. Imaging: A brief review of the ACL reconstruction surgery is war - ranted to further understand the imaging findings on radiographs and advanced imaging. One of the primary ACL reconstruction procedures is the autologous doubled semitendinosis and gracilis tendon graft (also known as four-strand hamstring graft). This procedure involves a femoral tunnel positioned at the lateral femoral condyle and a tibial tunnel positioned through the medial tibial pla-teau. Various methods are used to secure the graft within the tunnels until bony union occurs, including interfer - ence screws and the distal femoral Endobutton device. 32 Some of the previous case reports describing tibial pla- teau fractures were detected on knee radiographs10,11,14-17 though other cases used solely computed tomography12,18. In cases where the fracture was found on CT, it was not re-ported whether knee radiographs had initially detected the fracture. Sundaram et al noted that their subject's undis-placed tibial plateau fracture was not detected with knee AP or lateral oblique radiographs and was only found on subsequent MRI. 13 Thus, it was recommended that all acutely painful and swollen knees from trauma, following ACL reconstruction, should undergo an MRI when knee radiographs are read as normal. 13 MRI has been shown to be a sensitive instrument to exclude occult fractures not detected on plain radiographs. 33,34 In our case, while the initial radiographs detected a cortical defect at the medial tibial plateau, CT was required to determine the precise location and extent of the fracture. This supports the role of advanced imaging in cases where post-surgical fracture is suspected based on clinical presentation. Management: Treatment of tibial plateau fractures after ACL recon-struction has been variable. In previous reports, five cases were sur gically managed with open reduction and inter nal fixation10,12,15-17, one case was surgically managed with minimally invasive surgical fixation 11, and four cases were managed with 4-6 weeks of non-weightbearing9,13,14,18. The surgical cases tended to be associated with moderate-to-high degrees of trauma and more severe fractures, such as displaced fractures. Mith-ofer et al successfully used minimally-invasive fracture fixation of an intra-articular tibial plateau fracture, which involved the use of indirect fracture reduction and new plate designs, and no ACL revision was necessary.11 The distinct charac teristic of our case is the early and insuffi - ciency fracture onset. In all previous cases, the subjects were examined in a tertiary care setting, underscoring the importance of referring suspected cases of peri-articular fractures after ACL reconstruction to orthopedic special - ists by primary contact providers. In our patient' s case, early detection of this fracture may have minimized the need for invasive treatment. The patient had pain and swelling only three weeks after her ACL reconstruction, and was assessed at a chiropractic clinic. Prompt investigations ordered by the chiropractor included knee radiographs, which detected a possible in-fection or septic arthritis, and facilitated an immediate re-ferral to the emergency department. Delayed assessment and diagnosis of the tibial plateau fracture may have led to further progression of the fracture and possible indi-cation for more invasive management, such as surgical fixation of the fracture or ACL revision if the graft was in jeopardy . An appropriate index of suspicion for post-sur - gical complications is important, particularly in primary care providers focused on post-surgical rehabilitation. For instance, a recent case report describes active post-operative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation combined with soft tissue therapy in a chiropractic clinic that facili-tated successful recovery and return to function. 35 Authors emphasized the need to be up-to-date on the most recent evidence in post-surgical ACL rehabilitation, including early active exercise. 35,36 As highlighted in our patient's 130 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Insufficiency fracture of the tibial plateau after anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery case, effective management of post-surgical rehabilita - tion should not only include evidence-based rehabilita - tion protocols, but should also include an understanding of potential post-surgical complications, including tibial plateau fractures. This facilitates detection and appropri-ate management in both orthopedic surgeons and primary care providers, including chiropractors. Summary: This case report described the occurrence of a tibial pla-teau fracture presenting three weeks after ACL recon-struction, without any preceding trauma. Discussion sur - rounded the role of bony defects caused by transosseous tibial tunnels from ACL reconstruction that may have contributed to the post-operative tibial plateau fracture. In this case, early detection allowed for conservative man-agement in the form of four weeks of non-weightbearing and delayed rehabilitation protocol to allow the fracture to heal, avoiding the need for sur gical fixation of the fracture. This suggests that all acutely painful knees with persistent swelling, whether preceded by trauma or not, should be carefully investigated by both primary care and tertiary care providers to determine the underlying pathol - ogy and rule out peri-articular fractures.

The objective of this study was to determine the therapeutic interventions that chiropractors who are members of the Ontario Chiropractic Association in the Greater Toronto Area most commonly provide to pregnant patients. Methods: An introductory e-mail was sent in October 2011 to 755 members of the Ontario Chiropractic Association within the Greater Toronto Area five days prior to a 15 question survey being distributed via e-mail. Reminder e-mails were sent 13 days and 27 days later. Using descriptive statistics, demographic information was reported along with reported use of different treatments and recommendations for pregnant patients Results: A response rate of 23% was obtained. The majority of the respondents (90%) reported using the Diversified technique on pregnant patients, followed by soft tissue therapy (62%) and Activator (42%). The most common adjunctive therapy recommended to pregnant patients was referral to massage therapy (90%). Most of the respondents (92%) indicated that they prescribe stretching exercises to pregnant patients and recommend a multivitamin (84%) or folic acid (81%) to pregnant patients. *Division of Graduate Education & Research, Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College Corresponding author and contact information: Kent Stuber BSc, DC, MSc, Alberta, T3H 5P2; kstuber@cmcc.ca, 403-685-5252.The authors declare that there are no disclaimers or declarations to be made in the preparation of this manuscript.

Previous studies have indicated that both patients and chiropractors report safe and suc-cessful treatment of pregnancy related back pain through chiropractic treatment. 5-9 W ith only a small spectrum of drugs considered safe to use during pregnancy 10, alternative therapies that have a history of safety and effectiveness for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain may be sought out by this popula-tion. Chiropractic manual therapy, exercise, massage and techniques of local anesthesia such as Lidocaine 11 are all alternative treatments that can be sought out by pregnant women. While there is limited evidence to support spinal manipulation and mobilization for the chiropractic care of pregnant patients, there continues to be pregnant women who seek out chiropractic care for treatment of various pregnancy related complaints including, but not limited to, back pain, posterior pelvic pain, costovertebral injur - ies, carpal tunnel syndrome, lower extremity pain, and headaches. 12 Chiropractors may employ a variety of dif ferent treat - ment technique systems when treating non-pregnant patients. A survey regarding technique systems used by post-1980 graduates of the Canadian Memorial Chiro-practic College (CMCC) by Mykietiuk et al 13, revealed that the technique systems most commonly used in pri-vate practice in Ontario were Diversified T echnique, fol - lowed by Activator\u00ae, Thompson, and Active Release Techniques\u00ae. The objectiv e of this study was to determine the most commonly used treatments that chiropractors in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) provide to their pregnant patients. It is possible that the treatments provided to pregnant patients may be different from those offered to the non-pregnant population when accounting for their unique biomechanical, nutritional, and hormonal con-siderations. The resulting information may be useful for clinicians and chiropractic students who may benefit from learning which treatments and therapies are most com- monly employed on pregnant patients by their colleagues and then follow the principles and process of evidence based practice to investigate their potential value for their 134 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Therapeutic interventions employed by Greater Toronto Area chiropractors on pregnant patients pregnant patients. The information will also be of value to researchers in planning further research on chiroprac - tic treatment of pregnant patients as the most commonly used treatment s should likely be among the first and most investigated. MethodsSubjects Ethics approval was provided by the CMCC Research Ethics Board (project number 1 11013). The participants were selected from the 2009 Canadian Chiropractic As-sociation (CCA) digital database as this was the last publicly available CD-ROM based directory. The partici - pants in this study were chiropractors located in the GTA (consisting of the Halton Region, Peel Region, York Re-gion, City of Toronto and Durham Region) and who were members of the Ontario Chiropractic Association (OCA). The GTA was selected as previous surveys have used this population 14 and OCA members were used as this is the largest professional group representing chiropractors in Ontario. There were no limits on type of practice or tech - niques employed, but the inclusion criteria consisted of actively practicing OCA members in the GTA who see pregnant patients in their practices. Subjects were ex-cluded if they no longer practiced in the GTA or did not see pregnant patients. No compensation was provided for completing the survey. As this was a descriptive survey, there was no allocation to different groups in this study. Participant identities were kept confidential, only visible to study team members and the CMCC Office of Research Administration and response items were reported in ag- gregate form. Pilot Study Prior to distribution of the survey to all eligible chiroprac - tors in the GTA, a brief pilot study was conducted. An initial draft of the survey was completed confidentially by ten clinicians at the CMCC campus clinic in Toronto. This allowed for identification of any problem areas such as unclear , ambiguous, or lengthy questions and allowed for determination of the amount of time for survey comple - tion. Feedback from the pilot study was provided from each individual clinician, and guided necessary changes before distribution of the survey itself. The results from the pilot study group were not reported.SurveyThe survey is available from the corresponding author upon request and consisted of 15 multiple-choice style questions developed by the authors to identify the pro-portion of responding chiropractors who utilize the treat - ments of interest on pregnant patients. Face validity was assessed continuously through the development and pi-lot study periods by the authors and the final survey was deemed to have face validity. Items included questions eliciting demographic information and specific questions regarding chiropractic techniques and other treatments employed when seeing pregnant patients. The survey was administered by e-mail using the e-mail address provided in the 2009 CCA digital database. Survey Distribution Prior to the commencement of the survey in October 2011, a preliminary e-mail was sent to the selected chiropractors to notify them of the study. The survey was then distrib-uted five days later . The survey e-mail message consisted of a study information and informed consent sheet. Those who agreed to participate were required to click on an \"I Agree\" button which linked them securely to the survey via the CMCC Survey Monkey TM account. Thirteen days following the survey launch, a reminder e-mail was sent to the chiropractors who did not complete the survey. An additional reminder was sent 14 days following the first reminder (27 days following the initial distribution). Thus there were a total of four possible contacts distributed (in-cluding the pre-notification message) in order to increase the response rate. Participants were given the opportunity to receive the results of this study once it was completed by indicating interest at the end of the survey and provid-ing their e-mail address. Data Analysis Aggregated survey responses were provided to the auth-ors from CMCC's Survey Monkey TM account by CMCC's Office of Research Administration in the form of a Micro - soft Excel spreadsheet. The data was printed and stored in a secure filing cabinet by one of the authors (KJS). De - scriptive statistics were used to analyze this cross-section-al survey using Microsoft Excel. Results E-mail messages were sent to 755 e-mail addresses of J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) Capelletti, K Stuber chiropractors in the Greater Toronto Area. Of these, 125 of the e-mail messages were returned as undeliverable due to change of clinic e-mail addresses or addresses which no longer existed. As such, 630 e-mail addresses were sent successfully and 143 respondents gave consent to fill out the online survey . Therefore, the adjusted response rate was calculated as 22.7%. However , there were not neces - sarily 143 responses to each of the questions on the sur - vey as some of the respondents did not complete all of the questions. The questions with the lowest response rates were those pertaining to further training (28 responses, 115 missing a response) and nutritional supplement rec-ommendations (70 responses and 73 missing a response).

DiscussionTo our knowledge this is the first study to investigate which techniques and treatments are used most com- monly by chiropractors specifically when treating preg - nant patients. Previously, a survey of a small group of chiropractors conducted by Stuber 7 found that most of the respondents used spinal manipulative therapy, soft tis-sue therapy, exercise therapies and patient education on pregnant patients with back and/or neck pain, headaches, or benign vertigo. However, the extent to which differ - ent techniques and therapies are actually being utilized on that particular population by chiropractors was not re-ported. Chiropractic Technique Usage The majority of chiropractors from the current survey indicated using Diversified technique when treating preg -138 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Therapeutic interventions employed by Greater Toronto Area chiropractors on pregnant patients nant patients. This is consistent with the findings of a pre - vious survey of Canadian chiropractors by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners15 who indicated that 87.3% of thei r respondents primarily used Diversified technique to treat their patients, albeit without dividing their patient populations into different subgroups such as pregnant patients. The majority of the respondents in the current survey were educated at the CMCC where Diversified tec hnique is taught exclusively . However , ac - cording to the 2005 Job Analysis of Chiropractic in the United States, 96.5% of responding chiropractors use the Diversified tec hnique and 71.5% of patients were treated with this technique, regardless of belonging to any par - ticular subgroups, such as pregnancy .2 The second most popular technique reported by chiro-practors in this survey when treating pregnant patients was soft tissue therapies (STT) such as Active Release Technique\u00ae (ART\u00ae) and Myofascial Release Technique (MRT), followed by use of the Activator\u00ae. These find - ings are in line with those of Mykietiuk et al13 who found that 24% of their Canadian respondents utilized soft tis - sue therapies, while 15% used the Activator on their gen - eral patient populations. Thus from the current survey it would appear that a larger proportion of chiropractors re-ported using Activator and/or STT on pregnant patients, although this could represent an increase in the use of these techniques across patient groups. Exercise Prescription Nearly all of the respondents indicated prescribing exer - cises to their pregnant patients and this appears to follow an evidence-based perspective, and is similar to exercise utilization rates by chiropractors previously reported by the NBCE. 2 As stated by Fast et al16, during pregnancy physical activity may prevent or manage chronic condi-tions such as hypertension, obesity, gestational diabetes, dyspnea and pre-eclampsia. Regular physical activity may help women meet gestational weight gain targets and thus positively influence maternal-fetal outcomes, as well as improving well-being and quality of life.17 Approximately two-thirds of our respondents reported prescribing strengthening exercises to their pregnant pa-tients. Although it was not specified for which areas of the body respondents were prescribing these strengthening exercises, while roughly three out of five respondents indi - cated prescribing core stabilization exercises. Borrgren1 has suggested that targeting the transversus abdominis muscle specifically during pregnancy to potentially pre - vent some of the postural alterations in the third trimester, therefore potentially reducing the amount of pain experi-enced. The PARmed-X for Pregnancy from the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology also supports exercises of the abdomen as being important during pregnancy to promote good posture and prevent low back pain, prevent diastasis recti and strengthen the muscles of labour. 18 The PARmed-X also suggests strengthening exercises for the upper and lower back to promote good posture. The but-tocks and lower limbs should be strengthened to facilitate weight bearing and prevent varicose veins. It also advo-cates Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and prevent incontinence. Stretches, proprioceptive/balance exercises, and cardiovascular activity were also report-edly prescribed by respondents to their pregnant patients. The Parmed-X suggests warm up and cool down exer - cises be done and should include range of motion exer - cises for all major joints and static stretching for all major muscle groups. Regarding cardiovascular activity while pregnant, some alterations must be made as a result of reduced maximal heart rate reserve during gestation and modified tar get heart rate zones are provided in the P AR- med-X for Pregnancy Guidelines. In a study by Wolfe and Weissgerber 19 it was recommended that pregnant women engage in aerobic exercise regularly for at least 15 min-utes, three days per week at the target intensity. Exercise frequency can be increased to four to five days per week and the duration can be increased to 25 to 30 minutes per session at the target intensity to increase maternal physic-al fitness. T o illustrate the need for pregnant women to avoid exercisin g too frequently or infrequently, the study by Campbell and Matola20 indicated that women who par - ticipate in structured exercise five or more times per week have an increased chance of delivering a low birth weight infant compared with women who exercised three or four times per week. Women who exercised two days or less per week were also at increased risk for low birth weight. In a recent study by Stafne et al21 it was found that preg- nant women who adhered to a prescribed exercise proto-col (consisting of moderate intensity exercise of 45 to 60 minutes in duration, three days per week) tended to have lower weight, had a lower BMI, and reported less evening pain when compared with control women. While the two groups in that study were similar in terms of lumbopelvic J Can Chiropr Assoc L Capelletti, K Stuber pain prevalence, the women who adhered to the exercise protocol had less disability compared to the women in the control group, taking less time for sick leave due to lum-bopelvic pain. Dietary and Nutritional Supplement RecommendationRequirements for many, but not all, micronutrients in-crease during pregnancy. 22 Chiropractors frequently pro- vide nutritional and dietary recommendations to patients.2 As a component of prenatal care micronutrient supplemen - tation may reduce maternal morbidity and mortality dir - ectly by treating a pregnancy-related illness, or indirectly by lowering the risk of complications at delivery. Never - theless, the effectiveness of supplementation programs, notably of iron and folate, has tended to focus on infant outcomes, perinatal mortality, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. 23 In the current survey multivitamins and folic acid were the most commonly recommended nutri-tional supplements to pregnant patients by respondents. This high percentage of respondents prescribing folic acid is in line with recommendations by the World Health Or - ganization. 24 The WHO states that folate dietary allow- ances during pregnancy increase substantially , by 147%. This increase is necessary in order to build or maintain maternal stores and to meet the needs of rapidly growing maternal and fetal tissues. 24 The administration of folic acid in the periconceptional period reduces the number of births with neural tube defects by 75%25; thus, folic acid administration is recommended as standard prenatal care by the International Nutritional Anemia Consultative Group. The maximum dosage for folate is 1000 \u00b5g/d. 23 V itamin E and Vitamin A were each recommended to pregnant patients by approximately one in seven of this survey's respondents. The Food and Agriculture Organ-ization/WHO recommended that the daily allowance for vitamin A be 20% higher for pregnant women than for non-pregnant, non-lactating women because of the exten - sive cell proliferation and development of the fetus.26 One explanation for Vitamin E being prescribed less than other vitamins and supplements could be due to discrepancies in the literature. According to Ladipo 22 Vitamin E supple- mentation is not needed in pregnancy because most diets containing plant oils, fruit, and vegetables should provide an adequate supply of Vitamin E, and pregnancy adds no further Vitamin E requirements or needs. Conversely, the National Research Council 26 stated that Vitamin E is needed for fetal growth and they recommended that Vita - min E intake increase by 25% in pregnancy. Additional nutritional supplement recommendations reportedly made by chiropractors to their pregnant pa-tients in this survey, albeit at much lower rates, included eicosanoids (EEA's), combination fetal development and clearing remedies, Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, probiotics, vitamin B-50 complex, pre-natal magnesium, vitami n B, and bioflavonoids. Re - ferrals of pregnant patients to other health care profes-sionals were also indicated by respondents such referrals as to the patient's other primary health care provider, or to a naturopathic practitioner, nutritionist, or registered diet - itian for dietary advice. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization's recommendations, the dietary allowance of Vitamin D for pregnant women increases 300% to account for the calcium deposition and bone mineralization occurring in the fetus.27 Conversely, other sources, such as the Insti- tute of Medicine 28 have indicated that vitamin D supple- mentation is likely not necessary during pregnancy except perhaps in high-risk population groups, for example, in women whose clothing limits exposure to direct sunlight and in women who live in northern latitudes with few hours of daylight. They also note that vitamin D can be toxic to both the mother and fetus if given in large doses during pregnancy, although the intake at which this oc-curs is uncertain because inter-individual sensitivity to excessive intake varies. 27 They recommend women take smaller, daily doses compared to a few large doses to de-crease the risk of toxicity . V itamin B6 and B12 deficiency rarely occurs (other than in strict vegetarians) so the FAO/ WHO has not recommended additional requirements for pregnant women. 26 Adjunctive Treatment RecommendationsThe most common adjunctive treatment recommended to pregnant patients was massage therapy, followed by recommendations for orthotics and trochanteric belts. According to the 2005 NBCE Job Analysis of Chiroprac - tic, the rates of massage therapy utilization by respond-ing chiropractors were 84.9%, compared with 81.8% for orthotics.2 Additional recommended products included compression socks, kinesiotaping and pillows. Re-spondents also indicated referring their pregnant patients 140 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Therapeutic interventions employed by Greater Toronto Area chiropractors on pregnant patients to Traditional Chinese Medical (TCM) practitioners, nat- uropaths, nutritionists, or other chiropractic technique therapists at varying, albeit low, frequencies. Pregnant patients often present with a variety of conditions and the need for gynecological consultations, thus it is paramount that chiropractors and other health professionals work collaboratively. Post-Partum Chiropractic Treatment According to this survey , nearly 60% of respondents es - timated that at least 80% of their pregnant patients return for chiropractic care after delivery. Post-partum patients are still undergoing hormonal and anatomic changes to return to the pre-pregnancy stage. Postpartum health is under-addressed by researchers, clinicians, and women themselves as approximately 90% of women report at least one health problem soon after delivery.29 Conditions such as low back pain, urinary stress incontinence, fecal incontinence, urinary frequency, depression and anxiety, hemorrhoids, frequent headache and migraines cause dis-tress for new mothers. Up to one third of women have reported back pain lasting up to three months after child - birth. 30 Chiropractors can assist post-partum women with musculoskeletal dysfunction and educate new mothers regarding new physical and mental challenges in order to cope and manage appropriately. Limitations There were several limitations to this study. Surveys were only sent to chiropractors who were members of the OCA within the GTA, thus it is possible that the results are not representative of the wider population of chiropractors across the country , particularly as the majority (85%) of respondents were graduates of CMCC. This is higher than the actual percentage of Canadian chiropractors who are CMCC graduates, which has decreased over recent years due to an influx of graduates from chiropractic education - al institutions in the United States and internationally.13 Current data provided by the OCA indicated that 76% of their memb ers province-wide were CMCC graduates (personal communication with KJS September 18, 2012). The large percentage of respondents who were CMCC graduates may have been influenced by a lar ger propor - tion of CMCC graduates practicing in the GTA owing to CMCC's location in Toronto. It is thus possible that our results could be influenced by a potential association be -tween the educational institution where the majority of our respondents trained and their practice style. Further - more, 54% of our respondents graduated between 1997 and 201 1, compared with 60% of OCA members, while 46% of our respondents graduated either in or prior to 1996, compared with 37% of OCA members province- wide currently (personal communication with KJS Sep- tember 18, 2012). The low response rate of 22.7%, and the relatively small sample size could again lead to ques- tions as to whether or not the results may be representative of all Canadian chiropractors. Some technical difficulties were encountered when initially distributing the survey as well as the first reminder , which required two attempts when sending each e-mail message, and unfortunately that may have affected the response rates. We may have been able to increase the response rate by attempting a telephone call to those chiropractors whose e-mail messa-ges were returned as undeliverable; however due to time constraints we were unable to do so. Finally, our results were only presented descriptively; future research could look for bivariate and multivariable associations between particular demographic variables and different treatment-related variables. One strength of this study was that while the survey was only distributed to members of the OCA within the GTA, there was a good distribution of respondents across the GTA. In an attempt to improve response rates, this survey employed pre-notification, which Russell et al31 found to have a non-significant trend towards a higher response rate in previous surveys of chiropractors. Several e-mail mes - sages were distributed to recipients and the response rate for this survey was within ranges previously reported in the literature for previous surveys of chiropractors, albeit well below the mean of 54% reported by Russell et al31. Russell et al31 found a significant association between the number of mailings of a survey and response rate by chiro - practors, where surveys with fewer than three mailings had a significantly lower average response rate than those where three or more mailings were employed. We utilized four mailings (pre-notification, an initial mailing and two reminders) and of fered survey results to respondents, a technique that has also been found to increase response rates 32 and yet we still had a low response rate and this does potentially threaten the validity of our findings. One potential factor that may have been detrimental to our re - sponse rate was that this was an online study, which is a J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) Stuber convenient and cost-effective means of surveying poten- tial participants but can have lower response rates than paper based surveys. 32 Furthermore, it has been noted that health professionals are becoming increasingly resistant to completing surveys, with one reason being that some health professionals have simply instituted policies against completing surveys. 33 It has also been found that response rates tend to be higher in surveys that are personalized, have a deadline for completion, have some form of incen-tive, indicate that others have responded, or are not an-onymous, and applying these principles may have helped increase our response yield. 31,32 ConclusionsThis study represents the first known investigation into specific treatm ent usage by chiropractors on their preg - nant patients. The chiropractors who responded appear to employ many different treatment techniques and modal - ities on their pregnant patients, many at a frequency simi-lar to those reportedly used on non-pregnant patients. It is recommended that future studies employ a larger sample and include a larger population of chiropractors to obtain a representative sample of the profession and also inves-tigate the stages of pregnancy that different interventions are employed. Further research into the utilization, safety, and effectiveness of chiropractic care during the preg-nancy and post-partum periods is still necessary. References 1. Bor ggren CL.

Why are response Syndrome: positive response to spinal manipulation and adjunctive therapy - A case report Paul M. Gold, Brianna Albright** Back Syndrome (SBS) has been recognized for over 50 years. Not to be confused with flat back syndrome in the lumbar spine, SBS patients present with an obvious loss of the thoracic kyphosis accompanied by apparent heart symptoms. The main purpose of this article is to describe a patient diagnosed with SBS, whose symptoms were successfully managed using spinal manipulative therapy as well as ancillary modalities. The use of diagnostic and laboratory tests are essential to differentially diagnose cardiac disease from SBS. Genesis and incidence of this condition is also discussed as well as roentgenometric analysis. A suggested diagnostic algorithm is presented as well. key words: syndrome, straight back, thoracic, kyphosis, mitral valve * Private Practice / Instructor , Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, Toronto, ON, Department of Chiropractic Therapeutics, Division of Foundational and Professional Education ** Senior Interns, Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, Toronto, ON Address all correspondence to Dr. P.

This deformity leads to a reduced antero-posterior diameter of the chest causing a compression or \"pancaking\" of the heart and great vessels so as to appear enlarged. This is accompanied by a leftward displacement of the heart, resulting in cardiac murmurs 1, chest pain and tracheal compression2. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) has been reported in 64% of patients.2 Misdiagnosis of straight back syndrome as pericardial absence has also been cited.3 A study investigating the relationship between SBS and MVP showed echocardiograms to be normal in 36% of pa - tients diagnosed with SBS; however , 58% of these patients demonstrated mitral valve prolapsed.4 Despite the fact that this syndrome has been recognized for over 50 years, it is not commonly considered as a differential diagnose and thus the incidence is unknown. 5 However, given that this 144 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Straight Back Syndrome: positive response to spinal manipulation and adjunctive therapy - A case report syndrome is often associated with heart symptoms, it is important that health care practitioners are made aware of SBS and consider it as a differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with symptoms that can appear to be cardiac in nature. This is especially true in cases of atrial septal defect which can resemble the symptom picture of SBS. 6 This particular study describes the case of a patient with thoracic pain, who presented to a chiropractor also with cardiac symptoms but was ultimately diagnosed with and treated for symptoms related to SBS. Case Report All written consents, Research Ethics Board (CMCC) ap-provals were obtained from the patient prior to publishing this manuscript. History A 38 year old Caucasian, non-smoking male, presented to a chiropractic clinic with complaints of intermittent left arm paresthesia and left-sided chest pain and tightness rated at 3-4/10 (0=no pain, 10=most pain) and unrelent - ing. He also reported chronic, intermittent, daily mid-thoracic pain and tightness over the past year. Symptoms of mid-thoracic pain were verbally rated at 7/10. Short-ness of breath was also reported once per month. Chronic daily fatigue has also been an issue over the past year fol-lowing his recent divorce. Trauma or prior surgeries were denied. Occupational factors (sitting, computer work) ag-gravated his arm and chest symptoms which seemed to abate during his off-time. There did not appear to be any association between his arm pain and cervical stiffness, but his mid-thoracic and chest symptoms often occurred together. His employment required him to work night shifts for the past six years. Between 2007 and 2009, the patient underwent a number of medical diagnostic procedures, including blood work, echocardiogram, cardiac stress test, echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) which were all deemed within normal limits. He attended a walk-in clinic and was diagnosed with \"thoracic strain\" and was prescribed Naproxen, physiotherapy and mas-sage therapy. Treatments were ongoing for approximately six weeks and included upper back stretches and ultra - sound applied to the upper trapezius. Unfortunately, all interventions had no effect on managing his thoracic, arm or chest symptoms.Social HistoryNo family history of cardiovascular or MSK disorders was reported. He had not been taking any vitamins, min-erals or nutriceuticals and reported having little time for any form of exercise as he was caring for his two young children. Physical Assessment / Examinationa. Vitals Blood pressure was recorded at 118/77, pulse 71. He was 170 cm and weighed 69 kg. b. Prior Medical Testing A sleep study showed obstructive apnea with oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. X-ray report of the cervical spine stated cervical lordotic reversal, apex at C4-5 with mild joint / foramina narrowing. The C5-6 level was similarly involved. Mild thoraco-lumbar scolio-sis, convex to the right was also reported. c. Posture Examination showed moderate s-shaped scoliosis and an-terior head carriage. He exhibited mild pectus excavatum (Figure 1). There was moderately limited but pain-free active cervical mobility with posterior joint dysfunction located at C5-6. An obvious reduction of the thoracic ky-phosis (Figure 2) was noted. There was reduced bulk of the rhomboid muscles bilaterally resulting in a concave- FIGURE 1: pectus 57(2) 145PM Gold, B Albright, S Anani, H Toner appearing upper thoracic spine. Active left and right lat - eral flexion of the thoracic spine showed an obvious loss of global movement throughout, with focal mobility at the T8-9 region only (\"bent-stick\" motion pattern: absence of segmental later al flexion above and below an apex at T8- 9). d. Palpation Rhomboid and levator scapulae muscles were reduced in girth, palpably ropy, taut and tender. Deep palpation of the latter provoked local and referred pain into the upper border of the trapezius. Motion and static palpa-tion revealed severe loss of thoracic zygopophyseal/ joint function from T1-9. Exquisite tenderness was also noted with posterior-anterior facet challenge at these levels. No referral was elicited on para-spinal examina-tion. Costo-vertebral articulations were limited in their \"bucket handle\" 7 movement in this region with focal pain on direct palpation of the non-articulating tubercle of the first rib. TestingAll Kemp's, cervical compres-sion, thoracic outlet provoca-tion were unremarkable. 8 Neurologically, no obvious mo- tor changes were seen in the upper extremities; however there was loss of sensation over the right C5 dermatome at the deltoid tuberosity.Current Radiographic AssessmentSuspicion of SBS following initial physical examination led to chest and thoracic x-ray examination. It confirmed the moderate, s-shaped scoliosis. There was obvious loss of thoracic kyphosis (Figure 3). Chest AP was unremark-able for heart silhouette widening/pancaking (Figure 4). There are a number of roentgenometric procedures that have been used to determine the degree of thoracic ky-phosis and alteration of the retro-sternal and retro-cardiac spaces. The method chosen in this case was documented by Davies 1, whereby a measurement is made from the anterior body of T8 to the posterior aspect of the ster - num. The range of normal thoracic kyphosis varied from 12.68cm to 13.59cm. When reduced values are noted, the \"straight back\" nomenclature is applied. A second method used involves measuring the horizontal distance from T8 to a vertical line connecting T4 to T12. 1 AP values meas- ured in the lateral chest projection were 9.5cm and there - fore the SBS diagnosis was confirmed. (Figure 3). ManagementThe patient was diagnosed with chronic, idiopathic SBS. Treatment focused on symptomatic relief of chest tight - ness and constant thoracic symptoms. A pre-modulated bipolar electrotherapeutic current (80-120hz) was applied to the rhomboids and upper trapezius muscles. Spinal ma-nipulative therapy from T3-8 was performed in a supine manner (Anterior Thoracic procedure) 7 for a period of 8 FIGURE 3: lateral chest film showing thoracic spine flattening with a 9.5 cm antero-posterior measurement (T8 to posterior sternum) FIGURE 4: Normal AP chest; no evidence of heart pan-caking in the patient146 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Straight Back Syndrome: positive response to spinal manipulation and adjunctive therapy - A case report weeks, 2-3 times per week (total of 18 visits), followed by a simple, active pectoralis muscle stretch involving shoulder extension with scapular retraction (3 sets of 20 sec. inter-scapular contraction, 10 sec. rest). The patient was instructed to perform this 3 times per day to improve flexibility. Results The patient experienced considerable reduction of symp-toms at the 6 week mark monitored using the Vernon - Mior neck pain / disability scale and Rolland Morris in-ventory. Values dropped from a rating of 8 to 2 and from 12 to 1 respectively. Absence of anterior chest pain was noted with reported reduction of thoracic stiffness rat-ing of 7/10 to 2/10. Arm symptoms became less frequent (daily report to twice monthly) but upper trapezius tight - ness remained, requiring continued manipulation to the upper thoracic spine. Follow-up reporting at 6 months and re-examination at 23 months post treatment confirmed continued absence of chest symptoms including tightness, pain and shortness of breath. Discussion A review of the literature was conducted using search words: straight back syndrome, flat back syndrome, mi - tral valve prolapse using EBSCO, MEDLINE and Index to Chiropractic Literature data bases. Fifteen relevant articles were found, none more recent than 2007, the ma-jority of which were published at least 20 years ago. Rawlings9 first proposed the straight back syndrome (SBS) in 1960 in the American Journal of Cardiology and described it as the absence of the normal dorsal curvature in the thoracic part of the spine resulting in the reduced antero-posterior diameter of the thorax. At that time, it was considered a form of 'pseudo-heart disease' but cur - rent perspective is more often associated with valvular heart disease. 10 Diagnosis of straight back syndrome has changed slightly over the years. In 1956 De Leon et al.4 first pro - posed the diagnostic criteria as follows: the antero-pos-terior diameter \"a\" is defined as the distance from the an - terior border of T8 to the posterior border of the sternum on the lateral radiograph and the lateral diameter \"b\" is defined at the level of the diaphragm on the frontal radio - graph. SBS is diagnosed when a/b is 1/3 or less. In 1980, Davies et al.1 modified the diagnostic crite ria to evaluate a lar ger proportion of the chest diameter. They proposed that the lateral chest radiograph should be used to measure the distance, 'a' from the middle of the anter - ior border of T8 to a vertical line connecting T4 (top of anterior border) and T12 (bottom of anterior border). SBS is diagnosed when 'distance a' is smaller than 1.2cm. As in Datey15, the 2006 diagnostic criteria used by Yochum and Rowe11, includes a lateral chest projection is taken and the distance between the posterior sternum and the anterior surface of the T8 body is measured. A measured average saggital diameter of less than 13cm in males and less than 11cm in females may indicate the presence of SBS. It is important to ensure that SBS is not confused with flat back syndrome, which is defined as the loss of the normal lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine most commonly associated with spinal fusion surgery.12 Above all, it may be important for all health practition - ers to consider SBS as a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with a chest complaint and to understand that such presentations are not always cardiovascular in na-ture. We have proposed a diagnostic algorithm (appen-dix 1) to heighten clinicians' awareness to this syndrome. Such yellow flags that are ill ustrated include: decreased antero-posterior chest dimensions, pectus excavatum and straightening of the thoracic spine. X-ray finding may in - clude a pancaking cardiac silhouette appearing as cardio - megaly and prominence of the pulmonary artery. There is much debate as to the etiology of straight back syndrome. It has been suggested that it is an autosomal dominant condition and antigenic determinants may be located on chromosome 6. 1 Though it had previously been suggested that the deformity occurs in intrauterine life, making it a congenital condition 13, other recent discus- sions tends to support that straight back syndrome may be a postnatal acquired condition 5. Present literature remains unclear as to the cause of this syndrome. Straight back syndrome usually comes to attention due to systolic cardiac murmurs detected during routine examination. 3 However, this is not always the case. In one study, half the patients diagnosed with SBS were asymp-tomatic 3; therefore it is not plausible to only rely on inci - dentally found systolic cardiac murmurs for the diagnosis of this syndrome. Other comm on cardiac findings associ - ated ejection murmurs, para-sternal systolic impulses, loud delayed sounds of tricuspid valve closure, exaggerated respiratory split-J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) 147PM Gold, B Albright, S Anani, H Toner ting of the second heart sound.11 Palpitations and chest pain may be noted.14 In some rare cases, SBS has been associated with tracheal compression and respiratory fail - ure.5,14 These symptoms are thought to be caused by com- pression of the heart and great vessels.5 Upon radiographic examination of patients with SBS, the PA chest view may demonstrate an unusual down- ward angulation of the anterior rib ends and the heart may appear displaced toward the left and appear enlarged. 11 However, the most significant and diagnostic finding is thought to be the straightenin g of the dorsal spine, visible on inspection, which is therea fter confirmed by palpation and a lateral radiograph of the thoracic spine which can be evaluated using the diagnostic criteria elaborated by Yochum and Rowe. 10,14 Electrocardiogram is normal in most cases, solidifying that SBS is not an actual organic cardiac complaint but rather a pseudoheart condition. 9 In one study , echocardiograms were normal in 36% and ab - normal in 64% of patients.4 As previously stated, straight back syndrome has been associated with valvular defects. One study showed a strong association between SBS and mitral valve pro-lapse. In this study , 58% of patients with SBS were found to also have mitral valve prolapse (MVP).10 Davies et al.1 found that 67% of subjects with SBS had clinical or echo - cardiographic evidence of mitral valve prolapse while only 17.5% of without SBS had evidence MVP . Muraki et al15 studied the mechanism responsible for mi- tral valve prolapse in patients with SBS and concluded that antero-posterior flattening of the left ventricle predis - poses to asynchronous motion of the papillary muscles at end-systole, causing leaflet malcoaptation (malalignment) resulting in mitral regurgitation. In contrast, Chen et al.13 found that straight back syndrome does not increase the familial occurrence of mitral valve prolapse. They pos-tulated that both SBS and MVP might be features of a more generalized disorder. These two features may occur together in the same individual or they may be dissoci-ated. This evidence shows that though not all patients presenting with straight back syndrome have mitral valve prolapse, there is, however, an increased chance of its presence. Therefore, in the interest of caution, some auth-ors suggest patients be investigated for associated mitral valve prolapse if a diagnosis of SBS is suspected. 1, 10 Even if complicated with MVP , specific treatment for SBS is generally not required.5 Others, like Yochum and Albers16 contend that the clinicians' familiarity with this syndrome could prevent unnecessary and expensive testing as well as having the psychological benefit to the patient that they do not have or ganic heart disease. SummaryThis manuscript described the successful management of a patient with musculoskeletal symptoms related to SBS. Although SBS has gained increased recognition since its initial reporting by Rawlings in 1960, further research is still required in order to comprehend the scope of this syndrome and to guide health practitioners towards its proper diagnosis and, in some cases, management of its associated musculoskeletal issues. Further studies will help provide a greater understanding and appreciation of its overall incidence as well as its correlation with MVP. The incidence of SBS is unknown owing partially to its under-diagnosis within the clinical realm. As successful-ly shown in this case study, patients with SBS may not require any form of invasive treatment and often benefit from conservative care for symptomatic relief. Here, it consisted of chiropractic manipulative therapy, soft tissue treatment, and active exercise. Above all, it is important for the chiropractic practitioner to rule out cardiogenic causes by way of medical referral prior to any treatment regimen for patients presenting with a chest complaint.

The following is a case of a young male patient presenting with low back pain and radicular symptoms caused by myxopapillary ependymoma. Clinical Features: A nineteen year old male presented to an orthopaedic surgeon with a long history of back pain. He was initially diagnosed with soft tissue injuries and discharged. He began to experience erectile and bowel dysfunction two years later and was re-referred to the orthopaedic surgeon by his family physician but was lost to follow-up. The patient did not present to the surgeon until two years after his symptom profile changed. At that point, MRI examinations revealed a large myxopapillary ependymoma extending from T12 to L4 that was confirmed by a pathologist. Intervention and Outcome: The tumour was sur gically resected with subsequent adjuvant radiotherapy. After one year, the patient required continued catheterization and had poor anal tone. His back and leg complaints were almost normal. Follow-up MRI examinations revealed no disease progression or new spinal lesions at 4 years after the initial diagnosis. Conclusion: The clinical presentation of primary spinal cord tumours is non-specific and can easily be missed.

Delayed diagnosis and treatment of these rare causes of back pain could lead to poor outcomes; therefore, a referral to a surgeon should be done immediately with proper follow up to ensure continuity of care. key words: Spinal cord tumour, ependymoma, back ces cas IntroductionLow back pain caused by neoplasia accounts for less than 1% of cases of back pain1 but can be a significant cause of morbidity if undiagnosed and untreated. Primary spinal cord tumours represent approximately 15% of all neo - plasms of the central nervous system (CNS).2,3 These tu- mours pose a diagnostic challenge for practitioners since the symptoms are often non-specific with the most com - mon initial symptom being pain.3 Spinal cord tumours are classified according to their anatomical location and are separated into three broad categories: intramedullary, intradural are peripheral nerve tumours or meningiomas, and extradural lesions are usu-ally metastatic. The most common primary spinal cord tumour in adults is ependymoma. 4,5 Spinal cord tumours can significantly compress and displace the spinal cord, nerve roots or surrounding struc- tures, impacting the neurologic status.3 Therefore, early recognition of the signs and symptoms of primary spinal cord tumours allows for early treatment, potentially mini - mizing neurologic morbidity and improving outcome. The following is a case of a young male patient presenting with low back pain and radicular symptoms caused by myxopapillary ependymoma.Case HistoryA 19 year old male student presented to an orthopaedic surgeon with complaints of a 3 year history of back pain. He was referred to the surgeon by the family physician. He attributed the onset to being unexpectedly struck in the kidney area, after which he had ongoing recurring back pain. He was physically active but noted increasing pain in his lower back with some vague radicular discom-fort into his proximal thighs more towards the end of the day. Systems review was unremarkable. His lumbar spine range of motion was slightly restricted in forward flexion with a mild list to the right. Straight leg raising was to 90\u00b0 bilaterally with no evidence of nerve root tension signs. Sacroiliac and hip joint dysfunction tests were negative. On neurological examination of the lower limbs, deep ten-don reflexes were 3+ but symmetric, his muscle strength was graded 5/5 and he had normal sensation. Palpation revealed L4/5 and L5/S1 local tenderness. Conventional radiographs and a CT scan showed a spina bifida occulta of S1 but no pathology that would ac - count for his symptomatology. The patient was diagnosed with soft tissue injuries and prescribed NSAIDs and an-algesics to be taken on an as needed basis and discharged with no further follow-up scheduled. Approximately one year later he visited his family physician because he needed a form to be filled out for a motor vehicle accident. When he was asked about his 152 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Myxopapillary ependymoma as a cause of back pain in a young male - A case report low back pain, he stated that it was episodic but was not troubling him that much overall since he was managing with home exercises, and Diclofenac (V oltaren). Another year later, at the age of 21, the patient returned to his family physician with similar episodic low back pain, but at this time reported intermittent erectile dys-function and subjectively stated that he needed to bear down harder in order to have a bowel movement. At this point, he was re-referred to the orthopaedic surgeon; how-ever, he did not follow up with the surgical consultation. Another two years had elapsed before the patient re- turned to his family physician for reasons unrelated to his back pain (he had recently broken-up with his partner and was going through a custody battle and experiencing de-pression). At this point, he was 23 years old. When asked about his low back and the surgical consultation, he stated that he was never contacted by the orthopedic clinic and did not think much about it. He reported that he continued to experience the erectile and bowel dysfunction so was again referred to the orthopaedic surgeon. Four months later, the patient was seen by the ortho- paedic surgeon. At this consultation, he presented with back pain radiating into his legs with weakness and numb-ness in his legs and bowel, bladder and erectile dysfunc-tion. He ambulated independently with a limp. His deep tendon reflexes were absent bilaterally whereas they were 3+ four years earlier . The remainder of the physical exam- ination was unremarkable. An MRI examination revealed a large heterogenous, T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense, enhancing spinal canal mass that invaded multiple neural foramina bilaterally and eroded the posterior one third of the L1 vertebral body. There was posterior vertebral body scalloping extending from T12 to L4 with expansion of the spinal canal (Figures 1 and 2). Pathologic examination confirmed a neuroepithelial neoplasm, favouring Im- age Lumbar SpineT2-weighted MRI showing the erosion of the L1 verterbral body Figure 1: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Mid-Sagittal Lumbar Spine (A) Hyperintense intradural spinal canal mass noted on T2-weighted MRI; (B) The mass was hypointense on T1-weighted MRI and showed avid enhancement (C). Both images demonstrate that the upper extent of the mass is inseparable from the distal spinal cord with a large exophytic component. The spinal canal is expanded with posterior vertebral body scalloping extending from T12 to L4. Intra- and extra-lesional flow voids represent hypervascularity at the upper aspect of the mass surrounding the distal spinal cord.J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) Dufton, PJ Stern, O Islam An orthopaedic surgeon and neurosurgeon performed a conjoint procedure that involved T12 to S2 laminecto - mies, excision of the intradural spinal tumour and a spinal duraplasty. Adjuvant radiotherapy was recommended since the tumour could not be completely resected. In-itially post sur gery, he had significant bowel, bladder and erectile dysfunction. After one year, he still needed catheterization and had poor anal tone but his back and leg complaints were almost totally alleviated. Multiple bi-yearly follow-up MRI examinations revealed marrow changes secondary to radiation therapy. At 4 years after his initial diagnosis, the most recent post-operative MRI examinations revealed no disease progression or new spinal lesions. Discussion Spinal ependymal tumours are glial tumours derived from ependymal cells in the spinal cord and represent 40-60% of primary spinal cord tumours.6-8 The myxopapil - lary subtype of ependymomas (MPE) occurs mostly in the thoracolumbar region and is the most common form of ependymoma in the lumbar spine 4,8-10, accounting for 13% of all spinal ependymomas and 90% of tumours in the conus medullaris4-10. It is considered a benign tumour since it is usually encapsulated and anatomically isolated from direct access to lymphatic or other routes of dis-semination. 7 The key pathological characteristics of MPE are mucinous degeneration within the vascular connect-ive tissue cores of papillary tumours. 11 MPE usually occurs in the adult population in the third and fourth decades of life and af fect males more frequent- ly than females.4,12,13 Clinically , the most common find - ing is lumbar, sacral or radicular pain5,14 which is often worse in the recumbent position and, thus, at night7. To a lesser extent, sensory changes, motor deficits, bladder ab - normalities and impotence/ejaculation dysfunctions also occur. 5,14 The average duration of symptoms preceding diagnosis ranges from 13 months to 8.3 years5,12,15 since they are slow growing. Differential diagnoses for MPE include other primary spinal cord tumours and metasta - ses, or possibly disc herniation depending on the symp-toms. 7 Diagnosis of MPE is best accomplished with mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI findings typically include an intradural mass that tends to be hypointense or isointense with the spinal cord on T1 weighted images, hyperintense on T2 weighted images and will have in-tense homogenous enhancement after the administration of intravenous contrast material. 4-7,11,13 On average, the le- sions affect 2 to 4 vertebral body levels.4-6,11,13 Confirma - tion of the diagnosis cannot be made until the excised tu-mour tissues are examined pathologically. T reatment for MPE mainly involves surgical excision of the tumour. If the capsule ruptures or the tumour is not confined to the filum terminale, the mass could infiltrate and adhere to the cauda equina and/or conus medullaris or disseminate via the cerebral spinal fluid.5,11 Therefore, adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended when en bloc ex-cision (removal of the entire tumour as one piece) cannot be accomplished. 11,12 However , the efficacy of radiation therapy has not been established and can result in adverse effects such as radiation myelopathy5,12 and residual dys- uria11. The 5-year survival rate of spinal ependymomas ranges from 57-100%12,14,15 and 10-33% of patients will experience local invasion of the tumour or recurrence8,14. Metastasis is rare in MPE but there have been several reported cases. 16-29 A good prognosis is correlated with both a greater extent of resection5 and a high preopera- tive functional status2. Longer symptom duration prior to treatment is correlated with poorer functional outcomes30; therefore, early detection of the tumour is also associated with a better prognosis 11,30. In the chiropractic literature, three cases of spinal ependymomas have been published in two articles.31,32 One patient presented with chronic (six months duration) back pain whereas the other two presented with acute ex-acerbations of back pain. The clinical presentations were variable but each had an unusual characteristic: one had atrophy and weakness of the left hand; the second had bowel and bladder dysfunction; and the third experienced a disproportionate amount of pain relative to the mechan - ism of his injury. Ependymomas in the cervical spine (in the first case) and lumbar spine (in the latter two cases) were revealed via MRI and all cases had good outcomes after surgical excision of the tumour. The subtypes of ependymomas were not discussed in these three cases. In the present case, it is unlikely that the initial presen- tation of chronic low back pain was associated with the ependymoma. It could be argued that since MPE is a slow growing tumour, it could have begun to develop at that time. However , he did not report any red flags, the physic - al examination did not reveal any gross abnormalities and 154 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Myxopapillary ependymoma as a cause of back pain in a young male - A case report the conventional radiographs and CT scan were negative. Although his reflexes were 3+ in the lower extremities initially , this is not necessarily indicative of disease.33 If the original low back pain was indeed of a soft tissue na-ture as opined by the orthopaedic surgeon, then this case reinforces the necessity to regularly re-evaluate patients for changes in signs and symptoms. The patient' s symptom profile changed between the ages of 20 and 21 when he reported erectile and bowel dysfunction to the family physician. No physical exam - ination was performed during that visit so it cannot be de-termined when signs of neurological deterioration would have appeared. He was referred back to the orthopaedic surgeon but unfortunately, no appointment occurred. Treatment may have been further delayed had he not returned to the family physician for unrelated reasons 2 years later. At the time of the second surgical consulation, the patient had weakness in his legs, bowel and bladder dysfunction, erectile dysfunction and night pain. Physical findings further revealed a change from 3+ reflexes bilat- erally to absent reflexes. This delayed diagnosis perhaps contributed to his slow healing and residual bladder and anal tone dysfunction af-ter treatment. This highlights the importance of follow-up by the primary contact provider to ensure proper man-agement of the case. If the patient had seen the special - ist closer to the time of initial symptom change, surgical resection could have been performed sooner, perhaps re-sulting in a better clinical outcome. Conclusion Myxopapillary ependymomas are the most common primary tumours in the region of the conus medullaris and filum terminale. The clinical presentation of these tumours is non-specific with lumbar and radicular pain being the most common symptoms. In cases of chronic back pain, signs and symptoms should be regularly mon-itored for changes indicative of progressive neurological compromise such as sensory, motor and bowel/bladder dysfunction. If there is deterioration of clinical signs and symptoms, a spinal tumour should be considered in the list of differential diagnoses. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of these rare causes of back pain could lead to poor outcomes; therefore, a referral to a surgeon should be done immediately with proper follow up to ensure continuity of care.References 1.

We hypothesized that asking motion palpators to identify the most fixated cervical spinal level to allow calculating reliability at the group level might be a useful alternative approach. Methods: Three examiners palpated 29 asymptomatic supine participants for cervical joint hypomobility. The location of identified hypomobile sites was based on their distance from the T1 spinous process. Interexaminer concordance was estimated by calculating Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and mean absolute differences (MAD) values, stratified by degree of examiner confidence. Results: For the entire participant pool, ICC [2,1] = 0.61, judged \"good.\" MAD=1.35 cm, corresponding to mean interexaminer differences of about 75% of one cervical vertebral level. Stratification by examiner confidence levels resulted in small subgroups with equivocal results.

Given its ubiquity and strategic importance in training programs, the intraexaminer and interexaminer reliability of MP have been extensively studied and summarized in systematic and annotated reviews. 1-5 In their review of 44 MP studies, Haneline et al6 reported that only 8 showed high levels of reliability, and that only 2 of these 8 studies could be judged to be of high quality. MP has been found so unreliable 7-9 that some have controversially called for abandoning this diagnostic procedure10, while Hestbaek and Leboeuf-Yde concluded \"The esteem chiropractors have for motion palpation in particular has not been sub-stantiated by scientific data\"11. Cooperstein et al12 hypothesized that the design meth- ods of previous interexaminer MP reliability studies may not have been optimal to evaluate interexaminer agree-ment. All such studies, despite some differences, shared the method of analyzing agreement on a segmental basis. That is, the examiners tested and compared impressions for each spinal level considered separately. Some of the earlier studies reported the results in terms of percentage agreement, but as Haas pointed out13, this does not correct for chance agreement. All the more re-cent studies have assessed concordance using the kappa statistic, which does indeed correct for chance agreement. Sim and Wright have described several factors that can in-fluence the magnitude of kappa, including prevalence and bias, and discussed ways of interpreting the magnitude of obtained kappa values.14 Assessing agreement level by level may not reflect the conceptual model that some doctors in clinical practice use when asked to compare opinions for a specific patient on the location of hypomobility. For example, asked to evaluate the cervical spine of a patient with a \"stiff neck,\" we suspect some doctors would attempt to identify the most hypomobile level in the neck. The levels they found could then be judged to be either relatively close to or dis- tant from one another. Then, we could conclude the doc- tors had closely agreed upon, almost agreed upon, or sim-ply disagreed about the location of the most hypomobile segment. Cooperstein et al 12 studied the interexaminer re- liability of thoracic MP using this conceptual model and the statistical method best adapted to this type of analysis, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Although the kappa statistic performs calculations on discrete paired observations, ICC performs calculations on continuous data at the group level. Cooperstein et al12 also reasoned that many partici - pants in previous MP studies (often done using largely asymptomatic students) may have lacked a significant hypomobile location, forcing examiners to opine \"fix - ated\" or \"not-fixated\" at each level including cases where they were simply not sure of their findings. T o take this into account, examiners in their thoracic study were asked to rate their confidence in the finding each time they pal - pated a participant. Then, in analyzing the results, exam - iner agreement could be calculated among several subsets of study participants, stratified by the degree of doctor confidence. W ithout stratifica tion by doctor confidence, (95% CI, 0.6257, 0.9253). The objective of our present study was to apply Cooper - stein's thoracic spine methodology to the cervical spine, for which, to our knowledge, no data using continuous analysis and stratified confidence ratings have been previ - ously reported.158 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Interexaminer of cervical motion palpation using continuous measures and rater confidence levels Methods This studied required and received approval from the In-stitutional Review Board at our college. All participants were required to provide informed written consent prior to being enrolled in the study. The participants were a convenience sample of asymptomatic chiropractic stu-dents who volunteered to participate during a technique laboratory class. Participants with reported cervical pain greater than 2/10 or intolerance to the palpation proced-ure for any reason were excluded. There were no other exclusion criteria. Participants (n=29) were mostly male (n=19), mean 27.1 years of age, mean weight 71.2 kg, and mean height 172.3 cm. The mean pain level was 0.8 on an 11-point numeric pain scale, as established by participant-completed questionnaires. No potential participants were excluded. The 3 examiners used in this study were licensed chiro- practors, two with more than 20 years of clinical experi - ence and one with approximately 3 years of experience. The participants were instructed not to speak to the exa-miners during the examination process and were unaware of the palpatory results. The sequence of examiners was randomized for each participant by means of an (unblind-ed) research assistant drawing color-coded slips of paper from an envelope to prevent order effects. Each examiner was masked as to other examiners' findings. Participants were first placed prone in order to permit a research assistant to mark the skin at the location of the T1 spinous process. Participants were then re-positioned supine to permit MP by the examiners between the C1 and C7 levels. To do so, the examiners used the lateral aspect of their index fingers to apply over -pressure at end- range to the lat eral aspect of the cervical articular pillars, using a mostly posterior to anterior and somewhat lateral to medial vector. This created extension, ipsilateral lateral flexion and contralateral rotation to the side of contact. This would be described as an end-feel method of MP1,15, judging the quality of motion at end-range with pressure applied to one vertebra. The described over-pressure was equivalent to having taken each joint to end-range, left and right, as if to perform a traditional chiropractic adjust-ment commonly known as the modified rotary break, or more generical ly as the \"supine proximal lateral index- transverse/articular pillar move.\" After identifying the most hypomobile spinal site, the first examiner silently pointed out (by touching it) the lo -cation to a research assistant, who placed a small adhesive backed marker on the participant's skin at the indicated location. The examiner also whispered to the research assistant whether he was \"very confident\" or \"not con - fident\" in the finding of hypomobility . The research as - sistant then recorded the distance in centimeters from this marker to the mark on the T1 spinous process with a soft measuring tape, and also recorded the examiner 's confi - dence rating. The marker was then removed and then the second and third examiners repeated the procedure, al-lowing approximately 2 minutes between observations. Figure 1 illustrates our method for computing the dis- tances between the examiner's locations for hypomobil - ity, using findings at C4 and C6 as an example. Having ob - tained the distances from the hypomobile sites indentified by skin marks to the T1 spinous process, along lines O-C4 Figure 1. Method for computing the distances between the examiner' s locations for hypomobilityJ Can O-C6, we used trigonometry to calculate distances a and b along the line D-C4. Line D-C4 is drawn 1.5 cm lateral to point O, based on a measurement taken from a dry spine. These calculations enabled us to transform the entire dataset of measurements taken from the spinous process of T1 to laterally situated hypomobile locations, to the actual vertical distance s between examiners' find - ings. This heuristic calculation required three simplifying assumptions: (a) each level in the cervical spine was 1.8 cm in height 16 (even though vertebral height increases somewhat heading caudally); (b) the vertical length of the neck was uniform among participants; and (c) the skin marks were along a hypothetical line 1.5 cm from a hypo-thetical interspinous line. We determi ned the spread of hypomobile findings across the range of C1-C7. We used the ICC statistic [2,1] (a two-way ANOV A model) to calculate group concord-ance and the root mean square error (RMSE) for all 27 analyzable participants, for all 3 examiners. We also cal-culated concordance among the 3 In each of the 4 datasets analyzed, the calculations were performed in three ways: for the sample as a whole (un-stratified by doctor confidence), for a subset in which all examiners were confident in their findings, and for a sub - set in which at least one of the examiners lacked confi - dence. Thus, a total of 12 ICC and RMSE values were calculated. In addition, for each of these same 12 subsets we also calculated the mean absolute difference (MAD), the standard error of the mean (SEM), and 95% confi - dence intervals. Results Although 29 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria, two data points were not recorded for examiner 3 (one failure to record the distance from T1 to the hypomobile location, and one failure to record the confidence rating). As a result, some of the interexaminer reliability and MAD calculations (involving examiners 1&2) are based on n=29, and the others (any involving examiner 3) on n=27. Likewise, the calculations based upon the entire participant pool are based on n=27. Some mild erythema was often induced during examination, but was so dis-persed that each examiner 's identification of the most hypomobile location was judged to have been effectively masked from the other examiners. Figure 2 is a histogram providing the approximate dis- tribution of hypomobility findings for all examiners and all participants. Since the examiners did not attempt to nominate specific levels, but rather distances from a fixed point, we produced this histogram by distributing the ac - tual measured locations into 7 bins within the C1-7 range. Since doing so required some simplifying assumptions, the histogram must be seen as a heuristic attempt to cap-ture the results rather than representing exact numbers of findings at each segment. W e assumed a uniform scale for the cervical spine with equally spaced segments; that at least one of the examiners' calls included C1; and that the vertical length of each participant's neck was uniform. Subject to these limits on interpretation, the hypmobile findings approximated a fairl y smooth bell curve skewed to the left, with the peak frequency of hypomobile calls made at the the approximate level of C5. The overall agreement on side of hypomobility was p=.39. The percentage of participants for which at least one examiner lacked confidence was 28%, 17%, and 1 1% for examiners 1, 2, and 3 respectively . T able 1 summarizes the data for subgroups 1-4 based on examiner comparisons: (1) all examiners combined; Figure 2. Approximate distribution of hypomobility find-ings for all examiners and all participants160 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Interexaminer reliability of cervical motion palpation using continuous measures and rater confidence levels (2) examiners 1&2; (3) examiners 1&3; and (4) exam- iners 3&4. In each subgroup, data are reported for 3 par - ticipant subsets: a non-stratified subset, a subset where all examiners were confident, and a subset where at least one examiner was not confident. The Shapiro-W ilk test was run on all subsets to confirm the populations were nor- mally distributed prior to calculating reliability estimates. Stratification by examiner confidence levels resulted in a series of relatively small subgroups for analysis. For the entire unstratified participant pool, ICC [2,1] = 0.61; the root mean square error (RMSE) indicated that accur - acy of measurement was within 1.22 cm. The MAD in examiners' identification of the most hypomobile seg - ment was 1.35 cm, 95% confidence interval: 1.12, 1.57 cm. Assuming an approximate 1.8 cm per cervical level16, both the RMSE and MAD calculations suggest a mean in-terexaminer dif ference of about 75% of a vertebral level, clinically equivalent to having identified the same motion segment as being hypomobile. Discussion Possible explanations for the general poor reliability of previous motion palpation studies have included poor in-terexaminer spinal level localization leading to possible misreported discrepancies. 5,17 Some investigators avoided the spinal level numeration problem by having the exa-miners denote particular skin marks (applied beforehand by a research assistant) to represent the level of fixation, rather than attempting to number the vertebral levels felt to be fixated. Our study avoids the numeration problem by recording the hypomobile location as a distance from a landmark rather than as a spinal level in the usual sense of the term. Our study allowed the examiners to determine the most hypomobile cervical location and rate their findings by de - gree of confidence. Using the typical scale for classifying ICC values (below 0.40 = poor , 0.40-0.59 = fair, 0.60-0.74 =good, above 0.75 = excellent)14, interexaminer agreement for all participants, unstratified, was \"good.\" Although the ICC values obtained in the present study were somewhat lower than the highest ICC reported in the aforementioned thoracic study 12, the results are generally comparable. MAD, the average of examiners' differences, was 1.35 cm, equivalent to having identified the same motion segment.Table 1 Interexaminer agreement SetGroup description, sample intervalStandard error of meanIntraclass correlation coefficient MAD, cm lower upper SEM ICC e 1All ex, n=27 non-stratified 1.35 1.12 1.57 0.12 0.61 1.22 All ex, n=14 confident 1.13 0.88 1.39 .0.13 0.68 1.03 All ex, 13 not confident 1.57 1.19 1.95 0.19 0.52 1.44 2Ex 1&2, n=29 1.05 0.61 1.48 0.22 0.64 Ex 1&2, n=13 not 1.19 0.67 1.10 2.58 0.35 0.41 Haneline Our study was underpowered, resulting in subgroups that were exceedingly small. Thus, there was inadequate power to statistically determine significant dif ferences in reliability among the confidence strata. W alter et al18 de- veloped a method for estimating the required sample size for ICC calculations, given the expected ICC, the lowest ICC that would be acceptable, and the number of raters. For example, using 3 examiners, had we been willing to accept ICC=0.4 (\"fair\"), and expecting ICC=.7 (compar - able to a previous similar study 12, we would have needed a sample size of 20. For comparisons using 2 examiners, the required sample size would have been n=33. Study designs that permit analyzing continuous group data rather than discrete paired observations may provide an increased ability to discern interexaminer agreement, as does (to some degree) allowing the examiners to rate their level of confidence in their findings. The methods used in most if not all previous MP studies asked the exa- miners to judge each spinal level as either moving nor - mally or being hypomobile, and analyzed the data using the kappa statistic. Judging agreement by how near the identified locations are to one another , as we did, may be a more subtle and clinically relevant an assessing of agreement. It may better mirror how many (but certainly not all) manual therapists detect hypomobility in typ-ical clinical settings: the palpator examines the spine for hypomobile sites that are relatively near the area of the patient's complaints. Among the four dozen MP studies discussed in an an- notated review of MP2, Potter et al19 were one of only two groups of investigators who used a most-hypomobile-segment paradigm similar to ours, and they also used ICC for the purposes of analysis. Since theirs was an intraexaminer study, unlike ours, and furthermore con-sidered other examination findings in addition to MP to determine agreement, we cannot directly compare the re- sults of their study with our own. Ghoukassian et al20 also used a most fixated level protocol in an osteopathic study assessing the reliability of a percussive MP method de- veloped by Johnston21. Even though they could have used ICC for the purposes of analysis, the investigators organ-ized their data so as to use the kappa statistic, and doing so found negligible interexaminer agreement. When their data is reformatted so as to enable analysis using ICC, what becomes apparent is clinically relevant (although not high) agreement. Since the data in the Ghoukassian study 20 were presented such that they could be analyzed using either discrete or continuous statistical methods, in effect we have a direct head-to-head comparison whereby continuous analysis showed arguably more agreement than discrete analysis. An article re-analyzing this osteo-pathic study using continuous statistical methods is now in press. 22 It demonstrates that a head-to-head comparison of two measures of reliability, operating upon the same dataset, found greater reliability using continuous as com-pared with discrete analysis. However, this outcome may not be generalizable. Interexaminer motion palpation studies generally as- sess agreement on the spinal level of hypomobility, but infrequently report the direction or side of restriction. In-deed, many by design constrain the examiners to study posterior to anterior glide only, or confine examination to one side only. In our study the overall agreement on the side of hypomobility was only 44%, although paradox - ically, we found strong agreement on the spinal location of maximum hypomobility. Since the palpatory proced-ure involved applying mostly posterior to anterior pres-sure on the articular pillar and transverse process, the hard end-feel that the examiners perceived may have related more to vertebral resistance to extension (i.e., extension restriction) rather than axial rotation or lateral-to-medial translation. Under that assumption, the side contacted re-sulting in the judgement of extension hypomobility may have been perceptually unimportant. W e have no reason to think our results on side-speci - ficity dif fer from those of other MP investigators, most of whom did not report their data on side-specificity . A cervical MP study by Cooperstein et al reported good examiner agreement on which participants in their study exhibited fixation, but not on the side.23 There is some limited information available addressing cervical clinical outcomes as related to the side of intervention. 24-26 Awareness seems to be growing that the kappa statis- tic has not been very useful in demonstrating examiner concordance in level-by-level study designs, and in fact needs to be made more useful by dint of using expanded definitions of agreement. For example, Abbot et al27, after checking each lumbar level individually for instability, collapsed the data into just 2 levels, to which they then applied kappa statistics: \"For analysis of clinical exam - ination data, both clinical and radiographic data were then collapsed into two regions, corresponding to upper lum-162 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Interexaminer reliability of cervical motion palpation using continuous measures and rater confidence levels bar and lower lumbar. This was decided a priori, and con- sidered necessary because there is considerable evidence that therapists are not sufficiently accurate in identifying specific segmental levels by palpation, although they are usually within one level (up or down) and are generally reliable at locating again a segment they had previously located.\" Heiderscheit et al 28 also realized that their pros- pects for finding segmental agreement using the kappa statistic was poor: \"To account for potential segment level identification inaccuracies, an expanded definition of agreement was also used. Using this expanded definition, agreement with regard to the localization of findings was present if it was reproduced during the second examina - tion session and located in the exact same spinal level or in a neighboring level (\u00b1 1 spinal segment)\". Our study design did not have to expand the bins to detect agreement. Examiners needed only to have been near each other in identifying the most hypomobile seg-ment to be judged in agreement; and the closer they were, the higher the level of agreement. Our study was not de-signed to show that identifying the most fixated location is more clinically important than identifying a discrete level of care, nor address the clinical issues related to spinal manipulation based on any particular examination protocol. Rather, we attempted to show that examiners can be demonstrably concordant in identifying the most fixated location in the cervical spine, even though most prior cervical MP studies showed an unacceptable degree of agreement when assessing cervical motion level by level. Limitations of the study Although we randomized colored slips of paper to determine the order of examiners for each participant, we did not record the examiner or - der. This precluded determining if there were order ef fects based on which examiner was first, second, or third. The research assistant may have erred to some degree in placing the marker at the spot indi-cated by the examiners and in performing the measurements. In addition, the research assist-ant was not blinded to the examiners' site desig-nations. Since MP may alter the participant's joint move- ments (either increasing or decreasing end-range movement capability), using 3 examiners rather than the usual 2 might not have been a good design choice. It may have reduced the independence of the observations beyond what occurs using only 2 examiners. Lack of confidence in the examiners' rating of the most hypomobile motion segment might have come about in 2 different ways: an exam-iner might not have found any motion segment significantly hypomobile or an examiner may have found multiple segments significantly but indistinguishably hypomobile. The finding that the highest ICC recorded in this study occurred in a subgroup where at least one examiner was not confident was counter - intuitive and remains unexplained. That stated, examiner confidence levels appeared to have a modest impact in the study overall. Our study was underpowered, resulting in sub- groups that were exceedingly small. Thus, there was inadequate power to statistically determine significant dif ferences in reliability among the confidence strata. Small sample sizes29 may increase the variability of examiners' observa-tions. The study participants were largely asymptom - atic, thus not reflective of symptomatic patients seeking care, jeopardizing the external valid - ity in a manner that has been previously criti - cized5,11; lack of participant homogeneity30 may increase variability. On the other hand there is some evidence that using more symptomatic participants does not appreciably change the outcome. 31 W ithout a reference standard we cannot con- firm that there actually were any hypomobilities present in our study . ConclusionsThe palpators in this study of cervical end-feel MP exhib-ited good interexaminer agreement, with findings gener - ally within one level of each other, despite having used in- dustry-standard methods that previous studies had found mostly unreliab le. Examiner confidence levels seemed to have a modest impact on the reliability of cervical spine J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) 163R Cooperstein, M Young, M Haneline MP, but the study did not have enough power to address this clearly . There may be benefits to repeating the study on a sample of symptomatic patients. W ith so many previous studies having been performed in educational institutions that used mostly asymptomatic and minimally-symptomatic participants, it is not sur - prising that the protocol of examining the spine segment by segment became established, and propagated in clin - ical situations even where more symptomatic participants were available . After all, minus a significant participant complaint, a level-by-level approach may have seemed more appropriate compared with the more targeted ap-proach we suspect is used by field doctors, who might be expected to seek the most fixated or otherwise symptom - atic segment lying within the field of primary complaint. Our clinical protocol of ident ifying the most hypomobile level may better represent the practice of some but not all clinicians using MP. Investigators who perform research in educational in- stitutions often use a convenience sample of minimally symptomatic students, often a relatively small sample, usually due to research infrastructural limitations. These investigators understand it would have been better to use a larger sample of more heterogeneous participants, and know in advance their study will never achieve a high score using rating instruments like QAREL 32 for reliabil - ity or QUADAS33 for validity studies. Institutional inves- tigators in such circumstances do need to make it clear that their studies have limited external validity, and read-ers should be cautious to not over-interpret their results. The better reliability seen in our study compared with most previous motion palpation studies is not attributable to any improvements to the end-feel palpatory method, nor do they confirm a better method for identifying the most appropria te spinal site of care. We are not aware of any studies that report different outcomes for care based on examining every spinal level as compared with flag - ging the most relevant location within a patient's area of primary complaint. Therefore, these results do not call for clinicians to adopt new patient assessment methods or change their record-keeping protocols. They do sug-gest that researchers might consider designing their study protocols and research methods to explore reliability using the \"most clinically relevant spinal site\" protocol that some clinicians use. In fact, our results raise the possibility that the present inventory of mostly discrete (certainly for MP) reliability studies may underestimate clinically relevant examiner agreement, thereby unduly discouraging further research and clinician interest in such research. It may be possible to repeat many other in-terexaminer reliability studies, including studies of exam - ination procedures other than MP (thermography, x-ray line marking, etc.) with simil ar design modifications that may more meaningfully assess examiner agreement than the mostly discrete analysis that has been used up until now. We should not allow the confidence module of this study , given that it addressed an important clinical issue, to obscure our central finding. The interexaminer reliabil - ity for all 3 examiners, and for all participants, was good. AcknowledgmentWe would like to thank the Palmer Center for Chiroprac - tic Research for its support.

Part 2 - procedure usage rates Brian Gleberzon, DC, MHSc* Kent Stuber, BSc, DC, MSc** Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of the spine are most commonly utilized by chiropractors practicing in Ontario, based on a list of currently taught procedures at CMCC. In Part 1 of this study (published previously), the demographics and practice patterns of the respondents were presented. Part 2 of this study (presented here) reports on the utilization rates of spinal diagnostic and therapeutic procedures by the respondents. Methods: The study consisted of a paper-based survey that was sent to 500 randomly selected Ontario chiropractors who responded confidentially. Survey questions inquired into demographic and practice style characteristics as well as the frequency with which spinal diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were performed. Results: There were 108 respondents to the survey, giving a response rate of 22.4%. Frequency of use of diagnostic procedures fell into three broad categories: (i) those tests that are almost always performed, (ii) those tests that are almost always performed by two- * Professor, Chair of Department of Chiropractic Therapeutics, CMCC, 6100 Leslie St. Toronto, Ontario, M2H 3J1.

These procedures are principally directed towards the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and pel-vic regions (the spine) and peripheral joints, although students are also taught how to assess other structures (eyes, ears, heart and so on) as well. Two previous stud-ies sought to determine if the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures taught during the undergraduate programme at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) are required to be used by fourth year students during their internship when providing patient care under the dir - ect supervisions of chiropractic clinicians. 1,2 In general, these studies reported a relatively high degree of vertical integration of procedures between the undergraduate and clinical internship with respect to the cervical, thoracic and lumbopelvic spine but a very low degree of vertical integration with respect to assessment procedures of the cranium. 1,2 This study took those investigations one step further by attempting to ascertain if the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures currently taught to students are subsequently utilized for patient care after graduation. The overall purposes of this study were to: (i) charac- terize practice patterns and demographic information of a pseudo-random sample of Ontario chiropractors; (ii) de-termine which diagnostic tests of the spine and (iii) which therapeutic procedures of the spine were utilized by a pseudo-randomized sample of Ontarian chiropractors as well as how often (i.e. at what frequency) they were be-ing used. The first objective (characterization of practice patterns and demographic information) has been accepted for publication.3 We present here the second and third objectives of this study; namely, which diagnostic and therapeutic procedures currently taught to chiropractic students are used by a pseudo-randomized sample of On-tario chiropractors and how often (i.e. at what frequency) these tests were being used. Methods The methods employed in this study have been described in detail elsewhere 3, and modelled after two previously published studies on this topic1,2. Briefly , this study re - ceived approval from the CMCC Research Ethics Board (project #112019) and funding from the CMCC Division of Graduate Education and Research. Subjects were mailed a cover sheet and consent form, a paper-based survey and an addressed postage paid envelope to return the survey. The survey consisted of demographic ques-tions, questions regarding practice patterns, and several tables that listed and described all of the spinal diagnos-tic/examination procedures and manual mobilization and spinal manipulative therapies currently taught in the col-lege's curriculum, ascertained by auditing diagnosis courses.4,5 A six-point scale was provided for subjects to indicate the frequency with which they perform each procedure. Re-sponse as \"no clinical cause to use this test\". The survey was based on previous published studies on this topic by one of the authors 1,2, and further pre-tested on a single independent external subject. The surveys were distributed to a systematically pseu- do-randomized sample of 500 licensed Ontario chiroprac - tors selected from the directory of the College of Chiro-practors of Ontario (CCO) (the licensing body of that province). Subjects were included if they were a practi - cing chiropractor registered with the CCO who was in-volved in patient care and signed the informed consent form for partic ipation. Confidentiality was assured and participants could respond anonymously. Descriptive sta- tistics were employed to determine the overall frequency with which the different procedures were performed, along with determining the results of the demographic and practice pattern questions and a response rate. The six options available to respondents used in the survey (see above) were collapsed into four categories to facilitate re-sponse pattern analysis. These categories were: 'Never/Rarely' (N/R) (ST), 'Almost Al-ways/Often' (AA/O) Had Patient to Use it on' (HH-P). ResultsDiagnostic Examination ProceduresCervical Spine (Table 1) All respondents (100%) reported they AA/O perform cervical ranges of motion, and almost all respondents reported they perform joint play (96.3%) and static pal - pation (95.4%) during exami nation of the cervical spine. Over 80% of respondents reported AA/O performing motion palpation (84.3%) and Kemp' s test (82.4%). Roughly half of respondents indicated they AA/O per - form Cervical Compression (63%), Distraction (58.3%), Jackson' s (50.9%) and Spurling' s (46.3%) while the V alsalva's and Doorbell tests were AA/O performed by slightly less than half of respondents, although the results for these tests increase substantially if combined with the responses from respondents who reported that they 'sometimes' perform them. Conversely, over 85% of respondents reported they N/R performed Naffziger's test. Houle's test, a test that purportedly screens for patients at-risk of experiencing a vertebrobasilar stroke during cervical manipulation 6, was never used by 70.4% of respondents. Other tests com - monly N/R used included Cervical Flexion-Rotation, L'Hermittes, Upper Limb Tension and Soto-Hall. The Ro-tary Chair and Dix-Hallpike tests, used to differentially diagnose dizziness as either cervicogenic vertigo or be-nign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) respectively 7, were both N/R used by 70.4% of respondents, with rough - ly 7% indicating that they never had opportunity or cause to perform these tests (see Table 1). Other tests commonly N/R used included EAST, Adson's and Wright's tests, used to diagnose Thoracic Outlet Syndrome as well as Kernig's and Brudzinski's tests, used to identify menin - geal irritation. 8 The majority of respondents indicated they AA/O con-duct motor (85.3%), reflex (83.3%) and sensory (75%) neurological , 10.2% indicated they AA/O perform Hof fman's test. Thoracic Spine (Table 2)A high percentage of respondents reported they AA/O perform static palpation (96.2%), joint play (95.3%) and ranges of motion (93.4%) testing when assessing the thoracic spine, although only roughly two thirds perform Adam's test. Many respondents indicated they AA/O perform a straight leg raise, motion palpation, Kemp's, and rib springing. Other than Valsalva's maneuver and Doorbell testing, most of the other tests on the question-naire were never or rarely used, including Beevor's test or Beevor's sign, chest expansion test, Upper Limb Ten-sion Testing, passive scapular approximation, Slump test, skin rolling, L'Hermitte's, Soto-Hall, apparent or true leg length testing, and Kernig's or Brudzinski's tests. In this study , 56.1% of chiropractors reported they N/R per- formed chest percussion. Lumbopelvic Spine (T able 3) Respondents reported they AA/O perform a number of tests for the lumbopelvic spine, including static palpation (99.1%), joint play (96.3%), straight leg raise (95.3%), ranges of moti on (95.3%), J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Frequency of use of diagnostic and manual therapeutic procedures of the spine taught at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College motion palpation (86.9%), gait analysis (85%), Kemp' s (82.2%), crossed raise (79.2%), and Sacral Thrust (79%). A number of tests were reportedly used AA/O by roughly one-half to two-thirds of the respondents, includ - ing the Patrick's FABER (Figure 4), gait, and Bowstring's. number of tests were N/R used, including Schober's, tests, FAIR, Thigh Thrust, Gaenslen's, spinous percussion, Ober's, Distraction, and Trende-lenburg test. In this study , 61.3% of respondents never as - sessed lower limb pulses and 49.5% of respondents never performed abdominal percussion. With respect to neurological testing, 90.6% of re - spondents indicated they AA/O performed motor testing, 84% AA/O assessed reflexes, and 74.5% assessed lower limb sensation. The plantar reflex was used AA/O by 53.8% of respondents. Conversely 84.9% ron-Pheasant' s test and N/R assessed 53.8% muscle girth. Cervical Spine - manual therapeutic procedures (T able 4) The most commonly used cervical mobilization (cMOB) were long axis distraction (AA/O used by 76.2% of re - spondents), and global rotation (49.5%). All listed mobilizations were used to some extent. The cervical spinal manipulative procedures AA/O used by respondents in this study for the cervical spine were the Supine Rotary Cervical manipulation with Lat-eral Flexion (81%) and the Supine Rotary manipulation (74.3%). The next most comm only used procedures were the Lateral Break, Lateral Atlas, Seated and Prone cSMT. A number of other cSMT were N/R used by respondents, these were predominately the 'muscle adjustments'. Thoracic spine - manual therapeutic procedures (Table thoracic spine mobilizations (tMOB), re-spondents iliocostal (41.5%) and seated procedures (43.4%)in almost equal numbers. The most commonly reported thoracic spinal manipu - lative therapies (tSMT) Com bination (65.1%) and Modified Anterior (61.3%). The other tSMT listed (Thumb Move, Reinforced Unilateral and First Rib) were AA/O or ST used by more than half of respondents. The only tSMT N/R used by a large number of respondents was the Lateral Recumbent Rib (67.9%). Lumbar spine - manual therapeutic procedures (Table 6)With respect to lumbar mobilizations (L-MOB), long axis distraction was used AA/O by 61.3% of respondents and iliomammilary mobilization was used AA/O by 49.1% of respondents The lumbal spinal manipulative procedures most fre- quently reported as being AA/O used by respondents in this study were the Lumbar Roll ((81.1%), followed by the Lumbar Pull (68.9%), (56.5%) 'Bonyun'/Long Axis Distraction (54.5%). A number of other lumba r spinal manipulative therapies (L-SMT) were frequently reported as N/R, notably the Reverse Roll (84%), Seated (75.5%) and Disc Opening (61.3%) pro - cedures. Pelvic spine - manual therapeutic procedures (Table 7)With respect to mobilizations of the pelvis, respondents reported to AA/O use the sacral pump, knee-chest, and iliofemoral, alt hough it should be noted that 50% of re - spondents reported they N/R use the iliofemoral mobil - ization procedure. The pelvic spinal manipulative procedure most fre- quently reported as being AA/O used by respondents in this study was the PSIS contact ('upper SI') spinal ma-nipulative procedure (85.8%). Other pelvic spinal ma - nipulative therapies (P-SMT) were AA/O used less fre-quently. In descending order these were Ischial contact ('lower SI'), Prone SI, and Sacral base. Respondents to AA/O or N/R use the Sacral Apex manipu-lative procedure at almost the same frequency (roughly 39%). The Sitting Iliac Flexion procedure was N/R used by 85.8% of respondents, lateral (or side posture) pelvic therapy was N/R used by 61.3% of respondents and the Supine Iliac Flexion procedure Three distinct categories of tests can be discerned from the results of this survey. There appears to be one group of tests that respondents to this survey 'Almost Always' or 'Often' use. These mainly consist of segmental joint play, static and motion palpation, ranges of motion and neuro-logic testing of the different spinal regions. Triano et al 6 reported there was good evidence for some of these tests when used to identify the site of care (the clinical target of manipulation). The second category of tests identified in this survey was more condition-specific and AA/O used by roughly one half to two-thirds of respondents in this survey . For example, cervical compression tests (Kemp's, Jackson's or Spurling's test) or nerve tension tests of the lumbar spine (Braggard's or Bowstring's test) may be re-quired to be used on some - but not all - patients pre-senting to a chiropractor 's office depending on the pres - ence of referred or radicular pain. The third category of tests identified from the current survey are those that are 'Never ' or 'Rarely' used by the majority of respondents. These include Naffzinger's or L'Hermitte's tests in the cervical spine, true and apparent leg length testing in the thoracic spine and Schober's or Ankle-leg index testing in the lumbar spine. Overall, the level of vertical integration reported by respondents in this study with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of the spine was lower than the level of vertical integration reported from clinical faculty from CMCC 1,2, especially of the thoracic spine. Study LimitationsThe most notable limitation of this study was its very low response rate of only 22.2%. This low response rate and the pseudo-randomized sample reduce confidence in the generalizability of our findings. Furthermore our study included graduates of CMCC and other institutions, so it is possible that those educated at institutions other than CMCC may not have been taught some of the tests and techniques in the CMCC curriculum. Our decision to use a pencil-and-paper survey distributed by mail rather than an electronic survey may have contributed to the poor re-sponse rate. Future studies could perhaps garner a higher response rate using an on-line survey. W e chose not to set parameters around what consti- tuted 'almost always' versus 'sometimes used' or 'often used', instead relying on respondents to interpret what these meant. Future studies could provide definitions of these terms (ie 'almost always' implies the test is used on more than 90% of patients) for respondents. ConclusionsThis study reported on the frequency of use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures currently taught at CMCC by a group of pseudo-randomized Ontario chiropractors, most but not all of whom were CMCC graduates. The most commonly used diagnostic procedures for the cervical, thoracic, and lumbopelvic spine were joint play, static and motion palpation, neurological testing and ranges of mo-tion. A number of other orthopaedic tests were less com-monly used, and a number of tests were either rarely or not used at all, particularly in the assessment of the thor - acic spine. With respect to therapeutic procedures of the spine, many mobilization and manipulative procedures are commonly used, with the exception of the 'muscle' manipulations of the cervical spine.

Frac-tures specific to the scapular body comprise 35-65% of these fractures.1-4 Currently , 99% of all isolate d scapular body fractures are being treated non-operatively with an immobilizing sling or brace and some form of manual therapy with an 86% success rate.5 Scapular fractures have been a subject of investigation since Desault's treatise of 1805. 6 Scapula r fractures constitute only 1% of all frac - tures, 3% of shoulder -girdle injuries, and only 5% of all shoulder fractures.7 The infrequent occurrence of scapular fractures has been attributed to its protection anteriorly by the rib cage and thoracic cavity, a thick covering of soft tissue including eighteen muscular origins and insertions, and a wide range of mobility that allows for considerable dissipation of traumatic forces. 8,9 Scapular fractures occur most frequently in the 3rd and 4th deca des of life with 64-90% occurring in men.3,10,11 While isolated body fractures are most frequently caused by falls from different heights, 12 the most common cause of scapular body fractures in multi-trauma patient groups are road traffic accidents.2, 13 The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) outcome measure used in these case studies is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure the physical function and symptoms in patients with any or several musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The questionnaire (www.dash.iwh.on.ca) was jointly developed by the Institute for Work and Health and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and was designed to help grade the disability experienced by people with upper-limb disorders and also to monitor changes in symptoms and function over time. Testing has shown that the DASH performs well in both these roles. 14 The purpose of this paper is to describe both the iden-tification and conservative management of three cases of comminuted scapular body fractures which presented at three different chiropractic centers. Case ReportsCase 1History A 43 year old male manual laborer presented to a chiro-practic community outreach clinic with right shoulder pain eight days after slipping on ice and striking his right shoulder on cement blocks. Physical Examination This patient was able to remove his shirt but expressed mild discomfort with arm movements. Considerable con-tusion was evident overlying the inferior angle of the scap-ula and posterolateral thoracic wall. Decreased shoulder ranges of motion were accompanied by pain to palpation of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint evoking clinical sus-picion of an AC joint sprain or separation. Crepitus was elicited over the acromion process and at the superior as-pect of the shoulder during active abduction and external rotation. Shallow breathing and decreased normal lung sounds on inspiration and expiration in the right apical as well as upper anterior and posterior regions were ob-served with no significant signs of respiratory distress. Diagnostic ImagingChest and shoulder radiographs were obtained and re-vealed comminuted scapular fracture with isolation and antero-medial displacement of the GH joint, separation at the superior aspect of the acromioclavicular joint, dis-placed fractures of ribs 3, 4 and 6-9 on the right, pneumo-thorax, and passive/relaxation atelectasis (Figure 1A). Management The patient was transferred to the emergency department of a local hospital, where blood testing and a metabolic panel were interpreted as normal. The patient was then prescribed analgesic medication, a sling, and an ortho-pedic referral. The orthopedic consultant recommended against surgery, but advised the patient to continue im-mobilizing the shoulder in the sling for 6 weeks and then follow up. Approximately 3 weeks post injury, he presented back to the chiropractic community outreach clinic for treatment. Management consisted primarily of myofascial release of the trapezius and cervicothoracic paraspinal musculature, as well as diversified chiropractic adjustments to the cervical spine and instrument assisted (activator) adjustments as needed and tolerable in the thoracic spine. Treatments were administered approxi-mately once per week for 16 weeks. Outcome Four months after the initial injury, follow up radiographs 178 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Comminuted scapular body fractures: A report of three cases managed conservatively in chiropractic settings were taken and demonstrated a reduction in the displace - ment of the fracture fragment composed of the inferior scapular body and angle (Figure 1B). Re-examination at this time indicated some improvement in both active and passive right shoulder ranges of motion and normal shoul-der orthopedic testing, but reduced muscle strength of the rotator cuff and deltoid musculature (4/5) and continued mild edema, bruising and tenderness overlying the scap-ula. However, with continued treatment, two months later, this patient was pain free, with near normal ranges of mo-tion of the shoulder and strength of the rotator cuff mus-culature. Despite the temporary disability leave he was given by his orthopedist initially, this patient continued with light duty throughout his treatments and was able to return to work fully afterward with only slight soreness at the end of the day. On follow up, three years after the initial injury, this patient completed the Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm and Hand (DASH) outcome questionnaire which indicated disability of less than 2%. 14 Figure 1A: Right lateral scapular \"Y\" view displacement of the glenohumeral joint and comminuted scapular fracture (white arrow) eight days after injury.

The pneumothorax has resolved.Figure 179JL Scarano, M Richardson, JA Taylor Case 2 History A 53 year old Caucasian male businessman presented to the emergency room with right posterior shoulder pain sustained when an unexpected acceleration of a boat caused him to lose his balance and fall backward - strik-ing his right scapula directly on the gunwale of the boat. Radiographs (Figure 2A) and CT images (Figure 2B) of the chest and shoulder were performed revealing a com-minuted fracture of the right mid and lower scapular body with irregular fracture planes and multiple distracted, angulated and foreshortened fracture fragments as well as additional linear fractures through the base of the acro-mion and coracoid processes. The acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints were intact with no dislocation and there was no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The patient was fitted for a brace, prescribed analgesic medication to alleviate his symptoms and re- ferred to an orthopedist. During this visit one week later, in agreement with the ER orthopedist, he was advised against surgical intervention due to the delicate muscular envelope of the scapula and scheduled for re-checks two and six weeks later. Additionally, an MRI was scheduled demonstrating a partial thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon, fluid in the subacromi al/subdeltoid shoulder degenera - tive changes at the acromioclavicular joint encroaching upon the supraspinatus muscle tendon complex. The patient presented for a chiropractic evaluation three weeks following the incident to begin conserva-tive management of his injuries. At that time, the patient had already resumed working, discontinued his analgesic medication, and was beginning to feel more comfortable with his arm out of the brace. Physical Examination Initial examination revealed limitations with active shoul-der range of motion in all Figure 2A: External rotation view of the right shoulder on day of injury. Comminuted scapular fracture (black arrow) and old 6th and 7th posterior rib fractures from a previous injury that have healed with deformity (white arrows).Figure 2B: Axial CT scan through the right mid-scapular region also obtained on the day of injury demonstrating numerous comminuted fracture fragments of the scapular body (arrows).Figure 57(2)Comminuted scapular body fractures: A report of three cases managed conservatively in chiropractic settings 0\u00b0, internal rotation 40\u00b0). Passive ranges of motion were limited only in extension, abduction, and external rotation to 40\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 respectively. Neurologic examinations were unremark able, with normal deep tendon reflexes, and no motor or sensory loss with the exception of an in- ability to test deltoid or bicep strength on the right due to pain. Peripheral upper extremity pulses were symmetrical and of normal amplitude. At this time the DASH outcome questionnaire score indicated an 81% disability.14 ManagementThis patient was treated eighteen times over an eleven week period. Therapy began with early progressive pas-sive range of motion and Codman exercises and pro-gressed to active movements under supervision as toler - ated. Complementary therapies included electric muscle stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound and class IV laser treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, therapy was fo-cused on rehabilitating the rotator cuff with progressive isometric resistance, therapeutic bands, strengthening parascapular musculature, and preventing soft tissue ad-hesions using manual release methods and instrument as-sisted techniques. Diversified chiropractic manipulations of the cervical spine were administered for joint restric- tions as indicated and mobilizations of the ribs and thor - acic spine were also performed to tolerance. Outcome Nineteen weeks after the initial injury, this patient demon-strated pain free active ranges of motion in the shoulder with only slight crepitations at the scapulothoracic inter - face and a DASH score reduced to 5% disability .14 In a two year follow-up discussion by telephone the patient reported 100% mobility had been maintained with mild residual pain present at times only with sleeping on the injured side. Case 3History A 23 year old right-handed Caucasian male construction laborer was involved in a high speed motor vehicle col-lision. He was the driver of a mid-sized sedan that was struck from the passenger side in an intersection by an-other sedan estimated to be traveling at 75 MPH, causing his car to flip over seven times. At impact, his shoulder restraint was broken and he was thrown into the back seat of the car where he was wedged between the back seat and the rear windshield. He did not lose consciousness at any time after the collision. The fire department used hydraulic spreaders (Jaws of Life) to extricate him from his wedged-in position. He was transported by helicopter Mercy flight to the emer gency department where radio - graphs and CT scans were performed that revealed a frac-tured scapula. He remained in the hospital overnight and was released the next day with an arm sling and analgesic medication (Darvocet). He consulted with an orthopedic specialist two weeks after the collision where he obtained more radiographs and an MRI examination (not shown). The patient was advised that there was no nerve or muscle damage and that surgery was not necessary and would not improve his outcome. Diagnostic Imaging Radiographs of the right shoulder obtained at the hospi-tal immediately after the injury (Figure 3A) revealed a complete vertical fracture of the neck and axillary bor - der of the scapula with a 2 cm lateral displacement of the entire glenoid process and a triangular fracture fragment that projected inferiorly and laterally into the axilla. The GH joint was intact with no evidence of dislocation. Axial CT (Figure 3B) and reconstructed, surface-rendered 3-D CT images 3C) revealed that the glenoid fragment was internally rotated approximately 20 degrees, as well as an additional minimally displaced comminuted frac-ture of the scapular body. No evidence of pneumothorax, hemothorax, rib or spine fracture was present. Medical Management After examination, the orthopedic surgeon prescribed an-algesic medication and fitted the patient with a shoulder sling for immobilization and advised against surgery. The patient complied with this advice and the pain gradually decreased over time. After being on disability for one year, this patient was unable to return to work in construc-tion because his job was no longer available. However, he did resume work as a security officer at that time. Chiropractic ManagementNine months after the initial injury, the patient presented to a chiropractic college health center seeking chiropractic manual treatment and musculoskeletal rehabilitation for J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2) 181JL An initial radiograph ob- tained on the day of injury reveals a complete vertical fracture of the neck of the scapula and axillary border of the scapula with a 2 cm lateral dis-placement of the entire glenoid pro-cess and a triangular fracture frag-ment that (white 3B: Axial CT bone window image at the glenoid level reveals the internally rotated glenoid fragment (black arrow) as well as an addition-al minimally displaced comminuted fracture of the 3C: Three-dimensional sur - face-rendered CT image viewed from the posterior aspect, clearly illustrates the significant displacement of the tri-angular fragment arising from the glenoid neck and axillary border of the scapula (white arrow), as well as the comminuted fracture of the scapu-lar body (black arrows). Figure 3. Case 3: Figure 3D: A serial radiograph of the shoulder ob- tained in abduction and external rotation 6 years af-ter the injury reveals complete healing of the fractures with significant malunion consisting of a 4 cm long tri-angular subglenoid fragment (white arrow) and a per - sistent defect in the axillary border of the scapula (*).Figure 3E: Clinical photographs obtained 6 years after the initial injury reveal restriction of active internal rotation, ex-tension and adduction of the right shoulder resulting in a 7.5 cm discrepancy between the right and left side on the inferior Apley' s scratch test. Note that the right hand cannot reach as high as the left.182 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2013; 57(2)Comminuted scapular body fractures: A report of three cases managed conservatively in chiropractic settings continued pain in the right scapula and decreased ranges of motion of the right shoulder. The deep muscle pain at presentation ranged from 1 on a scale of 10 while at rest and became sharp rated 5/10 at its worst with internal and external rotation or abduction. Additionally, the pain was aggravated by lifting objects overhead and rotation of the shoulder in a throwing motion. Active stretching and rest provided pain relief. The pain did not radiate into his up-per extremity and did not disrupt sleep except when he rolled onto his right side while recumbent. Physical Examination The patient was 69\" tall, 185 lbs., right handed and ap-peared physically fit. V ital signs, gait, neurologic exam- ination and ambulation were all normal. Active range of motion of the right shoulder was full and pain free in combined flexion and adduction. Active external rotation was 100% restricted and provoked pain at the posterior axillary fold, and combined internal rotation, extension and adduction (Apley's inferior scratch test) of the right shoulder revealed significant restriction on the right com - pared with the left with a 20 cm discrepancy from side to side. The active range of abduction of the right shoul-der was full but provoked pain over the supraspinatus muscle. The right supraspinatus press test was mildly positive for pain. Myofascial trigger points and adhesions were detected in the right cervical spine musculature. These findings were most pronounced in the right infraspinatus muscle which was significantly atrophic compared with the left. This patient was diagnosed at the chiropractic college health center with post-traumatic myofascial parascapu - lar trigger points, myofascitis, muscular adhesions and weakness in the right shoulder musculature involving principally the infraspinatus muscle. He was seen seven times over a 2 month period. Treatment consisted of trig-ger point therapy, progressive isometric resistance using therapeutic bands, manual muscle release methods, in-strument assisted techniques aimed at preventing soft tis-sue adhesions, and passive progressive mobilizations to increase range of motion. The patient was also placed on a muscle strengthening regimen at his gymnasium three times per week to strengthen the parascapular muscula - ture. Diversified chiropractic manipulation and mobiliza -tion of the cervical spine, thoracic spine and ribs were administered on each visit to address joint restrictions as indicated. Outcome The patient reported a significant increase in muscle strength after 2 months. The active range of motion in external rotation improved from 100% restriction to 80% restriction in two months. The inferior Apley's scratch test improved somewhat from the 20 cm pre-treatment discrepancy to a 14 cm post-treatment discrepancy. At the conclusion of the seven visits, he continued to have mild pain which was graded at 2 of 10 with occasional exacerbations as high as 5 after vigorous workouts. He re-ported that the pain was still occasionally severe enough to awaken him at night as a result of rolling onto his right shoulder. After the two month treatment period, the pa-tient was then lost to follow-up. Six years after the initial injury, the patient was con- tacted and he reported for follow-up evaluation and radio-graphic examination. At this point, he was continuing to exercise and reported that the pain was much less fre-quent, and was provoked only by activities such as throw-ing a ball, absorbing body contact in rugby, and lying on his right side. Follow-up radiographs revealed that the fracture of the scapular neck had healed with significant malunion in which a 4 cm long triangular subglenoid fragment remained unattached to the axillary border of the scapular body. While the margins of this projection of bone were rounded and smooth, it projected into the axillary soft tissues (Figure 3D). Examination revealed significant generalized atrophy of the muscles of the right shoulder girdle compared to the left. Ranges of motion were all full and bilaterally symmetric except the inferior Apley's scratch test which exhibited a 7.5 cm discrepancy in ranges of motion from right to left (Figure 3E). He completed a DASH outcome questionnaire that revealed a 23% disability. 14 DiscussionScapular fracture diagnoses are commonly missed or de-layed owing to the extent of associated injuries over-shad-owing the scapula, chest trauma CT scans not covering the entirety of the scapula, unusual mechanisms of injury, low levels of consciousness, or because pain is being con-trolled by corticosteroid injection for 183JL Scarano, M Richardson, fractures have proven to be particularly sig- nificant due to their anatomic proximity to vital structures including the head, lungs, cervical spine and brachial neurovascular structures.2,3 It has been observed that 81- 96% with scapular fractures have associ - ated injury.1, 16,17 The most common associated injuries in these patients are rib fractures.11,18 However, other, more serious injuries can include hemothorax, pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, skull fractures, permanent cord injuries, brachial plexus injuries, complex regional pain syndrome, Horner's Syndrome and subclavian, axillary or brachial artery injury. 1,3,10 As a result, the mortality rate of individuals with scapular fractures, although not usually direct, has been reported to range from 2% to as high as 14.3%.10,11,13 While the vast majority of scapular fractures are man-aged quite successfully without surgery, most agree that surgical management should be considered for severely displaced injuries - most commonly: (1) significantly dis - placed fractures of the glenoid cavity (glenoid rim and glenoid fossa), (2) significant ly displaced fractures of the glenoid neck, and (3) double disruption of the superior shoulder suspensory complex (SSSC) in which one or more elements of the scapula are significantly displaced.9 Currently, 99% of all isolated scapular body fractures are being mana ged non-operatively with an 86% success rate.5 Because of its abundant blood supply, with appro- priate care, scapular fractures can heal rapidly under con-servative management. 8 However, when treating these fractures, there are consequences that can occur even with the current physiotherapy techniques that should be considered. For example, some patients with displaced scapular body fractures may experience a snapping or grating sensation at the scapulothoracic interface with movement through ranges of motion. 1 Persistent soft tis- sue irritation secondary to bone irregularity, callus for - mation of displaced fragments (as seen in Case 3), and heterotopic bone formation are also possibilities, which in some cases may require excision of the mass or ir - regularity for pain relief. 4,19 Other causes of patient dis- satisfaction after scapular healing can include prolonged weakness, pain, crepitations or a disfiguring bump, most common in multi-trauma patients.12 Although nonunion is rare, when a patient complains of persistent shoulder pain after conservative treatment, this possibility must be considered. 20, 21 Following fracture union, in our experience, adjunct - ive manual muscle procedures such as myofascial release, trigger point therapy, and instrument assisted techniques can be performed to relieve spasms and prevent soft tissue adhesions amongst the and chiropractic manipulations of the appro-priate cervical and thoracic motion segments were useful in facilitating biomechanical adaptation and symptomatic manifestations in each case presented here as well as in a case report by Deltoff et al. 22 All three patients in this case series received conserva- tive management for their injuries. The first patient who received 16 weeks of treatment completed a DASH ques- tionnaire at 3 years post injury that revealed functional improvement to 2% disability . The second patient who scored 81% disability 3 weeks after his initial injury , re - ceived 11 weeks of treatment, and at nineteen weeks had improved to 5% disability . The third patient with a more significantly displaced, comminuted fracture that resulted in healing with malunion scored a 23% disability on the DASH questionnaire completed 6 years after his initial injury. Conclusion Research indicates that the vast majority of patients with comminuted scapular fractures can be treated with an immobilizing sling or brace and some form of manual therapy and will heal completely within 6 weeks. 9 Al- though uncommon for such cases of scapular fracture to present in chiropractic offices, these three cases suggest that chiropractic management can help these individuals to achieve symptomatic relief, progressive functional improvements and in most cases, little need for long-term follow-up care.
