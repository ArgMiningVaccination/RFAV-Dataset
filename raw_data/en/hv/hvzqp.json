I trust you will nd the results interesting and informative, but more importantly, I hope they will help to drive actions towards improving community and individual health. In the spring of 2006, the BC-HWS collected key information about the health behaviours of people in 26 communities across all ve regional health authorities. The results, presented in this report, provide a picture of the health and wellness of British Columbians at a more local level than has ever before been available. In reviewing the results of BC-HWS 2006, it is important to remember that the data presented have not been interpreted. The data are presented only for descriptive purposes, to provide a general indication of health and wellness in the communities they refl ect. Toward ensuring we provide the most useful information possible, we welcome your feedback to this report. John Millar PHSA Executive DirectorPopulation Health Surveillance & Disease Control PlanningBritish Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 5 \u00a9 2007 PHSAIntroduction This report presents descriptive data from the BC Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS), an initiative of the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) aimed at developing an understanding of health-related lifestyle patterns of British Columbians. The purpose of the BC-HWS is to empower local communities to: Monitor the Premier's lifestyle targets for ActNow BC and the 2010 Challenge, as well as initiatives designed to address those targets *; Monitor key public health issues to support program planning and evaluation; andAdvocate for public policy development to improve the health of British Columbians. The BC-HWS is modeled after Ontario's Rapid Risk Factor Surveillance System (RRFSS), a randomized telephone survey conducted continuously through the year that monitors health behaviour risk factors and general health. The BC-HWS responds to an urgent need by medical health o cers, epidemiologists, health planners and health administrators for health data at a more local level than has previously been available in BC. Overview of Report This report provides an overview of data collected for the BC-HWS related to the following categories: Socio-demographic characteristics Body mass index (BMI)General healthDiabetesHigh blood pressurePhysical activity levelSedentary activitiesFruit and vegetable consumption * In order to make British Columbia the healthiest jurisdiction ever to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Premier has set the following targets for BC: to increase by 20% the prevalence of those who eat at least ve servings of fruits and vegetables per day; to increase by 20% those who are physically active; to reduce tobacco consumption by 10%; to reduce the prevalence of overweight or obesity; and to increase by 50% those who access information about alcohol risk during pregnancy.\u0084 \u0084 \u0084 \u0084 \u0084\u0084\u0084\u0084\u0084\u0084\u0084British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey Descriptive Report 6 \u00a9 2007 PHSATobacco use Alcohol consumptionPhysical environment for bicycling and recreation Food access and security The methods section of the report describes how the data were collected and analyzed, while the results section describes the variables of interest for the report and presents the data. The report concludes with a descriptive overview of ndings across the local health areas (LHAs)/communities surveyed. The reader is reminded that the purpose of this report is to provide only a descriptive overview of the ndings. Background According to the World Health Organization (WHO), chronic disease accounts for approximately 60% of all deaths worldwide.1 Deaths associated with chronic disease are expected to increase by about 15% in the next decade; based on current trends, 44% of these will be due to diabetes.1 In Canada, chronic diseases account for an even larger proportion of deaths (89%) and are expected to cause the death of two million Canadians over the next decade. 2 The economic impact of premature deaths associated with chronic disease in Canada was estimated at $500 million in 2005, and is projected to reach $9 billion over the next decade. 2 In BC, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes currently account for 10.3% of the health care budget - or about $1.28 billion.3 Addressing the major risk factors for chronic disease, which include an unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use, could decrease the number of deaths associated with heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes by about 80% and prevent about 40% of cancers. 1,4 Primary prevention aimed at reducing the prevalence of such risk factors is seen as integral to addressing the challenge of chronic disease. The need for more e ective prevention strategies has led to an interest among BC LHAs/communities to better understand the health status of their community members, especially regarding the behavioural determinants of health. Until now, only high-level provincial or BC health service delivery area data have been available, through surveys such as Statistics Canada's Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and Health Canada's Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS). While these are valuable sources of public health and prevention data, there is a need for more local data, such as at the municipal or neighbourhood levels. Providing descriptive health data at this level is the speci c intent of the BC-HWS. \u0084 \u0084\u0084\u0084British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 7 \u00a9 2007 PHSAMethods Data Sources Local Health Area (LHA)/Community Selection and Sampling The BC-HWS was designed to collect data and gather information about behavioural determinants of health and general health at the local or community level. Data collection involved 26 LHAs/communities, including ve LHAs/communities from four of BC's ve regional health authorities, and six LHAs from the Interior Health Authority - which provided complete geographic coverage of Interior Health's East Kootenay Health Services Delivery Area. In choosing LHAs/communities for the survey, the health authorities gave priority to those that expressed an interest and to those with the greatest capacity for disseminating the data from the BC-HWS. The initial intent of BC-HWS was to collect data at the local health area (LHA) level. However, given the tremendous variation in population density and diversity among the province's LHAs this plan was changed, and instead, a mix of 11 LHAs and 15 communities was surveyed. To avoid confusion between LHAs and communities, all LHAs are speci cally identi ed as such where mentioned within this report, e.g. Windermere-LHA, Golden-LHA.British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 8 \u00a9 2007 PHSATable 1.

CMA = Census Metropolitain Area Table 1 provides a list of the LHAs and communities surveyed for the BC-HWS. Eleven of the samples (i.e. North Vancouver (city & district), South Vancouver, Fernie, Cranbrook, Kimberley, Windermere, Creston, Golden, Fort Nelson, Prince Rupert, and New Westminster) represented complete coverage of an LHA. Four samples, surveyed separately, yielded complete coverage for two further LHAs. (The community of Vancouver Island North, for example, excludes Port Hardy and Port McNeil, which were surveyed separately to provide complete coverage of LHA 85. The same approach was taken for Alberni/Port Alberni in LHA 70.) All other areas surveyed represent only portions of their respective LHAs. A simple random sample of 400 people in each LHA/community was planned to ensure reliable estimates for most variables of interest. As the surveyed LHAs/communities were not randomly selected by the health authorities, data from the BC-HWS cannot be reliably aggregated at the health authority or provincial level.British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 10 \u00a9 2007 PHSAQuestionnaire The BC-HWS was adapted from Ontario's RRFSS, a telephone survey aimed at providing data across health units in Ontario.5 Additional questions were taken from other sources, such as the CCHS. The BC-HWS comprised 67 questions, which took an average of 17 minutes to complete. The survey included questions on socio-demographic characteristics, height and weight, general health, diabetes, high blood pressure, other chronic diseases, reproductive health, physical activity level, sedentary activities, fruit and vegetable consumption, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, environment for physical activity (bicycling and recreation), and food access and security. Only the main categories from the BC-HWS are included in this report. Data Collection and Procedures BC-HWS data were collected between March and July 2006 using random digit dialling (RDD) methodology for household selection. All samples were drawn from the Canada Survey Sampler software (ASDE Inc. 6) which included both listed and unlisted phone numbers. All interviews were conducted in English using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) technology. Random selection of respondents within a household was achieved using the next birthday method, 7 which involves interviewing the person in the household who is 18 years of age or older and whose birthday will be next. To protect against gender imbalance in the data, quota sampling was used to limit males or females in a community to 55% of the collected sample. A 14-callback protocol was instituted to ensure that sampled households had su cient opportunity to be included in the survey. In total 10,485 interviews were completed within the 26 selected LHAs/communities. Weighting A demographic pro le for each of the selected LHAs/communities was developed using the 2001 Statistics Canada Census data. A weighting scheme was constructed for each LHA/community based on the population demographic pro le and the sampling ratio by gender and by three age groups (18-34, 35-54 and 55+). These weights were used to ensure the correct representation of each LHA/community with respect to age and gender. For technical reasons, unlisted numbers were not available in three Vancouver Coastal Health communities (Grandview/ Woodland, Richmond Blundell, and Richmond Centre). Overall, 20% of the numbers included in the survey sample were unlisted numbers. British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 11 \u00a9 2007 PHSAAnalysis and reporting Descriptive analyses were performed for a subset of variables for each of the LHAs/communities. The following summary statistics are reported: Percentage Median (the mid-point dividing the distribution into upper and lower half; used to summarize the skewed continuous variables) Standard error (SE) (measures the precision of survey estimates)Coe cient of variation (CV) (standard error divided by the survey estimate; a measure of precision in relative terms and expressed as a percentage) 95% con dence interval (95% CI) (an estimated range of values which is likely - i.e. within 95% probability - to include the unknown population parameter.) Survey weights were applied in all estimations. Finite population correction was used in the calculation of the SE, CV and 95% CI to account for small populations in some of the surveyed LHAs/communities. Non-responses were excluded from the estimations if their percentages were low, while non-responses were reported when they were relatively high. The reliability of the estimates was assessed by the magnitude of the CV. Considering the pilot nature of the BC-HWS, the more liberal CV ratings from the Survey of Aquaculture Industry were adopted. 8 The estimates were classi ed as: acceptable , if the CV was less than 25%; interpret with caution , if the CV was between 25% and 34%; and unreliable , if the CV was greater than or equal to 35%. Estimates to be interpreted with caution were fl agged in the reporting tables, whereas unreliable estimates were suppressed. Data from Canadian CCHS Cycle 3.1, 2005 were used to obtain estimates for the health authorities and for BC when the questions were comparable to those of the BC-HWS, and are provided in this report. All analyses were carried out using SAS 9.1, except the estimation of the median and the SE of the median, which were carried out using SUDAAN 9.0.\u0084 \u0084 \u0084 \u0084 \u0084British Columbia Health Descriptive Report 12 \u00a9 2007 PHSAResults Socio-Demographic Data Description of Variables A series of demographic questions were asked, including age, marital status, ethnicity, education and household income. Gender was assessed by the interviewer. For age, respondents indicated the year and month they were born, which was then classi ed into one of three age groups: 18-34; 35-55 and 55+. Marital status was assessed with one question, and the six response categories were collapsed into three categories as follows: married or living with a partner; widowed, divorced, or separated; and never married. Ethnicity was assessed with two questions identical to the 2001 census questions. The rst question asked respondents if they considered themselves to be of aboriginal origin (North American Indian, Metis, Inuit) and those who responded \"no\" were asked to describe their ethnic group (White, Chinese, South Asian, Black, Filipino, Latin American, Southeast Asian, Arab, West Asian, Japanese, Korean, or other). The prevalence of White in these communities is provided in this report. Educational level was assessed by asking the highest educational level attained. Data were categorized as follows: did not graduate from high school; graduated from high school with some post secondary education; and, graduated from university. Finally, the household income question asked about combined income of the respondent and other members in the household. Income was assessed in 12 categories which were collapsed into three: less than $50,000; $50,000 \u0084British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 13 \u00a9 2007 PHSASummary Table 2 and Figure 1 present the age and gender distribution of the populations in BC-HWS LHAs/ communities. Populations ranged from 1,375 to 94,404. Six had populations less than 5,000: Fort Nelson-LHA, Robson Valley/McBride/Valemont, Mackenzie, Smithers/Moricetown, Vancouver Island North, and Hope. A comparison of the BC-HWS sample to the age and gender distribution of the population by LHA/community shows the younger age group as underrepresented and the older group as overrepresented, a typical observation in telephone surveys. 9 As the sampling limited the proportion of males or females in any of the surveyed communities to 55%, females were not overly represented in the BC-HWS as is commonly observed in telephone surveys. 9 Table 2.

Creston-LHA in Interior Health had an older population overall than most LHAs/communities, while Fort Nelson-LHA in Northern Health had a younger population overall. Other socio-demographic characteristics, including marital status, ethnicity, educational level and household income, are presented in Tables 3 and 4 . Most LHAs/communities show more than 60% of their population as married. The exceptions were four of the LHAs/communities in Vancouver Coastal Health (South Vancouver-LHA, Grandview-Woodlands, Richmond Blundell, and Richmond Centre), the Alberni community in Vancouver Island Health and the New Westminster-LHA in Fraser Health. Looking at ethnicity, the percentage of White was above 80% for all but ve LHAs/communities: South Vancouver-LHA Port Hardy/Port McNeil (79.2%). Education level varied by LHA/community. The ve Vancouver Coastal Health LHAs/communities surveyed had a high prevalence of college graduates (over 60%), while the prevalence of college graduates in all ve Northern Health LHAs/communities surveyed was lower than 40%. Finally, the proportion indicating a combined household income of more than $100,000 varied across the LHAs/communities from a low of 4.8% to a high of 27 .1%. In ve communities, at least 20% indicated a household income of greater than $100,000 (North Vancouver-LHA, Fort Nelson-LHA, Mackenzie, Port Moody, and South Surrey/White Rock).

For reporting purposes, the ve-point response format was collapsed into three categories: poor to fair, good, very good to excellent. The general health question was then followed by the chronic disease and risk factor questions. The BC-HWS asked speci cally about diabetes and high blood pressure, given these are risk factors for many other chronic diseases and are a ected by lifestyle behaviours. Respondents were asked whether they had been told by a doctor or health professional that they had diabetes or high blood pressure. Respondents were also asked an open-ended question regarding whether they had been diagnosed by a health professional for any other chronic or mental health conditions. As other chronic diseases and mental health conditions were not listed by name, it was anticipated that the BC-HWS would underestimate the prevalence of these conditions. No comparisons of disease prevalence were made with the CCHS as the questions were not comparable. British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 20 \u00a9 2007 PHSATable 5.

Summary The results for self-reported general health are presented in Table 5 and Figure 2 . The estimated prevalence of reported poor or fair general health ranged from 8.8% (South Surrey/White Rock) to 19.9% (Hope). The variability among the 26 LHAs/communities is depicted in Figure 2 . South Surrey/White Rock and Port Moody have a lower prevalence of poor to fair health than New Westminster-LHA, Mission and Hope, and Creston-LHA, Alberni and Port Alberni (as observed by the non-overlapping CI). Finally, the prevalence estimate for Robson Valley/McBride/Valemont was found to be unreliable, as shown by the wide 95% CI for that community. The estimated prevalence of high blood pressure and diabetes is summarized in Table 6 . The estimated prevalence of high blood pressure ranged from 12.2% in Grandview-Woodlands to 28.9% in Creston-LHA. Creston-LHA had a signi cantly higher prevalence of high blood pressure in comparison with the other ve surveyed LHAs in Interior Health (see Figure 3 ). 5791113151719212325 Richmond rdy/Port McNeil Sooke Alberni Port Alberni South Survey/White Rock Port Moody New Westminster- LHA Mission Hope Percent 5791113151719212325 Richmond rdy/Port McNeil Sooke Alberni Port Alberni South Survey/White Rock Port Moody New Westminster- LHA Mission Hope PercentBritish Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 22 \u00a9 2007 PHSATable 6.

No corresponding measure in the Canadian Community Health Survey for health authorities and British Columbia. The estimated prevalence of diabetes ranged from a low of 2.3% in Robson Valley/McBride/Valemont to 9.8% in Sooke (see Table 6). Although the lowest diabetes prevalence was found in Robson Valley/McBride/Valemont, Prince Rupert-LHA, which is within the same health authority, was more than three times higher (8.4%). More than 20 other chronic diseases were reported by the surveyed population, including heart- related problems, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory problems, mental disorders and arthritis. However, given the sample size for each selected LHA/community and the very low prevalence for these chronic conditions, the estimates were not su ciently reliable to be reported. For heart- related problems, only four LHAs/communities provided estimates with su cient reliability, while none of the LHAs/communities had reliable estimates for reporting the prevalence of stroke. Five LHAs/communities provided reliable estimates for mental disorders, seven for chronic respiratory problems, and 15 for arthritis. For cancer, no LHAs/communities had reliable estimates to report. For this reason, none of these data are included in this report. 5101520253035 Grandview-Woodlands Richmond Centre Mc Neil Sooke Vancouver Island North Port Al ber ni Port Moody New Westminster- LHA Mission South Survey/White Rock Hope Percent Richmond Mc Neil Sooke Vancouver Island North Port Al ber ni Port Moody New Westminster- LHA Mission South Survey/White Rock Hope Percent Richmond BlundellBritish Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 24 \u00a9 2007 PHSABody Mass Index (BMI) BMI is the ratio of a person's weight in relation to his/her height (kg/m2).

LHAs/communities from Vancouver Coastal Health reported a generally lower prevalence of overweight/obesity (40.0% to 44.7%). LHAs/communities in Interior Health, Vancouver Island Health and Fraser Health reported a wide range in the prevalence of overweight/obesity, ranging from 48.1% to 66.1%. Northern Health LHAs/communities reported a similar prevalence of overweight/obesity (62.1% to 64.2%), except for the community of Smithers/Moricetown, which had a self-reported estimate of 53.5% for overweight/obesity.

Estimates for health authorities and British Columbia were based on Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 3.1, 2005. The CCHS estimates of overweight/obesity prevalence for BC and the health authorities are presented in Figure 5 (see dashed and solid horizontal lines). The LHAs/communities surveyed in the BC-HWS followed patterns similar to those of the corresponding health authorities in the CCHS data. It should be noted that self-reported BMI data, as compared to objectively measured BMI data, underestimate the prevalence of overweight/obesity, as women underestimate their weight, men overestimate their height, and individuals with high BMI tend to underestimate their weight. 11 Data from the CCHS suggest that obesity is underestimated by about 7 .8% with self-report.12,13 Data collection methodology has also been found to result in di erent prevalence estimates, with self- report from telephone interviews resulting in lower prevalence as compared with self-report from face-to-face interviews. 12,13 Recent CCHS data include about half from face-to-face interviews and half from telephone interviews, while all the BC-HWS are from telephone interviews.3242526272 Grandview-Woodlands rdy/Port M cNeil Port Alberni Vancouver Island North Port Moody South Survey/White Rock New Westminster- LHA Hope Mission Percent Health authority British Columbia 3242526272 rdy/Port M cNeil Port Alberni Vancouver Island North Port Moody South Survey/White Rock New Westminster- LHA Hope Mission Percent Health authority British ColumbiaBritish Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 27 \u00a9 2007 PHSALifestyle Factors Physical Activity Physical activity was assessed using the 11-question International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form.14 The questions are not limited to leisure time physical activity but rather assess all forms of physical activity, including those activities done as part of household chores, yard work, transportation and work. The questionnaire collects information about physical activity, including vigorous, moderate, and walking activities that were performed in the past seven days and lasted for at least 10 minutes. Vigorous activities are de ned as activities that make one breathe much harder than usual and may include heavy lifting, digging, aerobics or fast bicycling. Moderate intensity physical activities are de ned as activities that make one breath somewhat harder than usual and may include carrying a light load, bicycling at a regular pace, or doubles tennis. The questionnaire provides separate scores for vigorous, moderate, and walking as well as a combined total score. The data are expressed in minutes per week and MET-minutes per week (MET-min/week), where one MET (metabolic equivalent) is equivalent to the amount of energy expended at rest. 15 A MET-minute is computed by multiplying the minutes an activity was performed by the MET level for that activity (see example in the following table). A MET-minute takes into account the intensity of the activity or, alternatively, it can be interpreted as standardized calories for someone who weighs 65 kg. For example, someone who weighs 65 kg and does 30 minutes of walking ve days a week will burn 495 calories or 495 MET-minutes. MET levels MET-min/week for 30 min/day, 5 days Walking = 3.3 Moderate intensity = 4.0Vigorous intensity = 8.03.3 MET s * 30 min * 5 days = 495 MET-min/week 4.0 MET s * 30 min * 5 days = 600 MET-min/week8.0 MET s * 30 min * 5 days = 1200 MET-min/week TOTAL = 2,295 MET-min/week The IPAQ allows the data to be aggregated into levels of physical activity. The original classi cation includes three categories, but we have used an expanded classi cation as used by the Canadian Fitness Lifestyle Research Institute. The levels of physical activity are described below. See Appendix 1 for examples.British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 28 \u00a9 2007 PHSALevel of Physical Activity Description of Physical Activity Levels HighAt least 7 days of some level of physical activity and achieving 3000 MET-min/week ORVigorous activity on 3 or more days of the week and achieving 3000 MET-min/week Moderately ActiveAt least 7 days of activity and achieving 1500 MET-min/week OR3 or more days of vigorous activity and achieving 1500 MET-min/week Somewhat Active3 to 6 days of vigorous activities at least 20 min per day OR5 to 6 days of moderate activities or walking at least 30 min per dayOR5 days of any combinations of activities per week and achieving 600 MET-min per week Sedentary Does not meet any of the above physical activity criteria CCHS collects information about leisure time over the previous three months. Since the CCHS does not include all forms of physical activity, its classi cation levels are not comparable to those of the IPAQ. As the recommendation for adults in Canada is to accumulate 60 minutes of physical activity on most days of the week, combining the sedentary and somewhat active categories provides an estimate of those who do not meet current Canadian physical activity guidelines. Summary Results from the IPAQ are summarized in Tables 8 and 9 and Figure 6 . As the data are highly skewed, Table 8 presents the median minutes of vigorous, moderate, and walking activities in the past week. The median time spent in vigorous physical activity ranged from a low of 59 min/week (Richmond Blundell) to a high of 180 min/week (Alberni). The median time for moderate activities ranged from 44 min/week (Richmond Centre) to 228 min/week (Robson Valley/McBride/Valemont). Walking ranged from 148 min/week (Richmond Centre) to 298 min/week (Alberni). British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 29 \u00a9 2007 PHSATable 8.

Table 9 and Figure 6 present levels of physical activity for all LHAs/communities. Combining the sedentary and somewhat active categories provides an estimate of those who are at increased risk for physical inactivity-related health conditions. Physical inactivity ranged from a low of 18.3% (Alberni) to a high of 41.0% (Richmond Blundell). Levels of physical inactivity were higher for three of the communities in Vancouver Coastal Health (South Vancouver, Richmond Blundell and Richmond Centre) and New Westminster-LHA in Fraser Health, than for most of the other LHAs/communities surveyed. As indicated earlier, the IPAQ data are not comparable to the CCHS data, and it is known that the IPAQ yields a higher prevalence estimate 16 of people meeting the Canadian physical activity recommendations than any other survey. Therefore, these prevalence estimates must be interpreted cautiously. The validity and reliability of the instrument have been established 14 and the data are reliable enough to allow LHAs/communities to be compared and to identify LHAs/communities at higher risk, but any prevalence estimate comparisons with other physical activity surveys may not be meaningful. 1015202530354045 Grandview-Woodlands rdy/Port McNeil Vancouver Island North Sooke Port Alberni Mission Hope South Survey/White Rock Port Moody New Westminster- LHA Percent rdy/Port McNeil Vancouver Island North Sooke Port Alberni Mission Hope South Survey/White Rock Port Moody New Westminster- LHA Percent Richmond CentreBritish Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 32 \u00a9 2007 PHSASedentary Activities The sedentary questions were taken directly from the CCHS questionnaire (version 3.1), which asked about time spent at computers, playing video games, watching TV and reading. The questions asked how much time in a typical week the person spent on each of these sedentary activities. The response categories were: none, less than an hour, one to two hours, three to ve hours, 11 to 14 hours, 15 to 20 hours and more than 20 hours. Total sedentary activities were derived by taking the sum of the mid-point of the response category across the four questions. This report presents time spent watching TV as well as total time for sedentary activities. Although the questions were the same as for CCHS, CCHS asked the video games questions only to those 19 years and younger. Therefore, the BC-HWS results were not compared to the CCHS results. Summary Table 10 presents the number of hours per week spent watching TV, and total hours of sedentary activity. The estimated prevalence of being sedentary for at least 30 hr/week (more than 3 hr/day) ranged from a low of 13.1% (Windermere-LHA and Robson Valley/McBride/Valemont) to a high of 29% (Richmond Blundell). Figure 7 shows the ve surveyed Vancouver Coastal LHAs/communities and Creston-LHA as having a somewhat higher prevalence of sedentary activity than all other LHAs/communities.

Respondents were asked to indicate if they consumed the following: 100% fruit juices and tomato juice, fruits, green salad, non-fried potatoes, carrots, and other vegetables. Respondents were asked \"How many times per day, week, or month ...\" they consumed these items, whereas the CCHS surveyed population was asked \"How often do you usually...\" consume these items, and were then asked to select the reporting period, which could be per day, week, month, or year. Given these negligible di erences between the BC-HWS and the CCHS, the data are considered comparable. Canada's Food Guide to Healthy Eating recommends that adults consume ve to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Therefore, data from the six questions were aggregated into three consumption categories: less than three servings per day; three to four per day; and ve or more per day. Summary Table 11 presents the patterns of fruit and vegetable consumption for the 26 LHAs/communities. The estimated prevalence of consuming less than three fruits and vegetables per day ranged from a low of 14.6% (South Surrey/White Rock) to a high of 25.4% (Mission). Close to 60% of the surveyed population do not consume the recommended level of ve or more fruits and vegetables per day: the estimated prevalence ranged from 51.9% (Smithers/Moricetown) to 67 .4% (New Westminster-LHA). The estimated prevalence of high alcohol consumers ranged from a low of 3.9% (Richmond Centre and Cranbrook-LHA) to a high of 13.2% (Alberni) (see Table 12 ).

One question asked if the person had smoked 100 cigarettes in his/her lifetime, and those who answered yes were asked to indicate if they currently smoke every day, some days, or not at all. Although the tobacco consumption questions are not identical to the CCHS questions, they are similar enough to be compared (e.g. \"daily\" is used instead of \"every day,\" and \"occasionally\" instead of \"some days\"). The data are summarized into three categories of smoking status: never smoked, former smoker, and current smoker. Alcohol consumption was assessed with four questions. The questions asked the following: have you had a drink in the past year, do you drink alcohol every day, how many days a week do you drink, and on average about how many drinks do you consume on those days? The alcohol questions are not comparable to CCHS. The alcohol data were summarized using the Heart and Stroke Foundation guideline for drinking at a safe level, de ned as consuming one to two drinks per day to a weekly maximum of 14 for men and nine for women. 17 Men and women who reported consuming more than the Canadian guideline are classi ed as consuming alcohol at a high risk. In addition, pregnant women who consumed any alcohol were considered high risk consumers. Summary As shown in Table 12 , the prevalence of current smokers varies from a low of 9.2% (South Vancouver-LHA) to a high of 31.7% (Port Hardy/Port McNeil). As shown in Figure 10 , the estimated prevalence of current smokers tends to be lower than the BC average for four LHAs/communities surveyed in Vancouver Coastal Health, one in Interior Health and two in Fraser Health. In contrast, the estimated prevalence of current smokers appears to be higher than the BC average for three of the LHAs/communities surveyed in Northern Health and four in Vancouver Island Health.

With the exception of the questions about type of housing in the neighbourhood and number of motorized vehicles, the response format for all questions was a four-point ordinal scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree). The report presents data on the questions that focused on having access to bicycle and recreational facilities. It should be noted that questions about environmental barriers have most often been used to survey larger/urban areas, and the availability of bicycle trails may not be as relevant for people in more rural areas. Summary The perceived level of opportunities to bicycle in the neighbourhood (e.g. access to bicycle trails and lanes) is presented in Table 13 . The prevalence of the surveyed population disagreeing that there are facilities in or near the neighbourhood for cycling ranged from a low of 16.2% (Grandview/ Woodlands) to a high of 87 .0% (Creston-LHA), where a low value is indicative of perceiving one's neighbourhood as having many facilities for cycling.

Household food security is the application of this concept to the family level, with individuals within households as the focus of concern\". 20 In the BC-HWS, food security was assessed with six questions. Three questions asked if lack of money resulted in: not having enough food to eat, not having quality and variety of food to eat, or worrying that there might not be enough to eat. If the person indicated yes to any of those questions, the household was classi ed as being food insecure. Depending on which question was answered yes, respondents received a follow-up question. If they reported not having enough to eat, they were asked if they could go to a family member, a friend, a food bank, or other places to eat; those who reported not having the quality and variety of food to eat were asked if they had a place to go to get better food; and nally those who reported worrying about not having enough to eat were asked if they did not get enough to eat, did they have a place to go? The follow-up questions were summarized as follows: among those who reported being food insecure, did the respondent report having a place to go? Although the CCHS asked about food access and security, the questions are not comparable to the BC-HWS and are not reported here. Summary Table 14 and Figure 14 present the food insecurity results. The estimated prevalence of food insecurity varies from a low of 5.1% (Mackenzie), to a high of 21.9% (Grandview-Woodlands), representing those households that reported lacking money to have enough food, to have quality and variety of food, or who worried there might not be enough to eat. Grandview-Woodlands had a higher prevalence of food insecurity than the other four surveyed LHAs/communities in Vancouver Coastal Health. Table 14 also displays the prevalence of not having a place to go for people who were food insecure. Given that the prevalence of food insecurity is relatively low, 11 of the LHA/community estimates for not having a place to go were suppressed or fl agged for being unreliable. Among those respondents who reported being food insecure, the prevalence of not having a place to go ranged from a low of 12.6% (Robson Valley/McBride/Valemont) to a high of 56.6% (Mackenzie), excluding those LHAs/communities with suppressed estimates.British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 48 \u00a9 2007 PHSATable 14.

The results across the 12 variables reported were colour-coded into quintiles. The lightest color (quintile 1) in the table represents the lowest level of health risk among the 26 LHAs/communities, while the darkest colour (quintile 5) identi es LHAs/communities with the highest level of health risk. Examination of these colour patterns across and within LHAs/communities is most useful for identifying overall issues at the LHA/community level and for identifying local resources and infrastructure needed for primary prevention. However, it is important to understand that patterns observed at the LHA/community level cannot be directly extrapolated to patterns or associations at the individual level. Categorizing the data into quintiles provides a quick way of looking at the data; however doing so results in some loss of information (e.g., the degree of di erences among the LHAs/communities). For some variables there may be little di erence between the top and bottom quintiles, while for other variables these di erences may be much larger. To help interpret the quintiles, Table 15 provides the prevalence range for each variable as well as the high and low value observed for that variable. With these caveats in mind, this section of the report describes patterns observed at the LHA/community level that may be helpful for developing lifestyle interventions.

All Vancouver Coastal LHAs/communities were ranked in the top quintile (quintile 1) for BMI and in the top two for access to bicycling and recreational facilities; however, they were ranked in the bottom two quintiles (quintiles 4 and 5) for physical activity and sedentary activities. These results indicate, at an LHA/community level, that having lower levels of overweight/obesity is not necessarily correlated with having the most active population. Although physical activity e orts are often part of obesity control e orts, there is much evidence suggesting that physical activity is an independent risk factor, irrespective of obesity. 21,22 Blair and colleagues have shown that people who are physically t and overweight/obese have lower cardiovascular disease, coronary health disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and cancer than those who are un t and of normal weight. The pattern observed in these LHAs/communities highlights that it is important to not only focus on BMI levels but also to evaluate levels of physical activity. Examining patterns among the ve lifestyle variables (physical activity, sedentary activities, fruit and vegetable consumption, tobacco use and alcohol use) provides a view on behaviours which may be modi ed through primary interventions. The community of Smithers/Moricetown had all ve lifestyle variables ranked in either the top or second quintiles. Fernie-LHA and Golden-LHA had four of ve lifestyle variables in the top two quintiles. None of the LHAs/communities had all ve lifestyle variables ranked in the bottom two quintiles, although Grandview-Woodlands had four of the lifestyle variables in the bottom two quintiles. Although examination of the quintiles provides an easy way to compare the LHAs/communities, it is important to also evaluate the prevalence of these lifestyle variables in terms of their meeting or not meeting BC or Canadian recommendations. However, examination of the patterns can be helpful in developing multi-behavioural interventions. Although not all possible patterns have been highlighted, it is hoped that people from these LHAs/communities can shed some light on the observed patterns. British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 53 \u00a9 2007 PHSALimitations This descriptive report is intended to present (rather than interpret) the BC-HWS data and to highlight some seemingly important di erences among the 26 surveyed LHAs/communities. In reviewing the BC-HWS data it is important to consider the limitations of the data and the survey. As the data were collected over a three-month period, it is important to note the estimates might be biased, as many of the lifestyle behaviours assessed through the survey are a ected by seasonality. 23,24 Therefore, the prevalence estimates in this report may not be accurate or comparable to other survey results. However, as the bias should be consistent across the 26 surveyed LHAs/communities, the data are reliable enough to allow LHA/community comparisons, as done in this report. In addition, any di erence in the data collection methodology has an impact on prevalence estimates. Therefore any divergence from the CCHS data, for example (which used telephone and face-to-face interviews as opposed to only telephone-based interviews as was done for the BC-HWS) should be interpreted with caution. By comparing the BC-HWS distribution of educational levels with those from the 2001 census data for the surveyed LHAs/communities, it was observed that respondents without a high school diploma were underrepresented in the survey, while respondents who graduated from college were overrepresented. Although this is often observed in telephone surveys, 9 the bias may be more pronounced in the BC-HWS than would normally be expected. This should be considered in the interpretation of the data. Similarly, other observed di erences in the socio-demographic characteristics of the surveyed LHAs/communities should be carefully considered when interpreting the results of the BC-HWS. A further limitation of the data, mentioned in the methods section of this report, is that the 26 surveyed LHAs/communities were not randomly selected, and therefore their prevalence estimates cannot be generalized for their respective health authorities. Where possible, the corresponding CCHS data estimate for the province and each health authority are provided. As the LHAs/communities were not randomly selected, they cannot be expected to have patterns similar to those refl ected by the CCHS data. The CCHS data are provided simply as background information. Any comparisons with the BC-HWS data, or interpretation of the BC-HWS data based on such comparisons, should be made with caution. British Columbia Health and Wellness Survey (BC-HWS) Descriptive Report 54 \u00a9 2007 PHSAConcluding Remarks The results of the BC-HWS provide a view on di erences at the LHA/community level across a number of health-related lifestyle variables. They highlight the di erences that exist among the 26 surveyed LHAs/communities and will challenge those LHAs/communities to examine the patterns in their data toward explaining the observed variability. As a recent report from the WHO suggests, developing population-wide approaches to health o ers a solution for reducing the growing cost of chronic disease in Canada. 1 In fact, the WHO estimates that reducing the prevalence of risk factors associated with chronic disease in Canada by 2% would result in a saving of $1 billion over 10 years.1,2 The economic impact of unhealthy behaviours is signi cant, and population-based strategies are desperately needed to help address this issue. Surveillance plays an important role in primary prevention as both a means of evaluating prevention e orts, and as a way of informing communities about their health status and empowering them to take action to help curtail the rise of chronic disease at the local level. More in-depth analyses of the BC HWS data are planned to help explain the patterns observed among the surveyed LHAs/communities. In addition, input from these LHAs/communities on the types of data and usefulness of the data presented here is being sought. The intent is to delineate the data most useful for identifying overall issues at the LHA/community level and for identifying resources and infrastructure needed at an LHA/community level for primary prevention initiatives.
