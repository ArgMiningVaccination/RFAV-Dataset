On this page Complementary therapy is known by many different terms, including complementary medicine, alternative therapy, alternative medicine, holistic therapy and traditional medicine. A wide range of treatments exist under the umbrella term 'complementary therapy', which makes it difficult to offer a blanket definition. Complementary therapies are used alongside conventional medicines or treatments. Alternative therapies are sometimes grouped with complementary therapies, but they refer to different concepts. Alternative therapies are used in place of conventional medicines or treatments. There is evidence to support the use of some complementary therapies, but alternative therapies are typically unproven or have been shown to be ineffective. There is no scientific or medical evidence for some complementary therapies and many alternative therapies, and they may be unsafe or cause harmful side effects. Complementary therapies and conventional medicine Conventional medicine is based on rigorous science and evaluation. Historically this has not been the case for complementary therapies. Some complementary therapies have now been tested in good quality scientific trials, but most have not. Conventional medicine and complementary therapies can often be used alongside each other. However, it is important to tell your doctor and your complementary practitioner of all medicines, treatments and remedies you take or use. Misuse of complementary therapies, incorrect diagnosis, or delaying use of conventional treatment may pose an increased risk to your health. Some complementary therapies have the potential to cause side effects or interact with conventional medicines. Never stop taking prescribed [medications](/conditionsandtreatments/medications), or change the dose, without first discussing with your doctor.

Use of complementary therapies Complementary and alternative therapies are estimated to be used by up to two thirds of people in Australia. Many complementary medicines are readily available and can mistakenly be considered safe when they come from 'natural' products. This is not necessarily the case, particularly if the dose is greater than that which occurs naturally in food. Complementary medicines can cause harmful effects in some people, including severe allergic reactions. Many complementary medicines contain active ingredients that people may not recognise. Cases of contamination have also been reported. As a precaution, do not use complementary medicines in children or if you are [pregnant](/healthyliving/pregnancy), attempting to become pregnant, or [breastfeeding](/health/healthyliving/breastfeeding). Ask your healthcare professional about the potential benefits and harms of any complementary therapy before using it. Philosophies of complementary therapies Complementary therapies tend to share a few core beliefs, including: - Illness occurs if the body is out of balance. - The body can heal itself and maintain a healthy state if given the right conditions. - The whole person should be treated, not just the disease or the symptoms. - The gentlest therapies must be tried first before harsher ones. - There is no quick fix, since healing and balance take time. - Natural products are preferable to synthetic ones.
