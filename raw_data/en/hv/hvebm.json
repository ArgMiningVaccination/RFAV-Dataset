Blood analysis may be appropriate in situations when it is suspected that a person is actively under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Since drugs are rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body, blood analysis offers a very brief detection window. Drugs in blood are typically detectable within minutes to hours, depending on the drug and the dose, versus one to several days in urine. Blood drug screen tests are performed on whole blood specimens using immunoassay screening with reflex to definitive testing. To set up a blood drug testing program, [contact Labcorp sales](https://www.labcorp.com/organizations/employers/contact).
