COVID-19 has had a devastating global impact, with over 110 million persons infected and 2.4 million deaths to date.1 While the burden of the pandemic is incalculable, it has resulted one major scientific achievement: the fastest creation and approval of an effective vaccine ever seen. With an end-goal of vaccinating the entire eligible United States (US) population, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created a phased rollout plan that first prioritizes the elderly and those individuals at the highest risk of exposure to, or severe illness from, COVID-19. Many adults with acquired cardiovascular disease and adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients fall into a medically high-risk group. To best identify those patients at the highest cardiovascular risk of severe illness, the ACC has released a [Heath Policy Statement on Cardiovascular Disease Consideration for COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritization](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2021.02.017).2 Current Vaccine Landscape Two vaccines, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, have received Emergency Use Authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration. Both are two-dose series with excellent efficacy. In Phase 3 trials, the Pzifer-BioNTech vaccine (n=43,449) conferred 95% protection, and the Moderna vaccine (n=30,420) 94.1% protection, from infection. Equally important is that subjects who become infected with COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated experience substantial protection from severe illness.3,4 Pfizer-BioNTech is currently approved in persons 16 years old, and Moderna 18 years old. Details on the other vaccine candidates currently under investigation can be found at: [https://www.idsociety.org/COVID-19-real-time-learning-network/vaccines/vaccines/](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/vaccines/vaccines/). It is vitally important that clinicians make time to educate their patients on these vaccines, as this rapid vaccine production has been met with public safety concerns and skepticism. Both vaccines are highly reactogenic, eliciting a strong immune response. Minor side effects are common, particularly after the second dose, and include injection site pain, fever, headache, chills, myalgia, and fatigue.3-5 Severe reactions are uncommon, though available data at this time can only speak towards short-term safety issues. Vaccination of the population at large has the potential to reveal previously unknown rare side effects.5 Anaphylactic reaction is extremely rare, with rates reported at 4.7 cases per million doses for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 2.5 cases per million doses for the Moderna vaccine.6 Patients with a prior severe allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components should not receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Misconceptions about the vaccines should be addressed and may include concerns over the vaccination causing COVID-19 infection and that receiving the vaccine may worsen a patient's underlying heart disease. Patients with a history of COVID-19 infection should also be educated on the necessity of vaccination for potentially longer-lasting immunity. How Do ACHD Patients Fit into the Prioritization Schedule? The ACHD population is extremely heterogeneous. Disease severity has traditionally been classified with an emphasis on anatomic complexity. [The 2018 AHA/ACC ACHD Guidelines](https://www.jacc.org/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.jacc.2018.08.1028?download=true) introduced a novel classification system based on a combination of anatomic and physiologic characteristics.7 The addition of physiologic staging adds greater insight into a patient's functional status and active hemodynamic issues (Table 1). Table 1 |Stage A||Stage C| arrhythmias Normal exercise capacity Normal renal/hepatic/pulmonary function |NYHA FC III symptoms | Significant (moderate or greater) valvular disease; moderate or greater ventricular dysfunction (systemic, Moderate aortic significant shunt Arrhythmias controlled with treatment Pulmonary hypertension (less than severe) End-organ dysfunction responsive to therapy |Stage B||Stage D| ventricular enlargement, Trivial or small shunt (not hemodynamically significant) Arrhythmia not requiring treatment Abnormal objective cardiac limitation to exercise |NYHA FC IV symptoms | Severe aortic enlargement Arrhythmias refractory to treatment Severe hypoxemia (almost always with cyanosis) Severe pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome Refractory end-organ dysfunction The ACC recommends that ACHD patients at an advanced, decompensated physiologic stage be considered among the highest risk cardiac patients and prioritized for vaccination. In a single-center cohort of 53 CHD patients with COVID-19 infection (10 pediatric, 43 adults), advanced physiologic stage (C or D), but not increasing complexity of anatomy, was associated with an increased odds of having moderate or severe illness (OR 19.38, p=0.002).8 Thus, a single ventricle patient post-Fontan palliation with excellent intracardiac hemodynamics may fare better than a repaired tetralogy of Fallot patient with significant valve regurgitation or profound ventricular dysfunction. A large-scale multicenter study launched through a collaborative effort between Adult Congenital Heart Association (ACHA) and the International Society for Adult Congenital Heart Disease is currently underway. Preliminary findings shared at a recent ACHA webinar offer support to the ACC recommendation to prioritize physiologic stage C and D patients. The Fight Against COVID-19 Continues Vaccination remains only part of the solution. Approximately 17.9 million people in the US, 5.4% of the population, have been fully vaccinated. Another 24.8 million (7.6% of the population) have received an initial vaccine dose.9 Population immunity to COVID-19 transmission and infection is not likely to be achieved until at least 67% of the US population is vaccinated.5,10 At the same time, new strains of COVID-19, for which the current vaccines may be less efficacious, are becoming increasingly prevalent. Wearing facemasks, hand washing, and social distancing remain crucial to slowing viral spread and for protecting our patients and ourselves from infection. We will get through this together and must continue to support each other to get across the finish line.
