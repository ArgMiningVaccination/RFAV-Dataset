WHAT IS IT? 50 - 30 - 20 Yoga is a 60-minute yoga practice that references the 50-20-30 principle for a balanced and optimized approach to Mind-Body wellness. HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TYPES OF YOGA? It places importance to each of the 3 main components: Move, Breathe and Meditate, unlike other yoga classes which are focused mostly/solely on giving the body a workout. 50% MOVE: 30 MINS PHYSICAL YOGA (ASANA) Asana is the practice of yoga postures, and derives from the Sanskrit word 'seat'. Your body is the vessel through which you experience and interact with the world. Physical yoga helps to maintain your vessel, improving your flexibility, restoring mobility and prevent muscle atrophy (which decreases with age), while balancing your daily energy consumption, shown in studies published by medical journals such as the International Journal of preventive medicine. 20% BREATHE: 12 MINS BREATH CULTIVATION (PRANAYAMA) Though we are breathing all the time few of us are conscious of how we breathe. Breath is life; how you breathe impacts the quality of your life. Pranayama is a set of breath regulation practices, and can be translated as 'cultivation' of 'life force'. Pranayama works like a stock you invest in that reaps dividends when you're older. Practising pranayama brings physical benefits (weight loss, cardiovascular health and improving digestion) and mental benefits (improved concentration, reduced stress) for your health, as evidenced by studies published by the International Journal of Yoga. 30% MEDITATE: 18 MINS MEDITATION Like the body, the mind is like a muscle. To prevent atrophy, it needs to be exercised. Dhyana, loosely translated as meditation, works like a software upgrade for your operating system. By practising meditation, you can improve your attention and awareness, and over time improving your mental clarity and emotional stability. This is evidenced by the results of fMRI / EEG studies by Harvard neuroscientists in the medical journal Neuroreport, which examined the effect of meditation on brain regions such as the hippocampus, posterior cingulate, Pons and Amygdala.
