This is the sixth set of warning letters the FTC has announced as part of its ongoing efforts to protect consumers from health-related COVID-19 scams. In all, the Commission has sent [similar letters to more than 160 companies and individuals](/coronavirus/enforcement/warning-letters). Most of the letters announced today target \"treatments\" offered in clinics or medical offices, including intravenous (IV) Vitamin C and D infusions, supposed stem cell therapy, and vitamin injections that may at first glance appear to be based in medicine or proven effective. However, currently there is no scientific evidence that these, or any, products or services can treat or cure COVID-19. The FTC sent the letters announced today to the companies and individuals listed below. The recipients are grouped based on the type of therapy, product, or service they pitched as preventing or treating COVID-19. Intravenous (IV) and Ozone Therapies, Immunity Boosting Injections: [Arizona Natural Medicine Physicians PLLC](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_swro_arizona_natural_medicine.pdf)(Chandler, Arizona) [Doll [East [Enliven](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_dap_enliven.pdf)(Odessa, Texas) [Gonino Center Stem California) Electromagnetic Field Blocking Health](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_julie_e._health.pdf)(Redondo Beach, California) Essential Clinic](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_post_falls_naturopathic_clinic.pdf)(Post Falls, Idaho) [Renaissance Heath Centre](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_renaissance_health_centre.pdf)(Las Vegas, Nevada) Vitamins, Supplements, and Chinese Herbal Treatments: [Bixa Human](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_bixa_human.pdf)(online only) [Bodhi Glyphix](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_bodhi_glyphix.pdf)(Wales Center, New York) Herbal Clinic](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_cho_acupuncture_herbal_clinic.pdf)(Norcross, Georgia) [Dramov Naturopathic Medical California) Feed](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_the_feed.pdf)(Boulder, Colorado) [The Nutritional Healing Center of Ann Arbor](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_dap_darren_schmidt_nutritional_healing_center.pdf)(Ann Arbor, Michigan) [Utopia Silver Supplements](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_utopiasilver.pdf)(Utopia, Texas) In the letters, the FTC states that one or more of the efficacy claims made by the marketers are unsubstantiated because they are not supported by scientific evidence, and therefore violate the FTC Act. The letters advise the recipients to immediately stop making all claims that their products can treat or cure COVID-19, and to notify the Commission within 48 hours about the specific actions they have taken to address the agency's concerns. The letters also note that if the false claims do not cease, the Commission may seek a federal court injunction and an order requiring money to be refunded to consumers. In April, the FTC announced its [first case against a marketer of such products](/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/thrive-supplement-marketer-agrees-preliminary-order-barring-him), Marc Ching, doing business as Whole Leaf Organics. The FTC worked in coordination with the Office of the Texas Attorney General in issuing the warning letter to Hot Springs Biofeedback, and appreciates its assistance.
