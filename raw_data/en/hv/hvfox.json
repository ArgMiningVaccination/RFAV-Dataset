The International Organization for Mi gration has estimated that 192 million people globally, or 3 percent of the world's population, live outside of their country of birth.2 Worldwide, even more people migrate within their country than out of it.3 According to the WHO, migration can often have serious heal th consequences for migrants because of challenges involving \"discrimination, language and cultural barriers, legal status and other economic and social difficulties.\"4 Indeed, the global financial crisis has particularly thrown into relief the plight of migrants as it ha s exacerbated health and social inequalities.5 Since the emergence of the HIV epidemic, migra nt populations have re ceived considerable recognition from the international community in the context of risk, spread, and prevention of HIV/AIDS. 6 However, despite the long recognition of migration's relationship to HIV vulnerability, states have largely failed to ensure that internal and international migrants have access to HIV treatment. Instead, many states have implemented discriminatory laws and policies that restrict the entry, stay or residence of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) and serve to limit the access of internal and international migrants to treatment services within the state. Furthermore, in many countries migrants are deported without adequate consideration of the availability of HIV treatment in the country of origin and without sufficient provision for continuity of care. Given the global scale and frequency of migra tion worldwide, a rational public health strategy toward HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment cannot include any form of discrimination against migrants. Denying treatment to migrants will only serve to perpetuate transmission and frustrate efforts toward contro lling the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Interruptions in HIV treatment occasioned by restrictions on en try, stay, or residence in a state, limits on movement within a state, barriers to access, or deportation can lead to illness, development of drug resistance, and death. 7 This document provides a brief overview of so me of the human rights challenges that HIV- positive migrants face and related public he alth consequences at every stage of the migration process, from restrictions on entry, stay, and residence, to official and unofficial barriers to accessing prevention and treatm ent services, to deportation and lack of continuity of treatment upon return to the coun try of origin. Despite recognition of the links between HIV and mobility and periodic pledges to deliver care, millions of migrants fail to Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 2 obtain or maintain access to the HIV treatmen t they need and risk needless illness, drug resistance, and premature death. Only with conc erted global effort on the part of states, international agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and donors, will human rights violations against HIV-positive indivi duals be eliminated and migrants' rights to health be fully realized. 3 Human Rights Watch | June 2009 HIV-Related Restrictions on Entry, Stay and Residence Scope of the Issue As of September 2008, 66 of the 186 countries in the world for which data were available placed special entry, stay, or residence restri ctions on PLHIV. These restrictions take two general forms. The first is an absolute ban on entry for PLHIV, and the second involves restrictions on longer term (generally grea ter than three months) residence. The most comprehensive database to track these restri ctions has found that among countries for which information is available, 14 countries ei ther categorically refuse entry of PLHIV or require disclosure of the status (likely leading to exclusion). The remainder of countries that impose restrictions require documentation of HI V sero-status for longer-term stays. In such cases, an HIV-positive result for an individu al applying for a long-term student or work permit in a country usually will lead to refusal of entry or deportation.8 As the World Health Organization has declared, HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay, and residence are not beneficial from a public health standpoint. 9 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have also uneq uivocally stated that restrictions on the rights to liberty of movement and choice of residence based on HI V status alone cannot be justified by public health concerns,10 since, while HIV is infectious, it cannot be transmitted through casual contact.11 HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay, and residence may, in fact, negatively impact public health for several reasons. First, these restrictions contribute to and reinforce stigma and discrimination against migrant PLHIV by lending credence to the idea that non- nationals are a danger from which the nation al population must be protected, and by prejudicially implying that PLHIV will act irre sponsibly in transmitting the infection. The restrictions make it difficult to discuss HIV is sues in public, decreasing prevention, testing, and treatment opportunities and uptake, and further isolating and marginalizing PLHIV. Singling out HIV for entry restrictions and ma ndatory testing has also been criticized by experts on the grounds that it creates a false sense of security in a country's nationals that only migrants are at risk for HIV. International Law National restrictions on entry, stay, and re sidence that single out PLHIV broadly violate international human rights law provisions ba nning discrimination and upholding equality before the law.12 Following the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 4 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees all persons the right to equal protection of the law without discrimination ba sed on race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or soci al origin, property, birth, or other status.13 The UN Commission on Human Rights has interpreted th is provision to include discrimination based on HIV status.14 States must respect this right for all individuals within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction, regardless of ci tizenship. Indeed, the Human Rights Committee - the ICCPR's monitoring body - has noted that while a state has in principle the authority to determine whom to admit to its territory, in the context of discrimination considerations, aliens still enjoy the protection of the Covenant in relation to entry or residence.15 Restrictions against entry, stay, and residence based on HIV status also run contrary to related human rights principles. As UNAIDS has noted, the implementation of these restrictions has regularly violated the human rights principle of non-refoulement of refugees (which prohibits return to a place where life or freedom is threatened),16 obligations to protect the family, protection of the best interest s of the child, the right to privacy, the right to freedom of association, the right to info rmation, and the rights of migrant workers.17 These restrictions also affect the individual's rights to seek asylum and to work, as well as the rights to education, the highest attainable standard of health, dignity, and life. According to international human rights law, as set out for example in the Siracusa Principles, to avoid being classified as imp ermissible discrimination, any difference in treatment that has a negative impact on a partic ular group - e.g. persons living with HIV or AIDS - has to be justified by being necessary to achieve a compelling purpose and be the least restrictive (meaning least discrimi natory) means of achieving that purpose.18 However, while preservation of public health is a compel ling purpose that might justify some forms of restrictions, HIV-related distinctions in entry, stay, and residence do not actually protect public health, and are too broad and coercive to be the least restrictive means to achieve this end.19 Case Studies Labor Migrants UNAIDS has determined that the greatest impac t of HIV-related entry, stay, and residence restrictions lies on labor migrants,20 of whom there are approximately 86 million worldwide.21 Frequently, unskilled or semi-skilled labor migrants are subject to mandatory HIV testing prior to departure, are unable to work overseas if found to be positive, and are subject to regular mandatory testing during residence overseas, with summary deportation resulting from a positive test. A 2005 study found that HIV-positive Filipino migrant workers in 5 Human Rights Watch | June 2009 numerous destination countries we re deported without counseling or ability to claim unpaid wages or possessions, and were, in some cases, confined in a hospital pending deportation (in one case in Saudi Arabia for as long as 11 months).22 Human Rights Watch has also documented pre-departure HIV testing without informed consent, confidentiality or access to test results of prospective migrant workers in Sri Lanka23 and the deportation of migrants who test positive for HIV from Saudi Arabia.24 These human rights violations are exacerbated by the fact that they take place with little or no effort to extend HIV prevention, treatment, support, or counseling geared specifically to ward this population in either the home or destination countries.25 Short Term Travelers The impact of restrictions on short-term entry, stay, or residence can be serious for affected individuals, including tourists, individuals s eeking to visit family, and business travelers. When PLHIV are confronted with questions calling for HIV status disclosure on visa application forms, they must choose between either not disclosing their HIV status (potentially committing fraud and, if caught, risking future entry), and having to hide medication, or disclose their HIV status, and face refusal of entry.26 Confronted with this dilemma, a 2006 study of HIV-positive travel ers from the United Kingdom to the United States found that of the 239 patients taking anti retroviral therapy (ART) at the time of travel to the US, the majority travelled illegally without a waiver visa. Twenty-seven (11.3%) stopped ART during the period of travel, thus ru nning the risk of developing drug resistance. Twenty-eight patients (11.7%) mailed their medi cation to the US in advance, but only 25% received mailed medication on time.27 Overwhelmingly, individuals who stopped treatment reported doing so because of the US travel restrictions, fear of being searched, and discovery of their illness.28 Recommendations An increasing awareness of the discriminatory nature and deleterious effects of HIV-related travel laws has begun to prompt change. Inte rnational agencies, human rights and HIV/AIDS organizations must continue to demand that such restrictions be repealed immediately and entirely. In instances in which these laws and policies are not rescinded, at a minimum national governments need to reform testing practices so as to conform with basic human rights standards. Conducting voluntary testin g, obtaining informed consent, and providing adequate pre- and post-test co unseling are key to ensuring that the rights of involved individuals receive a minimum measure of respect. Confidentiality of test results should also be strictly maintained. Policies subjecting in dividuals to expulsion must always be coupled Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 6 with protection of that individual's right to challenge his or her deportation through due process of law.29 Regardless of a country's policies on HIV-rela ted travel restrictions, provision of adequate HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment services for migrants and citizens alike is essential. The experience of discrimination, dislocation and disruption in social networks around migration is closely linked to HIV risk. Legisl ative priority and government resources should be redirected from maintaining costly and discriminatory entry, stay, and residence restrictions on PLHIV, and refocused on providing prevention, care, and treatment programs that target and serve non-citizens and citizens. The creation and maintenance of such programs will be the truly effective long-term st rategy in combating this pandemic from both a public health and a human rights perspective.

Reasons for migration are varied, but typically stem from soci al, political, or financial causes, or natural disaster. Internal migration has increased in ma ny countries throughout the world in recent years.30 Already marginalized and subject to stigma as a result of their migration status, migrants with HIV/AIDS are often doubly stigmatized and subject to neglect and exploitation. Gaps in internal migrants' access to HIV/AIDS services\u2014eit her as a result of offi cial restrictions or logistical, cultural and linguistic barriers\u2014ha ve significant consequences: individuals are less able to access care and are increasingly vu lnerable to infection and death, states are less able to realize the goals of universal ac cess to treatment and reduction of the AIDS epidemic, and the public health community may face the emergence of drug-resistant strains resulting from interruptions in treatment. 31 Barriers to access to HIV/AIDS-related services faced by internal migrants when they move from their place of origin include internal migration restrictions, and logistical, linguistic and cultural barriers to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. To successfully achi eve global goals for reducing the burden of HIV and providing universal access to prevention and care, states must recognize the rights of internal migrants and their own obligations to eliminate barriers to care. International Law International law provides for the basic right to the highest attainable standard of health, and requires states parties to take steps indi vidually and through international cooperation to progressively realize this right via the pr evention, treatment, and control of epidemic diseases and the creation of conditions to assure medical service and attention to all.32 International law also establishes the basic pr inciples of non-discrimination and equality.33 Taken together, these rights imply a right to access a core minimum set of health care services, including ART, without discrimination, including on the basis of social origin. According to the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights' monitori ng body, states must guarantee certain core obligations as part of the right to health, in cluding ensuring non-discriminatory access to health facilities, particularly for vulnerable or marginalized groups. While the Committee, in Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 8 its General Comment 14, notes the progressive nature of the right to health, it also points to the fact that states must immediately take st eps to realize the right to health, and must immediately guarantee the exercise of the right without discrimination of any kind. The right to health is thus centrally linked to the ri ght to non-discrimination. Discrimination against internal migrants - who are in fact citizens of the state in question - is banned as explained by the Committee's Comments, which state that the Covenant prohibits discrimination based on \"social origin.\" Thus, the Committee findings make clear that the Covenant prohibits discrimination against internal migra nts in receiving health care, and are an immediate call on all states parties to eliminate discrimination. 34 Case Studies The People's Republic of China While urban residents holding permits in China have long been entitled to state-sponsored social welfare benefits, individuals without hukou (a form of registration with local authorities that is often time-consuming, expensive, or difficult for internal migrants to obtain) are unable to access basic public serv ices such as education and health care, and therefore are forced to pay all costs. 35 The vast majority of internal migrants are uninsured, and rarely visit doctors or hospitals.36 Furthermore, lack of health care coverage for sick migrants has, in the past, been compounded by additional, harsh consequences: For example, internal migrant workers have been returned to their home province under armed guard after being found to be HIV-positive. 37 HIV-positive internal migrants' access to trea tment remains extremely limited, confounded in part by the effects of the hukou system. In 2003, the Chinese government announced a national HIV/AIDS treatment program - free to rural residents and poor urban residents. However, universal HIV/AIDS treatment is far from a reality among the general population.38 Indeed, even when free treatment is ostensibly offered, delays in diagnosis and referral can create significant costs for the patient prior to the availability of free treatment, thus particularly disadvantaging migrants, who ar e not entitled to free basic health care. The Russian Federation Vestiges of an internal registration system al so plague access to he alth care for internal migrants in Russia. While officially simplified and relaxed by the federal government, in practice, registration in cities including Mo scow may be cumbersome and expensive, and lack of registration status may have serious o fficial or unofficial consequences for internal migrants. Instances of unregistered migrants unable to legally marr y, vote, send their 9 Human Rights Watch | June 2009 children to school, and receive public assistance, have all been reported.39 Indeed, individuals who are legally in the country but la ck local registration have also reportedly faced harsh consequences, such as detention or deportation.40 While the Russian government is constitutionally required to provide free medical care to all citizens and most HIV treatment is officially pr ovided free of charge to citizens, in practice the implementation of this right is limited and major challenges exist in access to free health care.41 Internal migrants especially face barriers, as registration is a precondition for entitlement to many free health services. Hu man Rights Watch research has documented that a migrant without registration is often denied both short-term (for purposes of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission) and long-term antiretroviral treatment42 and will typically be directed to his or her city of origin to receive the treatment. Republic of India HIV prevention in India is seriously hindered by the low awareness of the disease among internal migrants, particularly from rural areas,43 as a result of mobile nature of this population, language, and cultural barriers. Sign ificant HIV/AIDS treatment gaps exist for all groups throughout the country, but migrants also face particular challenges in accessing health care.44 Health care is administered on a state- by-state basis in India, and in some states significant uncertainty exists among government officials as to whether state authorities are responsible for social welfare services to temporarily resident workers and their families.45 Furthermore, internal migrants ar e often unable to use the government- issued \"ration cards\" outside their local home authority in order to access social services, and migrants may face significant logistical chal lenges and delays in procuring a new ration card.46 Absent a ration card, it can be difficult to access even programs designed to provide health care to the poor, as some such servic es specifically target ration card holders.47 Indeed, some local authorities re portedly refuse to provide ART to individuals without ration cards.48 Recommendations First of all, in countries that place formal or informal eligibility restrictions on access to health care, such restrictions based on social origin within different regions of the country need to be immediately eliminated. As noted above, the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Committee directs that states have an immediate obligation to eliminate discrimination in health care provision, incl uding discrimination based on \"social origin.\" The obligation to ensure HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment to all individuals without Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 10 discrimination is all the more acute, as HIV/AIDS services are included as essential drugs in the core minimum of health care services nations have an obligation to provide.49 Second, states should reduce barriers to ART uptake for internal migrants. User fees constitute the main barrier to ART adherence, and free care at point of service leads to improved uptake of HIV-related services , especially among the poorest users.50 Internal migrants are often subject to greater fees and indirect costs than non-migrants, and the resulting lack of access to treatment serves to push internal migrants toward self-medication or illegal clinics. 51 Creating programs tailored specifically to internal migrants' needs is essential to ensure uptake even of free HIV prevention and treatment services. To remove barriers in access to HIV/AIDS services when free care is officially available, states and international agencies and donors need to formulate programs to sp ecifically address internal migrants' needs. Cross-regional linkages need to be developed to facilitate the transition from one regional health authority's care to the next, where health care is not administered at a national level. Additional programs could include providin g translators who could translate to the languages internal migrants to the region frequently speak, providing mobile outreach services or transport from areas where internal migrants live to health centers, educating health care providers as to migrants' part icular needs and rights, or holding patient education sessions geared toward migrants. Finally, national governments need to remove restrictions on movement that prevent or delay internal migrants from establishing residence in urban areas. The harsh consequences and rights violations of restrictions on inte rnal migration in some countries can include detention or deportation. Fear of such cons equences may lead internal migrants to avoid HIV-related services even when they are available. Additional Resources Katherine Wiltenburg Todrys and Joseph J. Amon, \"Within but Without: Human Rights and Access to HIV Prevention and Treatment for Internal Migrants,\" 2009 (forthcoming). 11 Human Rights Watch | June 2009 Access to Antiretrovirals for International Migrants Scope of the Issue Since the emergence of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s, public health officials have recognized that migrant populations face special risk of HIV infection.52 However, despite the long recognition of migration's relationship to HIV vulnerability and recent calls by international bodies to address migrant health needs,53 states have largely failed to ensure that migrants have access to HIV treatment. Although governments have committed themselves to provide \"universal access\"54 to HIV treatment and have specific obligations under international human rights law to ensure that HIV treatment (speci fically, antiretroviral therapy or ART) is provided to migrants as part of their duty to realize the right to health without discrimination, access to ART for migra nts remains largely unrealized. Few states have explicitly recognized ART as part of the core minimum of health services to be provided without discrimination, including as to citi zenship, for migrants within their borders. Given the global scale and frequency of migration worldwide, a public health strategy toward HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment cannot include discrimination against non-citizens in provision of ART, as denying such treatment wi ll only serve to perpetuate transmission and - for those already infected - can lead to illn ess, the development of drug resistance, and death. 55 The development of HIV treatment systems geared toward migrants is necessary to achieve universal access to HIV treatment and to meet the needs of the world's significant and growing population of international migrants. International Law International law provides for the basic right to the highest attainable standard of health, and requires states parties to take steps indi vidually and through international cooperation to progressively realize this right via the pr evention, treatment, and control of epidemic diseases and the creation of conditions to assure medical service and attention to all.56 International law also establishes the basic pr inciples of non-discrimination and equality.57 Taken together, these rights imply provision of a right to access a core minimum set of health care services, including ART, wi thout citizenship-based discrimination. According to the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Committee, the Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights' monitori ng body, States must guarantee certain core obligations as part of the right to health, in cluding ensuring non-discriminatory access to Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 12 health facilities - particular ly for vulnerable or marginalized groups - and providing essential drugs. While the Committee notes the progressive nature of the right to health, it also points to the fact that states must immedi ately take steps to realize the right to health, and must immediately guarantee the exercise of the right without discrimination of any kind. The right to health is thus centrally linked to the right to non-discrimination. More specifically with respect to migrants, th e Committee notes that \"States are under the obligation to respect the right to health by, inter alia, refraining from denying or limiting equal access for all persons, including prisoners or detainees , minorities, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, to preventive, cu rative and palliative health services.\"58 Thus, a prohibition against discrimination against non- citizens in receiving health care, and an immediate and core obligation to eliminate discrimination, emerge from the Committee's findings. Additionally, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has called on states to adopt measures including those that would remove obstacles that prevent the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by no n-citizens, notably in the areas of education, housing, employment and health; and those that would ensure that States parties respect the right of non-citizens to an adequate standard of physical and mental health by refraining from denying or limiting their access to preventi ve, curative and palliative health services. 59 The International Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers also explicitly guarantees the rights of migrant workers and their families to emergency medical care, providing them with medical care \"urgently required for the preservation of their life or the avoidance of irreparable harm to their health\" on an equal ba sis as a state's nationals, without regard to irregularity of status. With respect to additional health services, the Convention guarantees migrant workers equality of treatment with nation als in access to social and health services if requirements for participation in those schemes have been met.60 Case Studies South Africa Under the South African Constitution, individual s with irregular legal status are accorded a wide range of human rights, including the righ ts to access to emergency and basic health care, and ART.61 Asylum seekers and refugees are accorded free care if they are indigent, and assessed according to the same means test used to evaluate South African citizens if they are not. The Department of Health has issued memoranda clarifying that these rights apply equally whether the patient has documentation or not. 13 Human Rights Watch | June 2009 However, Human Rights Watch research, as well as NGO and media reports, have described a striking gap between South Africa's inclusive policies and the reality of access to health care for refugees, asylum seekers, and espe cially undocumented migrants. Some public clinics demand a South African identification do cument before offering health care, denying treatment for those without identification papers.62 Asylum seekers have experienced continuing difficulties accessing ART.63 Human rights organizations and journalists have documented verbal abuse, sub-standard treatment, insensitivity by providers, unusually long wait times, and outright denial of se rvices facing migrants seeking health care.64 Others are illegally charged prohibitive fees for treatment or medication, or told they must carry a green South African citizenship card in orde r to receive basic services. Undocumented Zimbabweans in need of health care have overwhelmed South African charities and churches, and been turned away from government clinics when unable to present citizenship papers.65 Basotho mineworkers, infected with HI V and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have faced deportation and been left at the border of their home country without any treatment or referral to local health services for treatment.66 Thailand The Thai government has developed a program to register migrants and regularize their status. Registration allows migrants access to basic health care services through the national health plan. However, ART is not considered part of the package of public health care involved in registration, except for pregnant women.67 Antiretrovirals are distributed to Thais through a separate scheme than register ed migrants' coverage, effectively barring non- Thais.68 Additionally, registration is problematic for migrants because of steep registration fees, the fact that migrants cannot change employers on ce registered, and migrants are not able to move outside the province in which they are registered.69 Registration eligibility changes annually and restrictions stemming from a lack of coverage of typical migrant job categories, and linkage of registration to specific places of employment keep many from accessing the registration program. 70 Further, while migrants themselves are entitled to have possession of their registration, work permit, and health in surance documents, employers often hold these documents and migrants find copies of the documents insufficient for actually obtaining care. 71 A 2004 Physicians for Human Rights Report dealing with Burmese migrants in Thailand called for HIV care and treatment for migrants on equal terms as Thai citizens, as \"discriminatory denial of care and treatment vi rtually condemns them to living with (and quickly dying of) AIDS.\" 72 Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 14 Recommendations In order to realize the requirements of inte rnational human rights law to provide a core minimum of health services without discriminatio n, states worldwide must provide essential ART drugs to migrants on the same terms as to citizens. In order to realize this commitment, and to ensure the availability of ART in practi ce, states should immediately offer free or low- cost ART to non-citizens on the same terms as to citizens. This includes providing free or low- cost ART for Prevention of Mother-to-Child Tran smission (PMTCT) to non-citizen HIV-positive pregnant women and removing all barriers to their enrollment in such programs. Furthermore, states should work to establish cross-border treatment mechanisms and improve continuity of care by taking steps to standardize health passports across borders, coordinate treatment regimes in neighboring countries, create an inte rnational registry of patients, and review ART guidelines to ensure lack of bias against mobi le populations. States also need to eliminate barriers facing refugees and other migrants officially granted access to care in receiving services, including through health provider education on patients' rights. To implement these policies, states must allocate suffici ent funding for provision of ART to migrant populations. International donors, as well, have the capacity to improve migrants' access to ART. Crucial steps toward improving access may be made by international donors through conditioning funding for ART drugs for the general population on the equal availability of these drugs to both citizens and non-citizens, including non-ci tizens with irregular or undocumented status. International donors may also support and supplement states' efforts to provide cross- border continuity of care by assisting with ev ery aspect of the development of cross-border systems noted above, and additionally aiding in the development of a confidential international patient registry system, providin g translators and transportation for migrants, and providing counseling and information for mig rants on health centers at other locations. Furthermore, international agencies and NGOs ha ve a significant role to play in increasing migrants' access to ART by writing equal access for migrants into international ART policies and guidance documents, and assisting state go vernments in doing so for national policies. As with international donors, internationa l agencies and NGOs may also supplement national efforts toward creating cross-border and migrant-friendly treatment. Furthermore, international agencies and NGOs may push fo r the establishment of health care centers serving migrants in geographic areas frequented by migrants. 15 Human Rights Watch | June 2009 Additional Resources Joseph J. Amon and Katherine Wiltenburg To drys, \"Access to Antiretroviral Treatment for Migrant Populations in the Global South,\" Sur - International Journal on Human Rights , vol. 10, 2009. Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 16 Deportation and Treatment for HIV-Positive Migrants Scope of the Issue HIV-positive individuals may undergo depo rtation for a host of immigration-related violations, or, in some countries, as a conseque nce of their HIV-positive status itself. States have an obligation to ensure medical care fo r immigration detainees at least equivalent to that available to the general population.73 However, when, either as a consequence of HIV- related restrictions on entry, stay, and residence, or as part of deportation proceedings commenced on unrelated grounds, HIV-positive immigrants are taken into custody and detained pending outcome of an immigration case or deportation, adequate systems are not in place in many countries to ensure HIV/AIDS treatment. 74 Under certain circumstances, international law prohibits deportation or permits withholding of deportation of persons living with HIV. Th e deportation of HIV-positive individuals needs to be broadly reconsidered by states under the international law principle of non- refoulement and additional human rights and humanitarian law provisions to ensure that HIV-positive individuals are not sent or re turned to circumstances where treatment and family support are grossly inadequate. Furtherm ore, from a public health perspective, ensuring and coordinating continuity of tr eatment when HIV-positive individuals are deported to their countries of origin is imperative. International Law The principle of non-refoulement applies in international human rights and refugee law. In human rights law it has established an absolute prohibition on the deportation of a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.75 International refugee law prohibits the return of refugees to a territory where the refugee's life or freedom may be threatened: \"No Contracting State shall expel or return (\"refouler\") a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\" 76 Some domestic courts have held that HIV status can form the basis of membership in a particular social group for purposes of an asylum analysis under the principle of non-refoulement .77 In some states, a form of protection from removal known as \"complementary\" protection exists. This often sets out the protection from non-refoulement based on human rights 17 Human Rights Watch | June 2009 principles. Complementary protection can govern categories of people who claim that they cannot be returned to their country of origin based on human rights law or humanitarian principles but do not fit into traditional refugee definitions,78 according a wider range of eligibility. Case Studies South Korea South Korea is one of the 30 countries in the wo rld that force HIV-positive foreigners to leave their borders.79 Work migrants are tested for HIV and are detained and deported upon testing positive.80 In 2008, the Korea Center for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention reported that 521 of the 647 foreigners diagnosed with HIV to date had been \"forced to leave the country,\" as the government routinely deported individual s who were found to be HIV-positive.81 South Korea's practice of depo rting HIV-positive non-citizens was challenged in November 2008, when the Seoul High Court (upholding the Seoul Administrative Court) prevented the deportation of \"Heo,\" a Chinese citizen of Kore an descent visiting his mother in Korea, who was tested for HIV during a required health check, found to be positive, detained and ordered deported. The court found that public health goals must be balanced against the rights to privacy and to receive medical treatm ent, and that detection and treatment rather than deportation are the most effective means of curbing the spread of HIV. However, notwithstanding this ruling, the Korean government introduced a parliament bill in December that would expand requirements under the Ministry of Justice's E-2 visa policy (which largely affects foreigne rs seeking to teach English). Under the measure, immigration officials could require drug and HIV testin g of any foreigner seeking a work visa. 82 Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia relies on migrant laborers, many from South Asia, and these laborers constitute a significant proportion of the country's population and an even greater percentage of HIV cases in the country. HIV testing is required of non-citizens for long term work permits, with visa denial and likely deportation if HIV test results are positive. 83 Reports describe migrants jailed upon discovery of HIV status, held, and deported from Saudi Arabia, often without any explanation or discussion of their condition. In one instance in 1994, 80 non-citizens were hastily deported after medical tests for the pu rpose of resident permits led public health officials to conclude that the individuals were HIV-positive.84 In 2005, press reports highlighted the case of one HIV-positive Palestinian migrant to Saudi Arabia, jailed in a cell (described by newspaper reports as a \"crowd ed cage\") at the King Saud Hospital for Discrimination, Denial, and Deportation 18 Infectious Diseases for three months\u2014along wi th two HIV-positive cellmates\u2014receiving no medication except basic painkillers and anti-allergy medication.85 In 2005, CARAM Asia reported a case of a Filipino migrant worker in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia who, upon testing positive for HIV, was confined for 11 months in the hospital without any information on the progress of his case. Psychological trauma, job lo ss, and lack of adequate health care face migrants upon return.86 United States When HIV-positive individuals are faced with deportation from the United States\u2014on the basis of HIV-positive status or other ground s\u2014US law provides several legal avenues that individuals seeking to avoid deportation could theoretically pursue. HIV-positive individuals could try to qualify for official status al ong the lines of the 1951 Refugee Convention 87 by obtaining status as a refugee based on me mbership in a persecuted social group.88 In addition to the asylum procedure, all applic ations involved in asylum proceedings are considered in light of the prohibitions on refoulement both in the domestic Immigration and Nationality Act, and in the Convention Against Torture.89 Deportees often face harsh conditions and lack of access to health care upon return from the United States to their countries of origin. Receiving country govern ments have complained about the effects of US immigrant deportation, especially when individuals with criminal convictions are deported without adequate notifi cation or possibility of rehabilitation. In Guyana, legislation has authorized surveillanc e of some American deportees. In Haiti, deportees are taken immediately to jail and he ld indefinitely under miserable conditions, where no medical treatment is provided for diseases including for HIV/AIDS. Some deportees do not survive such detention.90 In El Salvador and Honduras, deportees are subject to discrimination and violence and risk being hunted by vigilante squads.91 A study on injecting drug users in Mexico, for example, suggests recent deportees have less access to health services than other drug users in the country.92 Recommendations In order to meet the requirements of internat ional human rights law treatment to detainees and deportees, states worldwide should begi n or continue to provide ART drugs to individuals in detention awaiting deportation on at least the same basis as that offered to the general population. As noted above, nati onal governments have an obligation under international law to provide non-citizens in detention with medical treatment at least equivalent to that available to the general population. Instances of individuals held in 19 Human Rights Watch | June 2009 detention, especially for months at a time , without access to medication must not be repeated. Furthermore, states should reexamine deportat ion of HIV-positive individuals to countries where treatment and social su pport structures are inadequate, in accordance with international and regional law non-refoulement prohibitions on deportation and additional complementary bases of protection. In determinin g a standard for when an individual should not be removed, national governments could cons ider regional case law: The Inter-American Commission for Human Rights recently found in a decision on the Andrea Mortlock case that the petitioner should not be returned by th e United States to Jamaica and would face extraordinary hardship upon deportation, even amounting to a death sentence, under a two- part test considering 1) the availability of me dical care in the country of removal and 2) the availability of social services and support, especially the presence of close relatives.93 The European Court of Human Rights had previously set a similar test, but has subsequently interpreted its standard very narrowly. As a matter of good practice, states\u2014in cooperation with international agencies and donors\u2014should attempt to make provision for continuity of treatment when deportation does take place. Prior to deportation, health o fficials in countries of deportation may work to coordinate action with health services in countries of removal to ascertain the availability of care, enroll deportees prior to deportation so as to make sure that waiting lists do not prevent continuity of care, and confidentially transfer medical records to a patient's new physician. Providing a temporary supply of ART medication for self- or government- administration may be strongly recommended fo r PLHIV who are deported to countries in which anti-retroviral medication is not immedi ately accessible to newly arrived deportees. Immigration and health officials in deporting co untries should consider the situation facing each deportee on a case-by-case basis with detailed communication and understanding of the HIV treatment situation in the country of removal. Finally, information from governments on the number of HIV-positive individuals who are deported needs to be made available, and fu rther research undertaken on this issue by international agencies.
