We aimed to synthesize the available scientific evidence on the safety of vaccine co-administrations in children by performing a systematic literature review of studies assessing the safety of vaccine co-administrations in children between 1999 and 2019, in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Fifty studies compared co-administered vaccines versus the same vaccines administered separately. The most frequently studied vaccines included quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib) vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and pneumococcal conjugate 7-valent (PCV7) or 13-valent (PCV13) vaccines. Of this, 16% (n = 8) of the studies reported significantly more adverse events following immunization (AEFI) while in 10% (n = 5) significantly fewer adverse events were found in the co-administration groups. Statistically significant differences between co-administration and separate administration were found for 16 adverse events, for 11 different vaccine co-administrations. In general, studies briefly described safety and one-third of studies lacked any statistical assessment of AEFI. Overall, the evidence on the safety of vaccine co-administrations compared to separate vaccine administrations is inconclusive and there is a paucity of large post-licensure studies addressing this issue.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-12-31", "cleaned_text": "Safety of Co-Administration Versus Separate Administration of the Same Vaccines in Children: A Systematic Literature Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8010012](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8010012) [Strategies Addressing Falling co-administering vaccines may facilitate the introduction of new vaccines to immunization schedules and positively affect coverage rates [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00012)], a growing number of vaccines is likely to be co-administered in the future. Uncertainty about the safety of co-administered vaccines can contribute to vaccine hesitancy in parents [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00012), [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00012)]. This highlights the need for assessing the safety of co-administered vaccines. [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00012)]. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review, aiming to synthesize the available scientific evidence on the safety of vaccine co-administrations in children. 2.

Vaccines Studied [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00012-f002)). [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-vaccines-08-00012)provides an overview of the study characteristics and findings of all studies comparing co-administered vaccines versus the same vaccines administered separately. The full meaning of vaccine abbreviations can be found in [Supplementary Table S2](#app1-vaccines-08-00012). 3.2. Study Characteristics [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00012-t001)lists the sample sizes of these trials by phase. The minimum ages of children enrolled in the studies varied between birth and 16 years (median 1 year) and the maximum ages of the enrolled study population varied between 7 weeks and 49 years (median 23 months). Seven studies (14%) also included persons over 18 years whose data were deemed relevant for assessing the safety of co-administration and were therefore included in our analysis. [Figure 3](#vaccines-08-00012-f003)shows the geographic distribution of these studies and highlights that studies were particularly conducted in the US and Europe. 3.3. Safety Outcomes [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00012), [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00012)]. One study reported significant increases in injection site pain (risk difference (RD): 6.3%, relative risk (RR): 1.1) and injection site RR: 2.6) when co-administering MenACWY + Tdap + HPV compared to separate administration [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00012)]. One study reported significant increases in injection site swelling (RD: 5.0%, RR: 1.5) when co-administering MenACWY + Tdap + HPV compared to separate administration [ [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00012)], and one study reported a significant increase in myalgia (RD: 16%, RR: HPV [ [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00012)]. One study reported significant increases of injection site tenderness (RD: 15.6%, RR: 2.7) and headache (RD: co-administering Td + MMR + HepB compared to separate administration [ [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00012)]. One study reported a significant increase in vomiting (RD: 10.0%, RR: 2.0) following DTaP-IPV/Hib + MenC + RV5 co-administration [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00012)], and one study reported significant increases in overall adverse events following co-administration (RD: 19.1%, RR: 1.5) of DTaP-IPV/Hib + MMR compared to their separate administrations [ [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00012)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00012)]. One study reported significantly less injection site RR: 0.7) following DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib + MenC study reported RR: and rhinorrhea (RD: MMR + VAR + Hib-HepB co-administration compared to separate administration [ [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00012)]. One study reported significantly less nasopharyngitis (RD: 3.5%, RR: 0.6) and insomnia following co-administering PCV7 + MMRV compared to separate administration [ [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00012)]. One study reported significantly less conjunctivitis (RD: 0.7%, RR: 0.1) after co-administering OPV and separate administration [ [21](#B21-vaccines-08-00012)]. The reported incidences of AEFIs are presented in [Figure 4](#vaccines-08-00012-f004). [Supplementary Table S1](#app1-vaccines-08-00012)provides a summary of the major study characteristics. 4. Discussion [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00012)] and where databases with observational data are available. The remaining 135 studies assessed the safety of co-administration and revealed safety data but did not allow a comparison with separate administration because they lacked a control group who received the same antigens as separate vaccines. The control groups in these studies received fewer antigens, received the antigens in a combined vaccine, received other antigens, or the control group did not receive any vaccine. [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00012), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00012), [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00012), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00012)] studied four + [ [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00012), [34](#B34-vaccines-08-00012), [35](#B35-vaccines-08-00012)] were studied in three different studies MenACWY + each evaluated in two studies. [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00012-t002). Despite much more injection site bruising and slightly more injection site pain after co-administering MenACWY + Tdap + HPV found in one study [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00012)], three other studies evaluating the same co-administered vaccines [ [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00012), [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00012), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00012)] could not confirm this increase. On the other hand, one of these studies detected an increase in myalgia after co-administering MenACWY + Tdap + HPV [ [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00012)] but the three similar studies did not [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00012), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00012), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00012)]. Likewise, only one of these studies found an increase of injection site swelling after co-administration [ [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00012)] in contrast to the others [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00012), [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00012), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00012)]. Nevertheless, the incidence rates of these adverse events were in line with those reported in a study investigating the co-administration of MenACWY + Tdap + HPV but without a separate administration control group [ [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00012)]. Similarly, only one of three studies on DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib + PCV7 found a strong increase in cases of pyrexia after co-administration [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00012), [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00012), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00012)]. Also, here the incidence rates of fever were comparable with those observed in six other studies investigating the co-administration of the same vaccines but without a separate administration control group [ [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00012), [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00012), [45](#B45-vaccines-08-00012), [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00012), [47](#B47-vaccines-08-00012), [48](#B48-vaccines-08-00012)]. The consistency in incidence rates indicates that the observations are reliable and that the failure to detect significant differences rather might be due to a lack of statistical power. [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00012)], more than twice as many cases of pyrexia were found after co-administering PCV13 + IIV3 [ [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00012)], and twice as much vomiting was reported following co-administering DTaP-IPV/Hib + MenC + RV [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00012)]. A smaller increase in overall adverse events following co-administration of DTaP-IPV/Hib + MMR was observed in the only study with these vaccines [ [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00012)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00012)], less injection site erythema following DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib + MenC co-administration [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00012)], almost half as much rash and less rhinorrhea after MMR + VAR + Hib-HepB co-administration [ [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00012)], almost half as much nasopharyngitis and insomnia following co-administering PCV7 + OPV + LAIV compared to separate administration [ [21](#B21-vaccines-08-00012)]. All these co-administrations were assessed in only one study each. [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00012)]. This may be a reason why studies failed to detect statistically significant differences in safety. Observational studies with larger sample sizes assessing co-administration versus separate administration have better potential to achieve sufficient statistical power. However, such studies were found to be rare. Publication bias towards publishing studies with a positive benefit-risk balance may also affect the availability of information on safety and hence affect the findings of our review. Studies with an unsatisfactory immunogenicity and/or an unfavorable safety profile might not have been published. 5. Conclusions [50](#B50-vaccines-08-00012)], which can be addressed by proving the safety of vaccine co-administration. Co-administration is an efficient vaccination strategy, associated with high coverage rates [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00012)] and vaccine timeliness [ [51](#B51-vaccines-08-00012)]. While there is no indication to be concerned about the safety of co-administered vaccines, healthcare providers must aim for the highest standards of care. Particularly for preventive care in children such as immunization, we must aim for the best strategies that entail the lowest risks. Considering the scale of immunizing children and vaccine co-administrations in real life, the currently available evidence is limited and inconclusive. This study indicated that differences in safety of vaccine co-administrations compared to separate vaccine administrations may exist, particularly for more common, less severe AEFI. However, based on the currently available evidence, it is challenging to verify the true extent and impact. In summary, there is limited and inconclusive evidence available about the difference in safety of vaccine co-administrations compared to separate vaccine administrations in children.
