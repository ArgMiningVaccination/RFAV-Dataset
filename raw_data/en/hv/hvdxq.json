Nearly every type has a unique body of lore surrounding it. Many ancient cultures have been using crystals in spiritual and medicinal ways. Some of these practices continue to this day, either maintained through tradition or revived. Crystals and their uses can vary widely, and today we'll dive into this history. HISTORY OF CRYSTALS The earliest use of crystals was magical or medicinal. Other beliefs were spiritual. Ancient cultures often prescribed significance to stone meanings and uses. According to experts, the first recorded use of crystals comes from the [Ancient Sumerians](https://www.livescience.com/40347-crystal-healing.html). Surviving [cuneiform texts](https://www.asor.org/anetoday/2014/09/witchcraft-in-ancient-mesopotamia/) go into detail surrounding the rituals, themselves a combination of medicine and magic. Early on, humans established specific healing crystal meanings. Astrologers in the ancient world were recording these observations. Early beliefs were simple - a particular stone could counter a specific ailment. These astrological works, dating to as early as 400 BCE, noted that wearing amulets of certain gems would protect them from particular effects. CRYSTALS IN THE ANCIENT WORLD The traditions which have the most significant effect on using crystals in the modern age come from Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, and Greece. In the \" [Curious Lore of Precious Stones](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044009844317&view=1up&seq=92&q1=amulet),\" G. F. Kunz records the properties and attributes of many, explaining their significance to these ancient peoples. These amulets and talismans were carved, whole, or shaped in various ways. Every factor you could consider - size, shape, color, and more - affected the potency of the amulet. While we are familiar with the tombs of Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs, these amulets weren't just grave goods. People also use them in daily life to promote health or offer protection. Ancient Greeks also emphasized the potency of crystals. For instance, maritime people like the Greeks had numerous specialized amulets for protection at sea. Would it surprise you to learn that one of these stones was what we know as aquamarine? The word crystal comes from Greek! The Greek word \"kr\u00fdstallos\" means ice when directly translated. These ancients believed that clear quartz solid ice - froze so thoroughly that the effect was permanent. And who can forget amethyst? Many of us already know about its reputation as a stone of sobriety. We have the Greeks to thank for that! Kings of Ancient India collected gems to protect themselves from harm. The country has countless tales, many buried in religious texts, explaining various stone meanings and uses. The Garuda Purana and Graha-gocara Jyautisha are the central bodies of work explaining crystal use in Vedic practices. Vedic tradition is a significant inspiration for using crystals today and remains a widespread holistic practice today. Crystal use is important within Hinduism and Indian culture. And these practices continue to impact our understanding of [gem therapy](https://www.shoplc.com/c/jewelry). CRYSTALS IN THE MODERN WORLD Using crystals in modern times has its roots in the [New Age movement](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1283&context=honorstheses). Despite this, not every person using crystals to feel benefits is part of this movement. Nor does crystal use have specific ties to any system of belief. Most modern use is highly individualized! How is the ancient world connected to the modern world? In crystals and their uses, the New Age movement helped revive and popularize beliefs from British, Native American, and Indian cultures. About 40 years ago, these unrelated belief systems slowly came together, landing us where we are today. Aspects of these systems have been adopted, borrowed, and remixed into modern crystal use. The results? Particular practices - customized for the user. For instance, British tradition draws upon various pagan influences. These beliefs dovetailed nicely with Western astrological views, resulting in a perfect peanut butter-and-chocolate moment. Scholars recorded many of these practices and beliefs in lapidary texts. The practice flourished during the Middle Ages until mostly dying out during the 17th century. Native American tradition has also influenced using crystals today. While many of these oral traditions are lost, those that remain are highly influential. Across these concepts lay two core beliefs - meditation and respect. Mediation encourages users to reflect on positive thoughts and have a healthy mindset before starting. How this happens can vary from group to group, but these factors remain constant. Secondly is the concept of respect. Respect is crucial as crystals are a gift of the Earth. Most Native religions show great respect for the Earth. Meditation crystals are an entity unto themselves, deserving respect. CRYSTALS AND THEIR MEANING AND USES Crystals are natural elements. They come from the Earth. There are several kinds of objects which we might call crystals. Still, genuine crystals possess a unique lattice pattern called a crystal system. There are six lattice patterns that a crystal might have. - Hexagonal. The interior structure is six-sided. Hexagonal are crystals good for manifesting. - Isometric. These show a cubic structure. They are used for improving situations and amplifying. - Monoclinic. It displays a parallelogram shape. Monoclinic crystals are considered protective. - Orthorhombic. Diamond-shaped crystals. Used for cleansing, clearing, and removing blockages. - Tetragonal. Shows a rectangular structure. Considered to be attractors. - Triclinic. Has three inclined axes. Used in warding unwanted energy or retaining desired energy. Lastly, there are amorphous crystals. They do not have a crystal structure but are considered crystals, nonetheless. These include gems like opal and moldavite. Some crystals occur naturally, forming in the earth, while others form under controlled conditions. These are often called [\"lab created\" stones](https://blog.shoplc.com/what-is-a-synthetic-vs-simulated-gemstone/). Are lab created crystals less pure? Opinion varies. Some feel that they are, but others disagree. These experts state that handling crystals change their energy. It's best to try for yourself and see what works best for you. Crystals have their own vibrations. For example, quartz crystals power modern watch movements! Even the human body has vibrations. Believers tell us that these vibrations can affect us. Crystals are said to transform our bodies, minds, and spiritual energies. It is usually referred to as entrainment. WHAT IS ENTRAINMENT? [Entrainment](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entrain) is the ability of something to draw in or draw along. Think of it like this - have you ever been around someone grumpy, and their lousy mood rubbed off on you? Or perhaps a kindness from a stranger made you kinder in return? Those are examples of entrainment. Gem therapists and crystal healers suggest that entrainment can affect us. This occurs through one vibrational system's influence and affects another. Crystals generally vibrate at a higher frequency than our bodies. This can be useful as gem therapists suggest this can help us advance spiritually. It can help us move in more positive directions - mentally, physically, and spiritually. HOW CAN I FEEL A CRYSTAL'S ENERGY? We've talked about how ancient people, gem therapists, and crystal healers tune themselves into a stone's energy. Do you need this level of devotion when using crystals? Absolutely not! Consider these practical tips for trying this yourself. - Open Mindedness. It's natural to be skeptical. In fact, it's encouraged! - Set Aside Preconceptions. Instead, be curious.
