Acupuncture is a treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that involves the use of hair-thin needles on particular points throughout the body. The needles are inserted and promote the realignment of the flow of qi, the energy that runs through a person's body. In TCM, the inability of qi to flow freely through different pathways is part of the reason people experience different health problems. Our Practitioners will insert the needles at different acupuncture points based on the location of the pain or the problem the person is experiencing. Sometimes, the needles are inserted near the problem or on another part of the body not located near the problem. By getting the qi to flow to a particular area, it has the ability to reduce pain or rebalance the body's energy. Many researchers speculate the needles aid in the release of chemicals like endorphins or natural opioids that relieve pain, discomfort and other symptoms.
