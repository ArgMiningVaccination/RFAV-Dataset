I treat all my clients uniquely and help them to awaken their own inner healer in a way which works for them. \"Nicky was incredibly kind, caring, and knowledgeable when I connected with her for a consult about cervical dysplasia. She brings a wealth of knowledge about accessible forms of natural medicine from around the world, as well as on nutrition, lifestyle, and mentality. What is often a hard topic for me to discuss, she made compassionate, easy, and even surprisingly fun. I've done so much research on the topic for myself, and she helped me by adding more tremendously valuable knowledge, narrowing in and simplifying, making the experience meaningful and caring, and frankly helping me feel heard (a sadly rare thing in medicine.) I'm certainly on my way to healing with her help.\" Courtney, Texas My own healing journey I would love to share my story about finally saying goodbye to the HPV virus and cervical dysplasia. Most people say you can't heal HPV virus, and most doctors will tell you that there's nothing you can do, that you're just unlucky. Well I'll tell you there's a lot you can try and there's scientific research to back it up! I did so much research on this over the last 10 years and I'm happy to say I no longer have HPV and cervical dysplasia! What is HPV and cervical dysplasia HPV virus is a contact disease, mainly passed from sexual intercourse, but may be also be passed from other bodily parts also. There are many strains of HPV virus, the one I had was HPV 16, which is the leading cause of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer. Cervical dysplasia is when the cells start to become abnormal, which may eventually turn to cervical cancer. 90% or more people will have HPV virus at some point in their lives and in most of these cases, the body will shift the virus quickly and the abnormal cells will go back to normal. Some people find it more difficult to shift HPV virus than others. Of course I can never claim that what I did healed my HPV virus and cervical dysplasia, or which parts of my protocol helped, but after 14 years of carrying it, it disappeared! All I can say for certain is that I put my full intent into boosting my immune system and the outcome was deeply gratifying. \"I had a 1-on-1 consultation with Nicky to prepare me for my hospital visit and subsequent journey with cervical dysplasia and healing HPV. I received the confidence to know what is right for me and what I want that journey to look like. She gave me lots of information about procedures, treatments and in-depth knowledge on nutrition and supplements, based in her extensive research on the topic. I felt very seen and supported by Nicky, she really took her time to listen. She was really present and attentive and had capacity to take me and seriously, which I most often find hard to get from medical doctors, it really meant a lot.\" Iris - Cork My first journey to hospital At the age of 23 I went for my first smear test, when the results came back it showed I had a slight abnormality in the cells of my cervix. I was told not to worry and that it would probably go away on its own. I went off and didn't really think about it again until I had my next smear test and it had turned to CIN 1, which is still low grade abnormality. After a while with cervical dysplasia present, I was transferred to a women's hospital where they could do a colposcopy and look at the cervix with a camera, and I was asked to come back every six months for a check up. The first colposcopy was such a horrible experience, I never wanted to come back again, they asked me to cough, and while I was looking at the screen blood squirted all over it. It was terrifying and very uncomfortable, although, this never happened again in any colposcopy. Over the course or 3 years the cervical dysplasia had progressed to CIN2 and was more persistent. The hospital made the decision to give me a lletz/leep procedure. This is when they try to remove the abnormal cells on the cervix with an electrically charged wire loop. At the time I didn't know any better and just agreed. I felt so scared going in. It was painful and intrusive. It took me quite some time to get over it! I wished I had had some extra emotional support at this point. I help my clients prepare for hospital visits, colposcopies, treatments and make sure they feel empowered that they have made the right decision for themselves. Some times the health professionals can put pressure on us to do certain things we may feel we have to do in the moment, but then regret it afterwards. To go in feeling confident, with less fear, can help us to make the right decision for ourselves in the moment. Going Private My next smear test after the lletz/leep procedure and I was CIN 3 which is high grade CIN!!! What just happened??? I was distraught. My mum was also very upset and we both agreed to get a second opinion from a private consultant. When I saw him a few days before Christmas he did a colposcopy and wanted to do an emergency lletz/leep procedure on me there and then. The experience was very traumatic and the consultant kept trying to make small talk with me while I was in floods of tears. He also told me, that the last doctor had done quite a large lletz treatment, but missed the abnormal cells. I left his surgery feeling hopeless and intruded upon. He also did a HPV virus test and I found out I had HPV 16. He concluded that I must have had this since my first abnormal smear. I help my clients let go of the negative emotions that often come with being diagnosed with HPV virus, as I know I was holding on to resentment and shame from this diagnoses. \"I attended Nicky's support call this week and I was absolutely blown away by it! Not only was it deeply healing - with a guided meditation to heal the cervix and any guilt grief or shame that was there, but it was deeply informative and educational around HPV and cervical healing! Nicky herself is so professional and experienced with this topic both professionally and personally and I really trust her wisdom! I left the call feeling relieved, supported and excited about the healing journey and my power to heal! \" Sarah R, Dublin Taking healing into my own hands This is when I started studying nutritional therapy and realised I could take this into my own hands. I changed my diet and did many different detox plans to give my body a boost to try and heal itself. My skin and gut health seriously improved but my smear tests were still always coming back with a slight abnormality. I left my consultant and went to a different hospital where they kept monitoring me. After a few years of my smear tests and a biopsy coming back as high grade cervical dysplasia, they suggested I got another lletz/leep procedure. I asked them to give me 6 months, which they agreed to. I went off and took an array of supplements I had done research on. Glutathione, an immune booster, DIM detox and salvestrols but I didn't change my lifestyle or diet much. I felt I was pretty healthy! When I went back in 6 months the nurse showed me the photos of my cervix and it was obvious the cervical dysplasia had gotten worse! At this point I knew I was heading off to Costa Rica to work at a health retreat in the jungle. I had also done a lot more research and felt much more dedicated to healing myself. I asked them once more, to give me another 6 months. I think it's important to add that I would never recommend anyone else to put off medical treatment for any illnesses or conditions that they suffer from if they are being recommended by a medical professional. This decision is up to each individual, I help my clients connect to their own bodies, so they can feel empowered to make their own decisions about their health. This was my decision and my body. I weighed up the risk factors and felt that I had time to give it one more push myself. Healing in Costa Rica So, off I went to Farm of Life, Costa Rica! Here I learned a new way of living and healing from food like I'd never seen before. Here I worked on removing stress from my life, connected with nature, meditated every day and practised yoga. Eating lots of fruits, greens and broth gave my body more energy to focus on healing rather than digesting heavy fats and protein. For 4 months I took a mushroom complex, which is an incredible immune booster. I also made anticancer green juices every day from the plants we grow on the farm, these included soursop leaves, mangosteen leaves, kale, noni leaves, turmeric, ginger, red pepper, lemongrass, holy basil, oregano, lime leaves and cilantro. The plant medicine cacao was also a wonderful part of my journey also. I worked on self love, setting new healthy boundaries for myself. I let go of the resentment and fear, I worked on forgiveness and I learned to accept every part of me! The last thing I did every evening, was use a capsule internally directly on the cervix. This consisted of coconut oil and very small amounts of lemongrass oil, lemon oil and cannabis oil. We have to be very careful with these oils, as they are so strong and can be too much internally. I realise that not everyone will be living in Costa Rica while healing and that's why I create a unique protocol for each individual, taking in to consideration, where they are in the world, what time of year it is, and what kind of diet they would prefer to focus on. Maybe it's plant based, maybe animal foods are incorporated. It's very important that my client feels confident and will not find the healing journey stressful. I focused most of my energy into healing and knew I was going to succeed! My intention was so strong I knew I wasn't going to fail. I help my clients set their own intentions for their healing journey, so they can feel confident and believe in their own healing journey. There is a lot of scientific research around different natural cures for HPV, cervical cancer, cervical dysplasia and other viruses and unfortunately this is not shared in the hospitals. And, even though it's anecdotal, the evidence is with all the women, including myself that is is possible to heal naturally from HPV virus and cervical dysplasia. I have seen it many times over the years working with clients. From devastation to ultimate joy When I went home to get my colposcopy I was absolutely devastated and couldn't actually believe it when the nurse told me the cervical dysplasia looked worse again. She told me she looked at my file with the doctor and they both agreed I needed to get the lletz / leep procedure before heading back to Costa Rica again, but my results for the HPV virus may not come back in time. It was the Wednesday before leaving to come back to Costa Rica and I went in for my appointment still not sure what I was going to do when I saw the doctor. As it turns out the secretary had messed up and they couldn't fit me in to see the doctor that day. I thought, OK that's the way it's meant to be! I'll be fine for another 6 months. But after getting an unbelievable amount of pressure from my family and friends telling me I needed to change my flights so I could get the lletz / leep procedure I didn't know what to do. So I spent a lot of money and let many people down by being a week late to my job for a procedure I didn't even want to get. But after all the emotional trauma I went through by being torn in 2 directions, I got a pain in my cervix and it made me feel like I needed to stay to get the lletz / leep procedure. I felt my body spoke to me! So I changed my flights and got my appointment for the following Wednesday to get the lletz / leep procedure. I was a total mess knowing I would have to make a 35 hour journey on my own 2 days after getting this awful procedure done for the third time. I don't ever remember being in such an emotional state about anything. I felt like a failure and my hope in healing myself naturally was diminishing. I went into hospital on the Wednesday and the Doctor saw me, I saw he had my new results in his hand. My heart started beating faster while I was trying to peep at the results before he could tell me. I asked him, \"does that say HPV 16 negative?\" \"yes, it does\". Wow, wow, wow, what a turn around, I'd just spent the last 3 weeks in an emotional state of sadness and confusion only for all of it to be turned around to find out I had actually succeeded! HPV 16 negative. After having this for 14 years of my life, and it's gone in just 4 short months of a healing protocol. Saying I was over the moon was an understatement. I've never had emotions shift so quickly in my life. The doctor did another colposcopy and told me he there was still a slight abnormality, but it was as small as a dot from a pen! I'm not sure what the nurse saw in my last appointment that made her think it was worse. One crazy thing about this story is that if they didn't mess up my appointment in the hospital, I probably would have had the procedure unnecessarily a week before my results came back. I've now learned to always wait for the results and get a second opinion before agreeing to get an invasive procedure done. Follow up 6 months later I had another beautiful 6 months in Costa Rica knowing that I didn't have to worry about HPV virus any longer. I kept up the healthy lifestyle, and felt amazing. When I arrived back in Dublin, I had a colposcopy appointment which I was feeling very confident about. It was a different doctor this time and she told me that there was still an abnormality and that she wanted to take a biopsy and that I would probably need the lletz treatment. I was calm and cool, and told her I didn't want to get a biopsy until the results came back. She pleaded with me and said that the biopsy would be a better indicator. I totally understood that, but even with the biopsy, they are taking some of the skin from the cervix and if there was no need for this, I didn't want to be invaded again. So, a long 2 months waiting for the results, thinking, oh maybe the HPV virus came back, or that the abnormality had gotten worse after what that doctor had said. Well, when I got the results in the post, I could not have been happier, no HPV virus detected and my smear results were normal for the first time in 14 years, no more cervical dysplasia!!!! The best news is, that I am now no longer in need for 6 month colposcopy check ups in the hospital. I'll be going to my GP once every 3 years for my smear test instead. This has all lifted a huge weight I have been carrying around for so many years and returns all my faith in natural holistic healing. I have now had clear smears tests and negative HPV virus tests for 4.5 years and I've learned how to use a speculum to examine my own cervix.
