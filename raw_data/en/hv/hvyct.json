COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions Why vaccinate against COVID-19? Currently, there is no cure for this potentially deadly virus. The COVID-19 vaccine is a proven and safe way to help your body defend itself by developing immunity to it. Are the vaccines safe and effective? Yes. Since none of the vaccines contain live coronavirus, they cannot give you COVID-19. Millions of Americans have received these vaccines without major unexpected side effects. In very rare cases, people experienced serious allergic reactions, but these have generally occurred in individuals with a history of serious allergic reactions. The vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19 and resulting complications. They significantly lower your risk of becoming acutely ill from the virus, being hospitalized, or dying from it. To learn more about U.S. COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, please visit [clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/). Can I contract COVID-19 from the vaccine? No. It is impossible for the vaccine to give you COVID-19; it does not use the live virus that causes COVID-19. What are some side effects to the COVID-19 vaccine? The most common reaction is soreness at the injection site in the upper arm. Other reactions may include fatigue, headache, muscle or joint aches, or less commonly, fever. These normal reactions, which are more likely to occur with the second dose, indicate that your body is building immunity. To learn more about possible side effects, please review [Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html). I've already had COVID-19. Do I still need to get vaccinated? Yes. It is still possible to become re-infected, and the vaccine may provide extra protection. Must I still wear a mask after I get my COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. Since you may transmit the virus after vaccination, the CDC urges you to continue wearing a mask, maintaining physical distance, and washing your hands regularly. As more people are vaccinated, some of these requirements may change. Who should not get the COVID-19 vaccine? The vaccine is not recommended for people who may be allergic to its ingredients, are taking medications or undergoing treatments (e.g., for cancer) that may interact negatively with it. It also may not be recommended for children younger than age 5. Anyone who has had a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should NOT receive the vaccine. Please consult with your doctor first. Please consult your physician about the vaccines risks and benefits, and review CDC guides on [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html) and the [Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html). Should I take the vaccine if I'm pregnant, expecting, or breastfeeding? If you are pregnant and get COVID-19, then you have an increased risk of being hospitalized or dying from the virus. You have an even greater risk if you have [other chronic conditions](https://vaccinetogetherny.org/Documents/NYS_vaccine_medical_condition_qualifications.pdf). You should discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccine with your provider. Meanwhile, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), FDA, and CDC recommend that you take the vaccine if you are: - considering getting pregnant, to prevent possible complications of the virus during pregnancy; - currently pregnant, especially if you have other chronic conditions; or, - breastfeeding, since the vaccine cannot get into the breast milk or affect your baby. You should not stop breast feeding to get the vaccine. Does the current vaccine protect against the new coronavirus strain? Yes, experts believe the COVID-19 vaccines will be effective against this variant. According to the CDC, there is no evidence that the new variant strain is able to evade immunity induced by current COVID-19 vaccines. "}
