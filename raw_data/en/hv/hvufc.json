Babies often respond very quickly to homeopathic treatment and these are easy to administer as drops. Children cope well with remedies given as powders, granules or little pillules to suck. Giving the mother a remedy will often help both mother and baby (particularly if she is breast-feeding). Homeopathy can provide useful support throughout the many stages of childhood. The child's constitution naturally evolves as the challenges of growing up are met. Sometimes problems may arise and be hard to elicit from a child but may be expressed as physical symptoms (eg a rash, recurrent tummy ache, behaviour problems ,sleep problems or nightmares, bed wetting). Parents can often describe their childs' characteristics very clearly to the homeopath. This 'whole person'holistic homeopathic approach can be very helpfulin helping young children. Our medical homeopath may discuss contacting your GP or specialist (with your permission) if the baby or child develops signs or symptoms that need investigating further, or may advise medical treatment from the GP, whilst continuing to provide complementary support with homeopathy. N.B. We do not offer, so called, 'homeopathic vaccinations' at the Stockbridge Osteopathic Practice but are happy to discuss issues relating to vaccinations with concerned parents. "}
