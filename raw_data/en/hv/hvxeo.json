[Medicare Part B](/health/medicare-qa-tool/what-is-medicare-part-b/), which covers doctor and outpatient services, pays for [one flu shot](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2022/older-adults-high-dose-flu-shot.html) each flu season, which starts in the fall and continues through winter and early spring.

Medicare Advantage may require you to use an in-network provider or pharmacy. When should I get my influenza vaccination? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that most people 6 months and older get a [flu shot each flu season](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2022/flu-season.html), ideally in September or October, so it can be fully effective when cases begin to rise every October. The CDC recommends adults 65 years and older get immunized with a [high-dose or adjuvanted vaccine](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2022/older-adults-high-dose-flu-shot.html). People 65 and older are at a [higher risk of serious complications](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2019/avoiding-serious-flu-complications.html) if they get the flu, including [bacterial pneumonia](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2021/pneumonia-symptoms-treatments.html), [ear infections](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2021/ear-pain.html) and [sinus infections](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2022/sinus-infection-symptoms.html).

This guidance to get a high-dose or adjuvanted vaccine is new for the 2022 flu season. These types of vaccines offer greater protection to older adults, many with weakened immune systems because of age, CDC officials say. Older adults' immune systems also build up fewer antibodies in response to standard vaccine doses, and those antibodies stay around for a shorter time compared with younger people. An adjuvant is a vaccine ingredient that helps promote a better immune response. It also can reduce the amount of virus needed for production of a vaccine, which can allow for greater supplies of the vaccine. What types of flu vaccine are available? While powerful vaccines have been around for a while, this is the first time they've been recommended for people 65 and older. The three types of high-dose vaccines are: [Fluad quadrivalent](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/adjuvant.htm). This shot is an inactivated vaccine that consists of virus particles that have been grown in culture and then killed to destroy their disease-producing capacity, unlike live vaccines that use live pathogens. It's approved for people 65 and older to protect against influenza virus subtypes A and types B. "}
