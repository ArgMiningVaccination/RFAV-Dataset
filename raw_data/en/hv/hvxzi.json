My calcium level is borderline from becoming in the high range (10.0 while the high range is 10.2+). Would there be any downsides to megadosing K2 mk7? I'd maybe want to do 400-500 mcg at the beginning then go down to 100-200mcg after a week. Has anyone tried a K2 megadose? I also have somewhat bad teeth and have heard stories that it can help with that. "}
