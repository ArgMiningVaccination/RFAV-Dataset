Protein arginine methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) is responsible for the methylation of arginine residues on histones and targets transcription factors involved in many cellular processes,including gene transcription, mRNA splicing, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. In this study, the role and underlying mechanisms of PRMT2 in colitis were studied. Experimental Approach: A mouse dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimen- tal colitis model was used to study PRMT2 in colitis. Lentivirus-induced PRMT2 silencing or overexpression in vivo was applied to address the role of PRMT2 in colitis. Detailed western blot and expression analysis were done to understand epige- netic changes induced by PRMT2 in colitis.Key Results: PRMT2 is highly expressed in inflammatory bowel disease patients, in inflamed murine colon and in TNF- stimulated murine PRMT2 overexpression aggravates, while knockdown alleviates DSS-induced colitis, suggesting that PRMT2 is a pivotal mediator of colitis in mice. Mechanistically, PRMT2 mediates colitis by increasing repressive histone mark H3R8 asymmetricmethylation (H3R8me2a) at the promoter region of of cytokine signal- ling 3 promoter (SOCS3). Resultant inhibition and inhibition of SOCS3-mediated of TNF receptor associated factor 5 (TRAF5) via ubiquitination led to elevated TRAF5 expression and TRAF5-mediated downstream NF-B/MAPK activation. Conclusion and Implications: Our study demonstrates that PRMT2 acts as a transcriptional co-activator for proinflammatory genes during colitis. Hence, targetingPRMT2 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for colitis. dextran associated factor 5.

The disease has a profoundimpact on quality of life but is also recognized as a leading causative risk factor for the progression of colorectal cancer, which is mediated through long-term chronic intestinal inflammation (Kim &Chang, 2014; Yashiro, 2014). Consequently, there is an urgent need for new targets and novel therapies for inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the availability of an enormous amount of clinical and experimental data on the development of inflammatory bowel disease in both experimental animals and humans, the precise aetiology of inflammatory bowel disease remains elusive. It is generally believedthat both genetic alterations and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. With the onset of inflammatory bowel disease, enhanced secretion of inflammatorycytokines, such as TNF- andIL-6, is observed in the inflamed intesti- nal mucosa and is correlated with the disease severity (Strober & Fuss, 2011; Xiao et al., 2016). TNF- overproduction is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease and secreted TNF- can amplify the inflammatory response by stimulating downstream inflammatory mediators via the activation of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor- B (NF- B)and MAPKs. This in turn exacerbates mucosal injury and contributes to chronic intestinal inflammation (Biasi et al., 2013; Olesen et al., 2016). Moreover, recent studies have revealed that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation,histone modifications and noncoding RNA interactions, promote thedevelopment of inflammatory bowel disease by regulating the expres- sion of cytokines and tight junction proteins (Jabandziev et al., 2020; Kline et al., 2020; Nakanishi et al., 2018; Qi et al., 2019). Understand-ing these inflammatory bowel disease-specific epigenetic changes will provide new insights into new ways to treat inflammatory bowel disease. Histone methylation is a common histone modification implicated in gene transcription. Arginine methylation mediated by the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family is a widespread post- translational modification in eukaryote cells and plays a key role in many biological processes, such as transcription, cell signalling, pre- mRNA splicing and DNA damage signalling (Blanc & Richard, 2017;Kim et al., 2016). Using S-adenosine-methionine as the methyl donor,PRMT transfers methyl to the nitrogen atom of protein arginine side chain and produces S-adenosy- L-homocysteine and methyl arginine (Yang & Bedford, 2013). PRMT2 is a key member of the PRMT family and contains a highly conserved catalytic S-adenosyl methionine(Ado-Met) binding domain and a unique Src homology 3 domain that binds proteins with proline-rich motifs (Zhong et al., 2014). PRMT2 isimportant in the regulation of cellular signalling and gene expression by methylating histones and nonhistone proteins (Dong et al., 2018). So far, PRMT2 has been shown to be involved in breast cancer(Morettin et al., 2015) and tumorigenesis of glioblastoma (Donget al., 2018), whereas higher PRMT2 expression was observed in intestinal specimens from both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients (Krzystek-Korpacka et al., 2020). However, the role ofPRMT2 in colitis remain unclear. In the current study, we identify PRMT2 as a proinflammatory mediator in colitis and provide evidence that the onset of colitisand inflammatory responses are sensitive to lentiviral PRMT2 over- expression or knockdown in vivo studies demonstrate that PRMT2-mediated H3R8me2a methylation isresponsible for the suppression of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) and therefore inhibits SOCS3-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of TNF receptor associated factor 5 (TRAF5), subse-quently leading to elevated TRAF5 expression and TRAF5-mediateddownstream NF- B/MAPK activation. Our data also provide mechanistic insights into a PRMT2-mediated epigenetic regulatory mechanism of colitis and could lead to novel therapeutic strategies forthe treatment of colitis by targeting PRMT2.What is already known \u0081Inflammatory bowel disease (IBS) impacts on quality of life and epigenetic modifiers involve its pathogenesis. \u0081PRMT2 involves cellular signalling and gene expression, however its role in colitis remains unknown.

No20180115c0320430). Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines (Percie du Sert et al., 2020)and with the recommendations made by the British Journal of Pharma- cology (Lilley et al., 2020). Male C57BL/6 mice (7 -8 weeks old, 20 \u00b1 2 g, RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664) were purchased from Su Pu SiBiotechnology Co. Ltd. (Suzhou, Jiangsu, China). Mice were housedin a specific pathogen-free animal facility of Jiangnan University (Wuxi, Jiangsu, China) under a 12-h light -dark cycle and standard con- ditions for temperature (24 \u00b1 1 /C14C) and were fed ad libitum (AIN93G). Mice were group-housed (4-5 mice per cage) in individually ventilated cages (IVC). Animal studies were designed to generate groups of equal size in a blinded and random fashion. 2.2 |Lentivirus production and transfection The small hairpin RNA targeting mouse PRMT2 as listed in Table 1 was cloned into the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector by T4 DNA ligaseenzyme according to the manufacturer's instructions (New EnglandBiolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Lentivirus were produced by co-transfec- the PRMT2 lentiviral the packaging plasmid ps-PAX2 and the envelope pMD2 (at a intoHEK-293T cells Lipofectamin 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, After incubation for 48 h, viral parti- cles in the cell culture medium were collected and filtered through a0.45- m membrane filter, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 30 min. The pellet was washed once and resuspended with PBS. Viral titres were measured by QuickTiter Lentivirus Titer Kit (Cell lentiviral expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and then transfected into HEK-293T cells as above described and used toinfect mice or colonic epithelial cells. Mice or cells transduced with pLKO.1-scramble shRNA or blank pLVX-Puro vector were used as negative controls. For ex vivo studies, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)from dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice were isolated using (30-mM EDTA and 1-mM DTT) as previouslydescribed (Greten et al., 2004). 2.3 |Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and delivery of lentivirus DSS-induced colitis is the most widely used experimental model of acute colitis (Wirtz et al., 2007). To evaluate the role of PRMT2 in colitis, intracolonically administration of vehicle lentivector (shScr, Vector), PRMT2-shRNAlentivector lentivector(PRMT2-OE) at a dose of 1 /C210 9IU in a final volume of 100- l PBS were first administered to pentobarbital sodium (30 mg /C1kg/C01; i.p.) anaesthetized mice. It should be noted that both epithelial cells andlamina propria cells could be affected by this procedure (Wirtz et al., 1999). The body temperature of spontaneously breathing anaesthetized mice was maintained on heated blankets. Mice wereplaced in separate cages, kept warm and monitored. All mice were fully recovery in 2 h. Two days later (Matsumoto et al., 2010), mice were given 3% (w/v) DSS (MW 36 -50 kDa) in drinking water for 5 days followed by normal drinking water for 3 days. Negative control mice (CON) received normal drinking water (Li et al., 2020; Wirtz et al., 2017). Daily clinical evaluations, including the assessment ofbody weight, stool consistency and detection of rectal bleeding, wereconducted to generate a disease activity index score. Each parameter was given a grade from 0 to 4 and then averaged as follows:- body weight loss (scored as 0, none; 1, 2, loose stools; 4, diarrhoea) and faecal blood as 0, negative haemoccult test; 1, positive haemoccult test; 2, blood visibly presentin the stool; 3, blood visible and blood clotting on the anus; 4, gross bleeding) as previously described (Kim et al., 2012). For permeability experiments, fluorescein isothiocyanate /C01of body weight (Sharma et al., 2018). After 4 h, mice were killed by an overdose of pentobarbi- tone (90 mg /C1kg/C01; i.p.) and serum concentrations of FITC-dextran were assessed. In addition, the colon epithelial permeability wasdetermined using an Evans Blue assay according to Vargas Robles et al. (2017).

No2019[029]). Written informed consentwas obtained from all subjects. Colonoscopic biopsies were obtained from 9 Crohn's disease patients, 10 ulcerative colitis patients and 9 healthy individuals. The characteristics of human subjects weredescribed in Table 2. The diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerativecolitis was confirmed by a gastroenterologist based on a standard combination of clinical, endoscopic, biochemical, stool and histological criteria. A Mayo score was used for evaluation of ulcerative colitisactivity, which was based on four categories (bleeding, stool frequency, physician assessment and endoscopic appearance). The results correlate with disease severity: <2 remission; 3 -5 mild; 6 -10 moderate; 10 -12 severe (Lewis et al., 2008). Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score was used for the assessment of Crohn's disease activity, which was based on clinically reported signs, laboratoryresults and patient-reported symptoms in a 7-day period. The three possible grades depending on the results are clinical remission <150; mild to moderate activity 150 -450; and severe disease >450 (Freeman, 2008). 2.5 |Histopathological analysis Fresh colonic tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. After paraffin embedding, sections (5 m) were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (Hayakawa et al., 2010). Colonic injuries were examined under a DM2000 light microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Hesse, Germany) at200/C2magnification. The stained tissues were histologically evaluated in a double-blind fashion as previously published, using a combined score for epithelial damage and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Histological scoring was performed as follows: epithelium (score0, normal; -50%;score loss crypt score 5, ulcer 1%-50%; and score 6, ulcer >50%); infiltration of mucosa 0, normal; score 1, 2, 10% and score (score score 1, 1% -50% and score 2, >50%) and muscle or serosa (score 0, normal and score 1, >1%). Histologicalscores were the sum of epithelial damage scores and inflammatory cell infiltration scores (Deng et al., 2019; Katakura et al., 2005). 2.6 |Isolation, culture and lentiviral infection of mouse colon epithelial cells Mouse colonic epithelial cells were isolated and cultured as described previously (Booth & O'Shea, 2002; Di Claudio et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). Briefly, mice were killed by an overdose of pentobarbi- tone (90 mg /C1kg/C01; i.p.) and the colon was incubated with collagenase type U /C1ml/C01) and dispase protease (20 ug /C1ml/C01) for 2 h. After and centrifuged again. was carried out five times. The crypts were plated in dishes coated with collagen hydrogel (Corning, NY, USA) and cultured in medium supplemented with Wnt-3A (30 ng performed every 4 days. Colonic IECs (5 /C2105per well) were infected with PRMT2-OE, shPRMT2, or Vector and shScr at a multiplicity ofinfection of 50. At 48 h after infection, cells were stimulated withvehicle (PBS) or 50 ng /C1ml-1 TNF- for 2 h. 2.7 |Gene expression RNA samples were isolated using RNAiso Plus (Total RNA extraction reagent, TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) and then purified with LiClprecipitations as previously described (Viennois et al., 2018). Purified RNA was reversed by Prime-Script RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa Bio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA levels weredetected by qPCR SYBR Green Mix kits (YEASEN Biotechnology Co.,Ltd., China) and normalized to -actin. 2 /C044 Ctquantifica- tion method was conducted for calculations.

Fresh colon samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen imme- diately and embedded in OCT compound (Neg-50; Thermo Fisher Scientific), cryo-sectioned and fixed with acetone (SinopharmChemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 15 min at 4 /C14C. The sections were then permeabilized and blocked with blocking buffer (P0260; Beyotime Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature andincubated with fluorochrome primary antibody overnight at 4 /C14C. After extensive washing with PBS, sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Flour 555 pAb stained with Beyotime Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence (Zeiss, Gottingen, 610181, RRID:AB_ 397580). The relative quantification of immunofluorescence staining was performed by comparing the mean grey value through ImageJsoftware and normalized to the control group (Arqu\u00e9s et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2020). 2.10 |Co-immunoprecipitation Cruz Biotechnology, Cat# sc-135010, RRID:AB_10610885) at followed by incubation with protein A/G agarose (SantaCruz Biotechnology) for 4 h.

Data are calculated as percentage of input. 2.12 |ELISA Colon tissues were homogenized, and the concentration of TNF- was analysed with a commercial ELISA kit (CUSABIO TECHNOLOGYLLC, Wuhan, Hubei, China) according to the manufacturer'sinstructions. 2.13 |Data and statistical analysis The data and statistical analysis comply with the recommendations on experimental design and analysis in pharmacology (Curtis et al., 2018).Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was per- formed using GraphPad Prism (Version 7.04; GraphPad Software Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA, RRID:SCR_002798). The group size indifferent groups is the number of mice in each group or the number of separate experiments ( in vitro ). The group size for statistical analysis was n=6. The distribution of the data was tested with the Shapiro - Wilk normality test. For the difference between two groups, a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t-test was used. Comparisons among groups were analysed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's post hoc test. Post hoc tests were run only if Fachieved P< 0.05 and there was no significant variance inhomogeneity. A value of P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.LIET AL. 145 2.14 |Materials DSS was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA, USA).

As indicated in Figure 1a, PRMT2 andPRMT5 were significantly up-regulated in colitis mice compared withthe control mice, whereas no significant differences were observed for other PRMT family members. Meanwhile, a more prominent PRMT2 expression than PRMT5 was observed during colitis. There-fore, we mainly focused on PRMT2 in the subsequent study. By immunofluorescence staining, we further confirmed that PRMT2 was highly expressed in the colonic tissues of mice with colitis (Figure 1b,c) and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Figure 1d,e), and PRMT2 was mainly expressed in colonic epithelial cells (Figure 1b -e). Thus, these results suggest that aberrant PRMT2 up-regulation incolonic epithelium is associated with colitis. 3.2 |Colonic PRMT2 overexpression aggravates DSS-induced colitis To further address the function of PRMT2 in colitis, in vivo over- expression of PRMT2 in mouse colon was performed intrarectal instillation with lentiviruses of either PRMT2-OE (PRMT2overexpression lentivirus) or Vector (empty vehicle lentivirus) 2 days before DSS treatment. In vivo , a significant twofold increase in PRMT2 expression was observed after PRMT2-OE administration compared with the Vector +DSS-treated mice (Figure S1A). Overexpression of PRMT2 in the murine colon aggravated DSS-induced weight loss(Figure 2a); increased disease activity disease index score (DAI) based on body weight change, stool consistency and faecal blood (Figure 2b), and worsened shortening of the colon (Figure 2c). By fur-ther histological examination, we found that PRMT2 overexpression resulted in more severe colonic epithelial injury (white arrowheads), crypt loss (black arrows) and inflammatory infiltrates (black arrow-heads) than in DSS-treated mice (Figure 2d,e). Overexpression ofPRMT2 in steady state did not affect colon morphology (Figure S1B). Moreover, intestinal permeability was markedly increased in PRMT2-OE-treated mice, based on a serum FITC-dextran (Figure 2f)and Evans Blue assay (Figure 2g), which was further confirmed by decreased expression of ZO-1 and claudin-1 and increased expression of claudin-2 (Figure 2h). Together, these data indicate that colitis. 3.3 |Colonic PRMT2 We next determined whether colonic PRMT2 silencing could protect mice from colitis. Knocking down of PRMT2 in murine colon was achieved by intrarectal injection of shPRMT2 lentivirus. shPRMT2-treated mice exhibited a significant twofold decrease inPRMT2 expression level compared with the shScr +DSS-treated mice (Figure S1C). As expected, knockdown of PRMT2 in murine colon attenuated DSS-induced colitis, as evidenced by reduced weightloss (Figure 3a), DAI score (Figure 3b), alleviated shortening of colons (Figure 3c) and histological damage (Figure 3d,e). Knockdown of PRMT2 in steady state did not affect colon morphology (Figure S1B).Moreover, reduced intestinal permeability (Figure colons increased expression of ZO-1 and claudin-1 and decreased expression of claudin-2 (Figure 3h). Collectively, our loss-of-function experimentscomplement the above findings obtained from the PRMT2-overexpressing mice, supporting that PRMT2 is critical in colitis development. 3.4 |PRMT2 mediates NF- B/MAPK activation in DSS-induced colitis To further explore the underlying mechanism of PRMT2-induced coli- tis, we analysed S2, PRMT2-OE increased the levels of TNF- of PRMT2 1 arginine methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) expression is elevated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.

By further qPCR detection, we found that overexpression of PRMT2 significantlyincreased TNF- expression and enhanced suppressed and downstream chemokine expression (Figure 4b). In addition, primarycolonic mouse epithelial cells were isolated and transfected withPRMT2-OE or shPRMT2 followed by TNF- stimulation, to further determine whether PRMT2 TNF- knockdown of PRMT2 diminished TNF- -induced downstream genes expression (Figure 4d) in epithelial cells.

By determining phosphorylation levels of nuclear factor- B (NF- B) p65 and MAPKs in murine p38,ERK andJNK both in the colon (Figure 5a) and in isolated colonic epithelial cells (Figure 5b). In contrast, the knockdown of PRMT2suppressed the activation of p65, p38, ERK and JNK in colons (Figure 5c) and epithelial cells (Figure 5d).

To further dissect the mech-anism underlying how PRMT2 mediated NF- B/MAPK activation, we next analysed the consequences of gain/loss of function of PRMT2 on TRAF2/TRAF5 expression in colon samples. As shownin Figure 6, the expression of TRAF5 was up-regulated in DSS- treated mice, and overexpression of PRMT2 in further enhanced DSS-induced TRAF5 expression at both mRNA(Figure 6a) and protein 6b). Accordingly, blunted DSS-induced TRAF5 expression (Figure 6c,d). TRAF2 expression was elevated during experimental colitis. Itsexpression was reduced by shPRMT2 but not affected by PRMT2overexpression (Figure S3A,B). Together, these results demonstrate that PRMT2 modulates NF- B/MAPK activation by inducing TRAF5 expression in colitis.3.6 |PRMT2 inhibits the binding of SOCS3 to TRAF5 and the degradation of TRAF5 protein via ubiquitination Previous studies suggest that suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) may directly mediate the Lys48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF proteins (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2015). Thus, we explored whether PRMT2 stimulates TRAF5 expression byinhibiting SOCS3-mediated ubiquitination. We found that SOCS3 was up-regulated in the colon of mice with experimental colitis (Figure 7a, b), and its expression was markedly decreased by PRMT2 over-expression (Figure 7a) and correspondingly increased by PRMT2 knockdown (Figure 7b). This suggests that SOCS3 may be involved in the PRMT2-mediated regulation of colitis. By subsequent immunopre-cipitation assays, we confirmed that SOCS3 interacted in primary colonic epithelia of DSS-treated mice, which were consistent with the findings in TNF- -treated epithelial cells (Figure 7e,f). Moreover, by the knockdown of PRMT2 (Figure S4B). These results collectively demonstrate that PRMT2 FIGURE 4 Protein arginine methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) regulates (a,b) Relative mRNA cytokines murine colon were (c,d) levels of TNF- -induced cytokines in primary colonic epithelial cells were measured Data are means \u00b1 SEM, n=6. *P< mediates MAPK and NF- B activation.

To reveal whether the altered gene expression is a consequence of PRMT2-mediated his-tone arginine methylation, we examined several histone methylation levels in murine colon. As shown in Figure 8a, the levels of asym- metric demethylation on H3R8me2a methylation levels (Figure 8a).

Overexpression of PRMT2aggravates while knockdown of PRMT2 attenuates DSS-induced colitis, supporting that PRMT2 is a pivotal and essential mediator of colitis. Additional mechanistic investigations reveal that PRMT2promotes colitis by increasing repressive histone mark H3R8me2a at the SOCS3 promoter, thus inhibiting SOCS3 expression and its FIGURE 6 Protein arginine methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2)promotes TNF receptor associatedfactor 5 TRAF5 in murine colonadministered lentivector(PRMT2-OE).

Altogether, our study identifies PRMT2 as a critical protein in the development colitis. Pharmacologi- cal targeting at PRMT2 may therefore provide a novel approach for the treatment of colitis. The PRMT enzyme family regulate diverse cellular programmes, including RNA splicing, signalling transduction, DNA damage repairand protein -protein interactions (Blanc & Richard, 2017). While the other four PRMTs including PRMT1, PRMT4, PRMT5 and PRMT6have been documented to correlate with inflammatory responses (Kimet al., 2016), the role of PRMT2 in inflammatory diseases remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PRMT2 is expressed at a low basal level in normal colon tissues of mice but increases during colitis devel-opment. Our study demonstrated that PRMT2 was more prominently up-regulated than other PRMT proteins during inflammatory bowel FIGURE 7 Protein arginine methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) inhibits the interaction between suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) and TNF receptor associated factor 5 (TRAF5).

Meanwhile, colonic PRMT2 overexpression aggravates while PRMT2 knockdown protects against DSS-inducedcolitis mice, proving that PRMT2 acts as a proinflammatory media- tor in colitis. Our observation is in agreement with an earlier clinicalstudy showing elevated PRMT2 expression in inflamed tissues of ulcerative colitis patients, suggesting that PRMT2 positively correlates with clinical disease severity (Krzystek-Korpacka et al., 2020). TNF- signalling and TNF- -induced inflammatory responses have an important role in the initiation and development of colitis FIGURE 8 Protein arginine methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) epigenetically inhibits suppressor of expression increasing H3R8 asymmetric methylation (H3R8me2a) level in the SOCS3 promoter.

(f) Graphical summary for the role and mechanism of PRMT2 in mediating the development of colitis in mice.PRMT2-mediated H3R8me2a directly suppresses the expression of SOCS3 leading todownstream NF- B/MAPK activation, proinflammatory cytokine production and propagation of inflammatory responses during colitis. GAPDH was used as an internal control (CON) and the grey value and area of each band were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase(GAPDH) for (a), (c) and (d). Data are means \u00b1 SEM, n=6. *P< 0.05154 LIET AL. (Khalil et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2019). Therefore, in this study, we determined the regulatory effects of PRMT2 on TNF- signalling and its regulatory transcriptional factor NF- B. Our results demonstrated that colonic expression of TNF- and its downstream chemokines of PRMT2 in DSS-induced colitis mice and their expression levels were tightly regulated by PRMT2 knock- down, further supporting the proinflammatory role of PRMT2 in thedevelopment of colitis. Furthermore, overexpression PRMT2 enhanced phosphorylation of NF- B both in murine colon in murine colonic epithelial cells. In contrast, PRMT2 knock-down suppressed the activation of NF- B p65 in the colon and epi- thelial cells. It has been suggested that a positive feedback loop exists between NF- B and TNF- (Kagoya et al., 2014). NF- B and MAPKs are transcriptional factors and signalling molecules that regulate theexpression of TNF- . TNF- derived from destroyed epithelial or immune cells can activate NF- B and MAPKs to produce more proinflammatory cytokines including TNF- itself (Kagoya et al., 2014; Sabio & Davis, 2014). Thus, our findings suggested that PRMT2 may promote colitis by targeting at the positive feedback loop between NF-B and TNF- . TNF- -induced apoptosis and necrosis in epithelium contribute to the pathogenesis of colitis. It has been demonstrated that PRMT2 inhibited cell activation and promoted apoptosis in mouse embryofibroblasts (Ganesh et al., 2006). PRMT2 interacted with splicing fac-tors to regulate the alternative splicing Bcl-2-like 1 (Bcl-xl/BCLX) in TNF- -treated et rendered cells more susceptible to apoptosis bycytokines or cytotoxic drugs through reducing E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) expression (Yoshimoto et al., 2006). The above findings suggest that PRMT2 may participate in inflammatory bowel diseaseby stimulating epithelial apoptosis. While our study demonstrated the damage effects of PRMT2 on intestinal epithelium, whether and how apoptosis/necrosis pathways are involved needs to be furtherrevealed in the follow-up study. Arginine methylation plays a major role in transcriptional regula- tion because of the ability of the PRMTs Richard, 2017). In this study, we analysed the regulatory effects of PRMT2 on H4R3me2a, H4R3me2s, for H3R8me2a levels. for its transcriptional inhibition proinflammatory gene expression, suggesting that a PRMT2-mediated epigenetic mechanism critically regulates the development of colitis. Similarly, Dong et al. (2018) demonstrated thatPRMT2 is the main source for H3R8me2a and PRMT2-mediatedH3R8me2a is responsible for the activation of oncogenic transcrip- tional programmes (Dong et al., 2018). While our study is the first to indicate that PRMT2-mediated H3R8me2a is involved in mediatingcolitis, whether other histone marks by PRMT2 may participate in colitis progression remains to be identified. In addition, most of thehistone-modifying enzymes including PRMTs have multiple nonhis- tone substrates. For example, PRMT2 has been implicated in themethylation of STAT3 (Iwasaki et al., 2010) and E1B-AP5 (Kzhyshkowska et al., 2001). Thus, it would be interesting to identify potential nonhistone substrates of PRMT2 in the context of colitis. SOCS3, a well-known anti-inflammatory mediator, has been shown to negatively regulate NF- B and ERK/MAPK-dependent gene expression of proinflammatory mediators (Hovsepian et al., 2013;Mahony et al., 2016). The expression of SOCS3 is directly regulated by promoter methylation, and its expression may be inhibited or greatly reduced due to hypermethylation of the CpG islands in itspromoter region (Boosani & Agrawal, 2015). In our study, we demon-strate that PRMT2-mediated H3R8me2a directly targets the promoter region transcriptional inhibition. explains the enhanced activation of NF- B and MAPK and the subsequent aggravation of colitis. Previously, studies have reported that SOCS3 degrades TRAF6 via polyubiquitination (Zhanget al., 2018; 2015), and elevated SOCS3 promotes Lys48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF6, consequently impairing NF- B activation (Zhang et al., 2018). Here, we demonstrate that SOCS3 could also bind to TRAF5 and mediate Lys48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF5, thereby promoting TRAF5 degradation. In contrast, TRAF2 elevated during experimental colitis was reduced byshPRMT2. However, its expression was not affected by PRMT2 over-expression, suggesting that TRAF2 may be influenced by other regula- tors and thus not as important as TRAF5 for PRMT2-mediated inflammatory response. TRAF5 has been reported to mediate NF- B/ MAPK activation in response to TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines (Au & Yeh, 2007; Oeckinghaus et al., 2011). As a result, PRMT2 overexpression induces the expression of NF- is by preventing TRAF5 degra- dation, contributing to aggravated colitis development. In summary, our study demonstrates that PRMT2 promotes the development of colitis by acting as a proinflammatorymediator. Mechanistically, PRMT2-mediated H3R8me2a directly suppresses the expression of of TRAF5, subsequently leading to downstreamNF-B/MAPK activation, proinflammatory cytokine production and propagation of inflammatory responses during colitis. Thus, the development of therapeutic strategies to specifically target PRMT2might be useful for manipulating inflammatory diseases including colitis.
