ABOUT US Like most parents, we thought our daughters were fully protected against meningococcal meningitis. They were not. We each lost our young, healthy daughters too soon to Meningitis B, a disease that is now preventable through vaccination. High school senior Kimberly, 17, died one week before her graduation. College sophomore Emily, 19, died just 36 hours after her /f_irst symptoms. While both had received the MenACWY vaccine, the MenB vaccine was not yet available to help protect them from Meningitis B. Since then, The Kimberly Coffey Foundation and The Emily Stillman Foundation have come together to launch the Meningitis B Action Project so other families don't needlessly suffer the same Meningococcal Vaccination.
