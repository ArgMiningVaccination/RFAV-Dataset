Patient Testimonials \"Jodi is amazing. I can recall having really tight shoulders and chronic pain throughout the day. After my first session it felt as if my shoulders had been replaced by new ones. Jodi has healing hands and is knowledgable in locating exactly what areas need work. I would go everyday if I could. I've been training 10+ years and Acupunture works well & well needed in a program.\" Donavan Alexander \"They say the best review is a referral. I was introduced to Jodi by a friend of mine, and I've introduced her to several friends of mine since then. I'm terrified of needles, so getting Acupunture was a big deal for me. Jodi eased me into treatment and took time to explain things and try different needles and techniques. It's made a huge difference in my life (and I'm much better with needles now). She has also treated my husband for back issues and its's helped him immensely. She incredibly kind, warm and caring. I'd recommend her to anyone!\" Renee \"I started seeing Jodi for severe back pain, which she successfully helped to treat. She reviewed my MRI and developed a treatment plan. Jodi's approach to Acupunture is very medical and methodical. I've continued seeing her regularly for other things she can help with; sleeping better, allergies, immunity during cold/flu season, stress, sport injuries, muscle knots....If there's something bothering me, she usually has a treatment for it. Couldn't have healed my back pain and herniated discs without her.\" Craig I started seeing Jodi at a time when I was experiencing chronic back pain and stress and nothing was working. I had tried everything from physical therapy to medicine to nerve treatment with no luck. Jodi's acupuncture is truly the only thing that has helped me get better and be able to live my life comfortably. She is knowledgable and adaptable and really cares! I will go into a session with Jodi in pain and unable to walk and leave feeling like a new person, I have always recommend her and will continue to do so! Caitlin Bookman Jodi is remarkable! I visited her several years back when my Dr. gave me two options, acupuncture or a cortisone injection in my spine. I chose acupunture, with Jodi, for the first time and after a few visits my pain in my back was gone. It was a wonderful and pleasant experience. Fast foward to today, I have found Jodi and she has helped me with my very painful knee. My knee is so much better. I can walk without pain and I can sleep without pain. Jodi has also helped me get the best deep sleep ever! She listens and wants to help you. I would gladly recommend , and have recommended Jodi to friends and family. I am so grateful to have Jodi helping me to live a happier and healthier life. Susanne Farraye Write a Review This is your Testimonials section paragraph.
