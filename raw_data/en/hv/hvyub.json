A recent Australian survey suggests that about half of the general population employs such treatments1 This is remark\u00ad able when we know so little about the effica-damage such as spinal cord transection and 1 disk protrusion.

It is commonly believed that complementary/ alternative medicine (CAM) is natural and therefore safe and that people can be treat\u00ad ed without side-effects. The results of two recent surveys, however, provide evidence on the potential risks. In the first study, we invited readers of the British daily newspaper The Guardian ( circulation about 500,000) to answer a questionnaire about their experiences with CAM. The 386 respondents were, as expect\u00ad ed, strongly in favour of its use: 91.4% had a positive attitude, and 95.6% said it had improved their quality of life. But when asked about treatment outcome, a large proportion (23.8%) reported adverse effects (AE) (see table). The rate of AEs following acupuncture (12.5%) was similar to that reported elsewhere'. In the second study, a questionnaire was sent to every general practice in Devon and Cornwall (n = 972) enquiring whether gen\u00ad eral practitioners (GPs) had encountered patients experiencing problems with com\u00ad plementary terapies. Of the respondents, 176 (38.2%) reported encountering AEs. The table describes the direct physical AEs, but there were also 11 reports of psy\u00ad chological effects (mainly disillusion at absence of promised benefit) and 17 cases of inappropriate management or frank mis\u00ad diagnosis by complementary therapists. Manipulation therapy, such as chiropractic and osteopathy, was the dominant cause of physical AEs seen by GPs (see table): 3 of these cases (1.3% of all AEs reported) led to bone fractures and 2 to neurological NATURE \u00b7 VOL 381 \u00b7 30 MAY 1996 ence of serious AEs. The GP survey, on the other hand, was likely to collect reports of the more severe AEs. Furthermore, neither questionnaire provides reliable prevalence figures. However, both sets of data illustrate that CAM is not entirely free of risk. We therefore suggest more rigorous investiga\u00ad tions into this topic to determine the extent of the problem and (if necessary) to design a strategy to minimize harm. N. C. Abbot A. R. White E.

Feynman faux pas SIR -Our fascination with Richard Feyn\u00ad man's lectures (see review of Feynman's Lost Lecture1) is fuelled in part by the glimpses they give us of his extraordinary mind. Readers of Nature might therefore relish learning that Feynman could blunder. In a lecture at the US National Academy of Sciences in 1955 (reprinted in ref. 2), Feynman muses about why writers and artists do not rhapsodize about science. He wonders if perhaps they don't know \"how to read the music\", which he suggests is neces\u00ad sary to develop beautiful abstract ideas. He CORRESPONDENCE then invents an example in which ironically he, of all people, appears to misread the music. Feynman says (page 244): \"For instance, the scientific article may say, 'The radioactive phosphorus content of the cere\u00ad brum of the rat decreases to one-half in a period of two weeks.' Now what does that mean? It means that phosphorus that is in the brain of a rat -and also in mine and yours -is not the same phosphorus as it was two weeks ago.\" He tries to make something of the fact that our mind retains information despite replacement of phosphorus atoms in the brain. But the example he gives would not prove replacement; in fact, it suggests quite the opposite. In an endearing lapse, Feyn\u00ad man appears to have blanked out on the half-life for the decay of 32P to sulphur, which just happens to be two weeks; if the radioactivity decreases to one-half in two weeks it means (within experimental error) that there was no turnover of phosphorus in the cerebrum. A further irony is that the excerpt is cited approvingly by Daniel C. Dennett in his much-praised book on evolution3; Dennett is also concerned about scientific abstrac\u00ad tion and introduces the quotation with reck\u00ad less adulation, saying (page 360), \"Nobody has ever put it better than the physicist Richard Feynman\".

Hard evidence SIR -It has been suggested that the prob\u00ad lem of consciousness consists of an 'easy problem' and a 'hard problem'. Exploring the neurobiology of vision, for example, is 'easy' but understanding subjective visual experience is 'hard'1-3 To solve the hard problem, a 'new theory' has been developed in which 'conscious experience' is an irre\u00ad ducible phenomenon, with a physical (brain state) and an experiential (subjective state) aspect linked by psychophysical laws3 Replace 'conscious experience' with pre\u00ad sented by von Helmholtz in 1857 (ref. 4). Progress in the study of consciousness has not been delayed by theoretical constraints. Per S,idersten Karolinska Institute, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Novum, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden 1.
