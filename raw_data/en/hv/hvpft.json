Bryophyllum pinnatum (Crassulaceae) is a peren- nial succulent herb originating from Madagascarwith a long tradition of use in tropical countries.In Europe, its utilization is more recent and al-most exclusively restricted to anthroposophicmedicine (AM). Introduced in 1921 by RudolfSteiner initially for the treatment of what at thattime was called \"hysteria \",Bryophyllum is now used for a variety of hyperactivity disorders. Untilvery recently, only a few experimental and clini-cal data were available to support the use ofB. pinnatum from the perspective of rational phy- totherapy. Some years ago we therefore embarkedwithin the Bryophyllum Study Group (see ac- knowledgments) in a large collaborative projectonB. pinnatum with the aim to provide reliable clinical, pharmacological, and chemical data onthis plant. We review here the current state ofknowledge on the phytochemistry, pharmacolog-ical properties, and clinical data of B. pinnatum . With respect to pharmacology, an emphasis isput on properties related to the use in AM, butother bioactivities are also briefly reviewed.Some reviews have been previously published onthe constituents and pharmacological activities ofB. pinnatum [1-3] or, very recently, on the entire genus Kalanchoe , which includes, according to some botanical authors, species of the genusAbstract ! Bryophyllum pinnatum (syn. Kalanchoe pinnata )i s a succulent perennial plant native to Madagascarthat was introduced in anthroposophic medicinein the early 20th century. In recent years, we con-ducted a large collaborative project to provide re-liable data on the chemical composition, pharma-cological properties, and clinical efficacy of Bryo- phyllum . Here, we comprehensively review the phytochemistry, as well as the pharmacologicaland clinical data. As to the pharmacology, specialemphasis is given to properties related to the usein anthroposophic medicine as a treatment for\"hyperactivity diseases \", such as preterm labor, restlessness, and sleep disorders. Studies suggest-ing that B. pinnatum may become a new treat- ment option for overactive bladder syndrome arealso reviewed. Tolerability is addressed, and toxi-cological data are discussed in conjunction withthe presence of potentially toxic bufadienolidesinBryophyllum species. The few data available on two related species with medicinal uses, Bryo-phyllum daigremontianum and Bryophyllum dela- goense , have also been included. Taken together, current data support the use of B. pinnatum for the mentioned indications, but further studiesare needed to fully understand the modes of ac-tion, and to identify the pharmacologically activeconstituents.

While these reviews describe vari- ous compounds and bioactivities, none of them addresses thepharmacological and clinical data that support the therapeuticuse of Bryophyllum preparations in European countries. The present review focuses on B. pinnatum , but the few data available on also been included. The German homeopathic pharma- copeia (HAB) 2014 [5] lists the two species B. pinnatum and B. daigremontianum as officinal in its monography \"Bryophyllum Rh\", and both have been used in AM. B. delagoense was intro- duced in the 1980s as an anthroposophic medicinal product inGermany, primarily for sedative purposes (Personal communica-tion, Dr. med. Siegward-M. Elsas, see Acknowledgments). Botany ! The genus Bryophyllum comprises approximately 25 perennial succulent species that are native to Madagascar [6]. Meanwhile,many of them have been introduced in other tropical areaswhere they have sometimes become invasive plants. The genushas an intricate taxonomy, with a variable number of speciesand numerous synonyms, and is regarded by some authors asone of three sections (Kitchingia, Bryophyllum, and Eukalanchoe)of the genus Kalanchoe [6-8].Bryophyllum species have a unique mode of vegetative reproduction whereby young plantlets devel-op on the edges of leaves before being shed for propagation.Bryophyllum pinnatum (Lam.) Oken, originally described by La- marck as Cotyledon pinnata Lam. according to The Plant List [9], possesses 20 synonyms including Bryophyllum calycinum Salisb. and Kalanchoe pinnata (Lam.) Pers., a name that is very frequently used in the literature (For the full list of synonyms,seeTable 1 S , Supporting Information). B. pinnatum grows up to 1.5 m in height and is known by numerous vernacular names,such as life plant, air plant, love plant, miracle leaf, cathedralbells, and Goethe plant. The latter refers to the detailed observa-tions written down by Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 -1832) about (syn. Kalanchoe daigremontiana Raym.-Hamet & H. Perrier) is somewhat smaller (up to 1 m) and commonlyknown as mother of millions, or devil s backbone. Bryophyllum Eliot [9]) grows up to 1.5 m in height and possesses narrowleaves. Vernacular names include mother of millions, devil s backbone, or chandelier plant. The accepted names of The PlantList, B. pinnatum, B. daigremontianum, andB. delagoense , are con- sistently used throughout this manuscript, regardless of thenames used in the respective original publications. Constituents ! Various secondary metabolites have been reported from Bryo- phyllum species. Particular attention has been paid to the bufa- dienolides, owing to their toxicological relevance for grazing ani-mals [10], and their various other bioactivities. Beside these, alarge number of flavonoids have been reported in B. pinnatum Further constituents of B. pinnatum include triterpenes, varioussteroids, phenanthrenes, and some ubiquitous compounds. Data on the composition of B. daigremontianum andB. delagoense are almost exclusively limited bufadienolides ( 1-13), including three glycosides, from B. pinnatum, B. delagoense, B. daigremontia- num, and the hybrid B. daigremontianum xtubiflorum (l\"Table 1 ,Fig. 1 ), mostly in conjunction with various bioactiv- ities such and cytotoxic properties acteristic structural feature is the 1,3,5-orthoacetate function,which is present in about half of these compounds. ( 1), bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate ( bryotoxin C (= bryophyllin A, 4)h a v e been found in all species. In contrast, bryophyllins B ( 5)a n dC( 6) have been reported only in pinnatum , and daigremo- B. daigremontianum and/or B. daigremontianum xtubiflorum . The latter compound is listed here on the basis of biogenetic considerations even though it is not a bufadienolidebut rather a congener with an opened lactone ring. Bufadieno-lides were recently quantified in different batches of leaves andpress juices of B. pinnatum with the aid and bersaldegenin 1,3,5-orthoacetate ( 3) were found to be the main bufadienolides in the analyzed plants, with the totalcontents in the leaves ranging from 3.78 to 40.50 mg/100 g dryweight. Interestingly, when single leaves from individual plantswere analyzed, the content was found to be significantly higherin younger leaves. In the same study, the four compounds werealso quantified in leaves of B. daigremontianum andB. delagoense [24]. Flavonoids A number of flavonoids have been identified in B. pinnatum .T h e y include numerous flavonol derivatives ( 14-35), mainly quercetin and kaempferol 2 )[ , 2 5 -36]. In addition, epigallocatechin-3-O- syringate ( and anthocyani- a biogenetically unlikely structure [37] have been re-ported.To our knowledge, no flavonoids have been reported from B. gremontianum , -pentahydroxy-3 -methoxyflavone ( 43) have been isolated from the whole plants of B. delagoense [38] (l \"Fig. B. pin- natum . The plant was also shown to contain various phytosterols, such as 2016; 82: 930 -941Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. From B. daigremontianum , glutin-5(6)-en-3 -ol, stigmasterol, and a mixture of -a n d -amyrin have been isolated [43]. Gluti- nol and friedelin have been identified by mass spectrometry asthe major triterpenoids in the leaf wax [14], . The latter compounds pos- sess a 1,3,5-orthoacetate function that is also found in many bu-fadienolides of the genus Bryophyllum . Kalantuboside B differs from kalantuboside A by a biogenetically unusual location of thecarbonyl group in the lactone ring Miscellaneous metabolites 2(9-Decenyl)-phenanthrene and 2-(9-undecenyl)-phenanthrene [41] were obtained as a mixture from the leaves of B. pinnatum and identified by GC MS. More recently, a nitrogen containing derivative (6-[8-(ethenylamino)phenanthren-2-yl]hex-5-yn-2-one) was also obtained [46]. However, it must be pointed out thatthe structure reported for the latter compound is biogeneticallynot plausible.A lignan glycoside, bryophylluside ( 51), herbs of B. pinnatum [26].

Taurolipid C ( 53) found [14] (l \"Fig. 3 ). B. pinnatum was shown to contain large amounts of malic acid [13]. Other carboxylic acids include, according to a previous re-view, acid, riboflavin, thiamine, nia-cin, pyridoxine), were reported [2]. The rare vitamin E congeners-,-, and -tocomonoenols were identified in the leaves of B. daigremontianum , together with the widespread -,-a n d - tocopherols [50]. Ethnomedical Uses ! B. pinnatum has been widely used in traditional medicine of tropical regions where the plants grow spontaneously, such asMadagascar, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, India, Indonesia, Phil-ippines, Indo-China, and Brazil. Leaves and stems taste bitter and,due to their astringent effects, are effective against diarrhea, flat-ulence, and vomiting [2]. In Trinidad and Tobago, they are used toTable 1 Bufadienolides isolated from B. pinnatum, B. delagoense, , and the hybrid B. xtubiflorum .

Herbalists in Nigeria use anaqueous leaf extract for the treatment of cough and in the pro-phylaxis of asthma [52]. In India, the leaves are employed as ahepatoprotective herb to treat jaundice [53], and have also beenrecommended for the treatment of wounds, bruises, and insectbites [54,55]. Leaf preparations are used as an antipyretic andfor treatment of malaria in Africa, Asia, and Latin America [56].Further traditional uses with the corresponding countries havebeen listed in [3]. Bryophyllum pinnatum in Anthroposophic Medicine ! AM is an integrative multimodal medical system that was devel- oped by the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861 -1925) and the Dutch medical doctor Ita Wegman (1876 -1943). AM is currently practiced in 80 countries worldwide.In 1921, the first anthroposophic hospital in Arlesheim, Switzer-land, was established by Ita Wegman. AM is practiced by physi-cians who are fully trained and qualified in university medicineby integrating conventional skills and methods with a holisticunderstanding of man and nature. From this point of view, theunderstanding of the human being in his entirety means the ac-ceptance of a three-system organization with a physical body, thesoul, and the spirit. This holistic view of the human being leads toan understanding of health and illness that differs from conven- tional medicine, and to treatments that are specifically adaptedto each individual.Bryophyllum plants have the unique ability to let new plantlets grow from their leaves, thereby suggesting, according to anthro-posophic concepts, a strong vegetative force and great vitality.Additionally, flower formation is somehow displaced to theleaves, as demonstrated by the distribution of anthocyanins,which are normally present in flowers, and are responsible forthe reddish and purple patterns on the leaves. Furthermore, theplant does flower under favorable conditions only.From the perspective of AM, B. pinnatum is therapeutically indi- cated if the so-called astral and etheric bodies separate too muchfrom each other. This means that the processes linked to psychicqualities, such as emotions, and the physiological processes arenot well-balanced, which disturbs the basis for the healthy stateof a patient. B. pinnatum is supposed to reunite these two parts of the human organization, thereby restoring holistic balance.Based on this principle, B. pinnatum has historically been used to treat inner restlessness and anxiety, and, therefore, was alsocalled \"herbal valium its sedative properties [57,58]. In B. pinnatum preparations were initially recommended by Rudolf Steiner as AMs to treat \"hysteria \"[59]. Steiner de- scribed hysteria as the condition in which the spiritual and emo-tional energy is not capable anymore to fully regulate normalphysical functions [60]. Later, in 1970, Dr. Werner Hassauer(1928 -1993), a German gynecologist, introduced B. pinnatum as a tocolytic agent to prevent premature labor in an AM hospital(see below) [61]. Preparations and application A large multicenter observational study was performed involving38 German physicians collaborating in the Evaluation of Anthro-posophic Medicine (EvaMed) network. Over 6 years, a total of4038 prescriptions were recorded in the EvaMed data bank andshowed a broad indication range [62]. B. pinnatum preparations are produced by Weleda Heilmittel GmbH fo-cuses on B. daigremontianum . The use of B. pinnatum preparations is described in the German Commission C monographs. In Switzerland, B. pinnatum prepara- tions are authorized by the Swiss Agency for therapeutic prod-ucts (Swissmedic) as a medicinal product without any indication.B. pinnatum is currently used for the treatment of premature la- bor and for some other medical conditions, such as sleep dis-orders induced by restlessness, anxiety, pain induced by vitalweakness, and recurrent inflammation in the metabolic system[63]. Complex anthroposophic preparations, such as B. pinnatum Mercurio cultum or Argento cultum contain plants which the corresponding homeopathic diluted metal(quicksilver or silver) [62]. These preparations are primarily usedto regulate metabolic processes with or without concomitantpsychological symptoms (e.g., restlessness and sleep disorders).The combination of B. pinnatum and Conchae (calcium carbonate from oyster shell) is also used to harmonize rhythm and is pre-scribed to patients suffering from difficulty falling asleep, rest-lessness, excitation, and exhaustion [64]. B. pinnatum prepara- AG are available in different powder, tablets, drops, and ampoules. Globuli globules coated with are commercialized by Wala Heilmittel GmbH.Very recently, an online survey in Switzerland showed that ingynecology and obstetrics, B. pinnatum (50% tablets) is being Fig. 1 Structures of bufadienolides from B. pinnatum, B. daigremontianum, B. delagoense ,a n d B. 2016; 82: 930 -941Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

With two-thirds of the patients being treated at the University Hospital ofZurich, this work showed that B. pinnatum is a herbal product whose use is no longer confined to the AM, but has been inte-grated in conventional settings [65]. Pharmacological and Clinical Activities Related to Anthroposophic Medicine ! B. pinnatum has been used in AM to treat various disorders caused by hyperactive conditions. In vitro andin vivo studies that have been performed are summarized below. More detailed in-formation about the respective studies is provided as SupportingInformation ( Table 2 S , Supporting Information). Tocolysis B. pinnatum preparations have been used as a tocolytic agent since years, and several studies have been performed. The Ger-man gynecologist Dr. Hassauer showed that i.v. infusion and 50% trituration orally was well tolerated, and successful in 84% of the women. The treatment al-lowed him also to decrease the dosage of the beta-agonist feno-terol, or even replace it [61]. In a retrospective study with 170pregnant women, the tocolytic effect of B. pinnatum was investi- gated. Group A was treated with B. pinnatum 5% infusion fol- lowed by the oral treatment with 50% trituration. The treatmentin group B also started with B. pinnatum 5% infusion and due to an inadequate effect after 2 h, women additionally received feno-terol i.v. or p.o. followed by oral treatment with B. pinnatum 50% trituration. B. pinnatum showed a positive outcome comparable Fig. 2 Structures of flavonoids from B. pinnatum and B. delagoense .Table 2 Med 2016; 82: 930 -941Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. to fenoterol, and no undesired effects were recorded [66]. From 1977 to 2000, a total of 1622 deliveries were documented andevaluated by Dr. Istvan Vil\u00e0ghy, a gynecologist who practiced inSwitzerland. In this study, data from 253 pregnant women whoneeded a tocolytic therapy, and 29 premature deliveries were an-alyzed. In the period from 1977 to 1983, fenoterol was used toprevent premature labor resulting in an incidence of prematuredeliveries of 6.2%. In the following years, Dr. Vil\u00e0ghi integratedB. pinnatum in the treatment of premature labor. From 1990 to 2000, he treated pregnant women almost exclusively with B. pin- natum 33% dilution. When B. pinnatum was used for the treat- ment of premature labor, the incidence of premature deliveriesdecreased to 1.1% [67].In a retrospective matched-pairs study, the toco-lytic activity of i.v. administered pinnatum 5% was compared with beta-agonists (fenoterol or hexoprenaline) in a total of67 pregnant women. This study demonstrated similar maternaland neonatal outcomes in both treatment groups. However,maternal adverse effects (palpitation, dyspnea) were significantlyreduced, and the use of corticosteroids and antibiotics was lowerin the group treated with B. pinnatum . Neonatal outcomes and morbidity rates were similar or superior in the B. pinnatum treat- ment group [68]. In addition, a prospective, randomized clinicaltrial assessed the efficacy and safety of B. pinnatum 50% chewable tablets versus a currently used calcium antagonist, nifedipine, forthe treatment of premature contractions. A total of 27 pregnantwomen were included before the study was interrupted due toslow recruitment. Nevertheless, data showed that treatmentwith B. pinnatum as well as treatment with nifedipine led to sig- nificant decreases in the number of contractions/h. The neonataloutcome did not differ between the two groups [69].The tocolytic activity of B. pinnatum was confirmed in an in vitro study in comparison to fenoterol. B. pinnatum aqueous leaf ex-tract (10 4mg/L) dose-dependent of spontane- ous human myometrium contractions, although the contractionfrequency increased. The extract also showed a relaxant effecton oxytocin-induced contractions. Fenoterol decreased myome-trial contractions and frequency [70]. Subsequently, the in vitro effects on spontaneous contractions in myometrial strips was in-vestigated with B. pinnatum leaf press juice, and with three frac- tions of B. pinnatum extract, labelled as flavonoid, bufadienolide, and cinnamic acid fractions. After five spontaneous muscle con-tractions, 2 \u00b5L of the leaf press juice (undiluted) and fractions(1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, undiluted) were added to the organ bath cham-ber. The effects on the AUC, amplitude, and frequency of the con-tractions were measured. The leaf press juice significantly re-duced the AUC to 82% and rapidly increased the frequency to128% after the first application. Reduction of the amplitude to78% was statistically significant after the second application.The fraction enriched in flavonoids (undiluted) significantly re-duced the AUC to 51% and caused a rapid and large increase infrequency to 557% after the first application. The amplitude wasreduced to 70% after the second application. The two other frac-tions did not significantly affect the AUC and the amplitude, butincreased the contraction frequency more than the control [71].The mechanism behind the tocolytic effect of B. pinnatum was further investigated using human myometrial cells. In hTERT C3 cells, leaf press juice led to a thermore, in hTERT C3 cells kept under significantly inhibited the oxytocin-induced increaseof intracellular [Ca 2+]. Hence, the observed inhibitory effect was assumed to be independent of the extracellular calcium concen-tration. In addition, the effect of leaf press juice was investigatedin SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, which are Ca 2+channels. The [Ca2+]ire- sponse to KCl was not reduced by the press juice, but delayed,suggesting that the voltage-dependent calcium influx throughthe channels was restricted [72]. Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome OAB is a symptomatic diagnosis that has been defined by the In-ternational Continence Society (ICS) as urinary urgency, with orwithout urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia,after the exclusion of urinary tract infection (UTI) or other ob-vious pathologies [73]. Current pharmacotherapy of OAB in-cludes drugs with modes of action. Muscarinic receptorantagonists are the first-line pharmacotherapy for OAB and uri-nary incontinence. A beta3-agonist with proven clinical benefitswas recently registered in several countries, but only limited dataon long-term efficacy and safety are currently available. Besides,other drugs including calcium antagonists, serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and estrogens as well as intraves-ical injection of botulinum toxin are used to mitigate symptomsof OAB.In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlledstudy, 20 incontinence (MUI) were treatedwith B. pinnatum 50% chewable tablets or placebo. The women took 3 \u00d7 2 blinded capsules daily during 8 weeks. In a total of15 weeks, they had 5 visits and were ask to fill out 2-day bladderdiaries and answer 2 questionnaires, the King s Health Question- naire (KHQ) and the International Consultation on IncontinenceModular Questionnaire for OAB (ICIQ OAB). After treatment, a Fig. 3 Structures of miscellaneous compounds from B. pinnatum, B. dai- gremontianum ,a n d B. delagoense Bryophyllum pinnatum and...Planta Med 2016; 82: 930 -941Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. positive trend for B. pinnatum was observed relatively to the placebo. The primary endpoint, the micturition frequency/24 h,was reduced from 9.5 before to 7.8 after the treatment(p = 0.064). The quality of life (QoL) was comparable in the B. pin- natum and placebo group [74]. The effect of B. pinnatum leaf press juice on porcine detrusor muscle contractility was investigated in an organ bath chamber,in comparison with oxybutynin as a reference drug. Press juice(5% in the chamber) significantly inhibited detrusor contractilityinduced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) by 74.6% comparedto the control. In addition, the press juice (10%) had a significantrelaxant effect (18.7%) on carbachol-induced contractions. Theleaf press juice showed good activity, although oxybutynin had amore potent inhibitory and relaxing effect on the detrusormuscle [75].The effect of leaf press juice and different fractions of B. pinnatum on electrically induced porcine detrusor contractility was inves-tigated in further experiments. The inhibitory properties of leafpress juice were confirmed, even though an initial stimulatory ef-fect was observed. A flavonoid-enriched fraction reduced musclecontractility in a concentration- and time-dependent manner,resulting in a maximum inhibition of 78.7% at a test concentra-tion of 1 mg/mL after 77 min. The lipophilic fraction containingthe bufadienolides had no inhibitory effect on contractility atthe investigated concentrations. However, due to a poor solubil-ity of the lipophilic fraction test concentrations were significantlylower. An unexpected inhibitory effect was found in the polarfraction that contained substances that were not retained on aHP-20 column. Finally, this effect could be explained by a de-creased pH in the organ bath chamber due to the presence of alarge amount (17.8%) of L-malic acid in this fraction [76]. Sleep and neurological disorders In a prospective, multicenter, observational study, 49 pregnantwomen suffering from sleep disorders were treated with B. pin- natum 50% chewable tablets. The women took 3 -8 tablets per day and were asked to complete questionnaires before and afterthe 14-day treatment. The number of wake-ups and the subjec-tive quality of sleep were significantly improved, and women feltless sleepy during the day. However, a prolongation of sleep du-ration and reduction in the time to fall asleep was not achieved[77]. In a further study, the effect of B. pinnatum on sleep quality was assessed in 20 cancer patients. Treatment (3 weeks) withchewable tablets (mostly 2 \u00d7 2 tablets per day) resulted in a de-crease of the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) from 12.2 to9.1, and sleepiness was slightly reduced [78].The behavioral neuropharmacology of B. pinnatum aqueous leaf extract was investigated in mice, and neurosedative, CNS depres-sant, and anxiolytic activities were found. Furthermore, a dose-dependent muscle relaxant effect of the aqueous extract was ob-served, which was comparable to diazepam. Therefore, aGABAergic activity has been suggested for B. pinnatum [79]. Some of these neuropharmacological effects were tested in Swissmice applying a methanolic fraction. The GABA content in thebrain was estimated after i.p. administration, and the methanolicfraction led to an increase in brain GABA concentration [80].The compounds responsible for the neurological activity are notdefinitively known, but a neurosedative effect of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate ( 3) was demonstrated in mice, whereby strongly sedative activity was observed with doses of 0.1 - 0.5 mg/kg b.w. However, higher doses resulted in paralysis andmuscle contractions [23].Other Biological and Pharmacological Activities ! Additional activities have been investigated both in vitro and in vivo . Some of the described activities correspond to uses in tra- ditional medicine, but only a few studies in humans have been re-ported. A detailed description of the settings and outcomes canbe found in Table 3 S , Supporting Information. Antimicrobial activity In vitro experiments using the agar-well diffusion method dem- onstrated the sensitivity of several bacteria and fungi to hotwater and methanolic extracts as well as to flavonoids of B. pin- [81,82]. Several compounds, further -22) [28], showed antimicrobial activity. Antileishmanial activity Leishmaniasis comprises diseases that are caused by protozoan parasites belonging to over 20 Leishmania species. The protozoa are transmitted by the bite of female phlebotomine sandflies.Treatment of a cutaneous leishmaniasis patient with an aqueousleaf extract of B. pinnatum stopped growth and led to a slight de- crease of the active lesion. At the end of the 14-day treatment pe-riod, the toxicological parameters of the patient s serum were within the reference range [83]. In mice, the effect of an aqueousB. pinnatum extract was investigated after oral (by intragastric intubation), i.v., i.p., and topical (by rubbing the lesion site) ad-ministration. The oral treatment was most effective and was ableto prevent or delay the onset of lesions in a sustained manner.Additionally, after oral, i.p., or topical application, titers of a para-site-specific antibody (IgG) were reduced to 20% when comparedwith untreated mice [84]. Interestingly, the activity was abol-ished in vitro and in vivo by cotreatment with N-monomethyl- an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase and, hence, ofNO production. The authors concluded that the protective activ-ity was possibly not due to a direct effect on the parasite, butrather to the increase of NO production of macrophages [85].Subsequent investigations revealed that flavonoids were in-volved in the antileishmanial activity of ( 30) and a quercetin diglycoside ( 29) had the highest in vitro antileishmanial activity and low cytotoxicity. It has been suggested that the aglycone quercetin is relevant for the anti-leishmanial activity, since the corresponding kaempferol glyco-sides ( 15and22) were quercetin and quercetin glycosides were able to stopthe growth of lesions in mice. An explanation for the comparablein vivo activity of aglycone and glycosides could be that the same active metabolites are produced upon oral administration [86]. Insecticidal activity Several bufadienolides isolated from B. pinnatum and B. daigre- montianum xtubiflorum were tested in an in vitro assay using 3rd instar larvae of the silkworm. Larvae were cultured on an ar-tificial diet and further put into petri dishes containing the testsamples (added to 1 g of the diet). The mortality rate was deter-mined after 24 h. Daigremontianin ( 9), bryophyllin h o w e d LD 50values of 0.9, 3, 5, and 16 \u00b5g/g of diet, respectively, whereas bersaldegenin-1-acetate ( 1) and bersaldegenin-3-acetate ( 2) showed no insecticidal activity. These results suggest that the1,3,5-orthoacetate moiety is essential for the insecticidal 82: 930 -941Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Cytotoxic and antitumor promoting activity Anin vitro study demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhi- bition of human cervical cancer cell growth when B. pinnatum chloroform extract, and a fraction containing steroidal glyco-sides, alkaloids, and steroids were tested. The fraction was morepotent than the extract and showed proapoptotic activity. In con-trast, higher activity was observed for the extract against humanpapillomavirus (HPV), which plays a pivotal role in the develop-ment of cervical cancer [87]. The butanol-soluble fraction of anethanolic extract of fresh B. delagoense plants showed antiprolif- erative activity [88] in several cell lines via a modulation of themitotic cell division. More recently, the water-soluble fraction ofthe same extract was shown to cause cell cycle arrest, and to in-duce senescence in lung cancer A549 cells. At doses of 10 mg and100 mg/kg b.w. 5 times per week for 6 weeks, the fraction alsoreduced tumor growth in nude mice [89].In several studies, a cytotoxic effect of bufadienolides from Bryo- phyllum species was found. Bryophyllin A ( 4) showed potent cy- totoxicity in human lung carcinoma A-549 cells, KB cells, and co-lon HCT-8 tumor cells with ED 50values of 10, 14, and 30 ng/mL, respectively. Bersaldegenin-3-acetate ( 2) mainly demonstrated an effect against HCT-8 cells (ED 50= 10 ng/mL) and bryophyllin B showed cytotoxicity against KB cells with an ED 50value of < 80 ng/mL [21,22]. A series of five bufadienolides and two carde-nolides isolated from B. delagoense showed significant cytotoxic activity against A549, Cal-27, A2058, and lines.Kalantuboside B ( 12) and bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate ( 3) were the most potent compounds against A2058 and HL-60 cellswith IC 50s of 0.01 \u00b5M [14]. Besides cytotoxic properties, bufadienolides also showed anti-tumor promoting activity. Five compounds isolated from B. pin- natum and B. daigremontianum xtubiflorum inhibited Epstein- Barr antigen (EBV EA) activation. The 1,3,5-orthoace- tate moiety appeared to be important for the chemopreventiveactivity [18]. Antioxidant activity Extracts and flavonoids of B. pinnatum scav- enging activity activity and antiallergic effects B. pinnatum leaf press juice produced an in vitro antihistaminic effect in the guinea pig ileum and prevented histamine-inducedbronchoconstriction in guinea pigs in vivo . Flavonoids were thought to be responsible for the selective and competitive inhi-bition of the H 1receptor [91]. In addition, aqueous leaf extracts possessed an antiasthmatic by successfully protectingguinea pigs from histamine-induced preconvulsive dyspnea. Thereduction of coughing bouts in guinea pigs treated with this ex-tract confirmed its antitussive properties [52].Mice receiving daily oral treatment with B. pinnatum aqueous leaf extracts during a 14-day sensitization (ovalbumin, were protected from fatal anaphylactic shock. Quercitrin ( 30) had a protective effect in 75% of the animals and appeared to beimportant for the antianaphylactic effect of the extract. Further-more, the aqueous leaf extract reduced eosinophilia as well asIL-5, and TNF- cytokine production [92]. addition, the extract of B. pinnatum and quercetin, but not quercitrin, inhibited the development of allergic airway inflammation andairway hyperresponsiveness in mice. It is assumed that the inhi- bition of mast cell degranulation and reduction of TNF- levels were involved in the antiallergic effect [93]. Anti-inflammatory activity In Wistar rats, oral administration of 400 mg/kg b.w. of an aque-ous leaf extract of B. pinnatum significantly reduced paw edema [94]. This result was confirmed in another independent studythat showed a significant reduction of acute inflammation bythe aqueous extract (400 mg/kg b.w.; respectively. The authors concludedthat this steroidal compound was mainly responsible for theanti-inflammatory activity [40]. However, no data were shownto demonstrate that this steroid (isolated from a 95% ethanolicextract) was also present in the water extract. In a recent study,the inhibitory effect of a B. pinnatum ethanolic extract was inves- tigated in Swiss albino mice on ear edema induced by various ir-ritant agents such as croton oil, capsaicin, and phenol. Dependingon the irritant agent, mg/earshowed significant inhibition [30]. Also, carra-geenan-induced pleurisy in mice. The extract and 29both reduced the TNF- concentration in the pleural exudate. Com- pound 29also zymatic assay [95]. Antiulcer activity The pretreatment with leaf press juice did not prevent the devel-opment of histamine-induced ulcerations in guinea pigs [91].However, a methanolic fraction of B. pinnatum possessed anti- ulcer activity in rats. The development of different types of acutegastric ulcers was significantly inhibited after i.p. pretreatmentat doses of 100 or 300 mg/kg b.w. Additionally, the healing of ace-tic acid-induced gastric ulcers was improved [54]. In anotherstudy with doses (10 -40 mg/kg b.w.), Antinociceptive/analgesic activity Antinociceptive activity of B. pinnatum was investigated in mice. Mice were treated with an aqueous extract prior to exposure to aheat-induced nociceptive pain stimulus (hot plate). In anotherassay, the abdominal contractions triggered by i.p. injection of3% acetic acid were observed. In both experimental setups, theaqueous extract provided significant protection against the noci-ceptive stimulus compared to diclofenac [94]. In addition, the an-algesic potential of the aqueous extract, a methanolic fraction,and a steroidal compound of B. pinnatum was examined. Using the chemical method described above, the aqueous extract andstigmast-4,20(21),23-trien-3-one ( 47) significantly reduced the number of contractions by 80.16% and 75.72%, respectively. Themethanolic fraction also showed a significant reduction of con-tractions [40,80]. At doses of 100 -300 mg/kg b.w., the aqueous leaf extract increased the pain threshold in rats in the hot plateassay, and reduced phenylbenzoquinone-induced writhing inmice [97]. Antinociceptive properties together with anti-inflam-matory activity have been recently reported for an aqueous ex-tract of the flowers. The extract and the quercetin glycoside 29 significantly reduced the number of acetic acid-induced mice Med 2016; 82: 930 -941Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

The protective effect of a concentrated press juiceand of an ethanolic extract of the marc (left after expressing thejuice) against CCl 4-induced hepatotoxicity was examined in vitro andin vivo . The leaf press juice was more potent than the extract in rat hepatocytes as well as in the rat model. At a dose of 200 mg/kg b.w., significant decreases of elevated serum bilirubin (SBLN)levels extract (81% recovery) were observed [53]. Antiurolithic activity According to [98], B. pinnatum is used by local people in Pakistan to expel kidney stones. The authors therefore assessed the anti-urolithic activity of an ethanolic extract of B. pinnatum . Fresh urine from a man was mixed with different concentrations ofthe extract before sodium oxalate solution was added to inducecrystallization. A concentration-dependent increase of the num-ber of crystals was observed. However, the size and the numberof calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals, which are injuri-ous to epithelial cells, were significantly reduced, and their for-mation was totally inhibited at the highest concentration(100 mg/mL). Moreover, the formation of calcium oxalate di-hydrate (COD) crystals was promoted rather than COM, which isbeneficial since COD crystals are less urolithic than COM [98]. Theantiurolithic effect of an aqueous leaf extract of B. pinnatum has also been studied in rats. Kidney stones were induced by ethyleneglycol. The extract administered intraperitoneally at doses of 50and 100 mg/kg b.w. significantly reduced the urine oxalate level,improved creatinine and blood urea levels, and reduced calciumoxalate deposition in the kidneys [99]. Antidiabetic activity Significant hypoglycemic effects were reported for oral treatmentwith an aqueous leaf extract of B. An aqueous leaf extract of B. pinnatum was reported to reduce salt-induced hypertension in rats. Doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg b.w./day p.o. significantly prevented the increase of systolicand diastolic arterial pressures. On the other hand, no significantchange was observed in the heart rate [100]. Wound healing activity Topical application of an ethanolic leaf extract of B. pinnatum (100 mg/kg b.w.) accelerated wound healing in Sprague Dawleyrats. On day 11 after excision, the wound areas were reduced by86.3%, and only by 68.0% in the control group. A significant in-crease in wound contractions and a decrease in edema at thewound site were also observed [101]. Tolerability Studies ! A retrospective and two randomized prospective clinical studiesconfirmed good tolerability of B. pinnatum (For details, see Table 4 S , Supporting Information). In tocolysis, administration ofB. pinnatum 5% i.v. and 50% p.o. resulted in less side effects than under treatment with betamimetics. Specifically, the occur-rence of palpitations and dyspnea were significantly lower due to a lacking effect on 1-adrenoceptors [68]. In addition, the treat- ment of 14 pregnant women ( Bryophyllum group) with B. pinna- tum 50% chewable tablets showed no side effects that were at- tributable to the medication [69]. Another study revealed no sig-nificant difference in observed side effects. One woman treatedwith B. pinnatum 50% chewable tablets suffered from diarrhea and dysentery, possibly due to lactose intolerance, and a secondwoman developed exanthema of the face and upper thorax [74].In a longitudinal, prospective, randomized, controlled animalstudy, the effect of the mother tincture (MT), 30% of B. pinnatum , in pregnant Wistar rats was investigated. From day 0 of gestation,60 rats were treated with the B. pinnatum MT or pure vehicle. Two control groups, C1 and C2, received an equivalent to the usu-al daily dose and 25\u00d7 the maximum daily dose of vehicle, respec-tively. Groups B1, B2, B3, and B4 received every day 1, 25, 50, and100\u00d7 the maximum daily dose of MT, respectively. After 20 daysof treatment, weight gain (excluding fetal and placental weight)was higher in group B4 than in groups B1, C2, and B2. However,the perinea in group C1 were heavier than those in group B2.No maternal or fetal deaths, no differences in implantations andresorptions, and no differences in the number and weight of thefetuses and placentas were observed. External fetal abnormal-ities were not observed in groups B1 -B4 [102]. Toxicity Studies ! B. pinnatum is well tolerated in patients. However, toxicity of Bryophyllum species has been reported to be related to bufadie- nolides. The cardiotoxic activity of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoace-tate ( 3) was investigated in vitro using isolated rabbit and guinea pig hearts. A strong positive inotropic effect was shown [20,103].Toxicity to cattle has been documented in earlier studies. A studywas conducted including two calves that were treated with theflower heads of B. pinnatum . Clinical parameters were examined after administration of 20 g/kg b.w. by stomach tube. Five hoursafter dosing, the animals became depressed and suffered fromrumen stasis and anorexia. The first calf died after 9 h due todyspnea and tachycardia. The second calf had diarrhea until itdied after 15.5 h. This study demonstrated a correlation betweenbufadienolides and the toxic effect in cattle [15].An acute toxicity study was performed with a total of 25 rats (ormice, see below), which were given either a B. pinnatum metha- nolic extract or distilled water as a single dose. Mortality was ob-served after 24 h. A dose of 25 mg/kg caused neither death norside effects, but the treatment with 200 mg/kg was lethal for100% of the animals [96]. Unfortunately, information providedin the publication on the route of administration route (oral orintraperitoneal) and the animal species (rats or mice) is contra-dictory. A similar study was performed including Swiss albinomice. Intraperitoneal administration in mice of aqueous andmethanolic extracts showed LD 50values of 957 and 1159 mg/kg, respectively. Oral doses up to 3 g/kg b.w. in mice and rats led tono signs of toxicity [104]. In mice, an intraperitoneally adminis-tered methanolic fraction led to no deaths up to 2500 mg/kgb.w. in mice, but their behavior changed with concentrations> 100 mg/kg b.w.

The introduction of B. pinnatum as an AM was based on concepts of anthroposophy, and not on scientific investigations. Mean-while, several clinical studies support the use of the plant as a to-colytic. Recent pharmacological investigations confirmed effectson myometrial contraction, and also provided first insights intothe mode of action, which appears to involve the oxytocin path-way. In addition, another \"hyperactivity disease \", the OAB syn- drome, may represent a new therapeutic indication for B. pinna- tum preparations. As to sleep disorders, observational studies showed a positive effect on restlessness in pregnant women andcancer patients. However, larger controlled studies are needed toconfirm these preliminary data. Even if the tocolytic activity andinhibition of detrusor contractibility could be linked to a flavo-noid-containing fraction, the phytochemicals responsible for thepharmacological properties and clinical effects of B. pinnatum are not yet entirely clear. In particular, the exact contribution of bu-fadienolides and flavonoids, the two characteristic groups of sec-ondary metabolites, in the different effects remains to be estab-lished. In all clinical studies, B. pinnatum was well tolerated, and no serious side effects were observed. From a drug safety per-spective, however, the quantity of bufadienolides in Bryophyllum preparations should be controlled, since some of these com-pounds have shown toxicity in animals. Taken together, currentdata confirm the potential of B. pinnatum for the treatment of \"hyperactivity \"disorders. Further studies are needed to fully understand the modes of action and to identify the active constit-uents. This will further consolidate the rational clinical use ofB. pinnatum .
