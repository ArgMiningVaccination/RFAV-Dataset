Here's a peek behind some of the select ingredients in this blend. Ginger Known for its warming and comforting effects, ginger has a long history of use in food and medicine dating back thousands of years in Chinese and Indian cultures. With anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, ginger has been linked to a wide range of possible health benefits and is commonly used to reduce nausea and support digestive health. Peppermint With its incomparable fresh flavor and powerful aroma, peppermint has a unique ability to uplift, invigorate, and awaken the senses. We source our peppermint leaves from the Pacific Northwest, where the cultivars are considered the most potent and abundant in the world. The combination of the climate, soil, and farming practices yields mint with a distinctly high level of menthol, the plant's chief active compound credited for potential anti-inflammatory effects. Noted for its soothing properties, peppermint is an integral plant in herbal medicine and is commonly used to ease stomach discomfort and calm the digestive system.

Turmeric Having exploded on the health scene in recent years, turmeric has been around for centuries at the heart of ancient, traditional medicine. Vibrantly golden, warming, and delicious, turmeric is used in almost every single meal in Ayurvedic cooking and widely known for its holistic anti-inflammatory properties. With a wide range of associated health benefits, turmeric has been honored for generations and is also commonly used to support digestion. Licorice Root With a delightful sweetness unexpected in an herbal remedy, licorice root tea has been used throughout history to soothe the stomach, relieve irritation, and promote digestive and respiratory health. Its use has been documented by the great civilizations of the ancient past; prized for its healing properties and used as a cure-all by the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. With a lengthy list of versatile uses, it's not surprising this ancient herb has endured through centuries and remains one of the most widely used plants in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. Fennel Native to the Mediterranean, fennel has a long history as a medicinal plant dating back to the Roman era when warriors are said to have consumed it for strength. Now popular all over the world, this versatile, warming, and aromatic herb is commonly used in holistic herbalism to relieve stomach discomfort, decrease inflammation, and improve digestion. "}
