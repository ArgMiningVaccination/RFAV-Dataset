The RMP summary contains information on the medicine's safety profile and explains the measures that are taken in order to further investigate and follow the risks as well as to prevent or minimise them. The RMP summary of Nuvaxovid is a concise document and does not claim to be exhaustive. As the RMP is an international document, the summary might differ from the \"Arzn eimittelinformation / Information sur le m\u00e9dicament\" approved and published in Switzerland, e.g. by mentioning risks occurring in populations or indications not included in the Swiss authorization. Please note that the reference document which is valid and relevant for the effective and safe use of Nuvaxovid in Switzerland is the \"Arzneimittelinformation / Information sur le m\u00e9dicament\" (see www.swissmedic.ch) approved and authorized by Swissmedic. Future Health GmbH is fully responsible for the accuracy and correctness of the content of the published summary RMP of Nuvaxovid . SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR NUV AXOVID (COVID- 19 V ACCINE (RECOMBINANT, ADJUV ANT ED)) This is a summary of the RMP for Nuvaxovid. The R MP details important risks of Nuvaxovid, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Nuvaxovid's risks and uncertainties (missing information). Nuvaxovid's SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to HCP s and patients on how Nuvaxovid should be used. This summary of the RMP for Nuvaxovid should be read in the context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the Nuvaxovid RMP. I. The medicine and what it is used for Nuvaxovid is authorised for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 12 years of age and older (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains SARS -CoV-2 spike protein and is adjuvant ed with Matrix -M as the active substance and it is given by intramuscular (IM) injection . Further information about the evaluation of Nuvaxovid's benefits can be found in Nuvaxovid's EPAR, including in its plain -language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine's webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nuvaxovid. II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the risks Important risks of Nuvaxovid, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learni ng more about Nuvaxovid risks, are outlined below. Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCP s; Important advice on the medicine's packaging; The authorised pack size \u2014 the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly; The medicine' s legal status \u2014 the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regular ly analys ed, including PSUR assessment and monthly Summary Safety Reports so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine PV activities. If important information that may affect the safe use of Nuvaxovid is not yet available, it is listed under 'missing information' below. II.A List of important risks and missing information Important risks of Nuvaxovid are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient pr oof of a link with the use of Nuvaxovid. P otential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missi ng information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine) . List of important risks and missing information Important identified risks Myocarditis and/or pericarditis Important potential risks Vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine- associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Use in immunocompromised patients Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Interaction with other vaccines Long- term safety II.B Summary of important risks Important identified risk : Myocarditis and/or pericarditis Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine Lit erature on COVID -19 vaccines, post -market safety data, and clinical trial data. Risk factors and risk groups Adole scent and young adult males following the second dose of vaccine may be at higher risk. Immunocompromised patients may be at a higher risk. Risk minimisation measures Routine risk minimisation measures: SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8. PL section 2. Additional risk minimisation measures: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities Routi ne pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: Specific adverse reaction follow -up questionnaire Additional pharmacovigila nce activities: Ongoing clinical trials Study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 2); final CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -501; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -302; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -505; final CSR estimated date 31 May 2023 Study 2019nCoV -311; final CSR estimated date 31 July 2023 Study 2019nCoV -301; final CSR estimated date 31 Dec 2023 Post-a uthorisation studies Study 2019nCoV -402 (Safety study using the UK CPRD database); final study report estimated date 30 June 2025 Study 2019nCoV -404 (Safety study using a US-based claims and/or electronic health records (EHR) database); final study report estimated date 30 September 2025 Important potential risk: Vacci ne-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine Liter ature on viral vaccines, safety information of other COVID- 19 vaccines, clinical trials. Vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED) has been rarely encountered with existing vaccines or viral infections. It was observed in children given formalin-inactivated whole -virus vaccines against RSV and measles virus. No events of VAED/VAERD have been reported in the current N uvaxovid clinical development programme. There is a theoretical concern that vaccination against SARS -CoV -2 may be associated with enhanced severity of COVID -19 episodes which would manifest as VAED/V AERD. Risk factors and risk groups Ther e are no known risk factors or specific risk populations identified for VAED/VAERD. The demonstration of some disease enhancement with any candidate vaccine after viral challenge in animal models should not necessar ily represent a no -go signal for deciding whether to progress into early trials in clinical development of a COVID -19 vaccine ( Lambert 2020 ). Populatio n-based surveillance might give more insight in this, should any VAED occur. Risk minimisation measures Routine risk minimisation measures: None Additional risk minimisation measures: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities Routi ne pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: Specific adverse reaction follow -up questionnaire Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Ongoing clinical trials Study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 2); final CSR estimated date 3 1 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -501; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -302; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -505; final CSR estimated date 31 May 2023 Study 2019nCoV -311; final CSR estimated date 31 July 2023 Study 2019nCoV -301; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2023 Post-authorisation studies Study 2019nCoV -402 ( Safety study using the UK CPRD database ); final study report estimated date 30 June 2025 Study 2019nCoV -404 ( Safety study using a US -based claims and/or electronic health records (EHR) database ); final study report estimated date 30 September 2025 Important missing information: Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine There is limited experience with use of Nuvaxovid in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post -natal development. Administration of Nuvaxovid in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. Breastfeeding It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid is excreted in human milk. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Risk factors and risk groups Pregnant and breastfeeding women Risk minimisation measures Routine risk communication: SmPC Sections 4.6 and 5.3 PL Section 2 Additional risk minimisation : None Additional pharmacovigilance activities Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Study 2019nCoV -405 ( Pregnancy and infant outcomes safety study using the \"COVID- 19 Vaccines International Pregnancy Exposure Registry\" (C -VIPER)) ; final study report estimated date 30 June 2027 Important missing information : Use in immunocompromised patients Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine The vaccine has not been studied in individuals with immunocompromised conditions, except for subjects with HIV. Subjects with HIV were not excluded from the clinical programme, and 244 were enrolled in the 2019nCoV -501 study. The safety profile of N uvaxovid in HIV- positive participants in this study was similar to that seen in HIV - negative participants. There is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving Nuvaxovid will be different to that of the general population, but given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. Risk factors and risk groups Individuals with compromised immune function due to acquired or genetic conditions or conditions requiring the use of immunosuppressants Risk minimisation measures Routine risk minimisation measures: SmPC Section 4.4 PL section 2 Additional risk minimisation measures: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Ongoing clinical trials Study 2019nCoV -501; final CSR date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -302; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -505; final CSR estimated date 31 May 2023 Study 2019nCoV -301; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2023 Post-authorisation studies Study 2019nCoV -402 ( Safety study using the UK CPRD database ); final study report estimated date 30 June 2025 Study 2019nCoV -404 ( Safety study using a US -based claims and/or electronic health records (EHR) database) ; final study report estimated date 30 September 2025 Important missing information: Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine The vaccine has not been studied in frail individuals with comorbidities that may compromise immune function due to the condition or treatment of the condition. Frail patients w ith comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) are potentially at risk of developing a more severe manifestation of COVID -19. There is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving N uvaxovid will be different to that of the general population, but given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded Risk factors and risk groups Frail individuals with comorbidities (e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity defined as BMI 30 kg/m2, DM2, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease or HIV ). Risk minimisation measures Routine risk minimisation measures: None Additional risk minimisation measures: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Post-authorisation studies Study 2019nCoV -402 ( Safety study using the UK CPRD database ); final study report estimated date 30 June 2025 Study 2019nCoV -404 ( Safety study using a US -based claims and/or electronic health records (EHR) database) ; final study report estimated date 30 September 2025 Important missing information: Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. There is no evidence from Nuvaxovid clinical studies to date that the safety profile of this population differs with that of the general population. However, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. Risk factors and risk groups Patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Risk minimisation measures Routine risk minimisation measures: PL section 2 Additional risk minimisation measures: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Post-authorisation studies Study 2019nCoV -402 ( Safety study using the UK CPRD database ); final study report estimated date 30 June 2025 Study 2019nCoV -404 ( Safety study using a US -based claims and/or electronic health records (EHR) database) ; final study report estimated date 30 Sep 2025 Important missing information: Interaction with other vaccines Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine There is limited information on the safety of the vaccin e when administered other vaccines within 28 days prior to the first dose or any dose of N uvaxovid, except for seasonal influenza vaccine, <14 days. Approximately 400 participants were concomitantly administered a seasonal influenza vaccine with N uvaxovid or placebo. The binding antibody response to SARS -CoV -2 was lower when Nuvaxovid was given concomitantly with inactivated influenz a vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Risk factors and risk groups Individuals who will receive other vaccines within 28 prior to 14 days after immunisation with N uvaxovid. Risk minimisation measures Routine risk minimisation measures: SmPC Section 4.5 and 5.1 PL section 2 Additional risk minimisation measures: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Ongoing clinical trials Study 2019nCoV -302; final CSR 31 December 2022 Post-authorisation studies Study 2019nCoV -402 ( Safety study using the UK CPRD database ); final study report estimated date 30 June 2025 Study 2019nCoV -404 ( Safety study using a US -based claims and/or electronic health records (EHR) database) ; final study report estimated date 30 September 2025 Important missing information: Long -term safety Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine Understanding of the long -term safety profile of N uvaxovid is currently limited. The median duration of safety follow -up in each of the 2 Phase 3 studies was at least 60 days. Follow- up was conducted for one year post - vaccination ( Studies 101 Part 1 and 2, 501, and 302) or 2 years post - vaccination ( Study 301). Risk factors and risk groups There are no known risks with a potentially delayed onset, with the exception of the theoretical concern of VAED/VAERD. Whilst there is currently no evidence to suspect an adverse long- term safety profile, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded Risk minimisation measures Routine risk minimisation measures: None Additional risk minimisation measures: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: None Additional pharmacovigilance activities: Ongoing clinical trials Study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 2); CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -501; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -302; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2022 Study 2019nCoV -311; final CSR estimated date 31 July 2023 Study 2019nCoV -301; final CSR estimated date 31 December 2023 Post-authorisation studies Study 2019nCoV -402 ( Safety study using the UK CPRD database ); final study report estimated date 30 June 2025 Study 2019nCoV -404 ( Safety study using a US -based claims and/or electronic health records (EHR) database) ; final study report estimated date 30 September 2025 II.C Post-authorisation development plan II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation There are no studies that are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of Nuvaxovid.
