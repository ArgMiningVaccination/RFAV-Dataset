Methods: Based on the components of CYPs, we obtained potential targets of the interaction between CYPs and COVID-19. The potential targets were analyzed by protein-protein interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. The key active components of CYPs were subjected to molecular docking with (PLP). The components that may bind to the key target proteins of COVID-19 were screened to obtain the potential active components, targets and pathways for CYPs treatment of COVID-19. Finally, the above network analysis results were verified through experiments. Results: CYPs may prevent and treat COVID-19 by inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and TNF-, participating in the AGE-Rage signaling pathway, the HIF-1 signaling pathway and other anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immune regulatory signaling pathways, and blocking ACE2 via fortunellin and baicalin. Conclusion: CYPs mainly play an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The potential active components and molecular mechanism of CYPs can provide theoretical support and a pharmacological basis for further development and utilization of CYPs as well as the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
