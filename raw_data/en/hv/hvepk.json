Introduction The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) was signed into law on March 11, 2021 and includes numerous provisions aimed at responding to the COVID -19 pandemic and providing relief to address its impacts. Among these provisions is the allocation of $122 billion to the ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) Fund to be used to \"help safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and address the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Nation's students.\"1 As a condition of receiving funding, each Local Education Agency (LEA) must, within 30 days of rec eiving the ARP ESSER allocation, develop and post a plan for the \"safe return of in -person instruction and continuity of services.\" The LEA is also required to seek public comment on the plan and take any comments into account in the development of the pla n.2 This document, along with the individual charter school re-opening plans which are included in Appendix A of this document and can be found on the State Public Charter School Authority website3, meet the requirements for the Plan for the Safe Return to In-Person Instruction under Section 2001(i) of the American Rescue Plan. Pursuant to federal and state guidance, the State Public Charter School Authority reviews and updates this plan, with input and feedback from the public, at least every six months. This plan is available in Spanish on the SPCSA's website and will be provided in another format or language upon request. 1 https://oese.ed.gov/offices/american -rescue- plan/american -rescue- plan -elementary -and-secondary- school - emergency -relief/ 2 See Section 2001(i) of the American Rescue Plan 3 https://charterschools.nv.gov/News/2020/SPCSA_School_Reopening_Plans/ Input on the Development of this Plan Throughout 2020 and early 2021, the SPCSA engaged with stakeholders on numerous occasions to understand the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic and inform our actions. When schools closed in March of 2020, the SPCSA initiated a communications strategy whereby each school leader was assigned an SPCSA Liaison who regularly spoke to the school leader to discuss recent developments, understand challenges the school was facing, address questions that the school leader had, and collect information to monitor school operations. Internally, SPCSA Liaisons met regularly, initially twice per week , to discuss common themes, challenges, and questions. Information collected through these SPCSA Liaisons informed the actions and prio rities of the SPCSA. In addition, the SPCSA's Executive Director regularly held \"All School Calls\" to share important updates and answer questions. Many of the topics addressed in the All School Calls were informed by the trends observed by the SPCSA Liais ons. In addition, twice during the 2021 -22 school year, the SPSCA's Executive Director held a series of Focus Groups with school leaders and board chairs to gather input and inform key decision points. While these activities were not specifically intended to gather input on the SPCSA's Plan for the S afe Return to In-Person Instruction , the information collected has inherently shaped the work over the last year and the contents of this plan. In developing the SPCSA's Plan for the S afe Return to In-Person Instruction , public comment was sought during the State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) board meeting on April 23, 2021 . In addition, the SPCSA launched two survey s seeking input from parents, families, educators , students, and community members. The first survey was open from April 16 through May 7, 2021. The second survey was available in both English and Spanish from June 2 through June 15, 2021. In addition to us ing this survey data to inform this plan, the SPCSA disseminated the data to each school to help inform their planning. The SPCSA also held a special meeting of our Community Working Group which is comprised of community and business leaders, representativ es from local municipalities, representatives from the charter school community, and education representatives from local school districts and the Nevada Department of Education. Details regarding the input received from these stakeholders can be found in Appendix B. This plan was discussed during the State Public Charter School Authority's board meetings in November and December of 2021, as well as in February of 2022. Background On March 15, 2020, Governor Sisolak announced that all schools would close to students . This closure remained in place until early June when the Governor signed Emergency Directive 0224, allowing school building to open for certain purposes during the summer and setting forth requirements for schools to develop re -opening plans for the 2020- 21 school year. On June 26, 2020, the State Public Charter School Authority approved a motion prescribing the process for SPCSA-sponsored schools5 to approve and submit their re-opening plans. During the summer of 2020 and in accordanc e with Emergency Directive 022 , the Nevada Department of Education's Guidance for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education6, SPCSA-sponsored charter schools developed and submitted reopening plans to the SPCSA. Importantly, in accordance with Section 1 of Emergency Directive 022 and the process established by the Authority on June 26, 2020, charter schools were required to present their re-opening plans to their governing body for approval at least 20 days before their first day of school for the 2020-2 021 school year. While many schools engaged their communities in the development of their re-opening plans through a variety of ways such as focus groups, committees, and surveys, at minimum, each plan was presented in a public meeting with an opportunity for public comment. Once approved by the school's board , the SPCSA reviewed re-opening plans for compliance with prevailing directives and guidance and transmitted to the Nevada Department of Education (NDE) . This included review of the plan itself, as well as the board agenda in which the plan was presented. In accordance with NDE's direction, all of the reopening plans contemplated three scenarios for the 2020 - 21 schools year: (1) full in -person instruction, (2) a hybrid instructional model, and (3) a full distance education model. However, most, if not all of the SPCSA charter school reopening plans contemplated as its primary or preferred model the hybrid instructional model. These hybrid models contemplated a variety of approaches such as students coming into the school building for in -person instruction on an AM / PM schedule, or a Monday / Tuesda y or Thursday / Friday cohort model. On August 14, 2020, the SPCSA adopted the COVID -19 In -Person Learning Guidance7 which contemplated a distance education model, with limited in person instruction for any SPCSA-sponsored charter school located in a coun ty that is subject to Mitigation Level I or II pursuant to the Governor's COVID -19 Mitigation and Management Task Force. The SPCSA In -Person Learning Guidance allow ed for 25 percent of a school's enrollment to learn in-person, even for those schools in counties subject to Mitigation Level I or II, and enable d the SPCSA Executive Director to grant additional exemptions. While many schools started the school year under a fully distance learning model, in September and October, 4 https://gov.nv.gov/News/Emergency_Orders/2020/2020- 06-09_-_COVID - had not previo usly conducted any in -person learning began taking advantage of the 25 percent of enrollment provision, with limited numbers of students coming into school buildings. In November, the Authority adopted Updated and Revised COVID -19 In -Person Learning Guida nce8 increasing the limit on in- person learning from 25 percent to 40 percent of the school's enrollment for those schools located in counties subject to Mitigation Level I or II pursuant to the Governor's COVID -19 Mitigation and Management Task Force. In February, the Authority lifted the in -person learning limit on schools located in counties subject to Mitigation Level I or II , though schools continue to be subject to all prevailing emergency directives . This action was based on three primary factors: 1. A significant decline in COVID -19 cases and the test positivity rate; 2. The availability of vaccines to educators within all counties in which SPCSA -sponsored schools are located; 3. Experience of school staff in implementing mitigation COVID -19 mitigation measu res; and 4. Updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including an Operational Strategy for K -12 School through Phased Mitigation. This guidance provides concrete recommendations for in -person learning at varying levels of community transmission . By the end of the 2020-21 school year, of the 67 charter school campuses sponsored by the SPCSA, the vast majority were already offering in-person instruction in some form. Two school campuses were fully in-person, 51 school campuses were providing some form of hybrid instruction, 11 school campuses were providing limited in -person instruction for some students, and 3 school campuses remain ed fully virtual. However, it is important to note that all three of these schools that remain ed fully virtual, are approved for full-time virtual instruction pursuant to NAC 388.830. Pursuant to section 16 of Emergency Directive 044 and Guidance Memorandum 21 -02 (see Appendix C) , charter schools were required to create re -opening p lans and plans for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education for the 2021 -22 school year. Similar to plans developed for the 2020 -21 school year, the SPCSA reviewed re-opening plans for compliance with prevailing directives and guidance and transmit them to the Nevada Department of Education (NDE) . In addition, these 2021 -22 school year re - opening are included in the SPCSA's Plan for the Safe Return to In- Person Learning in Appendix A. 8 https://charterschoo ls.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/CharterSchoolsnvgov/content/News/2020/COVID- 19%20In - Person%20Learning%20Guidance.2020.11.12.pdf The SPCSA's Approach The State Public Charter School Authority (SPC SA) is a statewide authorizer9 and as of the 2021-22 school year sponsor s 38 Nevada public charter schools, encompassing 7 0 separate campuses serving over 53,000 Nevada students. As a statewide charter school sponsor that authorizes charter schools, but does not directly run any schools, the SPCSA 's role as a local educational agency (LEA)10 is unique. To that end, the SPCSA's approach to ensuring a safe return to in-person instruction for the 2021-2022 school year is based on the following principles: Clear Guardrails and Oversight: The SPCSA has and will continue to establish minimum standards, where appropriate, and conduct oversight t hat ensure s that SPCSA -sponsored charter schools are complying with all prevailing state -issued emergency directives and any applicable guidance . Flexibility and Support: To honor the local decision making that is central to charter schools, the SPCSA will ensure flexibility for SPCSA-sponsored charter schools, while at the same time providing any needed suppo rt. Consistent Communication: The SPCSA has and will continue to serve as a conduit for information to and from schools. 9 See NRS 388A.150 10 See NRS 388A.159 Plan for the Safe Return to In- Person Instruction Ultimately, each charter school was required to have a re -opening plan for the 202 0-21 school year, pursuant to Emergency Directive 022, and is required to have a re -opening plan for the 2021-22 school year pursuant to Emergency Directive 044. All of these plans can be found on the SPCSA website11. In addition, the SPCSA's Plan for the Safe Return to In-Person Instruction covers the key topics addressed in the Nevada Department of Education's Framework for a Safe, Efficient, and Equitable Return to School Buildings12 as well as the U.S. Department of Education's ED COVID -19 Handbook, Volume 1: Strategies for Safely Reopening Elementary and Secondary Schools13 and ED COVID -19 Handbook, Volume 2: Roadmap to Reopening Safely and Meeting All Students' Needs14. Establishing a Safe Learning Environment Clear Guardrails and Oversigh t Opening for the 2021 -22 School Year: Pursuant to Guidance Memorandum 21 -02 and in line with the CDC's Operational Strategy for K -12 Schools through Phased Prevention15, charter schools opened for the 2021-22 school year with the capacity to offer in -person learning to all students, except for schools classified as a charter school for distance education pursuant to NRS 388A.705. COVID -19 Mitigation Plans: Pursuant to section four (4) of Emergency Directive 0 5216, each charter school must adopt a COVID -19 mitigation plan that includes 1) a policy on whether or under what circumstances face coverings are required , 2) a regular COVID -19 testing program, and 3) a method for detecting school -wide outbreaks of COVID -19 and a plan for responding to and mitigating any outbreaks. This plan must be approved by the local health authority . The SPCSA, in coordinat ion with t he Depart ment of Health and Human Services and local health authorit ies is working with schools to ensure the development and approval of these plans. Social Distancing and C OVID -19 Mitigation Measures: During the 2020-21 school year, the SPCSA established certain requirements regarding capacity limits and social distancing at sponsored schools . With the robust guidance now available from the CDC within the Operational Strategy for K -12 Schools through Phased Prevention17, the SPCSA is recommending that charter schools continue to follow CDC guidance with regard to COVID -19 health and safety mitigation measures including physical distancing, handwashing, resp iratory etiquette, and cleaning . It is expected that this guidance will continue to be refined and the SPCSA will ensure schools are kept apprised and informed regarding any changes. 11 https://charterschools.nv.gov/News/2020/SPCSA_School_Reopening_Plans/ 12 https://doe.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/ndedoenvgov/content/News__Media/Press_Releases/2020_Documents/Nevad Pursuant to sections three ( 3) and six (6) of Emergency Directive 0 52, face coverings are optional in school set tings and charter schools may enact a policy that requires the use of fac e coverings. Masks conti nue to be r equired on all public transportation, including school buses. Additional ly, schools must conti nue to follow quar antine and iso lation requirements set forth by the Department of Health and Human Se rvices, which in some ca ses require the short -term use of face coverings for individuals who have recently had or been exposed to COV ID-19. In the event of a school -wide outbr eak of CO VID-19, the local health authority may require man datory and immediate use of face co verings for all students and staff . In addition, the SPCSA has provided schools with information regarding consistent and correct mask use: o CDC Consistent and Correct Mask Use: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/community/schools -childcare/k -12-guidance.html#mask-use COVID -19 cases that occur within the communities of sponsored charter schools and will continue to ensure that charter schools conduct contact tracing in coordination with state and local health authorit ies. Accommodations for Students who are Unable to Attend In- Person: Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and Guidance Memorandum 21 -02, charter schools must provide distance education options to students who a) have a documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending sc hool in- person, or b) are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Flexibility and Support COVID -19 Testing: The SPCSA worked with Nevada's Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services to provide access to COVID -19 testing for interested schools during the late winter and spring of 2021. For the 2021-22 school year, sponsored charter schools may opt to participate in any of the following testing options, all of which are either free to the school or involve nominal costs to establish the testing program. o BinaxNow rapid testing through the SPCSA's licensed laboratory under the Department of Health and Human Services : Participating schools that have completed training and laboratory inspection may have licensed staff conduct rapid BinaxNow COVID -19 tests on their school campus. These antigen tests need to be followed by a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) test if the individual who was tested is experiencing symptoms of COVID - 19 and/ or received a positive test result. o PCR testing through a state contractor : Participating schools work with SPCSA staff and the contractor to determine a regular weekly testing schedule, including the number of tests that will be administered each week. The contractor provides trained staff who administer the PCR test s and provide results within 48 hours. o PCR testing through PerkinElmer : Participating schools that sign up through the SPCSA rece ive a access to a portal to order PCR tests which arrive by mail. These tests can be self-administered by adults and students and then are mailed to the lab which provides results within 48 hours. With the recent announcement that the federal government will be requiring certain employers to ensure that unvaccinated employees are regularly tested for COVID -19, the SPCSA has urged all schools to establish testing infrastructure, whether through the S PCSA's testing programs or other avenues. The SPCSA anticipates receiving guidance from the Nevada Department of Business & Industry regarding the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) testing requirements and will disperse this information to schools and continue to support schools in accessing testing resources. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): During the 2020 -21 school year, the SPCSA assisted in securing PPE for sponsored schools. The SPCSA will continue to work with the Nevada Depart ment of Education and Department of Emergency Management and all state and local health districts to seek out opportunities to secure personal protective equipment (PPE) for interested charter schools. Ensuring Proper Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette: The SPCSA has provided schools with guidance for how to ensure proper handwashing and respiratory etiquette. o CDC Guidance regarding hygiene and etiquette: https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/coughing_sneezing.html o CDC Flyers regarding Stop the Spread of Germs: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/downloads/stop -the-spread -of- germs.pdf Ensuring Proper Cleaning and Disinfection: The SPCSA has provided schools with guidance for cleaning and disinfecting publ ic spaces. Several resources have been shared with schools to ensure they are aware of recommended cleaning and disinfection practices. o Guidance for Cleaning and Disinfecting Public Spaces, Workplaces, Businesses, Schools, and Homes: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/community/pdf/Reopening_America_Guidance.pdf Communicating and Reinforcing Safety Measures: T he SPCSA has provided schools with state and county health guidelines for proper hygiene and social distancing. Several resources have been provided to schools to communicate and reinforce key safety measures including physical distancing, handwashing, and respiratory etiquette. o COVID -19 Downloadable Graphics https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/community -resources/social -media/ o Southern Nevada Health District: https://covid.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/toolkit/ o Customizable social distancing flyer s https://www.adobe.com/express/create/poster/social -distance Improving Ventilation: The SPCSA has provided schools with information regarding how to improve ventilation in school buildings. Specifically, Charter schools have been provided with the most recent guidance from the CDC regarding COVID -19 protection in schools, which includes specific information regarding improving ventilation18 as well as the CDC guidance regarding ventilation in schools and childcare programs19. Screening for Symptoms: SPCSA-sponsored charter schools have been provided with CDC20, state , and local health district21 guidelines on proper screening for COVID -19 symptoms. Schools are encouraged to remind staff, students, and families to stay home when they are sick and/or experiencing any COVID1 -9 symptoms . Additionally, schools have been provided with resources to help communicate the importance of symptom screening22 and staying home when sick23 to their school communities . Supporting Students with Disabilities: A number of other support s are in place for schools to meet the needs of students with disabilities. o First, when school first reopened in person, the SPCSA sought an exemption to the social distancing requirement on behalf of all sponsored schools for serving students with disabil ities who may require close physical contact in order to meet their needs. This included, for example, the provision of certain services such as occupational and physical therapy. Through this exemption, SPCSA -sponsored schools were able to meet the needs of their students with disabilities. o Additionally, the SPCSA has provided sponsored schools with guidance from the CDC regarding serving students with disabilities or other health care needs 24. Consistent Communication Coordination with State and Local Health Officials: Since the beginning of the COVID -19 Pandemic, t he SPCSA has work ed closely with Nevada 's Department of Health and Human Services as well as local health authorities to ensure charter schools have access to critical information in ord er to mitigate the spread of COVID -19. This includes distributing information from health authorities to schools , seeking out answers and information on behalf of charter schools, and ensuring charter schools have informatio n and contact information necess ary to execute contact tracing protocols , as well as helping to develop documents for charter schools with clear guidance, such as the Southern Nevada Health Districts COVID -19 Preparedness and Response Plan for schools25. Updates to Guidance: The SPCSA provides schools with the most recent information from the Centers for Disease Control, the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, local health districts and the Nevada's COVID-19 Task Forc e regarding strategies to prevent the spread of COVID 18 S chool Communities: In early 2021, t he SPCSA worked with local health officials to disseminate information regarding the vaccination process for education staff . With the recent emergency authorization o f certain COVID -19 vaccines for children ages five and older, the SPCSA has shared information with schools about how they can request vaccine clinics at their schools sites, if they are interested. Meeting the S ocial, E motional, and M ental Health N eeds o f Students and S taff Clear Guardrails and Oversight Responding to Tips: The SPCSA monitors school responses to SafeVoice26 tips and ensures these are followed up on. In partnership with Nevada 's Department of Public Safety, the SafeVoice program provides students a safe place to submit tips concerning their own safety or that of others. A fully trained professional team of experts responds in an appropriate manner. Additionally, during the fall o f 2021, the SPCSA coordinated with the Nevada Department of Education to have a refresher training provided to interested school staff. Flexibility and Support Surveying Students and Staff: The SPCSA supports charter schools in their efforts to implement school climate and s ocial emotional learning survey s so that schools can have accurate data about student and staff well-being. Once surveys are completed, the SPCSA supports schools with utilizing school climate and social emotional learning survey data to make data -based decisions in creating social emotional learning lesson plans and selecting social emotional learning programs. Multi-Tiered Sy stems of Support (MTSS): The SPCSA, through our Project Aware grant, is providing schools with the opportunity to participate in a year -long program with dedicated coaching support to implement a multi -tiered system of support within their school. Equity i s deeply embedded in the MTSS and Project AWARE framework \u2014 which, at its core, provides a set of systems, structures, and practices to build a positive, equitable, and inclusive learning environment for each student. As of the 2021-22 school year, 2 2 char ter school campuses, or 31% of sponsored charter school campuses, are participating in this program. Participating schools will complete extensive training with the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports Technical Assistance Center, UNR and other c ommunity partners. Our cohort schools will gain an understanding of how equity fits into a Multi -Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) and is essential to ensuring academic, behavioral, and social -emotional success for all students. Professional Learning: The S PCSA, through our Project Aware grant and other federal grants, is providing schools with a range of training opportunities related to meeting the social, emotional, and mental health needs of students . During the 2021 -22 school year, the SPCSA will provid e access to training on the following o SafeTalk o ASIST 26 http://safevoicenv.org/#:~:text=Students%2C%20parents%20and%20faculty%20throu ghout,prevent%20violence% 20and%20save%20lives . o Youth Mental Health Fist Aid o Restorative Justice Practices o Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion o Trauma -Informed Care and Instruction o Social Emotional Learning Athletics and Extracurricular Programs: Given the positive impact that athletics and extracurricular programs can have on students, many SPCSA -sponsored schools have reinstated these programs. All health and safety provisions required during the school day apply to these extracurricular activiti es. In addition, SPCSA -sponsored schools that participate in athletics through the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) are required to comply with safety protocols established by the NIAA, including COVID -19 testing protocols. Supporti ng the Needs of School Staff: While the SPCSA does not employ school staff, rather, teachers, administrators, and support staff are employed by the charter school's governing board, the SPCSA has provided sponsored schools with information about how they c an support their employees. This includes providing schools with the following resources: o ED COVID -19 Handbook, Volume 2, Section III: Supporting Educator and Staff Stability and Well -Being 27 o The CDC's Guidance for COVID -19 Prevention in K-12 Schools, Sect ion 3: School Workers28 Accelerating learning Clear Guardrails and Oversight Monitoring Student Access : The SPCSA monitors pertinent data related to student learning. For example, when schools initially closed, the SPCSA collected weekly attendance data from all schools. The SPCSA also regularly monitors the status of student connectivity (internet and devices) . Monitoring Student Outcomes: The SPCSA regularly monitors the academic performance of SPCSA-sponsored charter schools and students through statewide interim and summative assessments. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted state testing, particularly for the 2019-2020 school year, the SP CSA is conducting targeted oversight on interim assessments for schools with previous academic performance concerns and schools that have limited historical data available . Flexibility and Support Internet Access: The SPCSA works with several partners, including Nevada 's Department of Education ; the Governor's Office of Science, Innovation, and Technology ; internet providers such as T-Mobile and Cox Communications to support charter schools in procuring devices and internet connectivity for cha rter school students. This includes disseminating approximately 1,080 hotspot devices to charter school students through the support of the Governor's Office of Science, Innovation, and Technology and summer 2020, the SPCSA partnered with the Achievement Network (ANet) to offer a 4-part, virtual professional development series to all SPCSA-sponsored Charter Leaders, in regard to the process for developing school -specific instructional recovery plan s. After surveyi ng school leaders during the spring of 2021, the SPCSA used federal grant funding to provide interested school staff with two learning opportunities during the 2021 -22 school year . o Attendance Works three -part virtual learning series focused improving student attendance and reducing chronic absenteeism. The SPCSA funded 19 school staff members to participate in this learning experience. o WestEd six-part professional learning series focused on formativ e assessment . This professional learning series is being offered to all school administrators at SPCSA- sponsored schools and runs from November through March. Additional Resources: The SPCSA coordinated with approximately half of our charter schools to apply for a competitive grant from Nevada's Department of Education to support a range of activities covering three categories: (1) High- Quality Digital Instructional Materials, (2) High- Quality Professional Development, and (3) Wrap -Around Services. The SPC SA was ultimately awarded an additional $761,000 for these additional resources and to directly support the needs of our schools. The SPCSA facilitate s the logistics of several of these activities such as targeted professional learning through the Regional Professional Development Program (RPDP). The SPCSA also plans to apply for any future competitive funding in coordination with SPCSA- sponsored charter schools. Charter School Re- Opening Plans Clear Guardrails and Oversight Guidance for 2021-22 School Year Plans: On June 11, 2021, the SPCSA issued guidance to SPCSA-sponsored charter schools regarding their re- opening plans for the 2021-2022 school year and plans for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education for the 2021 -22 school year. This guidance , which can be found in Appendix D , identifies key topics and information that must be addressed in each of these plans . The SPCSA recommended that SPCSA -sponsored charter schools develop a single plan that addresses all of these requirements. Specifically, charter schools must address a) health and safety , including how the school is addressing key CDC recommendations , b) student and staff well -being, c) accelerating student learning, d) distance learning for students unable to pa rticipate in -person learning , e) distance learning in the event of an emergency closure, and f) supporting students participating in distance learning. The SPSCA reviewed each school's plan to ensure that each plan is comprehensive and meets the requirements of Directive 044 and Nevada's Department of Education's Guidance Memorandum 21 -02. With the new requirement for schools to develop COVID -19 Mitigation plans under Emergency Di rective 052, schools may choose to m odify existing plans to incor porate any changes and/or additional information or may choose to develop a second plan that will be implemented alongside the existing plan. Prevailing G uidance : The SPCSA provide s schools with up -to-date information regarding CDC guidance, emergency directives, and other related guidance. The SPCSA works to synthesize this information and provide guidance documents, checklists, and templates to assist schools in their re-opening efforts. Monitoring School Status and Changes: Through regular communication between SPCSA charter school leaders and assigned liaisons, the SPCSA monitors the status of school re - opening. Flexibility and Support Resource and Information Sharing: The SPCSA regularly provides charter schools with resources from the CDC, Nevada's Department of Education, Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services, and local health authorities. The SPCSA also provides schools with weekly updates on the CDC's recommended indicators of transmission, so that charter schools have regular access to data to inform their operations. Consistent Communication Staying Current with School Plans: The SPCSA continues to review each updated charter school re-opening plan for compliance with prevailing directives and guidance before providing each plan to Nevada 's Department of Education . In addition, all current re-opening plans are posted on the SPCSA Website29. 29 https://charterschools.nv.gov/News/2020/SPCSA_School_Reopening_Plans/ Appendix A: School Plans for the 2021- 22 School Year Pursuant to section 16 of Emergency Directive 044 and Guidance Memorandum 21 -02 (see Appendix C), charter schools must create re-opening plans and plans for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education for the 2021 -22 school year. On June 11, 2021, the SPCSA issued guidance to schools regarding their re -opening plans and plans for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education for t he 2021- 22 school year. This guidance, which can be found in Appendix D, identifies key topics and information that must be addressed in these plans and recommends developing a single plan that addresses all of these requirements. Specifically, schools mus t address a) health and safety, b) student and staff wellbeing, c) accelerating student learning, d) distance learning for students unable to participate in -person, e) distance learning in the event of an emergency closure, and f) supporting students parti cipating in distance learning. Re-opening plans for all SPCSA sponsored charter schools can be found on the subsequent pages and located on the SPCSA website: https://ch arterschools.nv.gov/News/2020/SPCSA_School_Reopening_Plans/ Alpine Academy Charter High School 2021 -2022 Re -Opening Plan Overview and Purpose of this Document Background All charter schools must develop re -opening plans for the 2021 -2022 school year that contemplate instruction offered through: 1. In-person instruction following social distancing protocols; 2. Distance education under an approved Path Forward Program of Distance Education; or 3. A combination of distance education and in -person in struction. Re-opening plans must be based on Nevada's Path Forward: A Framework for a Safe, Efficient, and Equitable Return to School Buildings and include a Path Forward Program of Distance Education1 in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth by the Nevada Department of Education (NDE). With an understanding that developing a re -opening plan is complex and time intensive, the State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) has developed an optional re-opening plan template which covers the topi cs outlined in NDE's minimum requirements and the Path Forward Framework. This document should be seen as a resource for schools and not a mandate. Whether schools decide to use this template or develop their own, the topics and guiding questions can serve as a tool for ensuring a comprehensive plan.

How will you communicate with students, families, staff and other stakeholders about the actions your school will be taking to keep people safe and healthy? How will you communicate with students, families, staff and other stakeholders about the actions i ndividuals should take to protect themselves and others? What is your plan to ensure that Parents receive general updates regarding the district/school's implementation of distance education at least weekly? If English Learners comprise at least 10 percent of the student population, the school will be required to make these weekly updates available in any language that is the native language of at least 50 percent of English Learners enrolled in the charter school. Communication with all stakeholders will occur in the following formats: Newsletters (Monthly) Website - updated as needed Social Media - updated as needed Auto Dialers and handouts School announcements Reopening surveys for all stakeholders - July 2021 (See attachment) Alpine Academy Actions - Safety and Health Posted signage indicating \"Alpine Academy Standards of Practice\" Newsletters, Social media, Website, and Auto -Dialers Registration paperwork Developing a \"School Dialog\" concerning the health of yourself and others Weekly updat es The website will feature a \"Latest News\" section to indicate current statuses, State guidance, directives from authorizer, etc. * Newsletter Handouts/Dialers * School announcements *will be translated to Spanish RE-OPENING SCHOOL BUILDINGS RE-OPENING APPROACH How will your school building(s) re -open? Will the school request a calendar adjustment as part of your re -opening approach? How will you approach re -opening for students whose families are not comfortable with them returning to school or who are identified as \"vulnerable populations\"? Under a hybrid learning model how would the school determine which students receive in- person instruction at which times? What circumstances/scenarios will warrant a change in the approach? If a change in approach is warranted, how will that transition be made? Plan A: (See attached) Full capacity with full- virtual option for those students with documented immune- compromised disorder and/or those students isolating per WCHD guidance. Masks optional for fully -vaccinated individuals. Dialog and practice of hygienic practices to decrease the spread of Covid 19. Backup Option B: 50% Capacity Option Alpine will split students into 2 groups to effectively meet a 50% capacity guidance should this be mandated Alpine Academy staff had great success implementing a blended scenario, however, in contract to 2020 -2021, Alpine would required daily log on of all students and allow 50% capacity to attend courses in person on a 2 day a week schedule. Backup Option C: Full Distance Education with guided supports. Alpine Academy would require daily, synchronous class with high engagement and accountability. PHYSICAL HEALTH SCREENING How will you screen staff and students? Students will be directed to enter through the front door. Student movement will be monitored and limited as students will primarily be moving in cohorts throughout their schedules. All students and staff will be screened for temperature (no contact) should community rate of transmission reach high levels and symptom checked (short, simple questi ons). All staff will receive guidance on identifying potential symptomatic students. Should a student exhibit a temperature of 100.4 or higher and/or covid symptoms, they will be asked to leave with guardians and quarantined (if not vaccinated) until trans portation can be arranged. PHYSICAL HYGIENE How will you address and reinforce hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette? How will face coverings be used? Per the latest directive, masks are required for public spaces for those 10 and older if not fully vaccinated . Appropriate signage will be posted as well as modeling from staff. For those students who may have health or cognitive disabilities, alternatives such as face shields will be implemented. All common ways and classrooms will have disinfectant and access to bathrooms for handwashing will be granted to all students. All guidance will be followed. SOCIAL DISTANCING How will you maintain social distancing in line with the Path Forward Framework, Governor's Emergency Directives, and Nevada Department of Education guidance? How will you transition as necessary when the prevailing guidance shifts in response to public health conditions? Classrooms will space tables and/or desks to accommodate 3 ft spacing as recommended when possible. Alpine Academy is a small school with approximately 1 54 students and 1 4 staff. Many of the obstacles with the directives for reopening are not present with this campus. Staff will implement curriculum via Google Classroom to make transition as seamless as possible in and out of quarantined status . Because the curriculum and instruction will be heavily embedded throughout the technology, this also allows for students who are believed to have symptoms but are out of school as well as those students electing a full distance option due to immunocompromised (documented) status to be as engaged as possible. Alpine Academy has hired additional staff and has offered more courses in efforts to pace students out more throughout the building. HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF RETURN TO WORK How will staff return to work? How will you address circumstances where staff are not comfortable returning to work or are identified as \"vulnerable populations\"? How will your staffing approach ensure strong implementation of your overall re -opening approach? How will you prepare for t he possibility of increased staff absences due to illness and ensure that staff who are sick are able to stay home? Staff will return to work the week before school starts to discuss implementation of Covid protocols. Staff have been surveyed about reopening. Additional professional development will be provided on the topics of engagement in the classroom and the Social/Emotional needs of students struggling with returning to school. If a particular staff member is not able to return to work due to a documented immune -compromised health status or quarantined st atus , that teacher's courseload will then be transitioned to online and a certified staff member will facilitate the course of digital learners during the physical meeting days. Staff will be integrated into the monitoring and supervision schedule to assist in the enforcement of social distancing (as required) and sanitization protocols. Alpine typically fills absences of staff via prep periods, however, the school can adequately provide substitutes for absences. There are also 4 part-time staff who can b e hired on an hourly basis to cover periods during the day. GOVERNING BODY AND SCHOOL LEADERSHIP ROLE How will you share consistent and up- to-date information with your governing body and school leadership? How and to what extent will the governing body and school leadership weigh in on key decisions? The Alpine Academy Board will review opening plans. New guidance and finalization of the plan (and/or changes to the plan) will be communicated with the Board via email (if between regularly scheduled meetings) and/or in meetings) . LOGISTICS FACILITIES MANAGEMENT What adjustments will be made to the facility or use of the facility to support your re -opening plan and to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19? How and how frequently will you clean and sanitize various parts of the facility to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19? Alpine has analyzed the current spaces and has opened additional spaces for students to gether during meal times. Outdoor space is planned with ESSER II allocations to assist in the spacing of students. In discussion with Science department to incorporate digital/virtual labs to avoid gathering or students. Friday afternoons will also be deep cleaning. High- touch areas will be sanitized twice daily (minimum), meal areas sanitized after lunch, and precautions (TBD) taken between c lasses. Each classroom has high filtration purifiers in each room and filters are replaced yearly (per device guidance). No touch Sanitizing stations are located in common spaces as well as each classroom. NUTRITION SERVICES/BREAKFAST & LUNCH How will the school adjust meal -time procedures to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19? If the school provides meals, what precautions will be taken during meal preparation and service to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19? How will the school ensure that students have access to nutrition services to which they are entitled? Alpine Academy does not provide meals. Updated and ongoing information will be made available to students/families regarding area services/meal availability. TRANSPORTATION/ARRIVAL & DISMISSAL How will the school adjust arrival and dismissal to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19? If the school provides transportation, what changes will be made to ensure social distancing, proper cleaning and sanitation, and overall mitigation of the risk of spreading COVID -19? Alpine Academy will open campus for longer periods in the morning to provide distance and time for students to safely enter the building. Students will enter through the front door and may exit through the back and side doors to decrease possible contamination of sanitized surfaces. Alpine Academy does not provide transportation. ATHLETICS/EXTRA -CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES How will the school adjust athletics and/or extra -curricular activities to minimize the risk of spreading COVID - 19? If the school offers NIAA sports, describe your plan for athletics, which should comply with NIAA guidance. Archery will resume based on State and CDC directives and/or guidance . INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY What technology resources are necessary to implement your re -opening plan? How will you ensure that the school has all necessary technology resources to support your re -opening plan? What actions will you take to expand access to technology and internet connectivity for students, families and educators? Alpine Academy plans to become a one -to-one chromebook school with the ESSER II allocation . Students wi ll have access to technology within all classrooms and will be sanitized between students/classes. Alpine will check out devices on an as -needed basis for those students under quarantine and/or immunocompromised health status. Alpine will research upgrading connectivity while on campus in the 2021 -2022 school year. WELLNESS AND RECOVERY SOCIAL -EMOTIONAL LEARNING - TIER 1 How will the school provide tier 1 (universal) social emotional supports to students? Students will receive one -to-one availability to access staff via virtual office hours and/or interventions (after school, before school, and interventions . Alpine has hired a College and Career Ready Coach for the 2021 -2022 school year who can assist in the academic and/social emotional needs of the students. Alpine has been awarded the MT SS Project AWARE grant and is currently developing school- wide PBIS program. Alpine will survey students periodically to determine the need for social and emotional supports. Alpine is an SEL school and dialog and activities will be developed and administ ered via in -class as well as virtual classrooms. TRAUMA -INFORMED PRACTICES - TIERS 1 -3 How will the school monitor students, staff and families who may be struggling and evaluate their social emotional needs? What tier 1 (universal) trauma -informed practices will be in place? What tier 2 and tier 3 additional supports will be available to support students, families and staff that may be in need of more intensive support? The school will provide detailed information about coordinating community resources as well as facilitate the referral of families to specialized support services. Some universal supports will include (but are not limited to): Individualized support and access to the College and Career Ready Coach and/or referral ser vices for all staff and students via digital scheduling. All students will participate in grade -level and schoolwide programs/ /PBIS/ discussions that focus on the needs of students throughout the year. Surveys will be conducted to assess both schoolwide as well as individual needs of students and staff. Tier 2 and 3 supports will include the coordination of efforts with services beyond what Alpine Academy can provide. Detailed/documented referral processes will be in place and protocol will be established to determine intervention in crisis. All staff will be trained in Non -Violent Crisis intervention (Executive Director is a certified trainer for the Crisis Prevention Institutes). ACADEMICS - Path Forward Plan of Distance Education (required for all schools not already approved by the Nevada Department of Education to provide full -time distance education to 100% of students) INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACH How will instruction be provided to students (describe synchronous and asynchronous approaches, as applicable)? What accommodations will be provided to students without access to technology, which may include distance education through paper correspondence? How will the school ensure that students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials have access to distance education? How will the school ensure that a teacher attempts to contact each student via electronic means or by telephone at least once per day? How will teachers be accessible to students through the internet or by phone during the school's regular instructional hours ? What adjustments will be made to specific courses to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19, such as band, physical education, chorus, or certain CTE courses? Alpine will provide the following options (See 2021 -2022 Alpine Academy Reopening Scenarios) Alpine will provide access to digital resource during digital resources days/times for student who may not have consistent access. Should full distance learning be required by the State, technology will be distributed on an as - needed basis (socioeconomic data, survey data, request of family, etc). Those students who have been quarantined will still have access to classes via synchronous zoom meetings. Students can l og in and join classes as they would via their in -person schedule. Alpine will either participate in documentation via school documents (similar to 2020 -2021 ) OR via Infinite Campus. Alpine staff will have a designated prep period during the day or classe s with few or no students during the day to increase availability to students and families. Virtual office hours and tiered interventions will be made available to Alpine stakeholders. Alpine is a digital science lab software school (via ESSER Comp FY 21 grant) (Labster). Alpine will comply with all mandates concerning physical education, music, choir, etc courses. MEETING STUDENT NEEDS How will the school adapt to provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with IEPs and students with 504 plans? How will the school evaluate the efficacy of its implementation of distance learning in the spring of 2020 and determine the academic needs of students due to the disruption in in- person instruction? How will the school meet students' academic needs based on this determination? How will the school continue to evaluate the efficacy of their plan to meet students' needs and adjust, as needed? Alpine Academy will reopen to full capacity with mitigation efforts outlined above. Should a limited capacity restriction be announced by the State of NV, Alpine will propose a blended learning model to comply with building capacity requirements and to make social distancing practicable. Students identified as needing more assistance will be full in person to assist in the acquisition of service minutes and compliance per IEP/504 plans. Should full distance measures be implemented, Alpine will conduct daily classes for all stu dents. This will allow for a more reasonable transition back to school should restrictions loosen during the school year. Alpine will provide devices to those students exhibiting financial need. Alpine Academy has surveyed stakeholders in terms of efficacy of the 2020 -2021 and will make changes based on data. Additional attendance and grade data will also be evaluated to determine best practices for Fall 2021. Alpine will schedule all high needs (IEP, 504, Credit Deficient) students in Seminar periods as a preventative/supportive measure to help ensure success as well as increase attendance interventions to help support a higher positive attendance rate. Frequent contact home, assigned tutoring, a nd required intervention time will be assigned as needed. Alpine Academy will conduct periodic surveys and evaluate data as a team to determine best practices and assess current practices. Committees will be formed to measure effectiveness of strategies a nd adjust as needed. ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT How will the school track student attendance in Infinite Campus? How will the school engage parents and families to communicate and reinforce the importance of attendance? We will make the necessary schedules and groups within our Student Information System to track daily check ins and/or in -class attendance. Alpine will implement a series of attendance interventions designed to re -engage as well as inform/involve students and guardians from absence #1. These interventions include signed letters, auto -dialers, student meetings, guardian meetings, truancy referrals, home visits, and credit recovery/make -up time. Alpine believes that every minute counts - especially in a scenario of addressing learning loss from the pandemic and limited instructional time . Much of our school -wide dialog will include the importance of being \"present\" in their learning. PROFESSIONA L LEARNING What professional learning will be provided to educators and staff regarding high- quality distance education and health and safety requirements related to preventing the spread of COVID -19? All staff will participate in training concerning the identification of symptoms of Covid as well as protocol concerning the possible contagious student. Alpine staff will follow local health district protocol concerning notification of student/staff infection. All staff will participate in professional development concerning the instruction of students digitally to effectively engage all students - this will also allow for Alpine to easily adapt to COVID protocols and guidance set forth by the SPCSA as well as NDE. SUPPORTING PARENTS/FAMILIE S What resources will be provided to parents/families so that they can support students? Alpine Academy social worker will provide a detailed list of resources for families as well as conduct periodic surveys to assess both student and family needs. Additional surveys will be conducted to ascertain the needs of families and workshops will be conducted in areas such as: developing good study habits, self -motivation, resources to help your student, growth mindset. These will be in the form of meetings ( online and/or in person) as \"Parent University\" workshops. All staff will have virtual office hours to assist in supporting students and families. Alpine Academy will continue weekly tiered, targeted intervention assistance held on Fridays. Alpine Academy Reopening S cenarios 2021-2022 *All scenarios listed below are dependent on local, state and CDC guidance. Option #1 - Full Re -Open (no capacity restrictions) Attendance Students attend classes, in -person. Only those students quarantined and/or immunocompromised (documented) may attend virtually. All students attend Mon -Thurs with Friday (ass needed) interventions. Mask Guidance/Social Distancing Alpine will comply with mandates concerning masks and social distancing.

Alpine Academy Face Covering Policy As the Covid -19 vaccine has been made available to all students in our school community and in compliance with state and local guidance and following recommendation from the CDC, Alpine Academy is making the following adjustments to our mask policy effective August 1, 2021: 1. All fully vaccinated staff and fully vaccinated students are not required to wear a mask at school campus or events (excluding graduations). Students must submit their vaccinations records to keep in their student file. 2. Any students o r staff that are outside and can be socially distant up to 3 ft are not required to wear a mask. 3. Masks are required for all adults and students who participate in or attend gatherings of more than 250 people. Alpine Academy 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 1 Survey 2 Alpine 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 3 If Alpine Academy does NOT require proof of Covid 19 vaccination, please rate your comfortability with the mask mandate being an \"honor system.\" 1 - Very Uncomfortable, 3 Neutral, 5 Very Comfortable. *This information will inform our decision to include proof of vaccination. Alpine Academy 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 4 Based on the \"Archer Standards of Practice,\" how do you feel about the proposed cleaning and sanitizing efforts? Please include any additional concerns you have regarding cleaning/sanitizing and we can add ress with our supply rep and cleaning service company. 79 responses Looks good Sounds good Good No concerns Good I think adhering yo those standards seems totally appropriate Daily Weekly sounds great felt safe when we did the open house Covid vaccine should be mandatory to return to the school; masks would not be needed with all other efforts mentioned. Wearing masks dehumanizes people and makes it very difficult to have meaningful interactions and mak es it difficult to hear people speak. Vaccines are available to all at no cost, a vaccine should be mandatory No concerns I feel fine I appreciate the guidelines as read above. I feel confident that these efforts are thorough. Sounds great. Really hope the masks go away soon! N/A I feel good If it works keep it up I don't really agree with the social distancing aspect of this because most places in the city have pretty much reduced it. I feel that keeping the temperature checks are good as well because I know that some students might still come to school sick. I think sanitizing often would be good for the school as well. My question is will students be required to sanitize their seat after class ends like last year? And if we do have to do that this year , could we PLEASE use the wipes instead of that spray stuff? I don't like the spray stuff and I feel that disinfectant wipes are better than the spray because the spray doesn't clean the surface like the wipes do. I also hope that the school will reach out if they need sanitizing supplies because my family, and hopefully other families, will do our best to support the school's needs. No concerns as of now. This practice did work out well for the last school year. This looks like a great plan to keep the sch ool clean and us all healthy as possible! I think it's a bit overboard. Alpine Academy 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 5 yes I feel comfortable with this plan. We feel very comfortable with the standard that are set in place. This looks to be thorough and effective I think the proposed cleaning efforts w ill work well. Yes I think based on the science of our microbiomes and the necessity of germ exposure to build immunity, coupled with the extremely low death rates among children, you should not sanitize everything daily. It is also a terrible idea to keep children in masks and if you require proof of vaccination, my children will need to find a different school because whether or not they are vaccinated, that is a gross violation of our privacy and freedom. It's a bit much Good! This will work just fine. overkill None Covid19 is airborne and ventilation/air scrubbing should be the main focus for facility mitigation efforts. Yes, I'm ok with this. they look good!!! I think it is a great idea to have a written cleaning policy to reduce all kinds of infections . Flu and strep are most likely to be picked up off a surface. However for COVID, according to the CDC, \"In most cases, fogging, fumigation, and wide -area or electrostatic spraying are not recommended as primary methods of surface disinfection and have sev eral safety risks to consider, unless specified as a method of application on the product label.\" This is concerning to me as I feel that fogging is over -vigilant, puts too many chemicals into the environment, costly and doesn't provide any protection from the primary spread of COVID being aerosols spread person to person. Surface cleaning is enough. Please allow our students to build natural immunities to being around other people. You are not going to get teens to social distance ... period. Good luck. Wo n't hurt to have it as part of the plan, but then you are liable, if you don't enforce it. I would go with the Washoe County or school district recommendations on social distancing. Not sure what jurisdiction you fall under. Daily discussion of hygiene will begin to look like wallpaper. Obviously, a hygiene routine will help, but the hygiene discussion should be generated by the students, possibly having leadership or discipled students create new posters weekly. Remove old ones and replace with new ones re gularly so that students have buy -in. Very good - the school handled this very well. Not that concerned Fine Great Drop the social distancing and mask wearing. PERFECT! Alpine Academy 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 6 This all sounds good. Feel very comfortable, thanks for all your doing. We feel good about everything Your cleaning plan sounds very robust and thorough. I like it Sounds great I like and agree with all the steps being taken. Their good This is too much. All things that could go away are: temperature checks, daily discussions on hygiene (maybe twice a week is ok), face mask, social distancing of 6 feet (3 feet would be better if some type of distancing is required). high touch surfaces should be after each person touches it to avoid spreading the virus very comfortable it's goo d None at this time I feel this is a great plan. We're comfortable with this. Weekly Cleaning schedule is acceptable Will masks still be used by everyone in school, or only unvaccinated people? I am most comfortable with everyone being masked. This is a bit to much cleaning. I think what ever you need to do to stay open if fine with me. Schedule seems thorough. It's wonderful! none I agree with the procedures proposed. Great This is excellent! This goes beyond my expectations and helps me feel safer about my kid being at school. I feel pretty good and solid on this. Alpine Academy 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 7 RETURNING Students, Families, and Staff Only: Rate the effectiveness of the 2020 -2021 (prior year) mitigation efforts: (Face coverings, sanitization protocol, distancing, etc). 1 - Ineffective, 2 - Somewhat Ineffective, 3 - Neutral, 4 - Effective, 5 - Very Effective. 60 responses If you have other concerns or comments concerning the Covid -19 protocols, please include those below: 21 responses Mark will be happy to be back! With the Delta variant on the rise, I would assume vaccinated individuals could forgo a mask, but others should not. I feel that the same individuals who would not get vaccinated would also not want to wear masks. Therefore, even though it's a pain for the school, in order to protect the health of all of the school students and personnel, it would make sense for proof of vaccination to be required before masks are taken off. Keep wearing masks, variants can be just as harmful and are not all covered by vacc ines. Delta variant. Please let the students feel a sense of normalcy. For students/staff that are not vaccinated, I'd like to see proper mask wearing enforced. I would love to tell you what I think about all this.... but it's not very nice or professional . :0) I would love it all to go back the way it used to be so the kids can just go to school and only worry about grades...... Last year the students were champions about wearing masks, cleaning desks, and staying home when they were ill. I expect them to be as helpful now as we move forward. Just want to say THANK YOU for all your hard work in keeping our kids and teachers safe <3 I'm curious as to whether or not the attendance policy has changed based on the chance of a student (or student's family member) getting covid. Alpine Academy 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 8 please don't be like rest if this country TMMC has all ready stated that full vaccinated student's can return full time. Enough is enough it's not going to go away just like everything else that's out their. I am a teacher and work in WCSD. I realize the numbers listed on the districts website did not reflect schools such as mine and many others of actual cases (we had over 8 classes excluded and many students excluded, at least 130 students tested positive. This virus is deadly and though my daughter is not high risk I am, her dad, and brothers are high risk too. We take all precautions and she knows to wear a mask and use a sweatshirt or tissue to open doors. She only uses her own items and does not share due to severe food allergies and now covid. Spacing the students at least 3 feet apart is beneficial too. One of our aides at our school brought home the virus and lo st her mom who lived with her. I have known dozens of people who lost loved ones and just in Reno/Sparks. Many parents seem to take this lightly, as an educator I take this seriously and so does my family. We will do all we can to make sure we are safe and so are those around us. if the kids that aren't vaccinated are wearing mask then they are going to stand out and possibly be bullied. I truly hope that Alpine Academy does not resort to a mandatory vaccination to attend. None I would not be comfortable wi th my student wearing a mask for another year of school. I do not think there is sufficient studies to show the safety of the covid vaccine for young adults. I therefore do not think it should be a requirement. Please consider holding classes outdoors when ever possible. Please don't force these kids to wear masks. They have been through enough. Alpine Academy 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 9 In order to maximize efficiency and accommodate digital learners (those subject to quarantine per Washoe County Health District AND/OR those students who are DOCUMENTED as immuno -compromised), we will institute synchronous lessons via webcam. This will include camera on, microphone on, students in FULL view of the camera and daily attendance per NDE guidelines. Please state your concerns about the technology/at tendance requirements below if any. 40 responses Alyssa hated hearing \"you need to turn your camera on\" all day being marked absent for not having a camera on is a bit harsh I hated hearing \"please turn your camera on or I will mark you absent\" all day last year. I thought that I would go crazy before the end of last year from hearing that. I am comfortable with Immune Compromised children doing distance learning No concerns This worked well last year. N/A, but this is fantastic No real concerns. my child did ok last year. My student didn't do well when required to do this last year when he was unsupervised. it didn't work and if you are using zoom we will not down load it on are home PC because of the virus that is on it My only concern would be with the mic on is there may be background noise that I would not want the students to get in trouble for distractions. Also my student works better with having music. Yes Privacy Alpine Academy 2021- 2022 Reopening Survey Stakeholder Data 10 My student will physically attend school however, any concern I have to virtual learning is the hackers that prey on kids Fine with what ever you guys do. That seems fine and fair. Only concern is social and emotional health My only concern would be If the student is sick and feeling horrible they will not be nor would I want them to be trying to engage in class. Otherwise I think it's a good plan. If you have other concerns or comments concerning the Academics/Instruction, please include those below: 16 responses I hate the \"you need to have your camera on\" rule. I'm sorry, but some students may be uncomfortable with having their camera on and/or their mic on because of their home situation. I also think that proof of vaccination should be required in order to be a ble to not wear a mask. Finally, I think that social distancing should be no more because most places in town don't do it anymore and it will make classrooms that are bigger have more seating room for students. I remember in certain classes last year, if y ou did not get to class before most everyone else got there, you didn't get a seat, and the teachers and students would have to search for a spare table/desk. Masks should not be required. You guys are awesome! Looking forward to another great year! Please get back to normal. 1 Amplus Academy 2021- 2022 School Year Plan 2 Introduction 3 Introduction 3 In-Person Learning: Health and Safety 4 Health and safety of students, educators, and other s chool staff 5 Key CDC recommendations including: 6 Use of face coverings 6 Handwashing and respiratory etiquette 7 Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including improving ventilation 7 Contact tracing 8 Diagnos tic and screening testing 8 Efforts to increase access and awareness to vaccinations 8 Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to health and safety policies 9 In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing 10 Meeting students' social, emotional, mental and physical health needs and providing access to a safe and inclusive learning environment 10 Educator and staff well -being 10 Distance Education: Students unable to participate in -person 10 Participation in distance education for a Path Forward Programs of Distance Education 11 Requirements 11 Attendance Policy 12 Appli cation 13 Access to Technology 13 Nutrition services 14 Quarantined Individuals 14 Conclusion 14 Distance Education: Emergency Closure 14 Distance education in the event of emergency closure of school? 15 Distance Education: Continuity of services 15 Access to necessary technology and resources 16 Special education and EL services 16 Additional Outreach 16 Staff Communication 16 Instruction 16 Family Communication 17 Nutrition services 17 Guidance Memorandum 21 -02 18 Declaration of Emergency Directive 044 19 3 Introduction Introduction Amplus Academy recognizes the recommendations made by the Nevada Department of Education (NDE), The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Home/Health Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) and app reciates the support provided by the Nevada State Public Charter School Authority (NSPCSA). This plan is created in accordance with these recommendations and in accordance with the \"Declaration of Emergency Directive 044\" signed by Governor Sisolak on Apr il 19, 2021 and the State of Nevada Department of Education (NDE) \"Guidance Memorandum 21-02\" dated May 28, 2021 and in consideration of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). On May 15, 2021 the CDC released the latest version of the \"Operational St rategy for K -12 Schools through Phased Prevention.\" Within the released strategy it states, \"Prolonged periods of remote or virtual learning can have negative effects on educational progress for students, potentially slowing or reversing academic gains... safe-in-person schooling can also offset the negative social -emotional and mental health impacts of prolonged virtual learning.\" At the end of the 2020- 2021 school year nearly 80% of students grades 6- 12 and nearly 75% of students in grades K -5 participate d in the in- person learning offered at Amplus Academy. Taking the guidance from the CDC and the participation from the overwhelming majority of our families in last year's in- person learning, Amplus Academy will strive to ensure that with few exceptions our students will participate in in-person learning for the 2021- 2022 school year. Amplus Academy will offer extended instructional services to students pursuant to Declaration of Emergency Directive 044 and NDE's Guidance Memorandum 21- 02. This docume nt also outlines Amplus' policies in place to address potential emergency closures. 4 In-Person Learning: Health and Safety 5 Health and safety of students, educators, and other school staff Our primary goal will be to empower students, families, and staff to monitor and maintain good health and hygiene. We will require students, families and staff to complete their own daily health screenings and have created a system to report concerns to o ur school nurse. Signs like the one provided by the CDC below will be shared with families reminding them about staying home if they are not well. The following screening tool will also be provided. \"The presence of any of the symptoms below generally suggests a student, teacher, or staff member has an infectious illness and should not attend school, regardless of whether the illness is COVID -19. For students, staff, and teachers with chronic conditions, symptom presence should represent a change from their typical health status to warrant exclusion from school. Occurrence of any of the symptoms below while a student, teacher, or staff member is at school suggests the person may be referred for diagnostic testing. Temperature External of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher Sore throat Cough (for students with chronic cough due to allergies or asthma, a change in their cough from baseline) Difficulty breathing (for students with asthma, a change from their baseline breathing) Diarrhea or vomiting New loss of taste or smell New onset of severe headache, especially with a fever Students should not attend school in- person if they or their caregiver identifies new development of any of the symptoms above.\" 6 If, during the course of the day or upon entry, a student is ill, parents or guardians will be contacted to pick up the student as soon as possible. Students with symptoms will be isolated until a parent or guardian will be available to pick them up. At that time, according to up- to-date guidance from the aforementioned health agencies, expectations regarding their return will be communicated. Similarly, staff members who exhibit symptoms will be sent home and their classes will be covered until they are symptom free and expecta tions regarding their return will be communicated. The school's PTO policy will be followed to communicate medical concerns to Human Resources and supervising administration. Key CDC recommendations including: Use of face coverings On July 9, 2021 the C DC released guidance requiring all individuals who are not vaccinated to wear face coverings. Students, adults and visitors ages 12+ who are not fully vaccinated will be required to wear appropriate face coverings. Current CDC guidance provides the foll owing to define persons who are fully vaccinated; \"In general, people are considered fully vaccinated: 2 weeks after their second dose in a 2- dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or 2 weeks after a single -dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine 7 If you don't meet these requirements, regardless of your age, you are NOT fully vaccinated. Keep taking all precautions until you are fully vaccinated.\" Amplus Academy may adjust mask policies according to community tra nsmission levels, school transmission levels, and/or NDE, SPCSA, State or Federal mandate according to that which is least restrictive. Handwashing and respiratory etiquette Current CDC guidance on handwashing and respiratory etiquette is as follows, \" Core principle for handwashing and respiratory etiquette: Through ongoing health education units and lessons, teach children proper handwashing and reinforce behaviors, and provide adequate supplies. Ensure that teachers and staff use proper handwashing and respiratory etiquette. \" Throughout the first week of school and as needed after that staff will take class time to, \" Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students, t eachers, and staff. If handwashing is not possible, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol should be used...Encourage students and staff to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue when not wearing a mask and immediately wash their hands after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.\" Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including improving ventilation Amplus Academy will continue to require that students maintain three feet of social distance in all settings, except when participating in an activity that requires otherwise (such activities include sports practices and competition). Staff will be required to keep classroom doors open at all times, except when hallway noise becomes a distraction to students (staff will be asked to be especi ally mindful of students with sensory or auditory sensitivity) to ensure an equitable learning environment while maintaining proper room ventilation. All heating and air conditioning (HVAC) filters are currently being replaced; HVAC filters will be replac ed regularly according to updated guidance. All HVAC systems have been serviced and meet the current requirements for safe ventilation at both Amplus Academy campuses. Staff, visitors, and volunteers will be encouraged to maintain six feet of social dist ance between other adults and any student. By maintaining social distance of beyond six feet, staff will not be required to quarantine unless they themselves are symptomatic. Amplus staff will continue to require students to utilize hand sanitizer when entering and exiting the classroom. This \"sanitize in and sanitize out\" policy will be assisted by regular cleaning of desks and high traffic, high contact areas. Desks will be requi red to be cleaned prior to the beginning of each transition. Cleaning supplies will meet SNHD, OSHA, and CDC guidance for safety and effectiveness against viral germs. Members of the operations team and administration will complete regular checks of s chool spaces to ensure cleanliness. High traffic and high use areas will be cleaned regularly by operation staff. Shared materials will continue to be limited. 8 Contact tracing Any person who is on campus that is sick will be required to stay home for t he prescribed amount of time by a medical professional. According to the SNHD, current guidance for those who test positive for Covid- 19 states, \"Quarantine can end after Day 10 without testing and if no symptoms have been reported during daily monitoring... Quarantine can end after seven days if a diagnostic specimen tests negative and if no symptoms were reported during daily monitoring. The specimen may be collected and tested within 48 hours before the time of planned quarantine discontinuation (to all ow time for the specimen to be processed) but quarantine cannot be discontinued earlier than after Day 7.\" The CDC further states, \"Quarantine should be used for students, teachers, and staff who might have been exposed to COVID -19. Close contacts, identi fied through contact tracing, should quarantine unless they are fully vaccinated, or have tested positive in the last 3 months, and do not have any symptoms. Students, teachers, and staff who are in quarantine should stay home and follow the direction of t he local public health department about when it is safe for them to be around others. If a child with a disability is required to quarantine, the school is required to provide services consistent with federal disability laws.\" Therefore, in compliance wit h above guidance, staff and students who test positive for COVID -19 will be required to quarantine. Seating charts will be required in each classroom and any person meeting quarantine guidelines (those within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes over a 24 hour period) will be required to quarantine as well. Proof of test results for close contacts wishing to come back to school after a 7 day quarantine will be required. In accordance with that which is allowable by Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil ity Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and any applicable updates, staff members who wish to forgo quarantine because they are fully vaccinated will have to show proof of vaccination to a designated representative from Human Resources. Unless otherwise prescribed, Ampl us will not require proof of vaccination from students. A member of administration, the school nurse or the Director of Human Resources will contact the SNHD as necessary to ensure community contact tracing can take place. Diagnostic and screening tes ting Though Amplus Academy has access to screening tests, there is no plan to utilize them on a large scale at this time. There is a possibility that this testing could be used to assist staff members and parents of students who are being sent home as a result of symptoms. However, the test results of the screener that we have require confirmation from another test. As a result, this screener will likely not be used on a large scale. Efforts to increase access and awareness to vaccinations 9 Amplus Academy's face covering policy encourages vaccination in that those who are not vaccinated will be required to wear face co verings per current CDC requirements. Parents/guardians will be encouraged to discuss all medical concerns with their personal medical professionals. Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to health and safety policies Those students with a documented medical condition who will not be able to participate in the in- person learning and those who are quarantined and unable to participate in in- person learning will be enrolled in an Extended Instructional Services under the pat h forward program. More information regarding the expansion of instructional services is below. Students with other disabilities and/or special needs will be accomodated according to their disability and in accordance to IDEA. Utilizing ESSER and ARP funds, Amplus Academy will employ additional staff members to assist in more one on one attention to provide such accommodations. Additionally, students with disabilities will be appropriately placed in cohorts that will ensure more access to education and less exposure to possible infection. 10 In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing Meeting students' social, emotional, mental and physical health needs and providing access to a safe and inclusive learning environment Amplus Academy has a robust team of student support consisting of counselors, social workers, paraprofessionals, and student support facilitators who will assist and be available in addition to teaching staff. Utilizing multi- tiered systems of support and wrap -around services, Amplus Academy aims to support all students. Tier one supports include the character curriculum designed to proactively teach positive study, interpersonal, and educational skills to all students. This curriculum will include families and provide opportunities for extended learning opportunities within the home environment. Additionally, in primary elementary classrooms (K -3), the targeted student to adult ratio in the classroom is 16 to 1. Tier Two supports include targeted groups and parent/teacher/counselor/administrator meetings aimed at supporting students on all social, emotional, mental and physical levels. Tier Three supports incl ude intensive training/classes utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Lifeskills courses, and our newly developed ARCHER Academy. ARCHER Academy will be staffed by members of the student support team as well as licensed teaching staff. Enrollment in ARCHER Acade my will be first offered to students who were most affected by distance education in the two previous school years as evidenced by MAP, SBAC, and other testing. Educator and staff well -being Amplus Academy has access to funds for staff members who may be in need of counseling services. Amplus Academy contracts a member of the community to provide counseling services as needed for staff at no cost. Additionally our schedule is such that we have extra time built into our contract time on Wednesdays and Thursdays for meetings and collaboration. This combined with a robust observation schedule allows for staff and their supervising administrator to work together to discuss any needed support. Our Human Resource team schedules annual \"stay interviews\" wh ere staff have the opportunity to discuss their well -being. Additionally, administration, support staff and members of our operations team will provide training to staff to empower staff to proactively care for their immediate surroundings, cleanliness , and mental health needs. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in -person 11 Participation in distance education for a Path Forward Programs of Distance Education Amplus Academy will offer extended instructional services to qualified students pursuant to \"Declaration of Emergency Directive 044\" signed by Governor Sisolak on April 19, 2021 and the State of Nevada Department of Education (NDE) \"Guidance Memorandum 21- 02\" dated May 28, 2021. The following document will outline these Extended Instructional Services as part of the qualified services as directed by the \"Path Forward Prog rams of Extension Instructional services for Amplus Academy.\" Memo 21- 02 states, \"Distance education options must be available to all students, regardless of their public school of enrollment, if they have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in- person or if they are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. In addition, county school districts must provide distance education options to any student based on parent/ guardian request through a process to be established by the district. County school districts may restrict entry into and exit from distance education to certain times within the academic year (i.e., beginning/end of quarter, semester, etc.)\" Path forward programs, permitted under Directive 044, will expire when the State of Emergency referenced in Directive 044 is lifted. At such time, Amplus Academy will work with NDE and Amplus Academy's authorizer, the Nevada State Public Charter School Au thority (NSPCSA), to help students participating in Extended Instructional Services (EIS) who qualified through the Path Forward Programs to transition back to in- person learning. This EIS will be similar to the process in place for any other student exist ing Homebound services and will be determined based on need and qualification for the program. Parents of students in classes that will be streaming will acknowledge that normal classroom activities (including names, voices, and their image) may be live streamed. These classes will not be recorded, and the link will be provided only to students registered to Amplus Academy and that particular class only for the time there is need. Requirements Students participating in Amplus Academy's Extended Inst ructional Services under the path forward program will be required to do so synchronously from an alternative location. Students will be required to attend classes virtually for the duration of the day per the school hours listed below. Rainbow Campus Kindergarten - Fifth grade 8:00am -3:00pm (M, T, F) Rainbow Campus Kindergarten - Fifth grade 8:00am -2:00pm (W, Th) Durango Campus Kindergarten - Sixth grade 7:45am -2:45pm (M, T, F) Durango Campus Kindergarten - Sixth grade 7:45am -1:45pm (W, Th) Durango Campus Seventh - Twelfth grade 7:45am -2:45pm (M, T, F) Secondary classes on Monday, Tuesday and Friday consist of 8 class periods and a 30 minute lunch Durango Campus Seventh - Twelfth grade 7:45am -2:45pm (W, Th) Secondary classes on Wednesday consist of class periods 1- 4 and a 30 minute lunch 12 Secondary classes on Thursday consist of class periods 5 -8 and a 30 minute lunch Students approved for Extended Instructional Services under the Path Forward Program will be required to be present and on -time to class each day. Virtual attendees, similar to in -person attendees, will require regular participation. Regular participation will be determined based upon students logging in to class sessions set up by teaching staff. Special circumstances requiring different accommodations will be granted on an as needed basis through the school counselors, administration, and/or the Director of Student Services. By providing synchronous education options to the small portion of the population who will qua lify for Extended Instructional Services under the Path Forward Program, it can be ensured that special programs (students receiving EL, SpEd, and/or 504 services) will be able to receive the necessary support afforded to them. Members of the special prog rams participating in Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program may also receive assistance through home visits as deemed necessary (particularly for social/emotional support and supervised assessments and in consideration of the healt h/safety of all participants and/or staff). Aside from circumstances of students participating in Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program as a result of being quarantined, entry into and exit from Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program will only be permitted at the beginning/end of each quarter. Technological and location supports will be provided by the school. Attendance Policy Staff will take attendance at the beginning of each day in elementary and at the beginning of each period in secondary classes. Staff will utilize Infinite Campus to track attendance. Regular reports will be run to ensure that students are attending class. Students who participate in Extended Instructional Services under the Pa th Forward Program will be expected to submit assignments at the same day and time as their in -person classmates. Submission of assignments will be according to teacher/class expectations except that electronic submission will be permitted in place of handwritten submission(s). Student attendance will ensure equitable access to teaching staff as staff members will be available for assistance during class each day/class period. Special circumstances requiring different accommodations will be granted on a n as-needed basis. Some accommodations may include attendance requirements being satisfied by students showing progress by completing their homework and classwork assignments, and/or students meeting with staff members outside of class time in addition to actual attendance with cameras turned on and students participating in class. Amplus Academy has a robust team of student support consisting of counselors, social workers, paraprofessionals, and student support facilitators who will assist and be available in addition to teaching staff. Students who fail to meet regular attendance requirements will be contacted by a member of Amplus Academy's Student Support team. Support team members will provide as needed assistance to troubleshoot any 13 potential problems. Student support members will communicate with members of administration regarding any concerns. As needed, students will be r equired to attend (virtually or in person) parent/teacher/student/administrator conferences in response to poor attendance. Application As a State Public Charter School, Amplus Academy is NOT a \"county school district\"; therefore enrollment in Extended I nstructional Services under the path forward program will be restricted to those who \"have documentation from a medical professional...or they are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials.\" Amplus Academy will not enroll \" any student\" into Extended Instructional Services under the Path Forward Program unless the student qualifies under the previously mentioned process and procedure. Parents/guardians will be required to complete the \" Application for Participation in Extended Instructional Services Under The Path Forward Program .\" (A copy of the application can be found in the appendix.) Parents/guardians will acknowledge enrollment and exit requirements, attendance requirements, and homework/classwork requirements. Parents will be required to provide appropriate \"documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in- person\" in order to participate in Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program. The Director of Student Support will review all applications and supplemental documentation with the school nurse and present the application to the school Principal for approval. Once approved, a member of the student support team will contact families to provide any necessary equipment and supplies. Access to Technology Parents/guardians will be required to complete the \" Access to Technology and Internet Connectivity Survey \" to ensure that students have access to sufficient internet and technology (A copy of the survey can be found in the appendix). To ensure equal access and de vice compatibility students will be required to use a school issued device to participate in Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program. Amplus Academy is a \"1:1 technology\" school and provides access to devices to ensure equity. Stude nt use of Amplus Academy assigned devices will help staff members to appropriately assist and monitor student activity thus ensuring attentiveness and internet safety. All Amplus Academy student devices are equipped with the monitoring software, GoGuardia n. GoGuardian helps staff encourage student engagement therefore assisting in an equitable learning environment for all students. Amplus Academy has access to Internet Hotspot devices that students can utilize to participate virtually while enrolled in Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program. Upon reviewing the results of the aforementioned survey, members of the student support team will work with families to provide any help with internet access. 14 Nutrition services Amplus Aca demy does not participate in providing nutrition services to students. Therefore, students participating in Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program will not otherwise qualify for nutrition services. Quarantined Individuals Any student to include those qualified for participation for Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program, students who are home for disciplinary reasons, and/or students who are home \"on the advice of local public health officials\" will be able to access learning from an alternative location. Except as previously mentioned for specially qualified individuals, this learning opportunity will be extended on a temporary basis and will not be extended beyond the duration of the medical necessity or disciplinary action. All those participating in EIS will be required to attend for the duration of the class/subject. Attendance will be taken and tracked in Infinite Campus. Students attending via EIS will be afforded the same access to devices and/or i nternet access as prescribed above. Conclusion It is the intention of Amplus Academy's administration to support any individual unable to attend campus for any reason without the loss of instruction. The addition of Extended Instructional Services to include students who would be negatively affected by in- person attendance as a result of the global pandemic is to ensure compliance with Directive 044 and NDE memo 21- 02 works cohesively with our Homebound Services and Restorative Justice Discipline Plan already in place. Extended Instructional Services provide the support all students and families need to ardently close the gaps created by the Covid- 19 global pandemic. We are committed to the continued success and growth of all our students. Distance Education: Emergency Closure 15 Distance education in the event of emergency closure of school? In the event of a school closure, Amplus academy will return to a distance education model. Having the experience of teaching distance education over th e past two school years helps us feel confident in meeting the educational needs in such circumstances. All staff members will have access to their own laptops whose operating systems include access to online resources such as google classroom (and all ot her google suite for education services), canvas, GoGuardian, online library, camera, IXL, Khan Academy, and infinite campus. Despite our plans to begin school with the majority of our students on campus, we will structure classes and systems to allow for a shift to online learning on little to no notice. Attendance would take place in Infinite Campus to ensure adherence to mandated compulsory education requirements. Distance Education: Continuity of services 16 Access to necessary technology and resources With the guidance of NDE and SPCSA and the assistance of emergency funds Amplus academy was able to become a 1:1 school during the 2020- 2021 school year. At the beginning of the 2021- 2022 school year all students will be assigned a device for their use. All learning could potentially take place with these devices. Any supplementary resources can and will be provided to students through material pick- ups (similar to the last two years). Amplus academy took advantage of the assistance from T -Mobile last year and obtained internet \"hotspot\" devices which were provided to families who were in need of internet services. Our student support team also helped connect families to community resources. Special education and EL services Distance education services would be appropriate in assisting all special populations. When appropriate, these services would be administered in person. Special populations spent the majority of the school year on campus last year under the appreciate exceptions. Amplus staff would seek similar exemptions in the case of school emergency closure. When this is not possible, licensed staff will document their efforts in providing appropriate education to special populati ons. As necessary, parent meetings will take place virtually. Additional Outreach Members of the student support team, administration, elementary paraprofessionals, and administrative staff members would attempt regular contact with all families and students. Special contact attempts will be made via phone calls, email, video conferencing, home visits, and/or standard postage through the United States Postal Service (USPS). Priority for these contacts will be given to students identified as needing a dditional social emotional services and via teacher referral. Teachers will be expected to have weekly contact via email, work completion, phone call, or video conferencing with each student in their classes. In the event that they are unable to make contact teachers will inform the student support team. The student support team will then manage additional outreach. Staff Communication Utilizing the staff provided devices, members of administration and/or human resources will have weekly meetings to su pport staff members. The expectation of weekly team meetings will remain to ensure continuity of care and education for all students. This will also allow team members to remain in contact with their cohorts. Instruction Daily instruction will be required. When possible, synchronous instruction will be preferred. However, as needed, asynchronous options will be made available. Attendance requirements will be set based upon direction 17 provided at that time. The expectation, however, will be that stude nts are engaged in daily learning. Staff will utilize Google Classroom (and all other google suite for education services), Canvas, GoGuardian, online library, camera, IXL, Khan Academy, achieve3000, and infinite campus to provide instruction. Emphasis w ill be placed upon direct student/teacher education. Parents will be fully informed regarding their role in the success of their student's learning. Family Communication Staff will utilize Infinite Campus to communicate via email with families. Infinite Campus also allows staff to send automated phone calls and text messages which will assist in family communication. Upon registration, all students are assigned an email account. This account links students to the Google Education Suite (Google classro om, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Hangouts...). Should we need to shift to Distance Education due to another emergency, a family meeting would be held to provide appropriate expectations. We would use the aforementioned platforms to communicate the de tails of the meeting to families. A transcript and recording of the meeting would be posted to our website. Nutrition services Amplus Academy does not participate in providing nutrition services to students. Therefore, students participating in Extended Instructional Services under the path forward program will not otherwise qualify for nutrition services. However, members of the student support team will provide a list of resources to those in need of such information. 18 Appendix Guidance Memorandum 21- 02 19 Declaration of Emergency Directive 044 20 Applica tion for Participation in Extended Instructional Services Under The Path Forward Program Application for Participation in Extended Instructional Services Under The Path Forward Program Pursuant to \"Declaration of Emergency Directive 044\" signed by Governor Sisolak on April 19, 2021 and the State of Nevada Department of Education (NDE) \"Guidance Memorandum 21- 02\" dated May 28, 2021 Amplus Academy will extend Extended Instructional Service s to qualified students.

Signature of Applicant Date Principal Approval Date BANV 2021 - 2022 DRAFT Reopening and Path Forward School Plan Beacon Academy of Nevada 2021- 2022 Reopening and Path Forward School Plan BANV 2021 - 2022 DRAFT Reopening and Path Forward School Plan Overview and Purpose of this Document The Beacon Academy of Nevada Reopening and Path Forward Plan includes processes and procedures to implement a safe, efficient, and equitable return to school buildings. The plan incorporates the guidelines put forth in Nevada's Framework for a Safe, Efficient, and Equitable Return to School Buildings developed by the NDE based on public health guidance, best practice resources from national and state organizations, and the expertise of Committee members. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers the following guidance for ways in which scho ols can help protect students, educators, and staff and slow the spread of disease: Schools must determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials and to the extent possible, whether and how to implement these considerations while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. CDC guidance documents are meant to supplement \u2014not replace \u2014any stat e, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools must comply. In the development of this plan, stakeholders are invited and encouraged to engage in the decision- making process to ensure that the reopening plans are responsive to their concerns and expressed needs and address specific challenges in each community. Engaging and collaborating with families and community members throughout the planning and implementation process will result in a stronger and more sustainable reopening plan. We'd like your feedback on the reopening plan. You are invited to discuss your concerns with the Governing Board during the July Board Meeting scheduled for July 27, 2021 at 4:30 p.m. via Zoom or in- person at our West Campus location, 7360 W. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas, NV 89147. If interested in attending via Zoom, please contact Mary Kay Bellinger, Operations Coordinator - marykay.bellinger@banv.org - to request the link to the meeting. BANV 2021 - 2022 DRAFT Reopening and Path Forward School Plan Question 1: In -Person Learning: Health and Safety How will the school maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other school staff? How is the school addressing key CDC recommendations including: Use of face coverings; Handwashing and respiratory etiquette; Cleaning and maintaining he althy facilities, including improving ventilation; Contact tracing; Diagnostic and screening testing; Efforts to increase access and awareness to vaccinations; Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to health and safety p olicies. Ongoing Communication: Stakeholders will receive communication weekly, or more frequently, as needed, on the actions the school is taking to keep students, staff, and families safe and healthy. The school will also ensure stakeholders stay informed on how they can best protect themselves following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) guidelines. Resources, including vaccination access and awareness, and other information will be included in the weekly bulletin and emailed to families. For more urgent matters, the phone system will be used to share important updates and reminders to help families stay apprised of new developments. Consistent and accurate c ommunication regarding policies and procedures is needed to keep everyone safe. In addition to the weekly bulletin, website, emails and phone calls, and text messages, students will receive reminders when on campus or in their online classes: Signs will b e posted in highly visible locations (e.g., school entrances, restrooms) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs (such as access and awareness to vaccinations, proper handwashing, respiratory etiquette, and us e of a cloth face -covering). Teachers will make announcements about how to reduce the spread of illness each period. Announcements will be made in classes on campus and in the learning management system. Teachers will encourage and require frequent hand washing/sanitizing at regular intervals The weekly bulletin, website, and social media accounts will include messages about behaviors that prevent the spread of illness when communicating with staff and families. BANV will disseminate free CDC print and digital resources from the CDC's communications resources main page using the weekly bulletin and email. On campus, BANV staff will ensure student - and family -facing materials are reader- friendly and available in English and Spanish, to the extent possible. Staff will receive training for the general pandemic response and specific for their role. Parents will be enrolled in an online orientation/tutorial to help them create a Canvas LMS parent observer account, navigate Canvas LMS, and provide support to their students. BANV 2021 - 2022 DRAFT Reopening and Path Forward School Plan Students will be enrolled in an online course about safety precautions and measures to take in order to prevent the spread of COVID -19. Physical Hygiene: Students are required to monitor their health daily prior to coming to campus by watching for fever, cough, shortness of breath, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, etc. If symptoms are present, students are advised not to come to campus and are to notify a school official of their absence (i.e. Attendance Clerk, Teacher, School Nurse, Administrator, etc.). Students will be expected to follow quarantine guidelines as outlined by local health officials or medical professionals. In accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, students who are not fully vaccinated, which is two weeks after the final vaccine is administered, are required to wear a mask while on campus unless the student re quires accommodations in accordance with ADA/Medical guidelines. Fully vaccinated students will not be required to wear a mask on campus, however, will be required to provide documentation of vaccination. If documentation of vaccination is not provided, fully vaccinated students will be required to wear a mask. Prior to entering the building, students will be required to access the no -touch hand sanitizer located in the entryway to sanitize their hands prior to going to their classroom. If needed, stude nts will also be issued a reusable BANV cloth mask to use while on campus, if they have not brought their own. Masks will be collected as students exit the building and will be washed daily. On the first day of school all teachers will teach proper handwashing techniques to all students, the proper use, removal and wa shing of cloth face coverings, how to safely cover coughs and sneezes , where to access vaccinations and vaccination awareness, and how to limit contact and in the classroom setting. Students will be encouraged to wash or sanitize hands frequently throughout the day, with teachers planning for additional time and logistical considerations to allow for proper hand hygiene. Students will also complete a safety and hyg iene lesson online as a part of the back to school orientation. Students will be required to wipe down all shared surfaces prior to starting the school day (i.e. Chromebook , tables, chairs, etc.) Upon completion of Academic Seminar, students are required to wipe down all shared surfaces prior to leaving campus (i.e. Chromebook , tables, chairs, etc.). Students will be asked to wipe down the restroom (i.e. faucet handles, door handles, etc.) after each use, prior to leaving the restroom. Due to the fact that soap and water are only available in restrooms, no -touch hand sanitizer dispensers have been installed in each classroom for student and staff use. Hand sanitizers will be used at each transition between class periods, or more often as deemed appropriate by the classroom teacher. Social Distancing: Social distancing is one of the best methods to avoid being exposed to viruses and slow the spread of disease. BANV staff and students will maintain a social distance of three - feet and/or take steps to implement statewide mandates and follow CDC and local health guidelines that are in place at that time. Staff, including teachers, will be reminded to stay three -feet apart from students, families, and other staff members. Only two students will b e assigned to sit at each six- foot classroom table. BANV 2021 - 2022 DRAFT Reopening and Path Forward School Plan The hallways will be marked to indicate three -feet of distance. A one -way traffic flow pattern will be utilized on both floors of the school, to the extent possible. Staff will remain vigilant in hallways during transitions, reminding students to follow social distancing guidelines and one -way traffic patterns. Students assigned to second floor classrooms will be dismissed five minutes early, to minimize exposure to other people in the stairwell. Students will be scheduled to minimize exposure, when on campus: Students will transition to their second classroom by adhering to social distancing guidelines and following traffic -flow patterns. As CDC, State, and local guidance shifts, BANV is prepared to adjust to the newly established guidelines: If the situation worsens, BANV will implement a Fully Online program, as described in the plan. If the situation improves, BANV will gradually allow more students on campus as permitted by social distancing guidelines. Student academic performance data will be analyzed to identify students who require an additional day on campus. Priority will be given to those students and they will be scheduled for an additional day. BANV will continue to follow current mandates an d guidelines as restrictions lessen, scheduling more students on campus until it eventually returns to normal operations.

In -Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing How will the school meet students' social, emotional, mental and physical health needs and provide access to a safe and inclusive learning environment? How will the sc hool support educator and staff well-being? BANV attributes much of its success to innovative programming that prioritizes social - emotional growth and development of the whole student through school -wide Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) program. Providing intensive, individualized social, emotional, and academic support to students who have fallen off- track and face significant challenges is critical to the success of the student. Tier I Social -Emotional Support: A School Social Worker (SSW) is assigned to support the social and emotional health of every student enrolled. New students and their legal guardians are required to attend an academic consultation with a school social worker to discuss his/her academic hist ory to identify gaps in education, attendance, medical concerns, and academic performance to ensure that the social, emotional, and academic needs of the student are identified in order to better support the student. The academic consultations can be held virtually or on campus depending upon the family's preference or according to State and Local guidelines. Returning students are scheduled to attend a Student Success Plan meeting with their SSW at the start of each school year. During the meeting, the SSW conducts a Needs Assessment to identify changes in the student's status and provide social- emotional support or connect them to community resources. The SSW helps to minimize barriers that are impeding the success of the student by incorporating evid ence -based strategies which include: Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports, Check and Connect, identification of early warning indicators, and increased communication and re -engagement strategies using student performance data. Through grant fund s, BANV is able to provide access to the internet and minimizes transportation barriers for many students. In addition, BANV provides wrap -around services with the assistance of its extensive list of community partners. The following Tier I Supports will be offered online and/or on campus: BANV will provide consistency in daily routines to reduce stress and promote positive learning conditions. The teachers and support staff will be available during BANV school hours either on campus or remotely online. A Student Needs Assessment will be emailed to all students to identify basic needs and social emotional health, so the SSW can provide support. The SSW will hold office hours on campus and online using Google Meet. Students can drop -in without an appoint ment for support, assistance, or to schedule a private meeting. The SSW are available to students using phone , text, Google Chat, or email and respond to students within 24 - hours or less, remotely or on campus. SSW will facilitate Google Meet sessions online, providing opportunities for students to discuss a variety of topics based on their interests. Each week, the SSW will contact individual students to conduct a wellness -check, discuss attendance, academic progress, and social- emotional health using th e method of communication preferred by the student and their families. BANV 2021 - 2022 DRAFT Reopening and Path Forward School Plan Each student will be enrolled into a Canvas LMS course that will include material to support students' social and emotional needs. The course will provide the social worker department a communication platform that is frequently accessed by students. The students will have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the resources and material posted in the canvas course. The SSW will survey students to gather input on how th e school can celebrate student milestones. The survey will also include a question to understand the level of importance the celebrations may hold. This survey will also allow the input and thoughts surrounding the safety during COVID -19. SSW provides con nections for families/students in need of resources and outside school support. With respect to the students level of care, the SSW may provide information for community mental health services. BANV offers opportunities, on campus and/or online, for stud ents to share and process their emotions through teacher referral, student referral, and/or family referral. Referral and Support for Students requiring Tier II or Tier III Interventions Students who are not making progress, after exhausting Tier 1 inter ventions, are referred to participate in Tier II or Tier III intervention programs. The school has an online referral system in Smart Sheets where teachers can refer students to the Student Success Team, which consists of administrator, teachers, social w orkers, and attendance clerk. The team holds meetings to discuss referrals and student interventions. In addition, the SSW uses information gathered during the Student Success Plan meeting and from the Needs Assessment to identify students who need Tier II and Tier III supports and interventions. Staff Well -being: Employees of BANV in all roles and at all levels are integral to emergency planning and response. BANV must take into account its role as employer, policymaker, and trainer when addressing the human resource aspect of preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery.

In the program, schools have to provide details on their distance learning plan for full -time distance learning students for the 2021 -2022 school year. There has to be key information included, such as how students were approved for distance learning, what the learning model will look like, and how attendance will be taken. The State Public Charter School Authority requested more information from schools, such as what schools are doing to ensure health and safety for all, what a school's in -person learning will look like, and what steps schools are taking to support students and staff with their social and emotional wellbeing. The 2021 Legislative Session produc ed Senate Bill 215. Schools are required to develop a distance education plan in the event of an emergency that may cause a school closure of at least 10 days. This way schools are more prepared to tackle any sudden closures, similar to what was experience d in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. In an effort to streamline all of the requested information, the State Public Charter School Authority has requested that schools submit a 2021 -2022 reopening plan. In it, there are three key requirements: Requirem ent A: Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID -19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID -19 on students' opportunity to learn. Requirement B: Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Dist ance Education Plans for the 2021 -22 school year. This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in -person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Requirement C: Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community, parents and school employees. This plan 1 Section 8 of Emergency Directive 044 2 establishes an emergency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emergency. 6 Safe Reopening for In -Person Learning CIVICA ACADEMY recognizes that the health and safety of students and staff is of the utmost importance. CIVICA ACADEMY will seek data, guidance, recommendations, and/or approval from the Southern Nevada Health District, the Center for Disease Control, the Nevada Department of Education, and the Nevada Governor's Office. CIVICA ACADEMY will continually work with its families, staff, leadership and Board to implement Covid -19 mitigation protocols that are the safest for its in -person students and staff at any point in time. U ltimately, CIVICA ACADEMY will use all available scientific information to help make a determination on these matters. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette CIVICA Academy will continue to promote proper personal hygiene: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Wear a cloth face mask covering in public Avoid traveling if you are sick Stay home if you are feeling i ll Get medical care as needed All staff that has not been fully vaccinated will be required to wear a face mask at all times. Students over the age of nine who are not vaccinated will be required to wear face masks at all times. Face masks will be provide d to those who may need it. Students nine and under are not required to wear a mask. Students nine or older must provide evidence that they are vaccinated in order to not wear a mask. CIVICA Academy will have an abundance of signage promoting positive physical hygiene. For example, each restroom mirror will have a sticker reminding students to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds. In the event that a student may not be implementing safe and healthy hygiene practices, staff will re -educate the stude nt and inform the student's parents. Diagnostic and Screening Testing If any staff member or student is not feeling well and having any symptoms, that person will need to stay at home. They should only return to school when there are no remaining symptoms. For screening and testing, parents and staff will be required to mon itor symptoms, stay home if symptoms are present, and follow all SNHD and CDC guidelines. Optional Binax Rapid tests will be provided with parent/guardian consent. Persons who test positive via Binax Rapid test will still be recommended to be tested using the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Efforts 7 will be implemented to increase access and awareness to vaccinations. CIVICA Academy will communicate with stakeholders about access and awareness to vaccinations when applicable. CIVICA Academy will continue to partner with the SNHD and the UNLV School of Medicine to provide vaccines to eligible families. If a student or staff member is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease, the person will be required to self -quarantine, an d the Southern Nevada Health District will be contacted. CIVICA ACADEMY will work in consultation with medical and public health experts, the State Public Charter School Authority, and the Nevada Department of Education to determine the extent of testing in the school and if a closure is necessary. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities CIVICA ACADEMY will make multiple adjustments to its facilities to minimize the risk of COVID - 19. Hand sanitizer pumps will be placed on walls in various locations th roughout the campus. There is an increase in signage enforcing social distancing and healthy personal hygiene in hallways and classrooms. There are decals in restrooms reminding individuals to wash their hands. Furniture that is difficult to clean will not be utilized or replaced. All air filters will be monitored and replaced as needed. HVAC vendors have serviced each campus' HVAC system more frequently in the past 12 months. All shared items, such as athletic balls, will be cleaned accordingly There will be limited use of the water fountain. Students and staff will be encouraged to bring their own water bottles. Technology will be assigned to students as needed/requested All emergency plans will be adjusted to accommodate social distancing guidelines while maintaining the necessary safety, urgency and precaution At CIVICA Academy, staff will check the cleanliness of the cam pus to ensure a safe and healthy environment. All restrooms will be monitored regularly throughout the day to ensure cleanliness. High t ouch points, such as water fountains, sink heads, door knobs, and student desks, will be cleaned regularly by CIVICA ACADEMY staff. Shared materials will be limited as much as possible, and they will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Each night, there will be daily detailed cleaning of facilities from our night vendor to ensure all areas were cleaned. In the event of a pandemic scare or a positive COVID -19 diagnosis, each school has been equipped COVID -19 approved machines that run ever thirty min utes to kill any possible COVID -19 materials. These will be distributed throughout the school and run accordingly. Face Coverings Our campuses will have masks readily available for anyone who wants or needs one . Ultimately, CIVICA ACADEMY will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA for guidelines 8 requiring face coverings. If face coverings become mandated for whatever reason, CIVIC A ACADEMY will ensure that anyone stepping onto campus has a face covering on. Some of our students may not be able t o wear a mask or face covering due to medical reasons. A doctor's note must be provided by a medical physician on their letterhead. IEP/504 students may not be required to wear masks based on individual needs. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staff t hat has tested positive for Covid -19, principals conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in close contact with the positive individual. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes. The principal will share the names of close contacts, their contact information, and parent information if the close contact is a student. From there, the Principal will contact the Southern Nevada Health District. At that point in time, the length of quarant ine will be determined. Students or staff will remain on their quarantine and return after their quarantine time has passed and have no symptoms for 24 hours. Social Distancing & Capacity CIVICA ACADEMY will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA when it comes to social distancing requirements and room capacity limits. CIVICA ACADEMY has measured each of its classrooms. It knows the full capacity limit and can adjust accordingly to any percentage. Accommodations for Children with Disabilities The EL Team, SPED team, and school support staff will schedule time during both in -person and for students who have to be quarantined or have documentation from a medical professional to support English language learners and special education students. Ins tructional aides will be accessible during in -person instruction and remote instruction. Remote instruction students have access to remote break -out groups to receive small group or one -on-one instructional support. The school will evaluate the efficacy of the plan based on student engagement, student data and stakeholder feedback. Vaccination Access & Awareness CIVICA ACADEMY will continue to strongly encourage students, families and staff members to get their vaccinations if they are of age and healt h abides. CIVICA ACADEMY will promote local and site -based testing sites in order to raise awareness. 9 Traveling Abroad A quarantine may be required if a student/staff member has returned from traveling to an international COVID -19 hotspot, as determined by school leadership. There will be an exception for families that had work -related military job duty responsibilities. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Well -being Student and Staff wellbeing is at the top of CIVICA ACADEMY 'S list. SEL time has been bui lt in to our everyday schedules to make sure that we are checking in with our students daily. Wellness and Recovery SOCIAL -EMOTIONAL LEARNING - TIER 1 Social Emotional Learning team (SEL team) will first begin by providing training to all staff, including teachers, administration and support positions, on how to address student trauma, activities to start open conversations in classrooms, and how to refe r students who may be struggling more significantly. TRAUMA -INFORMED PRACTICES - TIERS 1 -3 Referral system starts with training teachers and staff to know the signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression in students and who they can contact on the SEL t eam for further assistance. Training will begin the first week back for teachers in either in person or webinar format. Tier 1 (universal) trauma -informed practices will be in place Teachers being supplied \"teachable moment\" lesson plans, following CALM procedures, maintaining an optimistic and calm approach to COVID concerns for students while adhering to CDC recommendations for safety of students and staff. Addressing key issues with facts and fostering a supportive and safe community for children and parents. What TIER 2 and TIER 3 additional supports will be available to support students, families and staff that may be in need of more intensive support? SEL team, including psychologist, counselors, and social workers will be available by referra l to speak with families and students individually in order to provide school based, solution focused, therapy and outside resources for families in need. Supporting Educators and Staff CIVICA ACADEMY will support educators and staff by focusing on areas to ensure their safety and well -being. 10 1. Foster wellness . CIVICA ACADEMY will educate staff about mental health and encourage open conversation s about the challenges people are experiencing, employees may be more likely to access care when needed. CIVICA ACADEMY will have an open door policy with their staff which allows them to feel comfortable to come in and talk about things they may be going through. CIVICA ACADEMY will do weekly check -ins with their teachers to provide consistent opportunities for those conversations to be had. 2. Provide training . CIVICA ACADEMY will put an emphasis on training all staff not just at the beginning of the year, but weekly trainings to allow teachers that continued professional development. 3. Model healthy behavior: CIVICA ACADEMY will promote an emphasis of school leadership to be the driving force behind modeling behavior for the rest of the staff which will make its way down to students modeling proper behaviors. Implementing Assessments/ Pairing Data with Instructi on CIVICA ACADEMY will continue to use diagnostic and formative assessments of student data (MAP, i -Ready, etc.) to evaluate the needs and effectiveness of instruction and determine the needs of students' academic progress. Teachers will hav e data chats with students and determine student goals based on formative assessments, summative assessments, and diagnostic results. Teachers will work with students to evaluate their progress toward their personalized goals and create a plan of action to work toward meeting those goals. We will utilize PLCs to analyze and monitor data to determine class and grade level needs to support students who need intervention, extension, and re-teaching. We will provide needed resources including necessary technology and curricular needs to those students who remain virtual due to a medical necessity or a necessary quarantine. Path Forward Program: Distance Learning CIVICA ACADEMY has created a distance learning plan for the 2021 -2022 school year. CIVICA ACADEMY recognizes that there may be families that need to keep learning in a virtual environment. The distance learning plan is specifically design ed for students: With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in -person learning, as determined by a medical health professional Who tested positive for Covid -19 Students who have to quarantine due to exposure 11 High -Risk Medical Exemption Process If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition*, a Medical Certification for COVID -19 High Risk Exemption Form (provided in the next section) may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home. A health care medical professional must complete the exemption form and email it to CIVICA ACADEMY. CIVICA ACADEMY will review the form, and either approve or deny. The medical exemption form is attached. Students who are out on a high -risk me dical exemption may not participate in any in -person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). There may be times, like for imp ortant assessments, where students may need to be on campus. During these times, a safe, socially -distanced environment will be set up for the students to be in. Every person will wear a mask in these environments. Once approved for distance learning, stud ents will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning at the end of first semester - which will be determined on a case -by-case basis. High Risk Exemption Form Page 1 - Information If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition *, a Medical Certification for COVID -19 High Risk Exemption Form may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021 -2022 school year. Students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not pa rticipate in any in -person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID -19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning - which will be determined on a case -by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. Distance learning will consist of your student working individually on assigned work through different learning platforms. Students will check in with their teacher s for progress check -ins, checking for understanding of the lessons, academic goal setting, assessment preparation, etc. *Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart 12 disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. Procedure for submitting a medical exemption form: Please see the next page for the fo rm. Fill in your child's name, grade, campus, and the parent -related information. Have your licensed health care provider complete and sign the form. Turn in the completed form to the front office staff. For siblings , one form must be completed for each sibling. If the student's medical physician cannot be reached for signature (i.e., moved to Las Vegas from another state), a letter from the physician on letterhead will suffice in place of the form All medical exemption requests will be subject to verification. The form must be completed and signed by a licensed health care provider and is subject to verification . Parents/guardians will be notified by campus leadership when the form has been verified and accepted. High Risk Exemption Form Page 2 - Medical Certification Student Name: Campus: Grade: The High -Risk Exemption is due to the health of: (circle one) Student Household Member Parent Name: Parent Email: Parent Signature: Parent Phone #: Should a student be required to return to in -person instruction, but the student or an individual in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, this medical certification form will need to be submitted in order for the student to be considered for remote learning. Completed forms should be submitted to the MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA to claim the high -risk exemption for COVID -19. Forms must be signed by a licensed health care provider an d are subject to verification. Parents/Guardians will be notified when the form has been approved. Individual at Higher Risk: Individuals at higher risk for severe illness from COVID -19 are those individuals with certain underlying health conditions as designated by the CDC, which provides as follows: Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, com promised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakenin g medications), diabetes, serious heart disease ( including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidn ey disease undergoing dialysis, liver disease, or severe obesity. 13 For High -Risk Student, a Medical Professional Must Complete the Section Below For High -Risk Household Member, Parent Must Complete Questions 1 & 2 + Attach Documentation Health Care Provider's Name: _____________________________________________________________________________ Health Care Provider's specialty: ________________________________________________________________________ Phone:_____________________________________ Email:_________ ____________________________________________ 1. Does the named student or individual in his/her household have an underlying medical condition deemed to be high risk for severe illness from COVID -19 as determined by the CDC and listed above? Yes No 2. Please provide the medical diagnosis of the underlying condition for the student/household member. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ___________________ __________________________________________________________ ___________________ Signature of Health Care Provider Date Received by :________________________________________________ Date :______________________ Parent Considerations for Distance Learning Parents/guardians are asked to consider the following information when seeking full -time distance learning (DL) for their student: Students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning, which will be determined on a case -by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. If a full -time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face -to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the real -time synchronous sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs a ssistance, they should not interrupt a lesson . A student participating in full -time distance learning who qualifies for free and reduced lunch, may receive meals at the school at no cost. 14 Successful candidates for full -time distance learning have demonstra ted positive attendance and grades during the previous year of school. All full -time distance learning requests are subject to approval by the school leadership. Students will be expected to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real-time sessions during the school's instructional day. Some courses/classes may not be offered through full -time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Parents will assist students in planning a tim e schedule for long -term assignments. Make -up work is available to all students. Students are responsible for asking teachers for the make -up work upon returning to class. Students will receive credit for satisfactory make -up work, including tests, after a n absence, but may receive a zero for any make -up work, including tests, not made up within the allotted time. Any assignment not turned in within the allotted time falls within the late work guidelines. Exceptions may be granted by the teacher in extenuat ing circumstances. Covid -19 Positive & Close Contacts - Logistics Full-time in -person students who have tested positive for Covid -19 must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. Proof of a positive test should be provided to campus leadership . Contact tracing will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus. Full-time in -person students who have been identified as Covid -19 close contacts (from the school, SNHD, or personal connection for any case) must quarantine as dete rmined by their campus leadership. A student's quarantine can be for two weeks (most of the time) but can be longer dependi ng on different factors. School leadership will communicate the next steps for distance learning with families. Students are require d to follow all procedures as stated by their teachers and leadership. Students are expected to attend class every day. Students should let teachers and front office staff know if they will be absent. Teacher(s) will try to connect with the student daily. Students may return to school from their quarantine on the agreed upon date. If the student is not symptom -free at the end of their quarantine, the quarantine will be extended for the safety of everyone. Once symptom -free, they may return to in -person lear ning. Quarantined Students & Distance Learning We foresee there being two types of quarantines for full -time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. Individual/Limited number of Students 15 When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, stude nts will be placed in Distance Learning with their in -person teacher. I nstruction will be synchronous through Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. Attendance will be taken i n Infinite Campus. Full -Time Distance Learning Full-time distance learning will only take place for high -risk students whose exemption form has been approved, or for a student who need to be quarantined. The school will work to ensure continuity of services, including access to necessary technology and resources, special education and EL services, and nutrition services for students participating in distance education by following the protocols set forth in Directive 044 . Serving Special Populations in Distance Learning Assessments, MDT meetings, and IEP meetings that do not need to be conducted in -person will continue to take place virtually or by phone. If the school cannot contact the parent/guardian to schedule an IEP meeting, the school will follow standard procedures. IEP teams must include any data collected, including any deficit areas, behavioral data, the effectiveness of accommodations, etc. When on campus for an IEP -mandated procedure, the IEP should also incl ude input from parents/guardians regarding difficulties with the student's compliance with rules related to social distancing, wearing face coverings, washing hands, and other safety protocols. Goals, benchmarks and/or short -term objectives should be based on the current present levels of academic achievement and functional performance. Based on prior goals and benchmarks or objectives, the team should consider the student's anticipated progress for the remainder of the annual IEP. Staffing & Development fo r Distance Learning Mater Academy of Nevada will utilize licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes to be the instructors for distance education. Teachers will post the content and language objectives for each class. These teachers will create lessons a nd units through Colegia and other programs to assist with planning instruction. Teachers will be accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. 16 Teachers will provide any support to families during distance learning. Teachers will be able to direct families to the necessary resources in support of the student's learning; they will communicate to the student the nature of the outstanding work and the time limitation for completing the work. During teacher in -service week, teachers will be receiving professional development and training on distance learning, Covid -19 protocols, and working with families through this time. Student Attendance in Full -Time Distance Learning Each student par ticipating full -time in distance education will be contacted via electronic means or by telephone by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher at least once per instructional day. If a student's confirmed lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record attempted contact via other means (e.g., home visit) once per week and maintain a record of attempts. Staff will use a consistent method in Infin ite Campus for recording contact with students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through Infinite Campus/Google Classroom . Daily attendance may be s atisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physically present; and/or (2) The pupil makes progress in their classwork leading toward mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and/or a course's completion that can be verified through a learning ma nagement system or other means; and/or (3) The pupil participates in a real -time (synchronous) class session; and/or (4) The pupil meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who is able to discuss the pupil's progre ss in the course. Families may contact the main office of their campus if there is an attendance issue, such incorrectly marked absence. Ten consecutive unexcused absences with no contact will resul t in a withdrawal from CIVICA ACADEMY . 17 Social -Emotional Support The pandemic has affected the social -emotional wellbeing of many people, students included. Staff are encouraged to get to know their students and build trust and respect. Staff are trained to identify and report anything out of the ordinary. Stude nts have an open -door policy with all staff. When a student does need social -emotional support, it is critical that parents work in partnership with school staff to create an action plan. The goal is to cope, mitigate or solve the underlying issue that is affecting the student. By addressing trauma sensitively and thoughtfully, it will help heal the student holistically. Education Management System Infinite Campus will continue to be used as the Student Information System (SIS). It will be the primary sourc e of grading, attendance accounting and information distribution to students and families. Although the legal attendance requirement is 1 contact per student per week, the site is requiring teachers to take attendance daily . Primary Online Learning Platfo rm Google Classroom will be used by every teacher to relay classroom content and deliver classroom instruction. Each teacher will share their Google Classroom codes with administration through a Google Form to create a Master List so all staff c an access codes for any student or parent further streamlining the enrollment process. Teachers upload videos, assignments and related information for student use. In addition to Google Classroom, teachers will use iReady, and their online curriculums. Google Meet and Zoom are additional teleconference methods being used by teachers for classroom instruction. Student Materials, Technology, Supplies Distribution Chromebooks will be distributed to families at a time, date, and location, which will be communicated rig ht away to families. Additional supplies will also be distributed for select classes during this time. Academic Progress Tracking The Counseling Department created a Google Form for staff to report students who are disengaged or not showing progress in s pecific courses. The administration then reaches out and develops action plans for getting students back on track. 18 Staff Communication Grade level, department, and all staff zoom meetings are scheduled weekly as well as emergency staff meetings when ne cessary. Teachers are required to contact parents via emai l or See Saw as an additional means of communication with students and parents. Weekly PLC's and Staff Meetings will be held via Google Meet or Zoom. Principals will join weekly planning meetings sc heduled by the SPCSA and update their staff accordingly. A tech team has been established that allows teachers to reach out with any instructional technology questions they may have. Attendance Teachers will reach out to the families if the students do not check -in or turn in their assignments. After some attempts, if the issue continues, teachers will inform administrators. The administration will reach out to families whose child(ren) does not check -in by Wednesdays. Registrars enter attendance for the sc hool by the end of Friday for each week. Special Education Program The Special Education Department within CIVICA ACADEMY recognizes the unique needs, strengths, and challenges of each of its special education students and families. In our attempt to provi de the best -individualized plan of specialized instruction during this situation, we strive to consider factors that hinder inclusion, accessibility, and equity such as technology, family socio - economics, language and culture, and parental obligations outs ide of the home. Therefore, a multimodal approach to student and family support has been put into place. Initial Preparation All teachers, including special education teachers w ill be provided with an introductory training to online instruction that include s modes of communication and instruction, asynchronous vs synchronous instruction, preventing miscommunication within the virtual environment, and tips for online classroom managemen t. Primary Online Platforms Google Classroom Google Meet/Chat Zoom Colegia 19 iReady Springboard Wonders GoMath Amplify HMH (Social Studies) Practical Issues IT facilities and support - especially if running state -wide modules & work across parent/guardian schedules may require tutor flexibility Some functionality is impaired on mobile devices Institutional usernames and passwords to access all platforms Upkeep of system - maintaining links etc. Monitoring student engagement Requires a similar amount of t utor time Special Education Specific Progress Monitoring Systems Paraprofessionals and Supports Virtual and Related Services and Coordination A Dedicated Special Education Person to Monitor Student Progress & Report to Team Related Service Providers Related Services Related Service providers will continue to provide related services using online learning platforms, for the seamless continuation of face to face service delivery, when the student and parent have access to the required technology. For pa rents who do not have the required technology for electronic service provision, related service providers will make weekly contact with the parent to offer continued support such a recommended strategy to implement at home, connecting parents to helpful re sources, and gathering information which may be beneficial for the case manager and/or special education staff to know in order to support the student in their virtual classroom environment through modification and accommodations. Related Service Providers will maintain a weekly log of services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made. Further, qualitative information will be included to alert CIVICA ACADEMY special education administration to ongoing concerns or themes which need support. A special education administrative staff with CIVICA ACADEMY will collect weekly records of communication between the related service providers, students, and parents, and determine areas that need further support, based on the data. 20 Special Education Teacher Each special education teacher will provide pull out service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, Google Classroom, supplemental online options, and progress monitoring to ensure work towards IEP goals . Special Education teac hers will be available f rom 8:00 am - 3:00 pm Monday to Friday. Each teacher will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar classroom. This schedule will be communicated individually with parents/guardians and s tudents. A flexible option will also be available. Special education teachers will monitor student progress, attendance, and assignment completion. Special education teachers will maintain a weekly log of services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made. Further, qualitative information will be included to alert CIVICA ACADEMY special education administration to ongoing concerns or themes which need support. A special education administrative staff with CIVICA ACADEMY will collect weekly records of communication between the related service providers, students, and parents, and determine areas that need further support, based on the data. Paraprofessionals Paraprofessionals and their assigned case managers will be in contact throughout the week, in order to plan and provide the support required for the student and their family to meet the week's objectives. An initial learning objective will be established for each new week, as co -designed by the case manager, st udent, and parent. This learning objective will be communicated with the paraprofessionals, who with the case manager, will develop a plan of action on how to measurably support the student within and outside of special education instruction, to include pr eparation of materials, modifying assignments, pre and reteaching, and the electronic dissemination and collection of materials. Each paraprofessional will provide push -in service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, monitoring and a ssisting with general education Google classrooms, student support, and supplemental online options. Paraprofessionals will b e available from 8:00 am - 3:00 pm Monday to Friday. Each paraprofessional will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar school. This schedule will be communicated individually by both the paraprofessional and special education teacher to parents/guardians and students. A flexible option will also be available. Instruction Special education support services are p rovided by both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Online learning platforms in use include Google Classroom and Zoom. Other methods of instruction and communication include Skype, FaceTime, email, and telephone. Teachers and support staff are required to be available between the hours of 7:30 am-3:30 pm during the school day, and as otherwise scheduled by the parent and teacher. Direct instruction is provided to address the previously designated areas of eligibility, as well as the support provided thro ugh push -in services, the modification of general education assignments, and ongoing accommodations. Special education teachers are in weekly contact with the general education classroom teachers to provide continued collaboration and planning. 21 Parent/Guar dian Communication Parents will be individually contacted by their case managers or a campus -based special education representative with a cursory description of what to expect over the coming weeks, the opportunity to schedule a phone call for Q&A, and me thods by which parents could contact their campus support person. Additionally, parents were further queried as to their digital savvy and accessibility. Progress Monitoring The CIVICA ACADEMY special education administrative staff will be designated as the individual responsible for collecting weekly progress monitoring, comparing the data against the student's goals, and ensuring that intervention decision making reflects the needs based on the data. This individual will also provide any necessary profe ssional development, coaching, or other support to teachers and buildings, with best practices for designing effective and efficient progress monitoring tools within the virtual learning environment. Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) All annual IEP meetings will be held using GoToMeeting and scheduled by the case manager. Each family will have the option to sign electronic permission to share documentation if they would like documents shared via email. All required documentation will be sent via US P ostal Service. Student -Specific Decision Making Parents will be contacted weekly to determine student -specific needs. An IEP team meeting will be scheduled for any discussion impacting the IEP or change in services or placement. Based on student and parent needs, strengths, and accessibility, examples of instruction may include: *Asynchronous Zoom session between staff, parent, and student, whereby a specific skill is targeted and remediated through evidenced -based activities, such as phonological awareness exercises that target rhyming, blending, and so forth. *An individual activity in which the parent can supervise the student in independently completing several worksheets in a skill area in which the student was close to the target. *Hands -on materials, created by school staff or by parents in coordination with school staff, whereby the student can exercise practicing a new skill in math or sentence construction with parents submitting photos of the finished product.

Guidelines for Parents Supporting Distance Learning CIVICA ACADEMY will share guidelines and tips with parents. An example list of recommendations is given here. Provide support for your children by adhering to following guidelines: 1. Follow instructions from the s chool. Review A Parent's Guide t o Google Classroom document shared with you. 2. Establish routines and expectations 3. Take an active role in helping your student process and own their learning 24 4. Encourage physical activity and/or exercise 5. Monitor how much time student is spending online 6. Monitor student's social media use, especially during school closure. 7. Cyberbullying: the use of electronic communication to bully a person including sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. What should you do if you're being bullied? Do not respond to harassment or threats --this may encourage the bully. Keep a record of messages received (print or take screenshots). Reach out to parents, teachers, counselors, and school administrators. Block communication from the bully (if possible). Do not participate in cyberbullying (even in response to a bully ). Ask for help if you are being cyberbullied. Stand up if you see somebody being cyberbullied Technology Access If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year, families are encouraged to contact their teacher. Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year. Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus (at leadership's discretion). Student/Family Communic ation Students are required to check in with their teachers each day. Whether through email, a phone call, or (video) messaging through a learning management system and/or Zoom, it will count as an interaction for the day. A teacher will schedule one or mo re conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the student is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is presenting some problem to the teacher, or in any other case that the teacher considers necessary. If a student has not communicated with a staff member for 5 days in a row, a home visit will take place. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, campus leadership, the teacher and the community outreach coordinator will work together to provide resources. 25 Nutrition Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school For virtual students to receive their lunch, the stu dent and/or a family member will need to visit the campus in -person during a designated lunch period set by the campus administration. The school will then provide a lunch meal. Mask & Visitation Policy Distance learning students and their family members a re required to wear masks when visiting their campus at all times. This is for the safety of the students and their families. IEP students are allowed to be on campuses if it is determined that they need services that can only be performed in -person. Emer gency School Closure Learning Plan CIVICA ACADEMY recognizes that there may be emergency situations that shut down a campus for an extended period of time. Examples of emergency situations could include, but not limited to, a pandemic, a facility issue, o r a natural disaster. In the case of a school wide shut down due to an outbreak, CIVICA ACADEMY will transition smoothly to a full virtual teaching model through the use of our technology at our disposal. Teachers will use the technology purchased to prov ide the best education possible if students are at home. Students will access their online curriculums in order to continue their education. Additional Outreach Emails will be sent weekly with details providing drive -through lunch options for students.

In the program, schools have to provide details on their distance learning plan for full-time distance learning students for the 2021-2022 school year. There has to be key information included, such as how students were approved for distance learning, what the learning model will look like, and how attendance will be taken. The State Public Charter School Authority requested more information from schools, such as what schools are doing to ensure health and safety for all, what a school's in-person learning will look like, and what steps schools are taking to support students and staff with their social and emotional wellbeing. The 2021 Legislative Session produced Senate Bill 215. Schools are required to develop a distance education plan in the event of an emergency that may cause a school closure of at least 10 days. This way schools are more prepared to tackle any sudden closures, similar to what was experienced in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. In an effort to streamline all of the requested information, the State Public Charter School Authority has requested that schools submit a 2021-2022 reopening plan. In it, there are three key requirements: Requirement A: Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID-19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn. Requirement B: Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Distance Education Plans for the 2021-22 school year. This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Requirement C: Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community, parents and school employees. This plan 1 Section 8 of Emergency Directive 044 2 establishes an emergency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emergency. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 5Safe Reopening for In-Person Learning CASLV recognizes that the health and safety of students and staff is of the utmost importance. CASLV will seek data, guidance, recommendations, and/or approval from the Southern Nevada Health District, the Center for Disease Control, the Nevada Department of Education, and the Nevada Governor's Office. CASLV will continually work with its families, staff, leadership and Board to implement Covid-19 mitigation protocols that are the safest for its in-person students and staff at any point in time. Ultimately, CASLV will use all available scientific information to help make a determination on these matters. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette CASLV will continue to promote proper personal hygiene: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Keep 6 feet of physical distance from others Avoid contact with others if within 6 feet Wear a cloth face mask covering in public Avoid traveling if you are sick Stay home if you are feeling ill Get medical care as needed Each campus will have an abundance of signage promoting positive physical hygiene. For example, each restroom mirror will have a sticker reminding students to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds. These visual cues will be incredibly helpful, especially for visual learners. In the event that a student may not be implementing safe and healthy hygiene practices, staff will re-educate the student and inform the student's parents. Diagnostic and Screening Testing Staff and students will self-screen their physical health. If any staff member or student is not feeling well and having any symptoms, that person will need to stay at home. They should only return to school when there are no remaining symptoms. If a student or staff member chooses to go to school while ill (no matter the illness), they will not be allowed in the classroom. For students, the parent will be contacted to take the student home and will not be allowed to return until they are symptom-free. For staff, they cannot return until they are symptom-free. In the event that a student or a staff member feels ill during the school day, they will be removed from the classroom. They will be asked relevant questions pertaining to their health and Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 6assessed by a staff member with a touchless thermometer. If it is determined that the student needs to be sent home, a parent will be contacted and their belongings will be gathered from the classroom for them. If it is determined that the staff member needs to be sent home, another staff member will cover their classroom/classes for the remainder of the day. They cannot return until they are symptom-free. A list of symptoms will be gathered from public health organizations. Each campus will have touchless thermometers and will be used at the discretion of school staff. Spaces will be created in our campuses for temporary isolation. If a student or staff member is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease, the person will be required to self-quarantine, and the Southern Nevada Health District will be contacted. CASLV will work in consultation with medical and public health experts, the State Public Charter School Authority, and the Nevada Department of Education to determine the extent of testing in the school and if a closure is necessary. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities CASLV will make multiple adjustments to each campus' facilities to minimize the risk of COVID-19. Hand sanitizer pumps will be placed on walls in various locations throughout the campus. There is an increase in signage enforcing social distancing and healthy personal hygiene in hallways and classrooms. There are visual cues on the floor showing where to stand, wait, and move. There are decals in restrooms reminding individuals to wash their hands. Occupancy capacity signs are placed in each classroom. Desks will be arranged to be socially distanced. Desks will be marked to show which ones are assigned to which students. Students will remain in their seats at all times. Furniture that is difficult to clean will not be utilized or replaced. All air filters will be monitored and replaced as needed. HVAC vendors have serviced each campus' HVAC system more frequently in the past 12 months. All shared items, such as athletic balls, will be cleaned accordingly There will be limited use of the water fountain. Students and staff will be encouraged to bring their own water bottles Technology will be assigned to students as needed/requested All emergency plans will be adjusted to accommodate social distancing guidelines while maintaining the necessary safety, urgency and precaution At each campus, staff will check the cleanliness of the campus to ensure a safe and health environment. All restrooms will be monitored regularly throughout the day to ensure cleanliness. High touch points, such as water fountains, sink heads, door knobs, and student desks, will be cleaned regularly by CASLV staff. Shared materials will be limited as much as possible, and they will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 7Each night, there will be daily detailed cleaning of facilities from Commercial Cleaning Services. The same vendor will perform a thorough deep sanitizing cleaning of each campus on Wednesday and Friday night. Commercial Cleaning Services uses these chemicals for sanitizing: Tribase Multipurpose Cleaner Biorenewables Glass Cleaner HDQC-2 Neutral Disinfectant Cleaner SparCreme Liquid Creme Cleanser In the event of a pandemic scare or a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, each school has been equipped with an electrostatic sprayer that will disinfectant on contact when used. After this has been used in a space, that area will be disinfected and suitable for occupancy. Face Coverings Our campuses will have masks readily available for anyone who wants it. Ultimately, CASLV will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA for guidelines requiring face coverings. If face coverings become mandated for whatever reason, CASLV will ensure that anyone stepping onto campus has a face covering on. Some of our students may not be able to wear a mask or face covering due to medical reasons. A doctor's note must be provided by a medical physician on their letterhead. IEP/504 students may not be required to wear masks based on individual needs. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staff that has tested positive for Covid-19, principals conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in closed contact with the positive individual. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes. The principal will connect with the Director of Operations. The principal will share the names of close contacts, their contact information, and parent information if the close contact is a student. From there, the Director will contact the Southern Nevada Health District. At that point in time, the length of quarantine will be determined. The Director will share that information with the principal. The principal will message the appropriate families. Social Distancing & Capacity CASLV will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA when it comes to social distancing requirements and room capacity limits. CASLV has measured each of its classrooms. It knows the full capacity limit and can adjust accordingly to any percentage. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 8Accommodations for Children with Disabilities If students and staff have one of the disability types listed below, they might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness CASLV will work with families of children with disabilities to see if in-person learning is the best option. If it is, then campus leadership will work with each family to develop an action plan that is both academically enriching and safe and healthy. Vaccination Access & Awareness CASLV has and will continue to strongly encourage students, families and staff members to get their vaccinations if they are of age and health abides. CASLV campuses will promote local vaccination sites to its staff and families. Traveling Abroad A quarantine may be required if a student/staff member has returned from traveling to an international COVID-19 hotspot, as determined by school leadership. There will be an exception for families that had work-related military job duty responsibilities. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing Being in the midst of a pandemic can bring a whirlwind of feelings within oneself. In any organization, it is critical for itself to make sure that the needs of its people are met. When it comes to students, those needs most likely also include socioemotional needs and the trauma that can be triggered by a pandemic. For CASLV, the wellbeing and mental health of staff and students are of the utmost importance. Supporting Students: Social-Emotional Learning - Tier 1 CASLV will utilize multiple tier 1 social emotional support for its students across all campuses. These supports include: School-wide expectations and procedures Systematic reinforcements Culturally responsive practices Data-based decision making Partner & Community partnerships Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 9 Journal writing Art activities Classroom meetings Mindfulness practices Monthly School Challenges: Coping Skills, Self Esteem, Empathy, Kindness, Friendship, Conflict Resolution, etc. Supporting Students: Trauma-Informed Practices - Tier 2-3 CASLV will provide ongoing support to staff, students and families for their social and emotional needs. CASLV will proactively encourage every person on campus to talk with people they trust about their feelings and concerns. CASLV leadership will work to build strong relationships with staff, students, and families. It will be important for CASLV to consider educators who have experienced hardships during this time due to health concerns, personal losses and other factors. For students, it will be important for staff to recognize which students have more significant needs that require a more immediate response, as well as students who have emerging symptoms that require monitoring over time. CASLV has to work and make decisions with these social emotional needs in mind. Universally, CASLV will use these tier 1 trauma-informed practices & interventions for its campuses: Learning positive self-talk Weekly reflection meetings Practice problem solving skills Creating a \"calm down toolkit\" Anxiety/grief support groups For more targeted and intensive support, CASLV will use these tier 2 & tier 3 interventions: One-on-one weekly meetings between student and counselor Virtual home visit between student and counselor Behavior contract Restorative justice Use of empathy in multiple forms Supporting Educators and Staff CASLV supports the mental health and wellbeing of its educators and staff. They are the driving force behind the success of the students and the campuses. CASLV will focus on three main bedrocks in helping teachers. 1. Foster wellness . CASLV has and will continue to educate staff about mental health and encourage open conversation about the challenges people are experiencing, employees may be more likely to access care when needed. CASLV will reach out to a wellness provider to consider hosting virtual mindfulness or discussion sessions. CASLV will promote the importance of healthy sleep. CASLV will encourage staff to Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 10serve as valuable resources to one another by sharing strategies for coping with the pandemic. 2. Provide training . CASLV acknowledges that staff members may have different levels of ability with using virtual platforms and new learning technologies. CASLV has been and will continue to offer training and technical support for new job demands. This may help to reduce stress. 3. Model healthy behavior: CASLV will encourage all school leaders to take care of their own physical, social, and psychological needs. By doing so, they serve as role models and set the tone that it is acceptable and necessary to take care of oneself. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning CASLV is well aware of the potential negative effect of the school closures and the distance learning program with limited hours of instruction provided to students since March 2020. Therefore, we are excited to be able to resume offering a full-day in person / traditional learning program starting in August 2021. Implementing Assessments CASLV will begin the school year with a comprehensive plan to diagnose and identify student needs. CASLV will use every tool available to identify student needs and the learning gaps. Some of these tools include but are not limited to Brigance Screener for Kindergarten, NWEA MAP Fall assessment, classroom level benchmark assessments, and hearing & vision screenings. Pairing Data with Instruction The teachers will look at the beginning of the year data during the Student Success Team (SST) meetings and prepare a comprehensive plan to meet the student needs. Schools will make the intervention groups during the first SST meeting by the beginning of September. Tutoring and intervention services will be provided during the school day and after school time. CASLV will utilize a wide range of programs to accelerate learning and close the achievement gap. Some of the intervention programs include but are not limited to Coach Digital, Red Bird, ALEKS, and MasteryConnect. In-Person Learning & Special Populations Special populations such as SPED, EL, and immigrant students will continue to receive services from licensed teachers. These groups will be identified and services will be provided in accordance with the Nevada State and Federal requirements and guidelines. Students will be served in their own groups and grant funds and other funds will be used solely to service these students. In addition, CASLV will offer a Saturday school starting with the beginning of the 2nd semester. Saturday school will be offered to identified intervention students at no cost. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 11Path Forward Program: Distance Learning Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas (CASLV) has created a distance learning plan for the 2021-2022 school year. CASLV recognizes that there may be families that need to keep learning in a virtual environment. The distance learning plan is specifically designed for students: With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in-person learning, as determined by a medical health professional Who tested positive for Covid-19 Identified as close contacts of Covid-19 Affected by school closures and/or tightening government health protocols CASLV is dedicated to maintaining high expectations and strong academic achievement for all students, whether full-time in-person or full-time distance learning. High-Risk Medical Exemption Process If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high-risk medical condition*, a Medical Certification for COVID-19 High Risk Exemption Form (provided in the next section) may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021-2022 school year. This was sent out to all families on June 18, 2021, with all returning and newly-accepted students enrolled. A health care medical professional must complete the exemption form and email it to CASLV by July 9, 2021. CASLV will review the form, and either approve or deny. The medical exemption form is attached. After July 9, 2021, if any student gets off the waitlist and enrolls at any of our campuses, the registrar will provide the family with a medical exemption form. They will complete it and return it to the campus as soon as possible. In the event that getting a physician's wet signature is not possible (due to moving from a different region or other similar circumstances), a letter from the physician on letterhead will suffice. Students who are out on a high-risk medical exemption may not participate in any in-person learning, face-to-face extracurricular or on-campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID-19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. There may be times, like for important assessments, where students may need to be on campus. During these times, a safe, socially-distanced environment will be set up for the students to be in. Every person will wear a mask in these environments. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 12Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning at the end of first semester - which will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. During the school year, if public health conditions worsen and/or students develop certain health conditions that may qualify for a high-risk medical exemption, families can reach out to school leadership to discuss joining full-time distance learning.

If a full-time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face-to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the real-time synchronous sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs assistance, they should not interrupt a lesson A student participating in full-time distance learning who qualifies for free and reduced lunch, may receive meals at the school at no cost. Successful candidates for full-time distance learning have demonstrated positive attendance and grades during the previous year of school. All full-time distance learning requests are subject to approval by the school leadership. Students will be expected to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real-time sessions during the school's instructional day. Kindergarten - 2nd grade will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions daily. 3rd - 5th grade will have a minimum of 90-120 minutes of real-time sessions daily. Middle and High School will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions per week per course. Full-time distance education elementary students must have an adult at home readily available to support their learning. Students will be required to attend school face-to-face for designated activities and assessments. Some courses/classes may not be offered through full-time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Parents will assist students in planning a time schedule for long-term assignments. Make-up work is available to all students. Students are responsible for asking teachers for the make-up work upon returning to class. Students will receive credit for satisfactory make-up work, including tests, after an absence, but may receive a zero for any make-up work, including tests, not made up within the allotted time. Any assignment not turned in within the allotted time falls within the late work guidelines. Exceptions may be granted by the teacher in extenuating circumstances. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 16Full-Time Distance Learning Full-time distance learning will only take place for high-risk students whose exemption form has been approved. Once eligible for the Distance Learning (DL) program, students will be assigned to the class of the dedicated DL program teacher(s) /substitute teacher(s). The school will make a schedule based on the number of DL eligible students from each grade level. The schedule may need to be revised/revisited throughout the year. Kindergarten - 2nd grade will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions daily. 3rd - 5th grade will have a minimum of 90-120 minutes of real-time sessions daily. Middle and high school will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions per week per course. Teachers will regularly review and revise the curriculum to reflect real-world needs, depth and complexity, rigor and relevance, and meeting all students' needs. Classwork is any instructional activity defined/planned by the teacher to be completed during a class period to facilitate the learning process. There could be occasions where classwork becomes homework. Students will have access to Canvas, Clever, and other DL instruction programs and resources. Students will be provided a Chromebook to take home. Students will also be provided internet service if need be. Students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in-person teacher if the entire class goes under quarantine. All work/activities will be accessed via Canvas, and instruction will take place via Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. Teachers will make at least one entry per week for each subject in the Infinite Campus Gradebook. The DL teacher will communicate with families each day via email, video conferencing, or phone calls. The communication will be documented in Infinite Campus or via a spreadsheet. Suppose a student cannot be accessed via phone, video conferencing, or email. In that case, the dedicated DL teacher will need to find other ways of interacting with the family and record all communication and details. Covid-19 Positive & Close Contacts - Logistics Full-time in-person students who have tested positive for Covid-19 must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. P r o o f o f a p o s i t i v e t e s t s h o u l d b e p r o v i d e d t o c a m p u s l e a d e r s h i p . Contact tracing will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus. Full-time in-person students who have been identified as Covid-19 close contacts (from the school, SNHD, or personal connection for any case) must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. A student's quarantine can be for two weeks (most of the time) but can be Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 17longer depending on different factors. During a student's quarantine, a Chromebook will be provided if needed. School leadership will communicate the next steps for distance learning with families. Students are required to follow all procedures as stated by their teachers and leadership. Students are expected to attend class every day. Students should let teachers and front office staff know if they will be absent. Teacher(s) will try to connect with the student daily. Students may return to school from their quarantine on the agreed upon date. If the student is not symptom-free at the end of their quarantine, the quarantine will be extended for the safety of everyone. Once symptom-free, they may return to in-person learning. Quarantined Students & Distance Learning We foresee there being two types of quarantines for full-time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. Individual/Limited number of Students When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in-person teacher. All work/activities will be accessed via Canvas, and instruction will be synchronous through Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. When only a limited number of students need to be quarantined, students will be assigned to the dedicated DL teacher's classroom. Attendance will be taken in Infinite Campus. All assignments will be turned in via Canvas. We have great experience in using this learning model during the 4th quarter of the 2019-2020 school year and entire 2020-2021 school year. We also have had to quarantine classrooms regularly during the 2020-2021 school year. Transitioning due to Public Health Conditions Worsening public health conditions can affect the learning model that is implemented. If the Southern Nevada Health District, Center for Disease Control, and/or the Nevada Department of Education enforce new directives, we will make those changes as necessary. It will be a smooth transition for us due to our experience, and we are equipped to adapt to the changes. The past 15 months have shown that we are capable of supporting students with the necessary technology, communicating with families effectively, and providing high-quality instruction to students. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 18We made a shift from in-person learning to full-time distance learning when schools were closed in March 2020. That occurred on a weekend. The next school day, live instruction was taking place online. This is because we prepared our staff and students for what we saw coming. When conditions were improving, we were one of the first schools to bring back students in-person through a hybrid model. By the start of the second quarter, we were managing AM/PM/full-distance cohorts at all of our campuses. It went smoothly because of the training that staff received and the communication between the students, families and the school. Through both models, our campuses implemented strict health and cleaning policies for staff, students and visitors to our campuses. We abided by any social distancing measures in the hallways and in classrooms. We provided nutrition meals during that time as well. If we are mandated to switch learning models during the 2021-2022 school year, our schools and staff members will be ready. If we are forced to shift the learning model abruptly, we will be ready to make that change immediately. Serving Special Populations in Distance Learning The distance learning program will provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plan. Special education teachers will meet virtually with students as needed to meet the mandated number of instructional minutes. School staff will consider alternative ways to provide equitable access and appropriate educational opportunities for students with disabilities, including exploring all available supplementary aids and services and related services to include online or virtual platforms, and/or other activities, such as paper/pencil activities. Documentation of all efforts to provide equitable access to educational opportunities is required. Special education teachers must document that the student is receiving his/her specially designed instruction through the approved instructional model on the status record. Related service providers must continue to follow current procedures to document services provided. Assessments, MDT meetings, and IEP meetings that do not need to be conducted in-person will continue to take place virtually or by phone. If the school cannot contact the parent/guardian to schedule an IEP meeting, the school will follow standard procedures. IEP teams must include any data collected, including any deficit areas, behavioral data, the effectiveness of accommodations, etc. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 19A case manager or related service provider must provide how instruction is scaffolded or the background knowledge needed for the student to complete the assignments aligned to the Nevada Pre-K Standards or the NVACS/Connectors and goals and benchmarks/objectives. A case manager or related service provider must also review and address student work and/or finished assignments, checking for understanding and accuracy, adapting content, methodology, and/or instruction to the needs of the student. When on campus for an IEP-mandated procedure, the IEP should also include input from parents/guardians regarding difficulties with the student's compliance with rules related to social distancing, wearing face coverings, washing hands, and other safety protocols. Goals, benchmarks and/or short-term objectives should be based on the current present levels of academic achievement and functional performance. Based on prior goals and benchmarks or objectives, the team should consider the student's anticipated progress for the remainder of the annual IEP. Staffing & Development for Distance Learning CASLV will utilize licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes to be the instructors for distance education. Teachers will post the content and language objectives for each class. These teachers will create lessons and units through Canvas, Pathfinder, Edgenuity, and other programs to assist with planning instruction. Teachers will be accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. Teachers will provide any support to families during distance learning. Teachers will be able to direct families to the necessary resources in support of the student's learning; they will communicate to the student the nature of the outstanding work and the time limitation for completing the work. During teacher in-service week, teachers will be receiving professional development and training on distance learning, Covid-19 protocols, and working with families through this time. Student Attendance in Full-Time Distance Learning Each student participating full-time in distance education will be contacted via electronic means or by telephone by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher at least once per instructional day. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 20If a student's confirmed lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record attempted contact via other means (e.g., home visit) once per week and maintain a record of attempts. Staff will use a consistent method in Infinite Campus for recording contact with students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through Canvas. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physically present; and/or (2) The pupil makes progress in their classwork leading toward mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and/or a course's completion that can be verified through a learning management system or other means; and/or (3) The pupil participates in a real-time (synchronous) class session; and/or (4) The pupil meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who is able to discuss the pupil's progress in the course. Families may contact the main office of their campus if there is an attendance issue, such incorrectly marked absence. Ten consecutive unexcused absences with no contact will result in a withdrawal from the CASLV. Technology Access For any students without access to such technology, school leadership will work with families to ensure technology is accessible. Families will have to complete a form to borrow the technology for the school year. If approved, students will be provided with a hotspot and a Chromebook at no cost to the family. Parents of DL students will be able to set up their Canvas Parent accounts at the beginning of the year and monitor their student's progress and see all upcoming assignments, tests, and due dates throughout the school year. Families will receive training by a CASLV staff member on how to use the technology if needed. If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year, families are encouraged to contact their teacher. Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year. Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus (at leadership's discretion). If there are greater issues in technology (i.e., internet service provider shutdown, blackout, etc.), distance learning can be done through paper correspondence. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 21Student/Family Communication Students are required to check in with their teachers each day. Whether through email, a phone call, or (video) messaging through a learning management system and/or Zoom, it will count as an interaction for the day. A teacher will schedule one or more conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the student is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is presenting some problem to the teacher, or in any other case that the teacher considers necessary. This conference may be requested by indicating so on the eight-week progress report. Such conferences may be handled by telephone, in person, or via written communication If families and/or students call teachers, it has to be a viable conversation about academics to count as a present attendance mark. If not answered, a voicemail message should be recorded. A teacher will respond within 24 hours. If a student emails a teacher, the teacher will respond within 24 hours. Email communication sent on Fridays after 12:00 p.m. should expect a response by close of business on the non-holiday business day. If a student has not communicated with a staff member for 5 days in a row, a home visit will take place. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, campus leadership, the teacher and the community outreach coordinator will work together to provide resources. Nutrition Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school. CASLV only serves lunch to K-12 students at its campuses. For virtual students to receive their lunch, the student and/or a family member will need to visit the campus in-person during a designated lunch period set by the campus administration. The school will then provide a lunch meal. A lunch meal will be not provided to anyone arriving before or after their designated lunch period, unless at the discretion of school administration. Important Note: The student and/or family member will be required to wear a mask and be socially distanced. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 22Social-Emotional Support The pandemic has affected the social-emotional wellbeing of many people, students included. Staff are encouraged to get to know their students and build trust and respect. Staff are trained to identify and report anything out of the ordinary. Students have an open-door policy with all staff. When a student does need social-emotional support, it is critical that parents work in partnership with school staff to create an action plan. The goal is to cope, mitigate or solve the underlying issue that is affecting the student. By addressing trauma sensitively and thoughtfully, it will help heal the student holistically. Mask & Visitation Policy Distance learning students and their family members are required to wear masks when visiting their campus at all times. This is for the safety of the students and their families. Distance learning students and their families may only stay in the main office area. For them to move through the campus, they must be given permission from school leadership. IEP students are allowed to be on campuses if it is determined that they need services that can only be performed in-person. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 23Emergency School Closure Learning Plan CASLV recognizes that there may be emergency situations that shut down a campus for an extended period of time. Examples of emergency situations could include, but not limited to, a pandemic, a facility issue, or a natural disaster. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas (CASLV) is committed to providing high-quality STEM education to its students and has developed this emergency school closure learning plan. This plan will be made available to all staff, families, and students. This plan will succeed in delivering instruction online to meet students' elective and general education requirements. The purpose of this plan is to empower and prepare students for success by enabling them to access quality online instruction. This plan will act as a guide to improve learning and enhance student success. It is also aimed to fulfill all applicable rules, regulations, and policies stipulated by the Nevada Department of Education and the US federal government. CASLV will continue to use email, Google GSuite and the school website for normal communications with parents, students, and teachers. This plan is developed for at least 10 consecutive days of implementation. Education Management System Infinite Campus will continue to be used as the Student Information System (SIS). It will be the primary source of grading, attendance accounting and information distribution to students and families. Although the legal attendance requirement is 1 contact per student per week, the site is requiring teachers to take attendance daily on a Google Sheet to address \"absent\" students on an ongoing basis. Teachers are required to enter grades at least one time per week. Primary Online Learning Platform Google Classroom will be used by every teacher to relay classroom content and deliver classroom instruction. Each teacher shared their Google Classroom codes with administration through a Google Form to create a Master List so all staff could access codes for any student or parent further streamlining the enrollment process. Teachers upload videos, assignments and related information for student use. In addition to Google Classroom, teachers will continue to use IXL, Aleks, Moodle, MobyMax, Khan Academy StudySync and various Computer Science (Learning.com, CodeHS, Edhesive) and Art software that was previously implemented for classroom use. Google Meet and Zoom are additional teleconference methods being used by teachers for classroom instruction. Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 24Student Materials, Technology, Supplies Distribution A student survey will be delivered to families to determine technology needs at the start of each school year. Chromebooks will then be distributed to families at a time, date, and location, which will be communicated right away to families. Additional supplies will also be distributed for select classes during this time, such as AP Art Laptops and Art supplies. Additional Outreach Emails will be sent weekly with details to local school sites providing drive-through lunch options for students. CASLV will work with its vendor to deliver types of meals (hot, cold, etc.) that best serves its students during that time. Academic Progress Tracking The Counseling Department created a Google Form for staff to report students who are disengaged or not showing progress in specific courses. The administration then reaches out and develops action plans for getting students back on track. Staff Communication The administration has created Google Hangout departments and grade level chat groups for specialized administration and colleague support. Grade level, department, and all staff zoom meetings are scheduled weekly as well as emergency staff meetings when necessary. How-to videos for curriculum, lesson planning, Google Classroom, grading, and other web-based programming are provided or created as needs are expressed by teachers. Leaders are included as teachers on all Google Classrooms to aid in student learning when needed. Teachers are required to contact parents via email or Google Voice phone number as an additional means of communication with students and parents. Weekly Department and Staff Meetings are held via Google Meet or Zoom. Principals will join weekly planning meetings scheduled by the Central Office and SPCSA and update their staff accordingly. A tech team has been established that allows teachers to reach out with any instructional technology questions they may have. Attendance The Administrative team created attendance tracking sheets where teachers enter attendance as they interact with students. Initially, teachers will reach out to the families if the students do not check-in or turn in their assignments. After some attempts, if the issue continues, teachers will inform administrators. The administration will reach out to families whose child(ren) does not Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 25check-in by Wednesdays. Registrars enter attendance for the school by the end of Friday for each week and submit a detailed list to the Head Registrar for further reporting. Special Education Program The Special Education Department within Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas recognizes the unique needs, strengths, and challenges of each of its special education students and families. In our attempt to provide the best-individualized plan of specialized instruction during this situation, we strive to consider factors that hinder inclusion, accessibility, and equity such as technology, family socio-economics, language and culture, and parental obligations outside of the home. Therefore, a multimodal approach to student and family support has been put into place. Initial Preparation Prior to the transition to online instruction, in anticipation of the need to fully move to online instruction, all special education teachers were provided with an introductory training to online instruction that included modes of communication and instruction, asynchronous vs synchronous instruction, preventing miscommunication within the virtual environment, and tips for online classroom management. Primary Online Platforms Google Classroom Google Meet/Chat IXL Moodle Study Sync Aleks Site-specific supplemental platforms Practical Issues IT facilities and support - especially if running state-wide modules & work across parent/guardian schedules may require tutor flexibility Some functionality is impaired on mobile devices Institutional usernames and passwords to access all platforms Upkeep of system - maintaining links etc. Monitoring student engagement Requires a similar amount of tutor time Special Education Specific Progress Monitoring Systems Paraprofessionals and Supports Virtual and Related Services and Coordination Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 26 A Dedicated Special Education Person to Monitor Student Progress & Report to Team Related Service Providers Related Services Related Service providers will continue to provide related services using online learning platforms, for the seamless continuation of face to face service delivery, when the student and parent have access to the required technology. For parents who do not have the required technology for electronic service provision, related service providers will make weekly contact with the parent to offer continued support such a recommended strategies to implement at home, connecting parents to helpful resources, and gathering information which may be beneficial for the case manager and/or special education staff to know in order to support the student in their virtual classroom environment through modification and accommodations. Related Service Providers will maintain a weekly log of services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made. Further, qualitative information will be included to alert CASLV special education administration to ongoing concerns or themes which need support. A special education administrative staff with CASLV will collect weekly records of communication between the related service providers, students, and parents, and determine areas that need further support, based on the data. Special Education Teacher Each special education teacher will provide pull out service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, Google classroom, supplemental online options, and progress monitoring to ensure work towards IEP goals. Special Education teachers will be available form 9:00 am - 3:00 pm Monday to Friday. Each teacher will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar classroom. This schedule will be communicated individually with parents/guardians and students. A flexible option will also be available. Special education teachers will monitor student progress, attendance, and assignment completion. Special education teachers will maintain a weekly log of services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made. Further, qualitative information will be included to alert CASLV special education administration to ongoing concerns or themes which need support. A special education administrative staff with CASLV will collect weekly records of communication between the related service providers, students, and parents, and determine areas that need further support, based on the data. Paraprofessionals Paraprofessionals and their assigned case managers will be in contact throughout the week, in order to plan and provide the support required for the student and their family to meet the week's objectives. An initial learning objective will be established for each new week, as co-designed by the case manager, student, and parent. This learning objective will be communicated with the paraprofessionals, who with the case manager, will develop a plan of Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 27action on how to measurably support the student within and outside of special education instruction, to include preparation of materials, modifying assignments, pre and reteaching, and the electronic dissemination and collection of materials. Each paraprofessional will provide push-in service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, monitoring and assisting with general education Google classrooms, student support, and supplemental online options. Paraprofessionals will be available from 9:00 am - 3:00 pm Monday to Friday. Each paraprofessional will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar school. This schedule will be communicated individually by both the paraprofessional and special education teacher to parents/guardians and students. A flexible option will also be available. Instruction Special education support services are provided by both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Online learning platforms in use include Google Classroom and Zoom. Other methods of instruction and communication include Skype, FaceTime, email, and telephone. Teachers and support staff are required to be available between the hours of 9 am-3 pm during the school day, and as otherwise scheduled by the parent and teacher. Direct instruction is provided to address the previously designated areas of eligibility, as well as the support provided through push-in services, the modification of general education assignments, and ongoing accommodations. Special education teachers are in weekly contact with the general education classroom teachers to provide continued collaboration and planning. Parent/Guardian Communication Parents were individually contacted by their case managers or a campus-based special education representative with a cursory description of what to expect over the coming weeks, the opportunity to schedule a phone call for Q&A, and methods by which parents could contact their campus support person. Additionally, parents were further queried as to their digital savvy and accessibility. Progress Monitoring The CASLV special education administrative staff will be designated as the individual responsible for collecting weekly progress monitoring, comparing the data against the student's goals, and ensuring that intervention decision making reflects the needs based on the data. This individual will also provide any necessary professional development, coaching, or other support to teachers and buildings, with best practices for designing effective and efficient progress monitoring tools within the virtual learning environment. Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) All annual IEP meetings will be held using GoToMeeting and scheduled by the case manager. Each family will have the option to sign electronic permission to share documentation if they Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 28would like documents shared via email. All required documentation will be sent via US Postal Service. Student-Specific Decision Making Parents will be contacted weekly to determine student-specific needs. An IEP team meeting will be scheduled for any discussion impacting the IEP or change in services or placement. Based on student and parent needs, strengths, and accessibility, examples of instruction may include: *Asynchronous Zoom session between staff, parent, and student, whereby a specific skill is targeted and remediated through evidenced-based activities, such as phonological awareness exercises that target rhyming, blending, and so forth. *An individual activity in which the parent can supervise the student in independently completing several worksheets in a skill area in which the student was close to the target. *Hands-on materials, created by school staff or by parents in coordination with school staff, whereby the student can exercise practicing a new skill in math or sentence construction with parents submitting photos of the finished product. Elementary Approximate Time Frames for Learning Students are responsible for visiting their teacher's Google Classroom page for online assignments on a daily basis Students will attend virtual class as specified in each teacher's email Students will have assignments from each teacher with specified due dates Counselors will be available to support students with academic, social, or emotional needs.

Teachers consider the following time frames when they assign work: Elementary: 1-2 hours Middle: 2-3 hours and High School: 3-4 hours daily. Security is a high priority, especially when the system involves many users. If you identify a security problem in the meetings, emails, or computers notify your administrator immediately. Grading IC Gradebook must be updated with the current week's grades prior to the following Monday All teachers must enter and post the grades weekly according to grade level/department Elementary: at least 1 grade for core courses (i.e., reading, writing, math, science) and 1 grade for social studies each week Elementary Specials - at least 1 grade per week Secondary: 2 grades for each core content area taught (English, Math, Social Studies, Science), including electives Guidelines for Parents Supporting Distance Learning Each campus will share guidelines and tips with parents. An example list of recommendations is given here. Provide support for your children by adhering to following guidelines: 1. Follow instructions from the school. Review A Parent's Guide To Google Classroom document shared with you. 2. Establish routines and expectations 3. Take an active role in helping your student process and own their learning 4. Encourage physical activity and/or exercise 5. Monitor how much time student is spending online Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 316. Monitor student's social media use, especially during school closure. 7. Cyberbullying: the use of electronic communication to bully a person including sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. What should you do if you're being bullied? Do not respond to harassment or threats--this may encourage the bully. Keep a record of messages received (print or take screenshots). Reach out to parents, teachers, counselors, and school administrators. Block communication from the bully (if possible). Do not participate in cyberbullying (even in response to a bully). Ask for help if you are being cyberbullied. Stand up if you see somebody being cyberbullied Coral Academy of Science Las Vegas 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 32COVID-19 OPERATIONAL SAFETY PLAN (EXTERNAL) DEMOCRACY PREP AT THE AGASSI CAMPUS 2020-21 P a g e 1 J u l y 1 3 , 2 0 2 1 I N T R O D U C T I O N A t D e m o c r a c y P r e p P u b l i c S c h o o l s , w e a r e c o m m i t t e d t o t h e s a f e t y o f o u r s t a f f a n d s c h o l a r s .

The Nevada Department of Education and the State Public Charter School Authority are requiring a reopening plan with the following in mind. Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID-19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn. Pursuant to Emer gency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Distance Education Plans for the 2021-22 school year . This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health of ficials. Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emer gency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community , parents and school employees. This plan establishes an emer gency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emer gency . Discovery Charter School (DCS) is prepared to adjust any of the following policies as required by the CDC, SNHD, SPCSA, and NV DOE. DCS was able to provide distance education beginning March 16, 2020 and operated a successful and fluid hybrid program for SY 2020-2021 in response to student and family needs. DCS will continue to monitor public health responses. DCS will continue to survey all stakeholders and respond to concerns throughout SY 2021-2022. 3In-Person Learning Health and Safety Discovery Charter School follows CDC, state, and local government regulations. As regulations change, the school will modify practices to ensure health and safety . Face Coverings The proper use of face coverings will be implemented to include the following: Mask will cover mouth and nose Wet or soiled masks will not be worn Masks can be removed for eating, drinking, or outside play when 6 feet can be maintained Masks will be worn on bus Students 9 and under are not required to wear a face mask. Vaccinated students and staf f are not required to wear a face mask. Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette All classrooms will be equipped with hand sanitizer . All sinks will be equipped with hand soap and paper towels. Handwashing will take place upon entering classrooms from outside and prior to lunch or snack times. Respiratory Etiquette will include one direction seating when possible, limiting group work time and maximizing outdoor instructional time. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities Discovery Charter School will continue to employ Merchants Building to daily clean facilities. This contracted company has improved their practices to align with safer and cleaner practices as a result of possible covid exposure. In addition, air filters have been upgraded to medical facility rating. 4Contact T racing When an individual tests positive for covid and has been on campus, a list of contacts will be generated. A close contact is considered to have been within 6 feet of the positive case for an accumulated 15 minutes. All close contacts will be notified. If the close contact has been vaccinated, no quarantine is necessary . If not vaccinated, the close contact will quarantine for the recommended time period as required by the Southern Nevada Health Department. Diagnostic and Scr eening T esting Discovery Charter School will use covid diagnostic symptom charts to determine if an individual should leave campus for testing. Families will be notified as soon as symptoms present themselves to staf f. Staff will be monitored and encouraged to stay home and seek testing using the same symptom charts. Efforts to increase access and awareness of vaccinations will be provided to all stakeholders. Discovery Charter School will communicate on all platforms the importance of vaccinating and provide location sites for families to visit. Appr opriate accommodations for childr en with disabilities Discovery Charter School will make all attempts to provide a free and appropriate education to children with disabilities in accordance with the student' s IEP . In the event a mask is not wearable by the child with disabilities, the staf f and close proximity peers will wear a mask and practice social distancing. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing Students' Social, Emotional, Mental, and Physical Health Discovery Charter School is prepared to identify and meet the social emotional needs of students. A contract with private counselors has been established to of fer on campus sessions for those in need and referred. After school activities are planned to include creativity , engagement, and movement in an attempt to teach the whole child and their senses that may have been neglected during the regular school day . Physical education will be scheduled for all students at a minimum of twice a week. DCS is also participating in the NCSAA organization for school sports in SY 2021-2022. 5Discovery Charter School Educator and Staff W ell-being Staff needs will continue to be assessed with surveys. Confidential communication with an assigned board member proficient in human resources is made available. Professional development has been scheduled for growth and awareness in the social emotional needs of students and others. The professional development will be provided by an outside professional vendor and will occur in person within the first six weeks of school. Staff well-being will be supported by a staf f retreat before the contract year begins, scheduled social events, and recognition of staf f life events. The contracted counselors will be made available to staf f. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning Discovery Charter School is greatly concerned about the impact of learning during the pandemic. Data meetings took place in Spring 2021 to begin to assess the gaps, losses, and trends. Returning to the classroom will present learning spectrums and not all students will need to close a gap, but rather accelerate their learning. A GATE program was installed during SY 2020-2021. In addition to GA TE students being identified, an ACE (Accelerated Curiosity and Exploration) program will be implemented at the same time. Students for ACE were identified using the GATE diagnostics, teacher referral and family referrals. Students in either program will receive a minimum of 150 minutes per week of accelerated learning. Student data will be analyzed weekly with classroom teachers, administration, literacy specialists, and special education facilitators. During the data talks, resources and plans for instruction will be made. The instructional plans will be implemented either in the classroom or with the literacy specialist in the form of Tier 2 or 3. The data and plans will be shared with family . Instructional time will include small group instruction for all grade levels. Classroom teachers will use data for grouping. The groupings will be reevaluated a minimum of three times a year using student data. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in- person Students who have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person will be of fered full time distance learning. Students will be assigned a classroom teacher . All technology needs will be provided to ensure equitable access to education. Students will participate in synchronous learning via google 6classroom. Teachers will have designated of fice hours for distance learning students to receive support. Students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health of ficials will be given a determined date to return to campus. During their quarantine, technology needs will be provided to ensure equitable access to education. Students will participate in synchronous learning via google classroom. Teachers will have designated of fice hours for distance learning students to receive support. Distance Education Emergency Closur e In the event of of school closure recommended by the Southern Nevada Health Department all staff and students will transition to the following distance education plan: Return to campus date will be determined by the health department and CDC guidelines. Students will remain assigned to classroom teacher . Lessons will become synchronous. All staf f and students will have access to necessary technology , including hot spots. Pick up of paper resources will be available at the front of fice. Attendance will be recorded daily using Infinite Campus. Absent students will be contacted via email, phone, google chat, or through submission of assignments. Distance Education: Supporting Students Students identified to participate in distance learning will receive all necessary technology to include hot spots, char gers, and laptops. All resources will be printed and either mailed or ready for pick up at the front of fice on a weekly basis. Special education students will be invited to virtual meetings by specialists in order to ensure IEP minutes are met. EL services will be provided accordingly . Virtual counseling meetings may be scheduled for those students identified. If in person meetings are necessary , face masks and social distancing will be required for all participants. 7 Attendance Discovery Charter School will take daily attendance for all modes of learning: in-person and full distance. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physically present; and/or (2) The pupil makes progress in their classwork leading toward mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and/or a course' s completion that can be verified through a learning management system or other means; and/or (3) The pupil participates in a real-time (synchronous) class session; and/or (4) The pupil meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who is able to discuss the pupil' s progress in the course. If a pupil participating in distance education full- or part-time demonstrates any one of the four criteria, the pupil is considered present for the full day . If the pupil does not demonstrate at leasone of the four criteria, they are considered absent for the full day . 8High Risk Exemption Form Page 1 - Information If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high-risk medical condition*, a Medical Certification for COVID-19 High Risk Exemption Form may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021-2022 school year . Students who are out on a high-risk medical exemption may not participate in any in-person learning, face-to-face extracurricular or on-campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID-19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning at the end of each quarter - which will be determined on a case-by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. Distance learning will consist of your student working individually on assigned work through different learning platforms. Students will check in daily with their teacher for progress check-ins, checking for understanding of the lessons, academic goal setting, assessment preparation, etc. *Those individuals who ar e at higher risk of sever e illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Contr ol (CDC), ar e those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chr onic lung disease, compr omised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer tr eatment, bone marr ow or or gan transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly contr olled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticoster oids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failur e, cor onary artery disease, congenital heart disease, car diomyopathies, and hypertension), chr onic kidney disease under going dialysis, or liver disease. Procedure for submitting a medical exemption form: Please see the next page for the form. Fill in your child's name,grade,campus,and the parent-related information. Have your licensed healthcare provider complete and sign the form. Turn in the completed form to the front of fice staff. For siblings ,one form must be completed for each sibling. If the student' s medical physician cannot be reached for signature (i.e., moved to Las Vegas from another state), a letter from the physician on letterhead will 9suffice in place of the form All medical exemption requests will be subject to verification. form must be completed and signed by a licensed health care provider and is subject to verification. Parents/guardians will be notified by campus leadership when the form has been verified and accepted. High Risk Exemption Form Page 2 - Medical Certification Student Name: Campus: Grade: The High-Risk Exemption is due to the health of: (circle one) Student Household Member Parent Name: Parent Email: Parent Signature: Parent Phone #: Should a student be required to return to in-person instruction, but the student or an individual in his/her household has a high-risk medical condition as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, this medical certification form will need to be submitted in order for the student to be considered for remote learning. Completed forms should be submitted to the front of fice to claim the high-risk exemption for COVID-19. Forms must be signed by a licensed health care provider and are subject to verification. Parents/Guardians will be notified when the form has been approved. Individual at Higher Risk: Individuals at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are those individuals with certain underlying health conditions as designated by the CDC, which provides as follows: Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not 1 0limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or or gan transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease under going dialysis, liver disease, or severe obesity .

If a full-time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face-to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the real-time synchronous sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs assistance, they should not interrupt a lesson. Successful candidates for full-time distance learning have demonstrated positive attendance and grades during the previous year of school. All full-time distance learning requests are subject to approval by the school leadership. Students will be expected to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real-time sessions during the school' s instructional day. Kindergarten - 2nd grade will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions daily . 3rd - 5th grade will have a minimum of 90-120 minutes of real-time sessions daily . Middle and High School will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions per week per course. Full-time distance education elementary students must have an adult at home readily available to support their learning. Families may be asked to pick up resources weekly from the front of fice. Students will be required to attend school face-to-face for designated activities and assessments. Some courses/classes may not be of fered through full-time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Parents will assist students in planning a time schedule for long-term assignments. Make-up work is available to all students. Students are responsible for asking teachers for the make-up work upon returning to class. Students will receive credit for satisfactory 1 3make-up work, including tests, after an absence, but may receive a zero for any make-up work, including tests, not made up within the allotted time. Any assignment not turned in within the allotted time falls within the late work guidelines. Exceptions may be granted by the teacher in extenuating circumstances. Grading and Attendance Families are encouraged to utilize the portal in Infinite Campus to monitor grades and attendance. Staf f will account for grading and attendance routinely in this student information system. Families are also encouraged to check email and class dojo for messages from teachers and administration. Communication DCS will continue to communicate with stakeholders using email, class dojo, the school website, robocalls, text messages, social media and conferences. We maintain a 24 hour hour return call policy for the upcoming year . Middle school students are encouraged to communicate with their teachers first before a family member communicates. Surveys will be administered to conduct needs assessments as policies and procedures change. 1 4 Doral Academy of Nevada Path Forward Programs for Distance Education 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Table of Contents Background 4 Safe Reopening for In -Person Learning 5 In-Person Learning: Health and Safety 5 Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette 5 Diagnostic and Screening Testing 5 Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities 6 Face Coverings 7 Contact Tracing 9 Social Distancing & Capacity 9 Accommodations for Children with Disabilities Error!

In the program, schools must provide details on their distance learning plan for full -time distance learning students for the 2021 -2022 school year. There must be key information included such as how students were appr oved for distance learning, what the learning model will look like, and how attendance will be taken. The State Public Charter School Authority requested more information from schools, such as what schools are doing to ensure health and safety for all, wh at a school's in -person learning will look like, and what steps schools are taking to support students and staff with their social and emotional well -being. The 2021 Legislative Session produced Senate Bill 215. Schools are required to develop a distance education plan in the event of an emergency that may cause a school closure of at least 10 days. This way schools are more prepared to tackle any sudden closures, similar to what was experienced in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. To streamli ne all of the requested information, the State Public Charter School Authority has requested that schools submit a 2021 -2022 reopening plan. In it, there are three key requirements: Requirement A: Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID -19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID -19 on students' oppo rtunity to learn. Requirement B: Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Distance Education Plans for the 2021 -22 school year. This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in- perso n or be quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Requirement C: Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community, parents, and sch ool employees. This plan 1 Section 8 of Emergency Directive 044 2 establishes an emergency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emergency. Safe Reopening for In- Person Learning Doral Academy of Nevada (DAN) recognizes that the h ealth and safety of students and staff is of the utmost importance. DAN will seek data, guidance, recommendations, and/or approval from the Southern Nevada Health District, the Center for Disease Control, the Nevada Department of Education, and the Nevada Governor's Office. DAN will continually work with its families, staff, leadership, and Board to implement Covid- 19 mitigation protocols that are the safest for its in - person students and staff at any point in time. Ultimately, DAN will use all available sc ientific information to help make a determination on these matters. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette DAN will continue to promote proper personal hygiene for staff and students: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Keep 3 feet of physical distance from others Avoid contact with others if within 3 feet Wear a cloth face mask covering inside the school building Avoid traveling if you are sick Stay home if you are feeling ill Get medical care as needed Each campus will have an abundance of signage promoting positive physical hygiene. For example, each restroom mirror will have signage reminding students to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds. These visual cues will be incredibly helpful, especially for visual learners. If a student may not be implementing safe and healthy hygiene practices, staff will re -educate the student and inform the student's parents. There may be students with disabilities who require special considerations when attempting to ensure that the child is able to execute CDC safety and health recommendations. In these circumstances, the school is prepared to collaborate with the child's parents and the child's medical team(s) when appropriate to delineate how the safet y and health procedures will be appropriately executed while still aligning to the child's needs. Diagnostic and Screening Testing Staff and students will self -screen their physical health. If any staff member or student is not feeling well and having any symptoms , that person will need to stay at home. They should only return to school when there are no remaining symptom s. If a student or staff member chooses to go to school while ill (no matter the illness), they will not be allowed in the classroom. For students, the parent will be contacted to take the student home and will not be allowed to return until they are symptom -free for 24 -hours. For staff, they cannot return until they are symptom -free for 24 -hours. In the event that a student feels ill during the school day, they will be removed from the classroom. They will be asked relevant questions pertaining to their heal th and assessed by a staff member with a touchless thermometer. If it is determined that the student needs to be sent home, a parent will be contacted, and their belongings will be gathered from the classroom for them. If it is determined that the staff me mber needs to be sent home, another staff member will cover their classroom/classes for the remainder of the day. They cannot return until they are symptom -free for 24 -hours. A list of symptoms will be gathered from public health organizations. Each campus will have touchless thermometers and will be used at the discretion of school staff. Spaces will be created on our campuses for temporary isolation. If a student or staff member is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease, the person will be required to self -quarantine, and the Southern Nevada Health District will be contacted. DAN will work in consultation with medical and public health experts, the State Public Charter School Authority, and the Nevada Department of Education to deter mine the extent of testing in the school and if a quarantine and/or closure is necessary. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities DAN will make multiple adjustments to each campus' facilities to minimize the risk of COVID- 19. Hand sanitizer pumps will be placed in various locations throughout the campus. There is an increase in signage enforcing social distancing and healthy personal hygiene in hallways and classrooms. There are visual cues on the floor showing where to stand, wait, and move. There are decals in restrooms reminding individuals to wash their hands. Desks will be arranged to be socially distanced. Desks will be marked to show which ones are assigned to which students. Furniture that is difficult to clean will not be utilized or replaced. All air filters will be monitored and replaced as needed. HVAC vendors have serviced each campus' HVAC system more frequently in the past 12 months. All shared items, such as athletic balls, will be cleaned accordingly. There will be limited use of the water fountain. Students and staff will be encouraged to bring their own water bottles. Technology will be assigned to students as needed/requested. All emergency plans will be adjusted to accommodate social distancing guidelines while maintaining the necessary safety, urgency, and precautions. Each classroom/office will be supplied with sanitizing wipes , sanitizer , and cleaning supplies. At each campus, staff will check the cleanliness of the campus to ensure a safe and healthy environment. All restrooms will be monitored regularly throughout the day to ensure cleanliness. High touch points, such as handrails, water fountains, sink heads, and doorknobs will be cleaned regularly by DAN staff. Shared materials will be limited as much as possible, and they will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Each night, there will be daily detailed cleaning of facilities from a contracted cleaning crew (e.g. Brilliant General Maintenance (BGM)). The same vendor will perform a thorough deep sanitizing cleaning of each campus in the event of a COVID exposure . Commer cial Cleaning Services uses these chemicals for sanitizing: Saddle Campus Mild Acid Cleaner (Brady) Clorox Hydrogen Peroxide Wipes BNC 15 Spartan Chemical Co Xcelente Sani -T 10 Plus Clean by Peroxy Cactus Campus Fire Mesa Campus Vital Oxide BNC -15 Brady Non -acid disinfectant Sani -T 10 Plus Red Rock ES Campus Brady Non -acid Disinfectant Clorox Hospital -Grade Hydrogen Peroxide Wipes HALT Hospital -Grade Disinfectant Sani -T 10 Plus Red Rock MS/HS Campus Sani T -10 Xcelente Waxie 730 Pebble Campus BNC -15 Vital Oxide Clorox Hospital -Grade Hydrogen Peroxide Wipes Sani -T 10 Plus Clorox Disinfectant Bio Stain and Odor Remover In the event of a pandemic scare or a positive COVID -19 diagnosis, each school will request an additional deep cleaning and sanitization for the affected classroom/area. After this has been used in a space, that area will be disinfected and suitable for occupancy. Face Coverings Ultimately, DAN will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, American Academy of Pediatrics, NDE, and SPCSA for guidelines requiring face coverings, and flexibility with mask requirements will be implemented based on current guidance and local transmission rates provided by SNHD. According to the CDC, masks should be worn by all indiv iduals (age 2 and older) who are not fully vaccinated. It is also recommended \"that schools maintain at least 3 feet of physical distancing between students within classrooms. When it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of at least 3 feet, it is especially important to layer multiple other prevention strategies (wearing masks). Our schools serve children under the age of 12 who are not eligible for vaccination at this time. Therefore, guidance emphasizes implementing layered prevention strat egies to protect people who are not fully vaccinated, including students, teachers, staff, and other members of their households.\" Currently (July 14, 2021) it is the plan of DAN to require face masks of all students, staff, and persons on campus. Studen ts and staff will be provided \"mask breaks\" by going outside and/or during limited instruction such as phonemic awareness in the classroom and during lunch/recess times. DAN will monitor local transmission rates, occurrence of outbreaks and vaccination rates within the community on a weekly basis and adjust to more relaxed mask requirements, as recommended by CDC, SNHD, American Academy of Pediatrics, NDE, and SPCSA. Our campuses will have masks readily available for anyone who needs one. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staff that has tested positive for Covid -19, principals conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in close contact with the positive individual. Close contact among children is defined a s within 3 feet for a total of 15 minutes. Classroom teachers will be required to implement assigned seat assignments and submit them to site administrators. The principal will communicate any COVID positive case or exposure with the Executive Director. The principal will share the names of close contacts, their contact information, and parent information if the close contact is a student. From there, the Executive Director will contact the Southern Nevada Health District. At that point in time, the length of quarantine will be determined. The Executive Director will share that information with the principal. The principal will message the appropriate families. Social Distancing & Capacity DAN will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA when it comes to social distancing requirements and room capacity limits. DAN is prepared with classroom measurements and classroom capacity at each school site, and is prepared to adjust accordingly to any percentage. Accommodations for Children with Disabilities If students and staff have one of the disability types listed below, they might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members. People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness. DAN will work with families of children with disabilities to see if in -person learning is the best option. If it is, then campus leadership will work with each family to develop an action plan that is both academically enriching and safe and healthy. Vaccination Access & Awareness DAN has and will continue to strongly encourage students, families, and staff members to get their vaccinations if they are of age and health abides. In addition to partnering with Albertsons/Savon to offer vaccination clinics for Doral students, families, and staff; DAN campuses will promote local vaccination sites to its staff and families. Clinics were held in May and July at Doral school campus locations. Traveling Abroad A quarantine may be required if a student/staff member has returned from traveling to an international COVID -19 hotspot, as determined by school leadership. There will be an exception for families that had work -related military job duty responsibilities. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Well -being Being in the midst of a pandemic can bring a whirlwind of feelings within oneself. In any organization, it is critical for itself to make sure that the needs of its people are met. When it comes to students, those needs most likely also include soci al-emotional needs and the trauma that can be triggered by a pandemic. For DAN, the wellbeing and mental health of staff and students are of the utmost importance. The pandemic has affected the social -emotional wellbeing of many people, students included. Staff are encouraged to get to know their students and build trust and respect. Staff are trained to identify and report anything out of the ordinary to counseling staff and administration. Students have an open- door policy with all staff. When a student does need social -emotional support, it is critical that parents work in partnership with school staff to create an action plan. The goal is to cope, mitigate or sol ve the underlying issue that is affecting the student. By addressing trauma sensitively and thoughtfully, it will help heal the student holistically. Administrators and Instructional Coaches attended a Dare to Lead book study. Through this professional dev elopment, Administrators and Instructional Coaches will be better prepared to help guide the students and staff in a more open and vulnerable way. The last year was really hard on staff and students and having some tools that are used to help connect bette r with staff and students emotionally is essential for students to get back to learning. Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) and Counselors also participated in the book study and became Dare to Lead certified. Through this training, MFTs and School coun selors can coordinate book studies with staff, parents, and students, with a specified Rollout Program through Dare to Lead . These leadership skills will help allow better connections with people throughout each individual campus and to help promote more d aring and brave leaders, which is what we all need right now. Our students have really missed out on deeper connections this last year, as much of our teaching was virtual and students need a safe space to process through all the emotions that have been co llected over the last year and a half. MFTs and Counselors collaborate across the system to provide bi -monthly parent and family workshops on topics to encourage healthy family/child development on topics, such as online safety, having hard discussions wi th your kids, creating routines, and healthy coping skills. School Counselors will conduct classroom visits to address topics such as, anxiety of students coming back to full days on campus after pandemic, bullying awareness, understanding emotions, and growth mindset. School Counselors and MFTs will conduct support groups for students to meet needs identified in beginning and mid year surveys, with topics ranging from divorce, anxiety, study skills, and self-esteem. School Administrators will work with MFTs and Counselors to embed Dare to Lead strategies into staff meetings throughout the year. A courageous culture connects its values to specific behaviors, so people know what is expec ted, encouraged, and rewarded within their team and organization. Self -awareness is key: who we are is how we lead. Using this lens, the MFTs and Counselors will help bring Dare to Lead concepts to the staff periodically throughout the year. Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) will provide a weekly family newsletter to promote healthy family and child development. Additional for students: SSP's and school counselors will be visible on campus and available via Zoom for distance learning to help create and maintain a healthy and safe school environment. Staff will have access to a weekly mental health newsletter. SSP's will help to \"normalize\" and educate the effects of childhood trauma to reduce burnout and stress related to student behaviors a nd academic struggles/setbacks. With SSP support, teachers will be educated in establishing a trauma informed classroom. Establishing a trauma -informed classroom meets student's emotional and physical wellness by providing proper support and understanding in children's development after experiencing trauma. (Trauma will likely be pandemic related among other traumatic experiences.) See below for a complete guide in creating a Trauma Informed Classroom. https://www.wcris.org/wp -content/uploads/2017/08/Fostering -the-Trauma -Informed -Classroom - Handouts.pdf In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning DAN is aware of the potential negative effect of the school closures and the distance learning program with limited hours of instruction provided to students since March 2020. Therefore, we are excited to be able to resume offering a full day, in person / traditional learning program starting in August 2021. Implementing Assessments DAN will begin the school year with a comprehensive plan to diagnose and identify student needs. DAN will use every tool available to identify student needs and the learning ga ps. Some of these tools include but are not limited to SBAC , WIDA, Brigance Screener for Kindergarten, NWEA MAP Fall assessment, classroom level benchmark assessments, and hearing and vision screenings. Pairing Data with Instruction The teachers will look at the beginning of the year data during grade level and/or Professional Learning Community (PLC) meetings and \"data chats\" and prepare a comprehensive plan to meet the students' needs. Schools will utilize benchmark, SBAC, formative and diagnostic data to develop intervention groups during the staff development days on September 23 and 24, 2021. Tutoring and intervention services will be provided during the school day and after school time. DAN will utilize a wide range of programs to accelerate learning and close the achievement gap. Some of the intervention programs include but are not limited to: Moby Max, ST Math, and WonderWorks . In-Person Learning & Special Populations Special populations such as SPED, English Learners (EL), and immigrant students will continue to receive services from licensed teachers. These groups will be identified, and services will be provided in accordance with the Nevada State and Federal requirements and guidelines. Students will be served in their own gr oups and grant funds and other funds will be used solely to service these students. Path Forward Program: Distance Learning Doral Academy of Nevada (DAN) has created a distance learning plan for the 2021 -2022 school year. DAN recognizes that there may be families that need to keep learning in a virtual environment. The distance learning plan is specifically designed for students: With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in -person learning, as determined by a medical health professional Who tested positive for Covid -19 and require quarantine Identified as close contacts of Covid -19 and require quarantine Affected by school closures and/or tightening government health protocols DAN is dedicated to maintaining high expectations and strong academic achievement for all students, whether full -time in -person or full -time distance learning. High -Risk Medical Exemption Process If a student has a high -risk medical condition*, a Medical Certification for COVID -19 High Risk Exemption Form (provided in the next section) may be completed to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021 -2022 school year. A health care medical professional must complete the exemption form and email it to the principal . DAN will review the form, and either approve or deny. The medical exemption form is attached. If any student gets off the waitlist and enrolls at any of our campuses, the registrar will provide the family with a medical exemption form. They will complete it and return it to the campus as soon as possible. In the event that getting a physician's signature is not possible (due to moving from a different region or other similar circumstances), a letter from the physician on letterhead will suffice. Students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not participate in any in- person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID -19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. There may be ti mes, such as state -required assessments, where students may need to be on campus. During these times, a safe, socially distanced environment will be set up for the students to attend campus for a specific purpose . Every person will wear a mask in these env ironments. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning at the end of first semester, which will be determined on a case -by-case basis. Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantati on, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. During the school year, if public health conditions worsen and/or students develop certain health conditions that may qualify for a h igh-risk medical exemption, families can complete a High Risk Exemption Form and submit it to administration for considerat ion. High Risk Exemption Form Page 1 - Information If a student has a high- risk medical condition *, a Medical Certication for COVID -19 High Risk Exemption Form may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021 -2022 school year. Students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not participate in any in- person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including eld trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID -19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning at the end of each semester, which will be determined on a case -by-case basis by administration and with public health protocols in mind. Distance learning will consist of the student working individually on assigned work through diffe rent learning platforms, such as Academica Virtual Education (AVE) or Edmentum. Students will check in daily with a teacher for progress check- ins, checking for understanding of the lessons, academic goal setting, assessment preparation, etc. *Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deciencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. P rocedure for submitting a medical exemption form: P lease see the next page for the form. Fill in your child's name, grade, campus, and the parent -related information. Have your licensed health care provider complete and sign the form. Turn in the completed form to the front ofce staff. For siblings , one form must be completed for each sibling. If the student's medical physician cannot be reached for signature (i.e., moved to Las Vegas from another state), a letter from the physician on letterhead will sufce in place of the form. All medical exemption requests will be subject to verication. The form must be completed and signed by a licensed health care provider and is subject to verication . Parents/guardians will be notied by administration when the form has been veried and accepted.

Does the named student or individual in his/her household have an underlying medical condition deemed to be high- risk for severe illness from COVID -19 as determined by the CDC and listed above? Yes No 2. Please provide the medical diagnosis and/or physician 's note of the underlying condition for the student/household member. Signature of Health Care Provider Date Received by : Date : Parent Considerations for Distance Learning Parents/guardians are asked to consider the following information when seeking full -time distance learning (DL) for their student: Students will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning at the end of each semester, which will be determined on a case -by-case basis by administration and w ith public health protocols in mind. If a full -time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face -to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the \"office hour\" sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs assistance, they s hould not interrupt a lesson. Just like students attending school on campus, a student participating in full -time distance learning may receive meals at the school at no cost. Successful candidates for full -time distance learning have demonstrated solid attendance and passing grades during the previous year of school. All full -time distance learning requests are subject to approval by the school leadership. Students will be expe cted to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real - time/ \"office hour\" with their child's teacher. Full- time distance education elementary students must have an adult at home readily available to support their learning. Students will be required to attend school face -to-face for designated activities and assessments. Some courses/classes may not be offered through full -time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Parents will assist students in planning a time schedule for long -term assignments. Make -up work is available to all students. Students are responsible for asking teachers for the make -up work upon returning to class. For young primary grade students (K-2), the parent is responsible for emailing the teacher regarding make -up work. Students will receive credit for satisfactory make -up work, including tests, after an absence, but may receive a minimum F (50%) for any make -up work, includi ng tests, not made up within the allotted time. Any assignment not turned in within the allotted time falls within the late work guidelines. Exceptions may be granted by the teacher in extenuating circumstances. Full- Time Distance Learning Full- time distance learning will only take place for high -risk students whose exemption form has been approved. Once eligible for the Distance Learning (DL) program, students will be assigned to the class of the dedicated DL program teacher(s) /substitute teacher(s). The school will make a schedule based on the number of DL eligible students from each grade level. The schedule may need to be revised/revisited throughout the year. Students will have access to Google Classroom and the assigned DL instruction programs (e.g. Academica Virtual Education (AVE), Ed genuity ) and resources. If needed, the s tudent will be provided a Chromebook to take home. Students will also be provided Internet service, if needed. Students will be placed in D L with their in-person teacher if the entire class goes under quarantine. All work/activities will be accessed via Google Classroom, and instruction will take place via Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. Teachers will make at least one entry per week in the Infinite Campus Gradebook. The DL teacher will communicate with families each day via email, video conferencing, or phone calls. The communication will be documented in Infinite Campus or via a spreadsheet. Suppose a student cannot be accessed via phone, video conferencing, or email. In that case, the dedicated distance learning teacher will need to find other ways of interacting with t he family and record all communication and details. Covid -19 Positive & Close Contacts - Logistics Full- time in -person students who have tested positive for Covid -19 must quarantine as determined by SNHD in collaboration with DAN's head nurse and administration. Proof of a positive PCR test should be provided to campus leadership . Contact tracing will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus. Full- time in -person students who have been identified as Covid -19 close contacts (from the school, SNHD, or personal connection for any case) must quarantine as determined SNHD in collab oration with DAN's head nurse and administration. A student's quarantine can be for t en calendar days (most of the time) but can b e longer depending on different factors. During a student's quarantine, a Chromebook will be provided if needed. School admi nistration will communicate the next steps for distance learning with families. Students are required to follow all procedures as stated by their teachers and leadership. Students are expected to attend daily \"office hours\" with the teacher to check -in du ring their quarantine. If they do not attend, the student will be marked absent. Students/Parents should let teachers and front office staff know if they will be absent. Teacher(s) will make a minimum of 2 attempts to contact the student daily. Students may return to school from their quarantine on the agreed upon date. If the student is not symptom -free at the end of their quarantine, the quarantine will be extended for the safety of everyone. Once symptom -free for 24 -hours, they may return to i n-person learning. Quarantined Students & Distance Learning We anticipate two types of quarantines for full -time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. Individual/Limited number of Students When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in -person teacher. All work/activities will be accessed via Google Classroom, and instruction will be synchronous through Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. When only a limited number of students need to be quarantined, students will be required to access assignments and instru ctional materials/resources via Google Classroom and attend \"office hours\" with the teacher during the period of quarantine. Assignments must be completed daily for each student to be considered in attendance. Attendance will be taken in Infinite Campus. All assignments will be turned in via Google Classroom. We have had great success implementing this learning model during the 4th quarter of the 2019 - 2020 school year and the entire 2020 -2021 school year. We also have had to quarantine classrooms regularly during the 2020 -2021 school year. Transitioning due to Public Health Conditions Worsening public health conditions can affect the learning model that is implemented. If the Southern Nevada Health District, Center for Disease Control, and/or the Nevada Department of Education enforce new directives, we will make those changes, as necessary. It will be a smooth transition for us due to our experience, and we are equipped to adapt to the changes. The past 15 months have show n that we can support students with the necessary technology, communicate with families effectively, and provide high -quality instruction to students. We made a shift from in -person learning to full -time distance learning when schools were closed in March 2020, within a short 3 -day period. Staff quickly pivoted and continued to provide live instruction for students for the last quarter of the school year. When conditions were improving, we were one of the first schools to bring back students in - perso n through a hybrid model. By the start of the second quarter, we were managing AM/PM/full- distance cohorts at all our campuses. This quick transition was successful due to the training that staff received and the communication between the students, familie s, and the school. Through both models, our campuses implemented strict health and cleaning policies for staff, students, and visitors to our campuses. We abided by social distancing measures in the hallways and in classrooms. We provided free nutriti ous meals to all during that time as well. If we are mandated to switch learning models during the 2021 -2022 school year, our schools and staff members will be ready. If we are forced to shift the learning model abruptly, we will be ready to make t hat change immediately. Serving Special Populations in Distance Learning If a student or group of students who receive services within Special Education have to participate in \"full distance education\" instructional models, our schools are prepared to ens ure the continuity of services including access to necessary technology, resources, and personnel including, but not limited to, related service staff as written into IEPs. Below is a list of processes/activities that we are prepared to execute: Providing child with technology device that has Wi -Fi accessibility and all appropriate applications that child would need in order to ensure their individualized FAPE is provided (i.e., text to speech/speech to text, Google Classroom, etc.). Families in n eed of in -home Wi - Fi will be also be supported. Students will continue to receive their individualized FAPE via a combination of live virtual instruction (Synchronous) as well as other types of virtual instruction (Asynchronous and reviewing of recorded in struction) from their corresponding certified teachers. Students in need of non- virtual learning materials will be provided those materials (construction paper, hard copies of learning curriculum, learning manipulatives, etc.) Every parent of a child with a disability is offered the opportunity to revise their child's IEP to include a Special Education Alternative Learning Plan (SEALP). The SEALP is a document that allows the IEP to consider the child's current IEP services and discuss how, when, and by who m the services will be delivered while participating in a \"full distance education\" model. The SEALP also allows the IEP team the opportunity to consider supports/services that may be needed now that the child is participating in a \"full distance educatio n\" model and then to appropriately include those supports/services in the SEALP as an addendum to the child's IEP. It will be our recommendation that for students who request to be on a \"full virtual track\" for an extended amount of time as delineated in writing by a medical professional, that an IEP Revision meeting takes place to properly address that change of placement and corresponding adjustments to supports and services. For students who are unexpectedly forced to remain out of school for a tempora ry amount of time as a result of having to quarantine according to adopted guidance health policy, it will be our recommendation for teams to send out a Prior Written Notice to families as soon as possible identifying the proposed supports and services bei ng offered to the child within that timeframe. More formal IEP Revisions may be needed for students under these circumstances depending on the student's individual learning needs and current state of health while under quarantine. Depending on the natur e of having to implement the \"full distance learning\" model, schools are prepared to work with individual families of students with unique special education needs to consider if any amount of \"in person\" learning may need to take place despite what is being allowed/offered to the general student population. Staffing & Development for Distance Learning DAN will utilize licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes to be the instructors for distance education. Teachers will post the content and language objectives for each class. These teachers will create lessons and units through Google Classroom and other programs to assist with planning instruction. Teachers will be accessible to students through the Internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. Teachers will be able to direct families to the necessary resources in support of the student's learning . Additionally, teachers will communicate to the student the nature of the outstanding work and the time limits for completing the work. During the August teacher in -service week, teachers will be receiving professional development and training on distance learning, Covid -19 protocols, and working with families through this time. Teachers new to DAN wi ll be provided training on Google Classroom and Zoom. Student Attendance in Full -Time Distance Learning Each student participating full -time in distance education will be contacted via electronic means or by telephone by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher at least once per instructional day. If a student's confirmed lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record at tempted contact via other means (e.g., Certified Letter ) once per week and maintain a record of attempts. Staff will use a consistent method in Infinite Campus for recording contact with students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through Google Classroom. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physically present; and/or (2) The student makes progress in their classwork leading toward mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and/or a course's completion that can be verified through a learning management system or other means; and/or (3) The pupil participates in a real -time (synchron ous) class session; and/or (4) The pupil meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who is able to discuss the pupil's progress in the course. Families may contact the main office of their campus if there is an attendance issue, such as incorrectly marked absence. Ten consecutive unexcused absences with no contact will result in a withdrawal from the DAN. Technology Access For any students without access to such technology, school administration will work with families to ensure technology is accessible. Families will need to complete a form to borrow the technology check -out form for the school year. If approved, students will be provided with a hotspot and a Chromebook at no cost to the family. Parents of DL students will be able to set up their Google Classroom accounts at the beginning of the year and monitor their student's progress and see all upcoming assignments, tests, and due dates throughout the school year. Families will receive training by a DAN staff member on how to use the technology if needed. If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year, families are encouraged to contact their child 's homeroom/advocacy teacher. Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year. Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus per the agreement form . If there are greater issues in technology (i.e., internet service provider shutdown, blackout, etc.), distance learning may be done through paper correspondence. Student/Family Communication Students are required to check in with their teachers each day. Whether through email, a phone call, or (video) messaging through a learning management system and/or Zoom, it will count as an interaction for the day. A teacher will schedule one or more conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the s tudent is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is presenting difficulties with behavior, academics, or attendance some, or in any other case that the teacher considers necessary. Such conferences may be handle d by telephone, via Zoom, in person, or via written communication. If families and/or students call teachers, and the call is not answered a voicemail message should be left by the parent or student (grade 4 -12). A teacher will respond within 24 hours. If a student emails a teacher, the teacher will respond within 24 hours. Email communication sent on Fridays after 12:00 p.m. should expect a response by close of business on the next non -holiday business day. If a student has not communicated with a staff member for 5 days in a row, the school counselor and/or administration will become involved to contact the student and/or family. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, campus administrators , the teacher and the school's counselor will work together to provide resources. Nutrition Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school. DAN serves lunch to K -12 students at its campuses. Students who are full DL or are temporarily quarantined may have access to free meals from their home campus, or any Doral Academy of Nevada campus. Students may pick up a week' s worth of meals at one time. A schedule of days/times that each campus distributes meals to full distance and quarantined students will be shared regularly. Important Note: The student and/or family member will be required to wear a mask and be socially distanced when picking up meals. Social -Emotional Support In the event of a full - school closure, the social -emotional protocols and guidelines provided on page 11, will be followed. Mask & Visitation Policy Distance learning students and their family members are required to wear masks when in the school building at all times. This is for the safety of the students and their families. Distance learning students and their families may only access the school's main office area , and they must request permission from school administration to attend campus for any specific reason . All visitors entering the building must complete the health screener and undergo a temperature check. DL IEP students are allowed to be on campus if it is determined that they need specific services that can only be performed in- person. Emergency School Closure Learning Plan DAN recognizes that there may be emergency situations that shut down a campus for an extended period of time. Examples of emergency situations could include, but not limited to, a pandemic, a facility issue, or a natural disaster. Doral Academy of Nevada (DAN) is committed to providing high -quality arts integrated education to its students and has developed this emergency school closure learning plan. This plan will be made available to all staff, families, and students. This plan will succeed in delivering instruction online to meet students' elective and general education requirements. The purpose of this plan is to empower and prepare students for success by enabling them to access quality online instruction. This plan will act as a guide to improve learning and enhance student success. It is also aimed to fulfill all applicable rules, regulations, and policies stipulated by the Nevada Department of Education and the US federal government. DAN will continue to use email, Infinite Campus, Google GSuite and the school website for normal communications with parents, students, and teachers. This plan is developed for at least 10 consecutive days of implementation. Education Management System Infinite Campus will continue to be used as the Student Information System (SIS). It will be the primary source of grading, attendance accounting and information distribution to students and families. Teachers are required to enter grades at least one time per week per subject/content area or course. Primary Online Learning Platform Google Classroom will be used by every teacher to relay classroom content and deliver classroom instruction. Each teacher shared their Google Classroom codes with administration through a Google Form to create a Master List so all staff could access codes for any student or parent further streamlining the enrollment process. Teachers upload videos, assignments and related information for student use. In addition to Google Classroom, teachers will continue to use other platforms such as IXL, ST Math, MobyMax, and Khan Academy that were previously implemented for classroom use. Zoom is the teleconference method being used by teachers for classroom instruction in the event a whole class has to quarantine. Student Materials, Technology, Supplies Distribution A student survey will be delivered to families to determine technology needs at the start of each school year. Chromebooks will then be distributed to families at a time, date, and location, which will be communicated to families at each school campus. Additional supplies will also be distributed for sele ct classes during this time, such as curricular materials and resources. Additional Outreach Emails will be sent weekly with details regarding local school sites providing drive -through lunch options for students. DAN will work with its vendor to deliver types of meals (hot, cold, etc.) that best serves its students during that time. Academic Progress Tracking Classroom teachers will communicate with counselors and administration any students who are disengaged or not showing progress in specific courses. The counseling team will work with administration to mee t with parents for the student 's academic success . Staff Communication The administration of each campus will work with its site leadership team to develop effective modes of communication. Grade level, department, and all staff Zoom, or in- person meetings are regularly scheduled as well as emergency staff meetings when necessary. How -to videos for curriculum, lesson planning, Google Classroom, grading, and other web -based prog ramming are provided or created as needs are expressed by teachers. Leaders are included as teachers on all Google Classrooms to aid in student learning when needed. Teachers are required to contact parents via email or phone number as an additional means of communication with students and parents. Principals will join weekly planning meetings scheduled by the Executive Office and SPCSA and update their staff accordingly. Technical support will be available via Intellatek, the contracted technology provider, to assist students and staff. Special Education Program See procedures and protocols on page 21. Related Services Related Service providers will continue to provide related services using online learning platforms when the student and parent have access to the required technology, for the seamless continuation of services to the child to ensure their FAPE is not compromised. For parents who do not have the required technology for electronic service provision, related servic e providers will make weekly contact with the parent to offer continued support such as recommended strategies to implement at home, connecting parents to helpful resources, and gathering information which may be beneficial for the case manager and/or spec ial education staff to know in order to support the student in their virtual classroom environment through modification and accommodations. Related Service Providers will continue to maintain their required Service Logs (in the Minute 7 web based applica tion) and Contact Logs which capture services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made. Further, qualitative information will be included to alert DAN special education administration to ongoing concerns or them es which need support. A special education administrative staff with DAN will oversee the accurate collection of service logs and contact logs between the related service providers, students, and parents, and determine areas that need further support, base d on the data. Special Education Teacher Each special education teacher will provide the IEP service minutes to the students on their caseload via a mixture of asynchronous and synchronous classes, Google classroom, supplemental online options, and progress monitoring to ensure work towards IEP goals. Special Education teachers will provide their delineated IEP services during the instructional school day, Monday to Friday. Each teacher will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar classroom. This schedule will be communicated individually with parents/guardians and students. All families will be provided the opportunity to make use of a Special Education Alternative Learning Plan (SEALP). A SEALP is a document that allows the IE P team to consider the child's current IEP services and discuss how, when, and by whom the services will be delivered while participating in a \"full distance education\" model. The SEALP also allows the IEP team the opportunity to consider supports/services that may be needed now that the child is participating in a \"full distance education\" model and then to appropriately include those supports/services in the SEALP as an addendum to the child's IEP. Special education teachers will monitor student progres s, attendance, and assignment completion. Special education teachers will continue to maintain their required Service Logs and Contact Logs which capture services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made. Furthe r, qualitative information will be included to alert DAN special education administration to ongoing concerns or themes which need support. A special education administrative staff with DAN will oversee the accurate collection of service logs and contact l ogs between the related service providers, students, and parents, and determine areas that need further support, based on the data. Paraprofessionals Paraprofessionals and their assigned case managers will be in contact throughout the week, in order to pl an and provide the support and services required. The paraprofessionals, their assigned case managers, and corresponding regular education teaching staff will work collaboratively to create a plan of action on how to measurably support the student within and outside of special education instruction, to include preparation of materials, modifying assignments, pre and reteaching, and the electronic dissemination and collection of materials. Each paraprofessional will provide service minutes using asyn chronous and synchronous classes, monitoring and assisting with general education Google classrooms, student support, and supplemental online options. Paraprofessionals will be available during the instructional day, Monday to Friday. Each paraprofessional will have a set schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar school. The schedule of delivery of all services, including those being executed by a paraprofessional, will be communicated by the special education teacher to the parents/guardians and students. Instruction Special education support services are provided by both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Online learning platforms in use include Google Classroom and Zoom. Other methods of instruction and communication may include Skype, FaceTime, email, text messaging, and telephone. Teachers and support staff are required to be available during the school day. Direct instruction is provided to address the previously designated areas of eligibility, as well as the support provided throu gh push -in services, the modification of general education assignments, and ongoing accommodations. Special education teachers are in weekly contact with the general education classroom teachers to provide continued collaboration and planning.

Teachers consider the following time frames when they assign work: Elementary: 1 -2 hours Middle: 2 -3 hours and High Scho ol: 3 -4 hours daily. Security is a high priority, especially when the system involves many users. If you identify a security problem in the Zoom meetings, emails, or computers notify your administrator immediately. Grading IC Gradebook must be updated regularly. Teachers must enter and post the grades and/or progress weekly according to grade level/department and school policy. Guidelines for Parents Supporting Distance Learning Each campus will share guidelines and tips with parents. An example list of recommendations is given here. Provide support for your children by adhering to following guidelines: 1. Follow instructions from the school. 2. Establish routines and expectations. 3. Take an active role in helping your student process and own their learning. 4. Encourage physical activity and/or exercise. 5. Monitor how much time a student is spending online. 6. Monitor student's social media use, especially during school closure. 7. Cyberbullying: the use of electronic communication to bully a person including sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. What should you do if yo ur child is being bullied? Do not respond to harassment or threats --this may encourage the bully. Keep a record of messages received (print or take screenshots). Reach out to parents, teachers, counselors, and school administrators. Block communication from the bully (if possible). Do not participate in cyberbullying (even in response to a bully). Ask for help if you are being cyberbullied. Stand up if you see somebody being cyberbullied IN PERSON LEARNING FRAMEWORK 2021 HEALTH & SAFETY Doral Academy of Northern Nevada (DANN) will maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other school sta by following all recommendations from and continuing close collaboration with the Washoe County Health District. DANN will follow NDE and WCHD protocols, including face coverings guidance. To remain vigilant and responsive to community needs, DANN will make modications to its internal policies regarding masking within ve school days of any changes implemented at the WCHD. Handwashing and respiratory etiquette will continue to be explicitly taught and daily protocols will be followed. DANN will continue to utilize hand sanitation in each classroom and provide stations throughout the school and on the playground. The DANN Board of Directors recently rearmed its commitment to cleaning and the maintenance of healthy facilities by requiring our contracted cleaning company to ensure additional nightly personnel and will continue to hire a day porter throughout the 2021-22 school year. High-touch surfaces will be cleaned throughout the day. Hand sanitizing stations will remain throughout the school. High touch surfaces in classrooms, building common areas, and the playground will be cleaned periodically throughout the day using approved cleaning products. Teachers will include students in the classroom cleaning procedures to the greatest extent possible including frequent opportunities for hand sanitizing and wiping down high-touch surfaces between activities and classes. In addition, DANN will continue its practice of hourly air circulation throughout the building and will ensure that custodial services regularly change air lters and clean air ducts. DANN will continue to employ a certied nurse (RN) on campus ve days a week. This employee will work directly with the WCHD to enact immediate contact tracing and exclusion practices consistent with the most recent WCHD guidance.

I am a Coyote; I am in charge of me. I am respectful, I am kind, I strive for excellence. 2 EIAA 2021 -2022 Path Forward Plan Disclaimer EIAA's Path Forward Plan will be adjusted to align with the local, state and CDC guidelines as they are adjusted. EIAA is a public school funded by the state. Our charter to operate as a school is through the Nevada Charter School Authority. The risks of n ot following CDC and state guidelines are as follows; loss of Charter, loss of funding, loss of license for professionals, personal financial impact for board memb ers and staff , and litigation. Circumstances regarding COVID -19 are fluid and social distancing protocols and other health and safety requirements are subject to change based on the advice of public health officials, including the State's Chief Medical Officer , the CDC, and local health officials . The purpose of this letter is to provide parents and current information for the 202 1-2022 school year. All quotes and information provided in the disclaimer have been pulled from Governor Sisolak's issues Declaration of Emergency Directive 044 -048. In accordance with Directive 044 authority for managing certain COVID -19 mitigation measures is delegated to district leaders and charter school sponsors. Superintendents and charter school sponsors (LEA Leaders) may determine capacity limits , social distancing protocols, and sanitation protocols while staying within the minimum requirements set through executive order. Within the plan schools must follow the Interim Final Rule (IFR) published by the United States Department of Education (USED ). The requirement clarifies that the plan must include how it will maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other school and LEA staff, and the extent to which it has adopted policies, and a description of any such policies, on each of the CDC's safety recommendations includi ng: Universal an d correct wearing of masks; Modifying facilities to allow for physical distancing (e.g. use of cohorts/podding) Handwashing and respiratory etiquette; cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including improving ventilation; contact tracing in combinat ion with isolation and quarantine, in collaboration with the State, local, territorial, or Tribal health departments; Diagnostic and screening testing; Efforts to provide vaccinations to school communities; Appropriate Accommodations for children with disa bilities with respect to health and safety policies; and Coordination with state and local health officials. Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public school s in Nevada .\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community, parents, and school e mployees. The state has made it known that the scenarios being used by schools at any given time can and will change based off COVID outbreak and current directives from the governor. \"Circumstances regarding COVID -19 are fluid and social distancing prot ocols and other health and safety requirements are subject to change based on the advice of public health officials, including the State's Chief Medical Office r\". \"Districts and charter schools will be required to adhere to emergency directives, public hea lth protocols, and NDE guidance throughout the 202 1-22 school year. While directives, protocols, and guidance may evolve to reflect changes in public health conditions, at any point in time the preva iling guidance will need to be upheld. 3 EIAA 2021 -2022 Path Forward Plan This policy incl udes measures we are actively taking to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. It is our goal to sustain a healthy and safe school in this unique environment. It is important that we all work together to eliminate outbreaks within the school so we c an keep ou r physical doors open. Reporting to the school nurse any positive results or contact with individuals who have positive results is an integral part of keeping our stakeholders safe. We assure you we will always treat your private health and personal data w ith high confidentiality and sensitivity. In creating EIAA's reopening plan, careful consideration of the CDC Guidance for Schools , and in conjunction with local health officials, an advisory group was formed to help inform the process. The plan must be approved by the Elko Institute for Academic Achievement Board o f Directors, State Public Charter School Authority, and the Nevada De partment of Education. Our top priority is to continue to provide high -quality and accessible learning opportunities to all students - without regard to means, ability, or at -home support - while ensuring the health and safety of students, staff, and commu nities. All individuals should monitor their health and symptoms (Appendix A). Any individual who does not feel well or is symptomatic should remain at home and away from others. When in public or at work, all persons should maximize physical distance from others. All EIAA team members should monitor to avoid those circumstances that do not allow for appropriate physical distancing. Again, every individual is responsible for the sa fety and health of themselves and those persons around them. Individuals returning to worksites who may have any of the serious underlying health conditions as noted by the CDC, should t ake any and all precautions necessary to protect themselves, especia lly while they are in the workplace. This may include (not all inclusive) maintaining social distances, following CDC recommended guidance for good hygiene and /or the wearing of proper equipment (ma sks) necessary to mitigate the contraction or spread of t he COVID -19 virus. Individuals should minimize any non -essential travel to hot spots. If an individual does travel to a hotspot, they should report to the school when and where they will be traveling so as to protect others and follow CDC guidelines rega rding isolation and protection of others. Individuals of the school who have receive a positive COVID test should notify the school immediately. If an individual with the school has tested positive or someone within the immediate household has tested positive the school needs to be notified as soon as possible so correct action can be taken. 4 EIAA 2021 -2022 Path Forward Plan Topic Subtopics Key Information to Address In-Person Learning: Health and Safety How will EIAA maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other school staff? Physical Health Screening Employees: Take their own temperature each morning BEFORE opening their classroom. Anyone with a temperature over 100.4 will be isolated and retested after 20 minutes of indoor rest. If elevated temperature remains staff will be sent home. If staff are able, they will teach virtually from their homes, with a substitute supervising their class. Staff may return to school once they h ave the okay from a medical professional or they are sympt om free without the aid of medication for 24 -hours. Students: When students arrive at school, they will immediately have their temperature checked. If their temperature is within normal r ange, they will wash their hands with soap and water and report imm ediately to class. STUDENTS WILL NOT BE LET IN THE BUILDING BEFORE 7:45am. Students who have a temperature over 100.4 will be provided a mask, isolated, and retested after 20 minutes of indoor rest. I f elevated temperature remains parents will be called t o pick them up. Due to social distancing protocols and temperature checks it is imperative that we stagger pickup and drop off times when ret urning to school full time. We understand work schedules can be tough and some families are dropping off multiple students that may not fall within the same time slot. Please do your best to accommodate the following pick up and drop off times to help us eliminate l ong lines for temperature checking. Students with the last name that starts with A -K will drop off at 7:45 . Students with the last name starting with L -Z will drop off at 7:55 Upon notification that a positive test occurred, in consultation with local health officials, the school will assess the risk , proceed with appropriate cleaning protocols, di sinfecting, and contact tracing. With guidance from the local health officials, necessary students and families will be notified in a confidential matter that there has been a positive case confirmed. Any student or staff member who lives with an individua l with a positive result for COVID will follow the guidelines given by local health and medical professionals as to when they can return to school. Distance education will be provided during the time a student is out of school. Physical Hygiene On the f irst day of school all teachers will teach proper handwashing techniques to all students, the proper use, removal and washing of face coverings, how to safely cover coughs and sneezes , and how to limit contact in the classroom setting. Masks are recommended by EIAA but are not required . Since soap and water are not readily available in the classrooms, hand sanitizer and/or Antibacterial Wet Wipes will be used. Hand sanitizer/Wet Wipes will be used at each transition between classes/su bjects, or more often as deemed appropriate by the classroom teacher. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities EIAA purchased 5 non touch thermometers to take temperatures of students and staff every morning. Temperatures will be taken as directed by local and state officials. Facility will be cleaned with CDC approved cleaners and following their guidelines daily. If there is a positive case, Janitorial will take additional measures to ensure surfaces and facility have been cleaned to re duce chances o f spread. Diagnostic and screening Any staff, students, or volunteers who have any symptoms will be asked to leave the school until they have a Dr. release or h ave been symptom free for 24 hours without the aid of medication. 5 EIAA 2021 -2022 Path Forward Plan In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing How will the school meet students' social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs and provide access to a safe and inclusive learning environment? How will the school support educator and staff well-being? Students and Families EIAA will continue to fund a \u00bd time social worker position in addition to a \u00bd time life skills coach. All classes will receive a life skill special to help support student mental, social, and emotional wellbeing. Students will work with our social worker and life skills professionals in small groups and individually as needed. Every class will continue to implement the 7 habits of healthy kids within their classrooms. EIAA will continue to team up with outside organizations to provide needed resources to families and students. Staff Every Wednesday the first 10 -15 minutes of PD wi ll be designated to the mental health and wellbeing of our staff. Administration will work with staff to maintain open communication and supports. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning How will the school address the impact of COVID -19 on students' opportunity to learn, including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, and effectively using data? Instruction EIAA has teamed up with RTB Data and Consulting to analyze all data and provide professional development for administration and teachers. Teachers will pre -assess all students coming into the 2021 -2022 school year. Academic goals will be set using data and leadership binders. Academic goals and plans will be shared with parents on an ongoing basis. Student data and interventions will be tracked and adjusted as data shows. Teachers will work collaboratively on Wednesdays to analyze student data and plan accordingly. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in -person How will the school ensure that any student who is in quarantine on the advice of local public officials is able to participate in distance education? Online Education Students who are under quarantine due to a medical professional and/or school requirements will continue to be provided with quality instruction and support by EIAA staff. Teachers will maintain close contact with both student and parent to facilitate the success of student through the quarantine process. Chromebooks and hotspots will be provided as needed. 6 EIAA 2021 -2022 Path Forward Plan Distance Education: Emergency Closure How will the school ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event that the school must be closed? Full Distance Learning Students are required to login daily to advance their studies. If students do not login to advance their studies, a licensed teacher or substitute teacher will attempt to contact each student via electronic means or by telephone at least once per instructional day; if a student's lack of access to a te lephone or phone service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record attempted contact once per week . Any student who is quarantined on the advice of local public health officials receives access to distance education. Licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes are accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. Chromebook and hotspots will be provided as needed. Distance Education: Supporting Students How will the school ensure continuity of services, including access to necessary technology and resources, special education and EL services, and nutrition services, for students participating in distance education? Supporting Students in Need SPED and ESL Speech and Language Students will be serviced online. Push -in time and pull -out time will be met by a Google Meet sign -up sheet with SPED staff. Group meetings will be recorded for students who cannot attend at that time. In addition, students can sign u p for one-on-one time. Time will be focused on meeting IEP goals. Technology Needed technology to meet IEP goals will be provided to students as needed. Chromebook and hotspots are available as needed. Food Services EIAA will work with families and community resources to help fill any gaps or needs within nutrition and food services. EQUIPO ACADEMY 2021-2022 PATH FORWARD PLAN 1.1Dear Equipo Team and Family, Sixteen months ago, the events of the COVID-19 pandemic changed our lives and our classrooms, but they never interrupted our work. From our first conversations together, we committed to leverage all the strengths of our team to support one another, to get resources to those who need them, and to keep teaching no matter what. Last summer we prepared our initial reopening plan to transition from an entirely online program to a hybrid program. Now, hundreds of meetings and many months of work later, we are ready to begin our next transition to a more normal and fully in-person instructional program. This plan represents many hours of brainstorming, feedback, and problem-solving with stakeholders across our team at every level. Thank you to each and every one of you for everything you have done and will do to ensure we continue proving: \"Impossible is not. \" The Equipo Academy Board and Leadership TABLE OF CONTENTSFederal and State Guidance 4 Equipo Priorities 10 Health and Safety 16 Program Walkthrough 24 Appendices 37FEDERAL & STATE GUIDANCE CHILDHOOD MEDICAL RE-OPENING GUIDANCEStatement from the American Academy of Pediatrics on June 28, 2020. \"The AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.\" \"The importance of in-person learning is well-documented, and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020.\" \"Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation. This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there has been substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and families.\" CDC RE-OPENING GUIDELINESBased on Centers for Disease Control guidance for COVID-19 Prevention in K-12 Schools (7/9/21), Equipo Academy is positioned to open fully and pending state guidance may reduce mask requirements for vaccinated individuals. NEVADA RE-OPENING GUIDANCEBased on Nevada' Health Response's continued adoption of CDC guidance, we expect to operate fully in-person following CDC guidelines for mask use. We continue to monitor state and local guidelines for additional requirements. NDE SCHOOL RE-OPENING GUIDELINES NDE has directed all schools to submit plans for a return to in-person instruction with limited medical exceptions for specific students to participate in distance education.SPCSA SCHOOL RE-OPENING PLAN REQUIREMENTSThe SPCSA has directed schools to incorporate various considerations in their path forward plans including COVID-19 mitigation measures and contingency plans for any emergency closure that could occur. EQUIPO PRIORITIES EQUITY STATEMENTEquipo Academy believes in the potential and ability of every student in our community. Understanding that the world does not allow all students or families to start from the same level playing field, we believe that we are obligated to provide each student with the unique supports that they need to be successful. These supports include but are not limited to the Nevada Department of Education recommendations of: an environment where student students are valued, respected, and see themselves in their curriculum and instructional materials while experiencing academic success without regard to dierences in age, gender, socio-economic status, religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, native language, national origin, or citizenship status. OUR CORE INSTRUCTIONAL MODELHigh Expectations for All Every member of our team can and will meet our highest expectations. We will clearly define ambitious achievement goals for students and sta and we will build partnerships for meaningful engagement from parents and families. Transformational Teachers and Leaders Nothing will impact our students so much as the teachers supporting them on their journey, and nothing will empower those teachers more than the leadership at the head of the school. We will invest more energy and resources into cultivating exceptional human capital than any other aspect of our campus.A Pathway To and Through College We seek more than college access for our students, we seek college success. We are not only preparing our students to get to college, but preparing our families and community to support them through college as well. We will empower families with the tools, data, and opportunities to transform the odds for their children and advocate for their community.Innovation Driven by Data We believe there is no silver bullet. Instead, we commit to an ongoing cycle of data gathering, analysis, reflection, and innovation. We will never be afraid to change practices or habits to better meet our mission, but we will always hold ourselves accountable to prove that our innovations deliver on our bottom line.The Joy Factor We work hard, so we play hard. Our mission is challenging and the obstacles our students face can be daunting, so we undertake them with joy and creativity. We celebrate successes and recognize achievement. In so doing, we build deep commitment that inspires our team to work harder and work longer to solve problems others call \"impossible.\"The challenges in returning to full in-person instruction will require us to think outside the box and develop creative ways to address obstacles. These challenges, however, will not alter the core components of our instructional model.Ensure access to in-person instruction for all students and sustain homebound medical learning where needed. Explicitly teach social distancing, personal hygiene, and respiratory etiquette so every team member has an opportunity to engage in in-person instruction. Expand technology and wifi solutions for all students who are homebound to avoid missed instruction due to health. Restore the in-person instructional, social emotional, and nutrition supports for students and families that empower all students to fully engage in instruction. Continue supports for students with special needs and emergent bilingual students across delivery methods (in-person or remote). Coordinate and leverage sta strengths to address unique needs of students in the return to in-person instruction.PATH FORWARD PRIORITIESDeliver rigorous instruction that prepares every student to excel to and through the college of their dreams. Provide a full week of in-person programming to recover learning loss. Build strong advisories that will form the heart of our in-person instructional work and support through regular and unanticipated emergency situations 2021-2022. Advance student resumes and extracurricular engagement to continue expanding college access. Engage families as partners who deeply understand and can advance our work for students. Find more ways for students and sta to collaborate and work as a team across social distancing and other limitations from the COVID-19 pandemic.EXCELLENTEQUITABLE&Reopening priorities were identified from multiple stakeholders and centered around the school goals of providing excellent and equitable instruction through this crisis.ACCELERATING INSTRUCTION TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF COVID High Expectations for All As local teachers and community leaders, we understand the loss of student investment in large urban schools and the struggle to engage parents across separate zones and buildings in East Las Vegas. We have built an integrated 6th to 12th grade campus for 800 students and hundreds of alumni, where families build real partnerships with their students' teachers from sixth grade through college graduation. More time to learn. More time for team. The challenges our students face are not limited to a traditional school day and neither are we. We will leverage an extended daily schedule on an extended school year calendar to reach our ambitious goals. We also commit to be there for one another any time a member of our team needs support. All sta will be given Remind accounts to address student and family challenges after hours, we will partner with local organizations to oer classes and opportunities for parents, and our facilities will be used after hours for potluck dinners, special events and extracurriculars. We will work for our families to see the school as a center of the community and a means for empowerment. The \"Commitment to Excellence\" In individual home visits, vaccinated sta members will join each students and their family to sign a \"Commitment to Excellence\" that codifies our high expectations for student work, family involvement, and sta responsibilities. Beyond merely demanding that students engage and participate in every class, the commitment challenges families to read together, solve problems collaboratively, and participate in all-team events. We will all hold ourselves to this commitment every day, in every setting, and it will guide us in tackling the challenges of recovering learning losses. Investment in Human Capital We will recruit the greatest teachers and sta and then we will invest significant time and energy in their development so they have the capacity to grow our school. With an intensive summer on-boarding, co- teaching structures and an ongoing coaching process, we create a pipeline of exceptionally talented teachers and leaders with the potential to lead our school and replicate its transformational impact on the community. The COVID-19 pandemic presented all forms of challenges we had never faced before. The challenge of accelerating instruction, however, is one we have overcome and know well. Our acceleration strategies include seven components.Arts and athletics As a small campus we may not be able to oer every sport or every creative opportunity, but those that we do provide will be exceptional. Our coaches and instructors in extracurriculars extend our high expectations, using their projects and practices as further opportunities to develop students into scholar athletes and scholar artists who can balance their academic and extracurricular work and become leaders in any arena. The interests lit in these opportunities drive students investment in a liberal arts education and socio-emotional well-being. Challenging curricula in every subject at every grade We expect all of our students to take rigorous Advanced Placement courses and college entrance exams because we expect all of our students to graduate from four-year colleges. We backwards plan for this work in their middle school classes to set them up for success, and we will deliberately create rigorous syllabi and seminar course structures in the high school grades to prepare students for college coursework. In tackling learning loss from the pandemic, we are increasing collaboration vertically to address lost pieces of curricula across departments and grade-levels. Student support for the long-haul Too many college-prep programs succeed in getting students to college, only to see them struggle and drop out before earning a degree. The challenges of financial aid, living away from home, forming new friendships and interacting with professors can become overwhelming. Many of the country's highest achieving charter schools have only realized 30-40% college graduation rates from their founding classes. We address this challenge from day one. Beyond merely preparing students with the academic and character skills needed for higher education, we will build a support team that fosters independent student problem-solving and empowers students to see everything about themselves as a potential asset in their work \"to and through\". HEALTH AND SAFETY VACCINATIONS School vaccination dashboard (reporting school-level vaccination data only) to monitor access to COVID-19 vaccines in our school community and current vaccination levels for decision making. Ongoing vaccination clinics on-site at Equipo Academy and/or with neighboring partner schools and organizations to reach school and community vaccination goals. Hosting bilingual town hall events and info sessions with local medical professionals to answer student and parent questions and concerns about the vaccine. Advisory and health class education about how vaccines function, the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, and the use of vaccines for public health in this and other pandemics. Excusal of student absences for vaccination appointments and doctor consultations as needed. Leadership and board monitoring of CDC guidance regarding COVID-19 and booster vaccinations should they be needed, with on-campus resources provided to educate families and the community as necessary.Not yet vaccinated? Only partially vaccinated? Find your closest Nevada vaccination site at: immunizenevada.org/covid-19-vaccine-locatorEquipo Academy has organized weeks of vaccination clinics providing hundreds of vaccines to students, families, and community members. We plan to continue this work in the 2021-2022 school year to reach school and community vaccination goals for public health. MASKS AND SCREENING UNVACCINATED Daily health screening required at all times for all team members. Face mask use required at all times indoors. Not required outdoors. Eligible to participate in intramural school activities and extracurriculars on-campus only.Both groups required to Immediately report COVID symptoms or potential exposure immediately to school sta and/or SNHD Follow all expectations for social distancing, hand washing, respiratory etiquette, and classroom sanitationWhile Nevada and Clark County continue to see high levels of community spread of COVID-19 variants, Equipo Academy will dierentiate mask and screening expectations based on CDC guidance for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. VACCINATED Daily health screening not required unless COVID symptoms are present. Use of face mask is optional at all times with visible school photo ID (clip/lanyard holder). Eligible to participate in all interscholastic activities and school travel as well as on-campus activities and extracurricular activities.HEALTH AND WELLNESSThrough ESSER funding all students will continue to have access on-campus to a full-time community health worker with optional referrals to community physical and mental health providers and organizations. In orientation, students will be introduced to community health resources for physical and mental health. Additionally, instruction on the use of school resources, emergency helplines, and the state SafeVoice system will be provided. Implementation of the AVID curriculum in advisory classes will build on existing social-emotional learning work at Equipo Academy through the upcoming year. All sta have round the clock access to free counseling through an employee assistance program with referrals available to community providers for ongoing counseling. Equipo Academy works with the Harbor to provide referrals for families needing access to services for health and wellness. All Equipo Academy team members (students, parents, sta) will be trained to recognize signs of mental, physical, social or emotional challenges in students and each other. If you or a loved one are experiencing a health emergency right now Call 911 If you need help solving a non-emergency problem you can Visit Us or Call Equipo Academy at 702-907-0432 If you need non-emergency help anonymously, visit Visit SafeVoiceNV.orgADDITIONAL MEASURES Per CDC guidance, universal or randomized COVID-19 tests of healthy individuals will not be utilized at Equipo Academy for screening. Diagnostic COVID-19 testing may be required following CDC guidance for any symptomatic or potentially exposed team member at Equipo Academy. Any known infection (on- or o-campus) will be reported to the SNHD for contact tracing and public health guidance. Instruction on and resources for hand sanitizing, hand washing, and respiratory etiquette will be provided in orientations and advisory (instruction) and throughout the building (resources). Facilities will continue to be disinfected at an elevated level: throughout the day for frequent-touch and all dining spaces; daily for all other spaces. Social distancing will be reduced to 3 feet as allowed by SNHD and Equipo Academy will continue to deploy ventilation improvements through ESSER funding to increase building ventilation. Should an on-campus infection occur, all aected spaces and surfaces will be sanitized by electrostatic disinfection. All measures may be modified following CDC guidance to accommodate individuals with disabilities (for example, modified face covering accommodations for special populations).Equipo Academy will maintain the following additional measures to ensure the health and safety of all team members. The Leadership Team and Governing Body will monitor data dashboards through the implementation of the Path Forward to adjust policies and target resources as needed. MEDICAL EXCEPTIONSEquipo Academy will accommodate students as needed for public health quarantine or professional medical instruction to isolate due to a condition that would endanger others or be compromised by in-person activities. A qualifying student (under quarantine for public health or isolating due to verified medical condition) will receive access to Equipo Academy's homebound distance education program. This includes access to needed technology for the duration of their quarantine, treatment, or medical guidance. An in-person or virtual orientation meeting will be held for each student and family participating in homebound distance education. This meeting will clarify all expectations, introduce relevant sta, and coordinate student services including nutrition programs. Qualifying students will participate daily with recorded attendance in Infinite Campus during regular school hours. The homebound distance education program is a state-mandated medical exception for distance education and not an opt-in \"online class\" or \"Zoom school\". Each student participating full-time in homebound distance education will be contacted by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher at least once per instructional day with weekly home visits to supplement provided work for public health quarantines or medical exceptions longer than 10 school days or wherever other means of daily communication are unsuccessful. Any homebound distance education will include appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plans. The Special Education Director or Zoom Program Director will participate in the orientation meeting and review needed services and schedule online sessions with licensed aides and highly-qualified aides to deliver intervention minutes while the advisor and case manager will monitor student grades and attendance for evidence of learning and engagement outcomes. Licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes will be accessible to all homebound distance education students through the internet or via telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. Homebound distance education students will always have access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled as nutrition services are generally provided by Equipo Academy. These services may be through parent pick-up or by sta delivery as arranged with homebound student families.EMERGENCY CLOSUREWhile we have prepared for a full return to in-person instruction, we understand from the events of the past year that our world can change in an instant. In the event of a situation that required a closure of in-person instruction, Equipo Academy would return to the Winter 2021 closure process developed at the onset of COVID. The instructional program would immediately reorient around advisories meeting on Zoom. This model meant that all students were able to continue instruction with no interruption (for example, a closure on a Wednesday night would not prohibit the majority of students from having access to their advisor the next morning on Zoom). Given notice of an open-ended or extended closure of in-person activities, up to 5 days would center on advisory meetings with students completing distance education work with the support of their own advisor and the grade-level class advisors monitoring student engagement and work progress. Beyond 5 days, Equipo Academy would implement its online block schedule (Spring 2020) to resume new content instruction in classes and to expand beyond advisory meetings. This format can continue as long as needed. If it were to become safe for in-person instruction to resume in a limited form, Equipo Academy would implement its hybrid instruction model (Fall 2020) prioritizing access for FRL, emergent bilingual, and students with IEPs. Once it was safe for all students to resume in-person instruction, the path forward plan (Fall 2021) would resume. In any scenario, weekly online family meetings would resume to provide clear and immediate two-way communication to families on a scheduled timeline. School leadership would be responsible for emergency announcements and two-way communication with sta to relay announcements and information to students and families. Advisors would be responsible for two-way communication with individual students and families through any closures or transitions. Food services would be continued in any scenario, using if necessary community partners for food services where regular providers are not available, and drive-through and delivery services as needed for any family unable to access the school. Intervention services for students with IEPs, emergent bilingual students, and students would continue uninterrupted in any format - online, hybrid, or in-person - if school closure were necessary and/or during a return to in-person instruction. Equipo Academy would follow guidance from NDE and the SPCSA in the event contingency days needed to be used to ensure no further learning loss, or to reduce scope or sequence of curricular or assessment plans if a term were shortened.PROGRAM WALKTHROUGH ARRIVALGOAL: SAFELY SCREEN EVERY TEAM MEMBER On arrival, all team members will scan photo identification badges with proximity RFID to quickly log their arrival and indicate their health clearance. Vaccinated team members will be immediately cleared to enter the building. Unvaccinated team members will continue to participate in daily health screening (symptoms, temperature, and mask check). Daily health screenings for unvaccinated team members start at home with phone app and are confirmed by sta on arrival. Masks required for unvaccinated team members, may be removed to eat or drink when seated three feet away from others. Two arrival zones with six distinct entry paths may be used as needed to building prevent crowding and direct team members to their workspaces. Required photo identification badges with proximity RFID for quick entry and to verify vaccinated campus guests cleared to visit during instructional hours.ADVISORYGOAL: A CONSISTENT , DAILY ROUTINE WITH A DEDICATED ADVISORDuring remote instruction in the last two school years, Advisories became a critically consistent routine in an uncertain learning environment. As we transition to a full re-opening plan, we plan to keep advisories at the heart of our work. Each morning students will begin their day in a small-group advisory meeting to check-in with a sta member they know and to receive information on procedures and expectations for the day. Advisories include socio-emotional lessons and use the AVID framework for student support.The daily advisory structure and routine creates a home base for each student regardless of in-person or remote attendance.In advisory, students learn new procedures and information before the day starts and engage in socio-emotional learning as we continually adjust from the COVID-19 pandemic.Students in advisory have a talk space to interact directly with sta and to get feedback from an advisor. ACADEMIC CLASSESGOAL: SAFE, COLLABORATIVE, RIGOROUS INSTRUCTION FOR ALL STUDENTSInstruction will be delivered in our smallest class sizes averaging 25 students per class compared to 40+ in many traditional secondary classrooms at peer schools. In-Person MS Homerooms MS students will work in five separate 24-student homerooms, seated three-feet apart in large 1200-1400sf classrooms. In-Person HS Sections HS students will work in sections of each course averaging 26-students seated three-feat apart in medium 900-1200sf classrooms. Each grade except 12th grade (smaller enrollment) will be divided into five homerooms or sections to ensure our smallest class sizes for health and safety and high-impact instruction.Equipo Academy has invested heavily in new materials and high-quality texts, technology, and science and extracurricular supplies to support a return to physical, in-person work.All content will continue to be organized in the Canvas LMS for flexible instruction options to support students who may need to quarantine and any possible emergency changes to the reopening plan. TRANSITIONSGOAL: PRACTICED, SAFE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN LEARNING SPACESDuring transitions, social distancing will be required and sta will be outside every classroom and restroom in all hallways to provide continual supervision. Middle school students will travel with the same homeroom to minimize transmission opportunities for any infection. Instruction on all transition procedures including timing will be provided to students during the summer orientation. Middle school homerooms will travel together through the day rotating as a homeroom to simplify transitions and minimize exposure in the event of any infection or needed contact-tracing.Arms-length social distancing (3+feet) will continue to be required of all students regardless of vaccination status.Longer transition times for movement will be practiced in small groups during orientation prior to the start of instructional days. LUNCHGOAL: FEED STUDENTS SAFELY AND SUPPORT SAFE STUDENT INTERACTIONS AND ACTIVITYAll students will go straight to tables where they receive grab-n-go lunches. During the lunch period, laptop filtering software will allow students to access an internal video chat platform to interact with peers who may not be near them physically. We are additionally exploring options to stream video and music content free for students. PE teachers will lead team stretches and building-wide physical activity to close the lunch period. All lunches will be provided to tables in grab-n-go form to reduce crowding and protect students' social time with each other.Sta will conduct a virtual orientation meeting with any medical/quarantine homebound students using distance education to arrange their access to food and other services.Additional time will be added to lunch once a week on Thursday for team events, outdoor BBQs, and other family meals with sta to support team-building and social emotional learning. DISMISSALGOAL: SAFELY CLEAR THE CAMPUS At dismissal, students will leave the building in three groups through two zones that each have three dierent exit ways. 1.Riding students released first from rear exits. 2.Walking students released second from front exits. 3.Driving students released last from rear exits. Students staying for approved extracurriculars or needing a waiting space after pick-up will work at distanced tables in the Common Space.Staged dismissal through multiple building exits will limit crowding and expedite students' departure from campus. Updates from advisors to Remind parent groups will maintain parent engagement in what has happened each day at school. Daily report sent to all team members with announcements and updates on health advisories.After the daily report, all non-emergency team communication will be muted for the day to protect time with friends and family. ARTS, ATHLETICS, & EXTRACURRICULARSGOAL: ALLOW STUDENTS TO CONTINUE ENGAGING IN ARTS, ATHLETICS, AND EXTRACURRICULARSArts, athletics, and extracurriculars inspire students to find and pursue their passions. By restricting participation in any interscholastic matches or performances to vaccinated students and by conducting additional health screenings, we aim to allow students to safely participate in approved extracurricular activities after school and during two weekly extracurricular time periods. Temperature and health screenings conducted for all unvaccinated student artists, athletes' and club members prior to practices and meetings outside regular school days.Fans or crowds will be allowed at events or performances following SNHD guidance for distancing and screening to protect the students and sta involved.Live streaming and video recording with parental consent will be used to allow other students and families to see the extracurricular work of our students. THE JOY FACTORGOAL: PLAY AS HARD AS WE WORKJust as we believe it will be important to continue working hard in 2021-2022, we also believe it will be important to play hard and find opportunities to celebrate. A Class Advisor assigned to each grade-level will coordinate the class culture and events for their grade-level. Extracurricular periods in the daily schedule and end of year trips (pending COVID-19 immunization) will provide school-level Joy Factor events.Two Extracurricular Blocks on Mondays/Fridays allow small groups of students to commit to an extracurricular of their choice for 70 minutes each week.Creative class culture events and celebrations coordinated by a dedicated Class Advisor assigned to each grade.Class trips restored for immunized students to visit colleges and experience curricular learning o-campus with virtual options for unvaccinated students. FRONT OFFICE SERVICESGOAL: MAINTAIN EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE IN A SAFE FORMATAll major front office services (applications, enrollments, records requests) will continue to be oered as remote services to manage in-person interactions. For services that do require coming to campus, families can once again access the front office with distancing and capacity limits for safety. Finally, ongoing surveys and check-ins will continue to be utilized to ensure that family experiences with Equipo Academy continue to represent our core value and genuine engagement with each and every member of our team and family. Our new website with live chat allows families to access more front office services from home with a smartphone/computer.For services requiring a parent to come to campus (ie. picking up a student) our office has fully reopened with distancing. Paperless application, enrollment, and registration workflows will be continued to reduce paper and pen tasks with visitors.Ongoing check-ins and surveys to manage family experiences with Equipo Academy through the return to full in-person learning. WELLNESSGOAL: CARE FOR OUR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THIS CRISISPeople are the core of Equipo Academy and it is because we recruit and retain great people - from students to sta - that we are able to do great work. We propose several initiatives to support the wellness of our team. 1.A return to live, in-person physical education instruction. 2.Continued expanded channels for counseling and therapy resources from EAP to an on-site social worker. 3.Referral to free testing options for sta and students exposed to COVID-19. 4.Ongoing nutrition programs through the crisis.A return to live, in-person physical education instruction centered around the Presidential Fitness benchmarks will help us recover team health metrics.Expanded counseling and therapy resources for students, sta, and parents in the 2021-2022 school year. Multiple testing options (including free o-site and scheduled on-site) for sta and students, prioritizing unvaccinated or symptomatic individuals.Ongoing community nutrition programs and food drives to support families. FACILITIESGOAL: ELIMINATE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 OR ITS VARIANTS THROUGH OUR FACILITIES.Increased disinfection procedures and resources during operating hours and multiple layers of building disinfection after-hours to protect all learning and workspaces at Equipo Academy. All classroom surfaces fully disinfected daily with frequent-touch/dining surfaces disinfected throughout the day. In the event of any confirmed on-campus infection, electrostatic disinfection conducted in aected spaces.Separate, professionally maintained rooftop HVAC units servicing each classroom and building fans running continuously to circulate air through all building spaces. Additional fresh-air and HVAC ventilation capacity improvements through ESSER funding. Sanitation stations (including hand sanitizer, disposable drinking cups, towels and disinfectants) in every classroom for personal and classroom hygiene and to support students with hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Direct instruction provided in required orientation.EQUIPO ACADEMY 4131 E BONANZA RD, LAS VEGAS, NV 89110APPENDICES DAILY SCHEDULEA return to a more regular daily schedule will address the greatest resource inequity of the COVID-19 pandemic - time to work face-to-face each day with eective teachers.

Tuesday, July 28, 2020 Ms. Jennifer King, Please find responses to your requests for clarification below. These responses represent additional information from our Governing Body and administration's discussions, and no material changes to the plan as submitted. -Technology: Equipo Academy had already accumulated sufficient Chromebooks and technology systems prior to the COVID-19 outbreak to maintain a 1:1 student-to-laptop ratio. We have continued to order additional devices throughout the crisis to replace devices that stop working and to maintain a reserve for future repairs. When a student has an issue with a laptop, they can call their advisor, the office, or submit an online repair form. A new laptop is made available at our lunch drive-thru or brought to them by an operations team member, and their broken laptop is collected for repair. For new sixth graders and other new students, laptops will be distributed at a drive thru on the school site the week of August 3, 2020. -Internet Connectivity: Equipo Academy established a contract in April 2020 with AT&T to provide unlimited data hotspots to students and staff with internet connectivity challenges. Additionally, our Title I-funded Dean of Families has partnered with families to assist with applications for and coordinating installation of reduced-price internet services from other ISPs. In the Spring 2020 semester, we were able to coordinate connectivity for every student and family. We continue to be disappointed in the high expense and poor service of most solutions - as companies like Cox refuse to provide service to students whose parents have past outstanding balances and as wireless carriers charge significant fees ($80/student/month) for their devices. We continue to advocate to all political representatives for our district and state that more should be expected of local ISPs in this crisis as schools cannot pay for internet connectivity indefinitely without new funding. In the event that no solutions or new funding are provided, Equipo Academy may need to switch to paper correspondence which would significantly reduce learning outcomes for students and create even greater disparities between our students and more affluent students and families. 4131 E Bonanza Road LAS VEGAS, NEVADA 89110 702-907-0432 -Attendance: Equipo Academy will continue to expect daily attendance for each class period and advisory from all students. Attendance will continue to be reported each period by teachers using Infinite Campus, and attendance expectations for the fall have been presented to families in Zoom conferences throughout July and will be communicated again in individual conferences with advisors the week prior to instruction. Where students have a health or emergency excuse, or for students pending technology solutions for computer or internet connectivity issues, the Attendance Coordinator will arrange for asynchronous or paper based work. Because we are offering in-person and online instruction, and providing solutions for technology and internet access, our Governing Body did approve a full return to regular grading and attendance expectations from all team members - online or in-person. Thank you for your support. Please let us know if there are any further questions or concerns. Sincerely, Benjamin Salkowe Principal Equipo AcademyExplore Academy Las Vegas Re-opening Plan 7/12/2021 Esteemed Stakeholders, Please know that the health and wellbeing of our stakeholders is of critical importance. Explore Academy has worked with stakeholders in our community to create a plan that meets the needs of families, students, and staff, while prioritizing the physical and emotional health of all. All staff and students are encouraged to receive the COVID vaccine as recommended by the CDC and SNHD; this is the most effective way to prevent the spread of COVID. The following plan is designed to meet the diverse needs of our families while providing a top-quality education for our students, guided by four principles: 1. Explore Academy ensures that our families, students, and staff have all of their physiological, safety, and resource needs met. 2. Explore Academy focuses on human connectedness with interactions, experiences, and social-emotional learning opportunities that focus on relationships and community. 3. Explore Academy engages and supports parents as educational stakeholders. 4. Explore Academy creates learning experiences that are student-centric, focused on acquiring new knowledge while building new technological literacy skills. Gretchen Larsen Principal Communication Families will receive ongoing communication in their language of origin about the reopening process via email, text, and our frequently-updated \"Back-to-school\" guide. Weekly email updates will be sent to stakeholders detailing our ongoing efforts to keep students healthy and learning, reminders on how to protect oneself and others, as well as our progress with implementation of distance learning. Frequency Communication Purpose Ongoing Text, email Communication to stakeholders about reopening process, urgent updates Ongoing Back to School Guide General updates for families about the start of school Weekly Parent email Updates for families on individual student progress Bi-Monthly Student/Family/Staff email survey Social/emotional check-in data for monitoring Bi-Monthly Coffee With the Principal Check-in with stakeholders, update on progress toward school-wide goals Reopening the School Building Re-Opening Approaches For all plans, school will begin August 5 th according to the current calendar. The school will work under guidelines from the Southern Nevada Health District and any confirmed cases at the school or in the home of any member of the school (staff or student) will be reported to the SNHD for guidance regarding ongoing operation. The school is prepared to move partially or fully to closure (Backup Option B) for cleaning and monitoring. Stakeholders will be notified via text and email of any impending changes as soon as possible. Whether in person or online, classes will follow the same bell schedule and be in session for the full class period. Attendance will be taken online just as in person, and learning will continue fluidly. Plan A: School will begin with two cohorts, those who will attend in person, and those who will attend online with a note from a doctor or due to quarantine. Students learning from home will attend classes according to the regular bell schedule.Backup Option B : In the event that online classes are necessary, the school will communicate the shift to parents via email and text message. All students will learn from home, and all teachers will work from home. Distance Education: Emergency Closure In the event that the school must close for a period of time due to emergency, school will proceed in the following manner: Students will use their Chromebooks (we are a 1:1 Chromebook school) to participate in distance learning via Google Meets. If needed, the school will work with families that need internet access and provide a portable wireless hotspot or connect them with discount or free internet services. The daily schedule will remain the same, and students will report to their Google Meets for classes just as in person. Students will continue to submit assignments in Google Classroom, participate in discussions, and complete assignments. Extra support will be available in the flex classroom throughout the day, just as with in-person school. Social and emotional wellbeing will be monitored via survey. Academic Needs Students will be assessed using internal assessments to determine varied learning needs. Students will receive individualized support for learning gaps through Flex periods, utilizing tutors and small groups. In addition to the above, special populations such as students learning English and those with IEPs or 504s will continue to receive accommodations and services either virtually or in person. Physical Health Screening Students and staff will self-screen at home daily before reporting to school. Anyone who is feeling sick or who has a fever must stay home. Students will be screened again upon arrival at campus using a scanning thermometer. If a student or staff member feels ill or exhibits symptoms while at school, disinfecting protocol will be followed and the person will be isolated and sent home as quickly as possible. Physical Hygiene Explore will follow current CDC and SNHD guidelines regarding prevention of the spread of illness. Currently, all unvaccinated students and staff will wear face coverings while indoors on campus; everyone may remove masks outdoors. If prevailing guidance from the CDC or SNHD recommends masks for vaccinated individuals due to a high instance of reinfection or during periods of high community transmission, Explore will adhere to such guidance regarding the usage of masks. Unvaccinated students who are unable to wear a face covering for extended periods of time will learn from home. Hand sanitizer will be located at each threshold, and students will be reminded to use sanitizer upon crossing a threshold. Students will be taught to minimize the spread of germs through effective hygiene practices. Reminders will be posted throughout the school, in emails to parents, and reinforced by on-site staff. Social Distancing Students attending in-person learning will be spaced three to six feet apart in the classroom, during passing periods, and in common areas, including outdoors.In the morning, students will report to the cafeteria for breakfast. At dismissal, students will be called individually to the pickup line, leaving their classrooms one at a time in the order called. Students will maintain social distancing while queueing and loading into cars. Any changes to the current plan will be communicated to stakeholders via text and email, including the teaching of any new procedures. Whenever possible, impending changes will be communicated to stakeholders with notice of the procedure and opportunities to give feedback or express concerns. Contact Tracing Explore will keep a log of all individuals on campus each day. Student information will be traced via Infinite Campus, and adults and visitors will be tracked via log. This information will be provided to the SNHD as needed for contact tracing purposes. Diagnostic and Screening Tests Staff or students exhibiting symptoms of illness will be immediately isolated and sent home as soon as possible. Those exhibiting symptoms will learn or work from home until a negative test result is provided or such time as the SNHD recommends returning to school. Human Resources Staff Return to Work Staff members who are identified as vulnerable will notify school administration, and universal precautions and cleaning protocols will be followed to ensure the safety of all students and staff. Our staff will be trained on delivering online instruction by recording instructional videos, hosting live learning sessions, and supporting virtual learning for students. Reopening PD will include familiarizing staff with the various components of the plan, ensuring that protocols are followed and that any necessary changes in delivery method occur smoothly. In preparation for potentially increased absences, the school will seek to maintain a bank of available substitute teachers. Governing Body and School Leadership Role Weekly communications will be sent to all stakeholders regarding the safety of staff and students, updates on our ongoing efforts, and any anticipated changes. Our board will review the reopening plan that is submitted to the state for approval, and will take part in any revisions to the plan. Logistics Attendance Weekly stakeholder communications will include reminders on balancing in-person attendance with health needs, as needed. Students will be expected to be in their uniform and ready to learn at 8:00 AM daily, whether learning in person or online. Teachers will take attendance at the beginning of each class period for those in attendance at the school, and for those in attendance virtually.Should personal circumstances dictate missing a full or partial day of school, students will have 24 hours to complete missed content and submit it to be counted as fully present for each day. In the event that a student is not able to attend in person or virtually and no contact is initiated from the family, the school will initiate contact to ensure that expectations for attendance are clear and to see if the school can provide any support. Facilities Management Restrooms will be cleaned and sanitized twice daily. In the cafeteria, students will maintain social distance at tables, which will be cleaned after each use. Students eating on the turf will maintain three feet of distance. In classrooms, teachers and students will clean desks at regular intervals throughout the day. Hand sanitizer will be placed at each threshold for student and staff use, and at other areas as needed. Nutrition Services Students will receive pre-packaged meals from the cafeteria or bring a lunch from home. Students with a home lunch may choose to eat on the turf or in the cafeteria. In the cafeteria, students will wash hands, then collect their cafeteria food, maintaining six feet of distance in line. Students will then proceed to their table or the turf, if eating outdoors. Students who do not attend in-person learning can notify the school and make arrangements to drive through to pick up food during regular drop off or dismissal. If transportation is a concern, food can be delivered to those in need. Transportation/Arrival & Dismissal Arrival and dismissal will follow a structured pattern of five cars disembarking at a time. Students will exit their cars, then walk to the cafeteria, maintaining six feet of distance. Students eating breakfast will wash their hands, collect breakfast, and sit separately from those awaiting the start of class. At dismissal, students will be called from classrooms individually, reporting to the queue to load into cars in groups of five. Students will wait on marked spots for their car to be in the loading zone. Athletics/Extra-Curricular Activities Students will not stay after dismissal except as part of a pre-arranged agreement with a staff member or before/after-school care provider. Information Technology The school will provide chromebooks for families qualifying for free or reduced lunch as needed. Families and teachers in need of internet will be referred to community partners as necessary or provided wireless hotspots as available. Wellness and Recovery Social-Emotional Learning: Tier 1 Instruction will be engaging and exciting to encourage students to dive in with enthusiasm. Students will have opportunities to discuss academic and emotional concerns with staff during theschool day. The school will host activities to foster student engagement and social/emotional wellbeing. Ongoing lessons in mindfulness, healthy habits, and social skills will be delivered during Flex. Trauma-Informed Practices: Tiers 1-3 Before the start of school, staff will complete training on trauma-informed teaching. Students, families, and staff will complete a monthly self-check and submit via google forms for monitoring. Students will receive instruction and guidance on effective self-monitoring of social and emotional needs through their Flex periods. Families will be provided with resources for support services via ongoing stakeholder communication. Staff will have ongoing opportunities to report concerns about any students. Additionally, all staff and stakeholders will receive ongoing instruction on monitoring themselves and others for signs of trauma and mental health concerns. At tier 2, students exhibiting or self-reporting signs of concern will receive individual check-ins with staff, tools, lessons, and resources for coping, along with referrals to additional resources as necessary. At tier 3, students will be assessed for immediate need and referred for crisis evaluation and/or counseling.Founders Classical Academy of Las Vegas 21-22 Nevada Path Forward Plan INTRODUCTION: As defined by the Nevada Department of Education (NDE) and the Nevada State Public Charter Authority (SPCSA), Founders Classical Academy of Las Vegas (FCALV) is required to meet certain requirements related to Covid -19 for the 2021- 2022 school year: FCALV is responsible for determining certain COVID -19 mitigation m easures as defined by the SPCSA, and, therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID -19 on students' opportu nity to learn. Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, FCALV must develop a Path Forward Program Distance Education Plan for the 2021 - 2022 school year. This plan addresses how the academy provide s distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in -person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community, parents and school employees. This plan establishes an emergency distance l earning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emergency. Specifically, FCALV will address six elements in its Path Forward Program of Distance Education for the 2021- 22 school year: I. In-Person Learning a) Health and Safety b) Student and Staff Well -Being c) Accelerating Student Learning II. Distance Education a) Students Unable to Participate In-Person b) Distance Education: Emergency Closure c) Supporting Students IN-PERSON LEARNING In-Person Learning: Health and Safety FCALV maintains the health and safety of students, educators, and other school staff , acknowledging and promot ing any recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) , keeping in mind the unique geographic position of Las Vegas and the recommendations of state and local authorities : a) FCALV supports the u se of face coverings on school campus , especially those who are not fully vaccinated. Currently be aware that 1) stude nts and guests 9 years old and younger are not required to wear a face covering on campus, 2) students and guests 10 to 11 years older are required to wear a face covering on campus, and 3) students 12 years and older, school employees, and guests are requ ired to wear a face covering on campus unless fully vaccinated for Covid -19 (This is a state directive) . Note: Be aware that the CDC recommends face coverings for all individuals who are 10 years and older regardless of vaccination status. Certain exemptio ns can be granted in alignment with the governor's directives and for certain school activities and athletics , including eating, drinking, and outdoor activities . FCALV is committed to provide CDC -recommended face coverings to any students, staff, or guest s to the school campus upon request ; b) FCALV recogniz es CDC recommendations for social distancing; however, FCALV's position is to allow a less restrictive minimum of 3 feet of social distancing for elementary and middle school students whenever possible with an extension of 6 feet of social distancing for high school student s and adults whenever possible, mindful that instruction and educational delivery may limit specific social distancing lengths ; c) FCALV provides training and supports for proper hand washing and respiratory etiquette as defined by the CDC , including additional hand sanitizing stations ; d) FCALV practices diligent c leaning and maintenance to ensure healthy facilities, including improvin g ventilation and air filtration; e) FCALV maintains c ontact tracing by grade level and course, limiting extended interactions between grade levels and the elementary, middle, and high school students, especially in lunches, passing periods, and recesses ; f) FCALV supports d iagnostic and screening testing and utilizes that da ta to inform students and parents/guardians of possible Covid -19 exposures ; g) FCALV supports e fforts to increase access and awareness to vaccinations through its regular parent communications ; and h) FCALV provides appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to health and safety policies and as defined in IEP's or 504's . In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing FCALV meets students' social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs and provide access to a safe and inclusiv e learning environment with teachers regularly leading classroom and individual conversations with students to a ssess students' emotional state. When appropriate, teachers and administrators decide possible interventionists to be contacted to aid students and families -- parents, counselors, school psychologist, social services agencies, or law enforcement. Additionally, FCALV support s educator and staff well -being, promoting open communication and related supports. FCALV's counselor and school psychologist provide support and training to assess anxieties and stressors. FCALV has a supportive faculty and PTO that create environments and activities that bring the faculty together and demonstrate the appreciation for one another . In-Person Learni ng: Accelerating Student Learning FCALV will address the impact of COVID -19 on students' opportunity to learn, including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, effectively using data, and addressing resource inequities . FCALV will be actively remediating education loss due to Covid -19. Our priority is to collect data from 1) standardized tests administered last school year (SBAC and ACT), 2) specialized tests administered last year (English Language Learner with WIDA) and Special Education ree valuation testing, 3) the school's internal monitoring program (Lumos Learning which aligned to Nevada Content Standards), and 4) classroom/course pre -assessments to establish as baseline of content knowledge. FCALV will analyze this data to identify trend s and student groups that need remediation to ensure grade -level proficiency and/or course competency. Students identified in need of remediation will be identified, specifically in English Language Arts and Mathematics, and individualized learning plans w ill be developed, implemented, and monitored for growth. Additional educational assistance related to individualized ELA and Math Plans will be led by the school's Learning Strategist. The Learning Strategist will supervise the ELA and Math programs of rem ediation addressing educational loss (Covid -19), including the two Academic Coaches (providing pull -outs) and Teachers and Instructional Aides (providing after school tutoring). DISTANCE EDUCATION In accordance with this academy's Plan for a Path Forward Program of Distance Education for the 2021 - 22 school year, Founders Classical Academy of Las Vegas (FCALV) will ensure the distance education will be available to all students if they have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by at tending school in -person or if they are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. FCALV will ensure students participating in distance education have access to the technology necessary to participate in distance education, such as access to a computer and internet connectivity, or plan to provide accommodations for students without access to such technology. In addition, FCALV will ensure: (1) A licensed teacher or substitute teacher will attempt to contact each student via electronic means or by telephone at least once per instructional day; if a student's lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will attempt contact via other means (e.g., home visit) once per week and maintain a record of attempts. (2) The program of instruction will provide appropriate education for English Learners, studen ts with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plans. (3) Licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes will be accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. (4) FCALV will use a consistent method in Infinite Campus for recording contact with students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through a learning management system. FCALV will provide \"hybrid learning ,\" defined as any arrangement under which this academy provides in- person instruction concurrently with distance education through electronic means and correspondence. Daily attendance will be taken for a ll modes of learning: in -person, hybrid, and full distance. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physically present; and/or (2) The student participates in a real- time (synchronous) class session; and/or (3) The student meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who can implement the elements of the course, providing instructional support and assessment. If a student participating in distance education full- or part -time demonstrates any one of the three criteria, the pupil is considered present for the full day. If the pupil does not demonstrate at least one of the three criteria, they are considered absent for the full day. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in- person FCALV will ensure that students impact ed by COVID -19 will have the opportunity to learn and remediate education loss , including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, effectively using data, and addressing resource inequities . FCALV will be actively remediating education loss due to Covid -19. Our priority is to collect data from 1) standardized tests administered last school year (SBAC and ACT), 2) specialized test s administered last year (English Language Learner with WIDA) and Special Education reevaluation testing, 3) the school's internal monitoring program (Lumos Learning which aligned to Nevada Content Standards), and 4) classroom/course pre -assessments to establish as baseline of content k nowledge. FCALV will analyze this data to identify trends and student groups that need remediation to ensure grade -level proficiency and/or course competency. Students identified in need of remediation will be identified, specifically in English Language A rts and Mathematics, and individualized learning plans will be developed, implemented, and monitored for growth. Additional educational assistance related to individualized ELA and Math Plans will be led by the school's Learning Strategist. The Learning St rategist will supervise the ELA and Math programs of remediation addressing educational loss (Covid -19), including the two Academic Coaches (providing pull -outs) and Teachers and Instructional Aides (providing after school tutoring). To address students w ho are unable to attend school due to Covid -related issues, FCALV will comply to the directives of the governor's office, the Nevada Department of Education, and the State Public Charter School Authority. FCALV will ensure that any student who falls into one of the categories listed below is able to participate in distance education that meets the requirements established for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education . Students who have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in -person and students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials will be allowed to attend daily instruction in synchronous, on -line, live instruction. Specifically, parents/g uardians may request approval for the school's administration under the circumstances listed above. Upon approval, FCALV will provide technology and internet accessibility assistance as requested, and the assigned teachers will contact parent/guardians wit h platform log -in information and class schedules. Teachers will provide daily direct and live instruction via voice and video technology, integrating all students into the daily instruction. Materials will be distributed and collected for assessment electronically as much as possible. Some materials pick -up and drop -off may be required, such as textbooks, tools, and specialized items that support instruction. Distance Education: Emergency Closure FCALV will address the impact of COVID -19 on students' opportunity to learn, including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, effectively using data, and addressing resource inequities . Emergencies closure would be like the previous scenario with a more universal approach to impl eme ntatio n as the entire school transitioned between in -person and at -home instruction. The key to this smooth and seamless transition is communication and the quick implementation of these steps: a) Communication (paper and electronic ) of the school's plan and timeli ne for implementation of its Emergency Closure Plan ; b) School preparations of electronic devices, textbooks, and related classroom materials per class and course, prepared for distribution in the MPR by ES classroom or MS/HS teacher/course ; c) Distribution of electronic devices (ChromeBooks and Tablets) via c ar line distribution; d) Distribution of textbooks and related classroom materials via car line; e) Regular education teacher paper and electronic communications by class and/or course with platform log -ins, expectations, and daily time schedules of instruction; f) Special Education, ELL, and 504 teacher and facilitator paper and electronic communication to review accommodations and schedule service providers (Speech, Psychologist, OT); g) Learning Strategies, TOSA, and Tutor paper and electronic communication to ensure continuity of service relate d to Individualized ELA and Math Plan for remediation due to educational loss (Covid -19); h) Communications paper and electronic for the athletics/activities administrator related to athletic and curricular activities ; i) Communications paper and electronic for the school counselor and psychologist on academic and social emotional assistance and resources; j) Communications paper and electronic from the technology administrative assistant on devices, log-in, and internet accessibility; and k) Communications paper and electronic not less than weekly from the school's superintendent-principal with updates and communications on important deadlines.

Freedom Classical Academy School Re -Opening Plan 2021- 22 As the effects of COVID -19 and its variants continues to be felt, it is incumbent upon the school to plan for the safe and effective return to the school setting for the 2012- 22 school year. The purpose of this document is to provide an outline for such a plan. This plan will necessarily adapt and change to the exigencies of the moment as new guidance is issued by Federal and State Health experts and is not intended to represent a static set of rules or regulations. Adaptations to this plan will be consider ed in a public meeting except where an emergency declaration or public health mandate supersedes the authority of the Board of Directors of the school. Face Coverings State guidance on face coverings in school settings requires students and staff to cover their nose and mouth with a face covering in a manner consistent with current guidance issued by the CDC. Given this guidance; 1. All fully vaccinated staff and fully vaccinated students are not required to wear a mask at the school or school events (excluding school assemblies). 2. Any students or staff that are outside and can be socially distant are not required to wear a mask regardless of their age. 3. Masks are optional for any student in K through grade 3 (0- 9 years old). 4. Masks are required for all adu lts and students who participate in or attend assemblies. These restrictions are subject to change given further direction from the State / CDC. Handwashing All classrooms at Freedom Classical Academy (FCA) as well as several entrances and hallways have b een outfitted with hand sanitizer stations to enable students frequent opportunity to sanitize their hands. Additionally, students will be strongly encouraged to vigorously was their hands on classroom bathroom breaks that happen throughout the day. Younge r students, K -3, will receive a tutorial on the proper washing of hands to eliminate germs. Signage has also been erected to encourage hand washing and hand sanitation by both employees and students. Facility Sanitation School facilities will be sanitized daily to prevent spread of germs. Custodial staff will be on - hand both during the school day and after hours to ensure that classrooms and common areas are properly disinfected. Where classrooms are used by multiple students, custodial staff and teachers shall work together to sanitize surfaces between classes. Additionally, classrooms will be organized so as to maintain proper distancing requirements. All custodial staff have been trained in proper disinfection technique to ensure that chemicals have sufficient contact time to effectively eliminate contaminants. Additional equipment has also been requested as a part of the ESSER II allocation to enable quicker and more effective sanitation. UVC lamps have previously been purchased and will be rotated through spaces to provide addition disinfection. Contact Tracing FCA will work with the Southern Nevada Health District to facilitate contract tracing as necessary. FCA maintains accurate attendance records and will utilize those records as well as first-person interviews to determine potential exposure. The Director of Operations will conduct any contact tracing activities under the guidance and regulations of the Southern Nevada Health District. Any persons that ha ve potentially been exposed and are required to quarantine will be contacted by the Director of Operations and their information forwarded on to the Southern Nevada Health District. Diagnostic and Screening Testing FCA has the ability to provide rapid covid testing on- site thanks to a state program. Our school nurse has received the requisite training and as long as that program continues, will be able to administer rapid testing at the school. Students demonstrating symptoms of COVID will be required t o stay or be sent home if they come to school. Efforts to increase access and awareness to vaccinations FCA will make families aware of community resources for obtaining vaccinations via school newsletter. Accommodations for children with disabilities The Special Education Coordinator shall be delegated authority to make reasonable accommodations for children with disabilities in conjunction with parents and teachers. Meeting social/emotional/physical needs of students to provide a safe and inclusive environment FCA is undertaking a variety of measures to address the social, emotional, and physical needs of our students. 1. Purchase of SEL program that provides surveys and targeted SEL lessons . 2. Recommencement of leadership courses 3. Recommencem ent of clubs & athletics 4. Continuation of Social Worker Panorama, the SEL program being purchased, enables SEL surveys that help identify at -risk students and provide interventions. The school Social Worker will work with those students who are at significant risk and provide ongoing support. Supporting staff well -being FCA recognizes the challenges placed upon school staff in the current setting. To help staff succeed, FCA will provide: 1. Frequent informal check -ins 2. Ongoing coaching and support 3. Access to rapid testing 4. Ongoing staff appreciation gestures 5. Ongoing mental health awareness campaigns 6. Social Worker check -ins Accelerating student learning Freedom Classical Academy has spent a substantial amount of thought and effort evaluating the best methods for accelerating learning for the 2021 -22 school year. As a result of these efforts, the following changes have been made for the 2021- 22 school year: 1. Increased focus on literature in all classrooms 2. Decreased emphasis on CKLA program 3. Increased emphasis on CKHG and CKSci programs as primary language arts compone nts 4. Integration of standards mastery activities 5. Emphasis on small -group remediation in the classroom 6. Realignment of Special Education program 7. Addition of Reading Specialist 8. Addition of full -time ELL Coordinator 9. Addition of student dashboards 10. Recommencement of after -school tutoring Distance Education Distance education will be available only to students that provide documentation from a licensed doctor certifying that they have a medical condition that would put them at risk if they attend school in- person. Freedom Classical Academy reserves the right to deny requests for distance education if it determines the documentation provided is insufficient. Distance education for students with medical needs will be provided via synchronous instruction with the students participating with live classes remotely via web conference technology. Online students will be required to log in on- time and participate with the class in real time. Students will be required to complete the same work as their classr oom peers for all core courses; modification may be made for specials based on the individual circumstances of each student. Students with IEPs that receive distance education may be required to receive some services on campus where it is not reasonable / feasible to deliver these services in an online format. In these situations, every effort will be made to safeguard the student's health. Distance Education: Emergency Closure In the event of an emergency closure of ten days or more, Freedom Classical Academy will revert to the online learning model utilized last school year with the exception that Google Classroom will be our online learning platform in place of Canvas. 1. Core courses will be provided synchronously, daily. 2. Specials courses will be provided asynchronously 3. If the anticipated closure is 10 days or less, all students will attend online classes at the same time. 4. If the anticipated closure is longer than 10 days, students will be divided into AM and PM cohorts to enable smaller online classes. 5. Administration will make a determination on whether teachers will teach from the school or from home based on the circumstances surrounding the emergency closure. Distance Educa tion: Supporting Students In order to support students during distance education, FCA will undertake a number of measures, including: 1. Ensuring weekly contact with each student 2. Sending regular SEL surveys 3. Providing follow -up SEL lessons and support to students based on needs identified in SEL surveys 4. Ensuring each student has access to a computer and internet services 5. Providing additional academic support to struggling students. Futuro Academy 2021-2022 Path Forward & School Re-Opening Plan Background Superintendent Jhone Ebert and the Nevada Department of Education requested the submission of a Path Forward Program. In the program, schools have to provide details on their distance learning plan for full-time distance learning students for the 2021-2022 school year. There has to be key information included, such as how students were approved for distance learning, what the learning model will look like, and how attendance will be taken. The State Public Charter School Authority requested more information from schools, such as what schools are doing to ensure health and safety for all, what a school's in-person learning will look like, and what steps schools are taking to support students and staff with their social and emotional wellbeing. The 2021 Legislative Session produced Senate Bill 215. Schools are required to develop a distance education plan in the event of an emergency that may cause a school closure of at least 10 days. This way schools are more prepared to tackle any sudden closures, similar to what was experienced in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. In an effort to streamline all of the requested information, the State Public Charter School Authority has requested that schools submit a 2021-2022 reopening plan. In it, there are three key requirements: Requirement A: Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID-19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn. Requirement B: Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Distance Education Plans for the 2021-22 school year. This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Requirement C: Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community, parents and school employees. This plan 1 Section 8 of Emergency Directive 044 2 establishes an emergency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emergency. During the June 23, 2021 Futuro Academy Board of Trustees meeting, a crucial vote was undertaken to designate \"In Person\" instruction the primary model of instruction while allowing for up to 10% of students to enroll in virtual education by choice, with guaranteed medical exemptions granted for virtual education. SSafe Reopening for In-Person Learning FUTURO recognizes that the health and safety of students and staff is of the utmost importance, but also that in the 2021-22 school year, per CDC guidance, in-person learning should be maximized. FUTURO will seek data, guidance, recommendations, and/or approval from the Southern Nevada Health District, the Center for Disease Control, the Nevada Department of Education, and the Nevada Governor's Office. FUTURO will continually work with its families, staff, leadership and Board to implement Covid-19 mitigation protocols that are the safest for its in-person students and staff at any point in time. Ultimately, FUTURO will use all available scientific information to help make a determination on these matters. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette FUTURO will continue to promote proper personal hygiene: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Keep 3 feet between students, 6 feet of physical distance from others for adults Avoid contact with others if within 3 or 6 feet Wear a cloth face mask covering in public Avoid traveling if you are sick Stay home if you are feeling ill Get medical care as needed The campus will have an abundance of signage promoting positive physical hygiene. For example, each restroom mirror will have a sticker reminding students to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds. These visual cues will be incredibly helpful, especially for visual learners. In the event that a student may not be implementing safe and healthy hygiene practices, staff will re-educate the student and inform the student's parents. Diagnostic and Screening Testing Staff and students will self-screen their physical health. If any staff member or student is not feeling well and having any symptoms, that person will need to stay at home. They should only return to school when there are no remaining symptoms. If a student or staff member chooses to go to school while ill (no matter the illness), they will not be allowed in the classroom. For students, the parent will be contacted to take the student home and will not be allowed to return until they are symptom-free. For staff, they cannot return until they are symptom-free. In the event that a student or a staff member feels ill during the school day, they will be removed from the classroom. They will be asked relevant questions pertaining to their health and assessed by a staff member with a touchless thermometer. If it is determined that the student needs to be sent home, a parent will be contacted and their belongings will be gathered from the classroom for them. If it is determined that the staff member needs to be sent home, another staff member will cover their classroom/classes for the remainder of the day. They cannot return until they are symptom-free. A list of symptoms will be gathered from public health organizations. Each campus will have touchless thermometers and will be used at the discretion of school staff. Spaces will be created in our campuses for temporary isolation. If a student or staff member is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease, the person will be required to self-quarantine, and the Southern Nevada Health District will be contacted. FUTURO will work in consultation with medical and public health experts, the State Public Charter School Authority, and the Nevada Department of Education to determine the extent of testing in the school and if a closure is necessary. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities FUTURO will make multiple adjustments to each campus' facilities to minimize the risk of COVID-19. Hand sanitizer pumps will be placed on hallway stands in various locations throughout the campus. There is an increase in signage enforcing social distancing and healthy personal hygiene in hallways and classrooms. There are visual cues on the floor showing where to stand, wait, and move. There are decals in restrooms reminding individuals to wash their hands. Occupancy capacity signs are placed in each classroom. Desks will be arranged to be socially distanced to the maximum ability possible. Desks will be marked to show which ones are assigned to which students. Students will remain in their seats at all times. Furniture that is difficult to clean will not be utilized or replaced. All air filters will be monitored and replaced as needed and minimally on a quarterly basis. All shared items will be cleaned accordingly There will be limited use of the water fountain. Students and staff will be encouraged to bring their own water bottles, and bottle fillers have been installed for the 2021-22 school year Technology will be assigned to students as needed/requested All Emergency Operations Plans will be adjusted to accommodate social distancing guidelines while maintaining the necessary safety, urgency and precaution during Emergency Operations At each campus, staff will check the cleanliness of the campus to ensure a safe and health environment. All restrooms will be monitored regularly throughout the day to ensure cleanliness and cleaning logs will be maintained in a visible location outside the restrooms for enforcement. High touch points, such as water fountains, sink heads, door knobs, and student desks, will be cleaned regularly by FUTURO staff. Shared materials will be limited as much as possible, and they will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Face Coverings Our campuses will have masks readily available for anyone who wants it. Ultimately, FUTURO will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA for guidelines requiring face coverings, which as of writing of this plan maintains the use of masks indoors for students ages 12 and below and staff who work with them regardless of vaccination status. If face coverings become universally mandated for whatever reason, FUTURO will ensure that anyone stepping onto campus has a face covering on, or follow ongoing recommendations regarding vaccination and/or community transmission rate impact on school settings recommendations. Some of our students may not be able to wear a mask or face covering due to medical reasons. A doctor's note must be provided by a medical physician on their letterhead. IEP/504 students may not be required to wear masks based on individual needs. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staff that has tested positive for Covid-19, principals (or designee) conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in closed contact with the positive individual. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes. From there, the principal (or designee) will contact the Southern Nevada Health District. At that point in time, the length of quarantine will be determined. The Director will share that information with the principal. The principal will message the appropriate families. Social Distancing & Capacity FUTURO will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA when it comes to social distancing requirements and room capacity limits. FUTURO has measured each of its classrooms and maintains fire rating capacities for each common space for the purposes of planning. Accommodations for Children with Disabilities If students and staff have one of the disability types listed below, they might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness FUTURO will work with families of children with disabilities to see if in-person learning is the best option. If it is, then campus leadership will work with each family to develop an action plan that is both academically enriching and safe and healthy. Vaccination Access & Awareness FUTURO has and will continue to strongly encourage students, families and staff members to get their vaccinations if they are of age and health abides. FUTURO campuses will promote local vaccination sites to its staff and families, including continuing to hose campus based vaccination clinics. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing Being in the midst of a pandemic can bring a whirlwind of feelings within oneself. In any organization, it is critical for itself to make sure that the needs of its people are met. When it comes to students, those needs most likely also include socio-emotional needs and the trauma that can be triggered by a pandemic. For FUTURO, the wellbeing and mental health of staff and students are of the utmost importance. Supporting Students: Social-Emotional Learning - Tier 1 FUTURO will utilize multiple tier 1 social emotional support for its students across all campuses. These supports include: School-wide expectations and procedures Systematic reinforcements Culturally responsive practices Data-based decision making Partner & Community partnerships Classroom meetings Mindfulness practices Supporting Students: Trauma-Informed Practices - Tier 2-3 FUTURO will provide ongoing support to staff, students and families for their social and emotional needs. For students, it will be important for staff to recognize which students have more significant needs that require a more immediate response, as well as students who have emerging symptoms that require monitoring over time. FUTURO has to work and make decisions with these social emotional needs in mind. Universally, FUTURO will use these tier 1 trauma-informed practices & interventions for its campuses: Learning positive self-talk during daily circle times Weekly reflection meetings Practice problem solving skills Creating a \"calm down toolkit\" For more targeted and intensive support, FUTURO will use these tier 2 & tier 3 interventions: One-on-one weekly meetings between student and assigned staff member Behavior contract Restorative justice Use of empathy in multiple forms Supporting Educators and Staff FUTURO supports the mental health and wellbeing of its educators and staff. They are the driving force behind the success of the students and the campuses. FUTURO will focus on three main bedrocks in helping teachers. 1. Foster wellness. FUTURO has and will continue to educate staff about mental health and encourage open conversation about the challenges people are experiencing, employees may be more likely to access care when needed. 2. Provide training. FUTURO acknowledges that staff members may have different levels of ability with using virtual platforms and new learning technologies. FUTURO will emphasize differentiated support through the 2 weeks of summer professional development, and through the ongoing development calendar to include no less than one training day per month. 3. Model healthy behavior: FUTURO will encourage all school leaders to take care of their own physical, social, and psychological needs. By doing so, they serve as role models and set the tone that it is acceptable and necessary to take care of oneself. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning FUTURO is well aware of the potential negative effect of the school closures and the distance learning program with limited hours of instruction provided to students since March 2020. Therefore, we are excited to be able to resume offering a full-day in person / traditional learning program starting in August 2021. Implementing Assessments FUTURO will begin the school year with a comprehensive plan to diagnose and identify student needs. FUTURO will use every tool available to identify student needs and the learning gaps. Some of these tools include but are not limited to Brigance Screener for Kindergarten, NWEA MAP Fall assessment, classroom level benchmark assessments, Key Data interim assessment systems, and hearing & vision screenings. Leveraging Data to Inform Instruction The teachers will look at the beginning of the year data during the Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) meetings and prepare a comprehensive plan to meet the student needs. Schools will make the intervention groups during the first ILT meeting by the beginning of September. Tutoring and intervention services will be provided during the school day and after school time. FUTURO will utilize a wide range of programs to accelerate learning and close the achievement gap. In-Person Learning & Special Populations Special populations such as SPED, EL, and immigrant students will continue to receive services from licensed teachers. These groups will be identified and services will be provided in accordance with the Nevada State and Federal requirements and guidelines. Students will be served in their own groups and grant funds and other funds will be used solely to service these students. Path Forward Program: Distance Learning Futuro Academy (FUTURO) has created a distance learning plan for the 2021-2022 school year. FUTURO recognizes that there may be families that need to keep learning in a virtual environment. The distance learning plan is specifically designed for students: With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in-person learning, as determined by a medical health professional Who tested positive for Covid-19 Identified as close contacts of Covid-19 Affected by school closures and/or tightening government health protocols Limited to 10% aggregate enrollment of any grade level by choice after the circumstances above FUTURO is dedicated to maintaining high expectations and strong academic achievement for all students, whether full-time in-person or full-time distance learning. High-Risk Medical Exemption Process If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high-risk medical condition*, a Request for Virtual Placement may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021-2022 school year, and the request will require providing medical documentation. This was sent out to all families on July 7, 2021, with all returning and newly-accepted students enrolled. A health care medical professional must complete the exemption form and email it to FUTURO at any point during the school year. FUTURO will review the form, and either approve or deny. After approval of a medical exemption, a student will require medical fitness to return documentation to be allowed to return to in-person learning while Governor's Order 044 is in place. Students who are out on a high-risk medical exemption may not participate in any in-person learning, face-to-face extracurricular or on-campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID-19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. There may be times, like for important assessments, where students may need to be on campus. During these times, a safe, socially-distanced environment will be set up for the students to be in. Every person will wear a mask in these environments. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning at the first full day of instruction of the subsequent month of school. Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. Parent Considerations for Distance Learning Parents/guardians are asked to consider the following information when seeking full-time distance learning (DL) for their student: If a full-time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face-to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. A student participating in full-time distance learning who qualifies for free and reduced lunch, may receive meals at the school at no cost. Successful candidates for full-time distance learning must maintain 90% attendance monthly, and may be transitioned to in-person learning if in choice based distance learning and below attendance threshold Students will be expected to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real-time sessions during the school's instructional day. Kindergarten - 2nd grade will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions daily. 3rd - 5th grade will have a minimum of 90-120 minutes of real-time sessions daily. Full-time distance education elementary students must have an adult at home readily available to support their learning. Students will be required to attend school face-to-face for designated activities and assessments. Some courses/classes may not be offered through full-time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Parents will assist students in planning a time schedule for long-term assignments. Covid-19 Positive & Close Contacts - Logistics Full-time in-person students who have tested positive for Covid-19 must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. Proof of a positive test should be provided to campus leadership. Contact tracing will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus, and the SNHD will confirm the testing documentation. Full-time in-person students who have been identified as Covid-19 close contacts (from the school, SNHD, or personal connection for any case) must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership and in accordance with the most recent \"Covid-19 Guidelines and Protocols for Students\" document. Quarantined Students & Distance Learning We foresee there being two types of quarantines for full-time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. Individual/Limited number of Students When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in-person teacher. All work/activities will be accessed via Google Classroom, and instruction will be synchronous through Google Meet. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. When only a limited number of students need to be quarantined, students will attend via Google Meet synchronously during school hours while the homeroom teacher maintains their typical in-person schedule. Attendance will be taken in Infinite Campus. All assignments will be turned in via Google Classroom. Transitioning due to Public Health Conditions Worsening public health conditions can affect the learning model that is implemented. If the Southern Nevada Health District, Center for Disease Control, and/or the Nevada Department of Education enforce new directives, we will make those changes as necessary. It will be a smooth transition for us due to our experience, and we are equipped to adapt to the changes. Serving Special Populations in Distance Learning The distance learning program will provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plan. Special education teachers will meet virtually with students as needed to meet the mandated number of instructional minutes. School staff will consider alternative ways to provide equitable access and appropriate educational opportunities for students with disabilities, including exploring all available supplementary aids and services and related services to include online or virtual platforms, and/or other activities, such as paper/pencil activities. Documentation of all efforts to provide equitable access to educational opportunities is required. Special education teachers must document that the student is receiving his/her specially designed instruction through the approved instructional model on the status record. Related service providers must continue to follow current procedures to document services provided. Assessments, MDT meetings, and IEP meetings that do not need to be conducted in-person will continue to take place virtually or by phone. If the school cannot contact the parent/guardian to schedule an IEP meeting, the school will follow standard procedures. IEP teams must include any data collected, including any deficit areas, behavioral data, the effectiveness of accommodations, etc. A case manager or related service provider must provide how instruction is scaffolded or the background knowledge needed for the student to complete the assignments aligned to the Nevada Pre-K Standards or the NVACS and goals and benchmarks/objectives. When on campus for an IEP-mandated procedure, the IEP should also include input from parents/guardians regarding difficulties with the student's compliance with rules related to social distancing, wearing face coverings, washing hands, and other safety protocols. Goals, benchmarks and/or short-term objectives should be based on the current present levels of academic achievement and functional performance. Based on prior goals and benchmarks or objectives, the team should consider the student's anticipated progress for the remainder of the annual IEP. Student Attendance in Full-Time Distance Learning Each student participating full-time in distance education will must attend live via synchronous Google Meet participation to earn attendance for the school day while participating in Distance Learning. If a student's confirmed lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record attempted contact via other means (e.g., home visit) once per week and maintain a record of attempts. Staff will use a consistent method in Infinite Campus for recording contact with students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through Canvas. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physically present; and/or (2) The pupil participates in a real-time (synchronous) class session; Families may contact the main office of their campus if there is an attendance issue, such incorrectly marked absence. Ten consecutive unexcused absences with no contact will result in a withdrawal from FUTURO. Technology Access For any students without access to such technology, school leadership will work with families to ensure technology is accessible. Families will have to complete a form to borrow the technology for the school year. If approved, students will be provided with a hotspot and a Chromebook at no cost to the family. Families will receive training by a FUTURO staff member on how to use the technology if needed. If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year, families are encouraged to contact their teacher. Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year. Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus (at leadership's discretion). If there are greater issues in technology (i.e., internet service provider shutdown, blackout, etc.), distance learning can be done through paper correspondence. Student/Family Communication A teacher will schedule one or more conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the student is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is presenting some problem to the teacher, or in any other case that the teacher considers necessary. This conference may be requested by indicating so on the regular progress reports. Such conferences may be handled by telephone, in person, or via written communication If families and/or students call teachers, it has to be a viable conversation about academics to count as a present attendance mark. If not answered, a voicemail message should be recorded. A teacher will respond within 24 hours. If a student emails a teacher, the teacher will respond within 24 hours. Email communication sent on Fridays after 12:00 p.m. should expect a response by close of business on the non-holiday business day. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, campus leadership and the teacher will work together to provide resources. Nutrition Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school. FUTURO only serves lunch to K-12 students at its campuses. For virtual students to receive their lunch, the student and/or a family member will need to visit the campus in-person during a designated lunch period set by the campus administration. The school will then provide a lunch meal. A lunch meal will be not provided to anyone arriving before or after their designated lunch period, unless at the discretion of school administration. Important Note: The student and/or family member will be required to wear a mask and be socially distanced. Social-Emotional Support The pandemic has affected the social-emotional wellbeing of many people, students included. Staff are encouraged to get to know their students and build trust and respect. Staff are trained to identify and report anything out of the ordinary. Students have an open-door policy with all staff. When a student does need social-emotional support, it is critical that parents work in partnership with school staff to create an action plan. The goal is to cope, mitigate or solve the underlying issue that is affecting the student. By addressing trauma sensitively and thoughtfully, it will help heal the student holistically. Mask & Visitation Policy Distance learning students and their family members are required to wear masks when visiting their campus at all times. This is for the safety of the students and their families. Distance learning students and their families may only stay in the main office area. For them to move through the campus, they must be given permission from school leadership. IEP students are allowed to be on campuses if it is determined that they need services that can only be performed in-person. Emergency School Closure Learning Plan FUTURO recognizes that there may be emergency situations that shut down a campus for an extended period of time. Examples of emergency situations could include, but not limited to, a pandemic, a facility issue, or a natural disaster. Futuro Academy East Las Vegas (FUTURO) is committed to providing high-quality education to its students and has developed this emergency school closure learning plan. This plan will be made available to all staff, families, and students. This plan will succeed in delivering instruction online to meet students' elective and general education requirements. This plan will act as a guide to improve learning and enhance student success. It is also aimed to fulfill all applicable rules, regulations, and policies stipulated by the Nevada Department of Education and the US federal government. FUTURO will continue to use email, Google GSuite and the school website for normal communications with parents, students, and teachers. This plan is developed for at least 10 consecutive days of implementation. Education Management System Infinite Campus will continue to be used as the Student Information System (SIS). It will be the primary source of grading, attendance accounting and information distribution to students and families. Attendance will be recorded daily based on attendance in synchronous Google Meet sessions. Primary Online Learning Platform Google Classroom will be used by every teacher to relay classroom content and deliver classroom instruction. Google Meet will be the primary student platform for synchronous classes. Student Materials, Technology, Supplies Distribution A student survey will be delivered to families to determine technology needs at the start of each school year. Chromebooks will then be distributed to families at a time, date, and location, which will be communicated right away to families. Additional Outreach Emails will be sent weekly with operational and instructional details throughout the remainder of the emergency declaration to provide ongoing information on model updates. Staff Communication Grade level, department, and all staff Google Meet meetings are scheduled weekly as well as emergency staff meetings when necessary. How-to videos for curriculum, lesson planning, Google Classroom, grading, and other web-based programming are provided or created as needs are expressed by teachers. Leaders are included as teachers on all Google Classrooms to aid in student learning when needed. Teachers are required to contact parents via email or Google Voice phone number as an additional means of communication with students and parents. Weekly Department and Staff Meetings are held via Zoom large meeting platform. Page | 1 Girls Athletic Leadership School Las Vegas July 8, 2021 2021 -2022 SY Plan (Response to COVID) To assure the safe return of all students and staff to GALS and in accordance with federal requirements under the America Rescue Plan Act (ARP), GALS adopts th is 2021 -2022 SY Plan. I. Plans for Safe Return to In -person instruction When interacting with others who are not suspected or confirmed to have COVID -19, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends following everyday prevention actions. Therefo re, personal prevention practices such as social distancing; handwashing; hand sanitizing; not touching eyes, nose, or mouth; wearing cloth face coverings; staying home when sick; and environmental practices, such as frequent cleaning and disinfection of f requently touched surfaces, are important principles. To lower the risk of infection transmission, GALS adopts and promote s healthy behaviors that reduce the spread of illness. 1. Social distancing, also called \"physical distancing,\" means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home. To practice social or physical distancing: The CDC recommends at least 3 feet of physical distance between students within classrooms, combined with indoor mask wearing by people who are not fully vaccinated, to reduce transmission risk. When it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of at least 3 feet, indoor masking is necessary as a layering strategy to provide protection. 2. Handwashing is the single most effective infection control interv ention (CDC). Hand hygiene is performed by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer with 60 -95 percent alcohol content until the product dries. If hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water. Hand sanitizer is pla ced in every room. 3. Masks: While cloth face coverings are not considered personal protective equipment (PPE), they are useful to prevent the spread of disease. Cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infect ed but does not have symptoms. Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks, respirators, or other medical PPE. Cloth face coverings should be washed daily in a washing machine. Do not touch the face (eyes, nose, or mouth) at any time, including while weari ng a cloth face covering and wash hands frequently. Masks to be effective be worn above the nose and at all times unless eating or drinking. The CDC recommends masks should be worn indoors by all individuals (age 2 and older) who are not fully vaccinate d. Any students or staff that are outside and can be socially distant are not required to wear a mask regardless of their age. GALS asks that individuals provide proof of vaccination if choosing to not wear a mask. Consistent and correct mask use by peop le who are not fully vaccinated is especially important indoors and in crowded settings, when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Page | 2 4. Frequent cleaning: GALS will station spray bottles with a cleaning towel in every classroom. Students and staff are asked to spray and disinfect after themselves throughout the day. Spray bottles contain a disinfectant that is tested to be effective against COVID. Review t he 6 steps of cleaning provided by the EPA at: https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020 -04/documents/disinfectants -onepager.pdf . 5. The CDC states that vaccination is currently the leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID -19 pandemic. GALS encourages all students and staff to be vaccinated. To receive your free vaccination, schedule an appointment at the website https://www.unlv.edu/coronavirus/vaccine . 6. Any students or staff with a disability will receive appropriate accommodations, please contact the head of school at HOS@galslv. org for more information. 7. Students, teachers, and staff should stay home when they have signs of any infectious illness and be referred to their healthcare provider for testing and care. 8. Please report any incident of COVID to 702 -672-6386. For any stude nt and/or staff that has tested positive for Covid -19, GALS will conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in closed contact with the positive individual. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total o f 15 minutes. GALS will coordinate any positive COVID cases to the State Public Charter School Authority and the Southern Nevada Health District. GALS will seek and follow advice given from these expert agencies. Students and staff diagnosed with COVID -19 should isolate and stay away from the school premises until requirements for en d of isolation are met . II. In -person Learning : Student and Staff Well -being 1. Students will continue to receive social emotional development through the GALS Series course which is provided daily for each student . Students will continue to receive physical health development through the GALS Movement programming which also occurs d aily as part of the GALS schedule. GALS will continue to have a school counselor to provide c ounseling support to students as needed. 2. GALS is a health and wellness school where physical activity, movement, medication, mindfulness and healthy eating are incorporated into our daily routines. Staff participate actively alongside students in this healthy lifestyle. Staff receive professio nal development in these topics along with teaching strategies, regulatory requirements and high -quality curriculum. 3. With the full return of GALS students to in -person school these students will be able to fully benefit from GALS education model which is designed to accelerate learning through addressing the needs of the \"whole child.\" Key components of the GALS model include: An all -girl environment that provides a safe and supportive environment that best suits the needs of adolescent girls at a criti cal time in their development. Incorporation of morning movement each day to ignite the body and mind, preparing it for a rigorous day of learning. Movement alerts the brain receptors to learning and calms the physical body, improving attention span and absorption of knowledge. GALS utilizes project based and activity -based learning to keep our students engaged and active throughout the day. Page | 3 Through our signature GALS Series class, our students receive daily social emotional instruction t o develop the social skills and self -knowledge to engage and become a leader in our community. GALS conducts assessments on a regular and routine basis to provide data to inform our teaching practices with each student. Data is compiled 3x per year and staff meets to review the data and adjust individual learning plans, interventions and strategies for each student to most effectively meet the needs and support academic growth in each child. GALS recognizes and provides counseling services and additional support to st udents and more broadly through our partner, Boys Town, to families in need. Equity is a cornerstone of the GALS model and our vision is to create an equitable world where all people are treated with respect, direct their own lives and reach their full p otential. II. In-person learning: Accelerating Student Learning GALS has a 4 -pronged approach to accelerate student learning. 1. In-school acceleration - based on assessment data, GALS develops an individualized learning plan for each student. Daily instructi on and materials are adjusted based on those results. Students are placed in to accelerators or learning interventions depending on their levels and teacher observations of a student's needs. 2. After School tutoring - GALS students who attend one of our after -school partner programs at either Clark county Library or the Boys and Girls Club will receive an hour of homework assistance. GALS coordinates missing assignments and homework with each of these partners to ensure the highest impact use of this time. 3. GALS \"Power Hour\" - each school day, GALS has dedicated an entire hour to accelerations and interventions depending on a student's needs. Small group break out sessions occur and one on one t ime with teachers. 4. Partnerships with Family - GALS coordinates with parents and guardians daily regarding attendance, missing or failed assignments and engages the parent in supporting and holding students accountable. IV. COVID - 19 Path Forward Program (Distance Learning for students unable to attend in person) In accordance with guidance from the State Public Charter School Authority and the Governors Directives (No. 44) , Girls Athletic Leadership School adopts the following in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. 1. Any student who has documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in -person or is quarantined on the advice of local public health officials will receive access to distance educ ation , including access to the technology necessary to participate in distance education, including a computer and internet connectivity (Hotspot). 2. Students will attend the regular GALS class schedule as their in -person peers via the Internet. 3. Students participating in distance education must demonstrat e regular weekly progress in their classwork to be submitted through Google Classroom, then graded and recorded in Infinite Campus ; 4. Each student participating full -time in distance education will be conta cted via electronic means or by telephone by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher at least once per instructional day; if a student's confirmed lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licens ed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record attempted contact via other means (e.g., home visit) once per week and maintain a record of attempts ; 5. The program of instruction will provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with I ndividualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plans; Page | 4 6. Licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes will be accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours; and 7. Students are also eligible to receive the GALS student breakfast and lunch available for pick up daily. I. Distance Learning in th e event of an emergency closure /support for students In the event of another state mandated emergency school closure, GALS would revert to a distance learning style of education. GALS would provide notice via Infinite Campus messenger, text and phone call s to all families to coordinate the change. All students would be issued a Chromebook and hotspot (for those that need one) to attend school over the Internet. The class schedule would remain essentially the same however morning movement would be distribu ted through the day breaking into 10 -minute increments between each class. GALS finds this opportunity for a \"brain break\" vital to maintaining interest and engagement during class time. Students would continue to receive their regular scheduled classe s through out the day. GALS would continue to provide social emotional support through the GALS Series course. Students receiving speciation education services and/or English Learner support would continue to do so within the context of the normal school schedule. These services would be provided virtually. GALS would continue to provide Counseling support is available by sending an email to Counselor@galslv.org . A limited staff would remain on site to provide daily food service pick up for those families in need. GALS would work with our food service vendor to optimize food pick up schedules to 1 -2 times per week. 1 Honors Academy of Literature 2021 -2022 Reopening Plan In-Person Learning: Health and Safety In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning Distance Education: Students unable to participate in -person Distance Education: Emergency Closure Distance Education: Supporting Students The Honors Academy of Literature will prioritize in person learning Monday through Friday , addressing learning loss, and meeting the social emotional needs of scholars, teachers, and families during the 2021 -2022 school year.

It will be necessary for ISMV to provide all sta keholders information regarding topics such as re - opening, plans for keeping individuals safe and healthy, promoting safe and healthy habits, and continual updates regarding academic plans. As ISMV continues to navigate these ever changing times, the scho ol will maintain communication in a number of ways. Communication will be disseminated in the following ways: Bloomz (Primary Method) Family Handbook Staff Handbook The school's website www.imaginemountainview.org Infinite Campus email/text blasts (SHOUT) Weekly Newsletter Formal Letters Governing Body and Leadership Role The Imagine Schools at Mountain View governing body and the Imagine Schools regional leadership team provide ongoing support and collaboration. The key component to this successful collaboration is the regular communication between all parties. Communication takes place in the following ways: Bimonthly Board Mee tings Email Regional Leadership Meetings (not including the governing board) IN-PERSON LEARNING: HEALTH AND SAFETY Physical Health Screening ISMV values the importance of maintaining a safe and healthy environment for our students, staff, and families. I SMV is committed to adhering to the CDC guidelines to ensure that we are taking all necessary precautions concerning the COVID -19 pandemic. Staff: Home Health Check Observation for Symptoms Students: Home Health Check Observation for Symptoms We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 5 ISMV will post reminders to check for symptoms by posting signs, sending home reminders to families, and displaying the symptom checklist on Bloomz, the school website, and in the school newsletter. The Home Health Check requires individuals or caregivers of minors to identify if they are exhibiting COVID -19 symptoms. People with COVID -19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported - ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2 -14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these sympto ms may have COVID -19: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea *This list does not include all poss ible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID -19. Resources: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/schools -childcare/k -12-guidance.html Physical Hygiene Hygiene: According to the CDC, handwashing is especially important and is one of the best ways to protect and prevent from getting sick as well as spreading germs. ISMV will teach and implement the following hand and respiratory etiquette: Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for a t least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students and staff. If soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol can be used (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanit izer). Encourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. ISMV will provide the following supplies to support hand and respiratory etiquette: Soap Hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use) Paper towels Tissues Disinfectant wipes Cloth face coverings (as feasible) We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 6 Face coverings: ISMV is committed to the safety and well -being of all stakeholders in response to COVID -19. ISMV will reopen with full capacity for the 2021 -2022 school year. Based on the recommendations found in the Guidance for Covid- 19 Prevention in K-12 Schools publis hed by the CDC on July 9, 2021, masks will be required for all students K -6. If there is a medical concern for wearing masks a doctor's note must be provided on their letterhead. IEP/504 students may not be required to wear masks based on individual needs. For fully vaccinated staff masks are optional. Staff members who opt for a mask may wear a clear or cloth mask with a clear panel when interacting with young students, students learning to read, or when interacting with people who rely on reading lips. Masks are NOT required when outside due to open ventilation. ISMV will continue to monitor community transmission/outbreak and will move to a possible phased out approach to masks. Accommodations for Children with Disabilities ISMV will work with families of children with disabilities to see if in -person learning is the best option. If it is, then campus leadership will work with each family to develop an action plan that is both academically enriching and safe and healthy. Vaccination Access & Awarene ss ISMV has and will continue to strongly encourage students, families and staff members to get their vaccinations if they are of age and health abides. ISMV campuses will promote local vaccination sites to its staff and families. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staff that has tested positive for Covid -19, principals conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in close contact with the positive individual. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes. The principal will connect with the Southern Nevada Health District. At that point in time, the length of quarantine will be determined. The principal will message the appropriate families. Social Distancing ISMV will continue to educate staff to maintain at least 3 feet of distance between individuals when possible. ISMV Staff members will educate and remind students regularly to maintain at least 3 feet of distance between individuals when possible. ISMV will utilize social distancing markers throughout the school. Shared Spaces Classrooms: We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 7 ISMV Staff Members will create a seating chart and students will remain at their assigned seats for the longest extent of time possible. ISMV Staff Members will limit the use of s hared equipment, such as writing utensils, manipulatives, keyboards, and headphones. ISMV Staff Members will clean any shared objects between uses, following instructions from the manufacturer and the cleaning product(s). ISMV Staff Members will implement procedures for turning in assignments in a manner that minimizes contact in the classroom (for example, collecting assignments electronically or in a bin). Hallways: Mark hallways with adhesive tape to direct students to stay on one side of the hallway for each direction of travel. Where possible given the school layout, certain hallways may be designated one -way. Playgrounds: Staggering the use of communally shared spaces such as playgrounds. Plastic chains, cones, painted lines, or rope can help create a visual separation of different recess areas. Educators can designate labeled areas for specific groups of students that can rotate through the areas throughout a given time period (day or week). Lunch Rooms: Initial Phase: The lunch room will be open during breakfast. Families must notify ISMV if their child/ren will be eating breakfast so the school can continue to monitor the capacity limits. ISMV will close the multipurpose room during lunch. The school will serve lunches in classr ooms and on disposable food service items (trays, plates, etc.), if possible. Prohibit students from sharing lunch items with one another. Students will be permitted to remove masks while eating. Handwashing/Hand sanitizer will be utilized before and after meals. If a classroom has a student with food allergies, convene a 504 team to discuss appropriate accommodations. These may include, for example, taking the student to another location, such as a school conference room or the multipurpose room, with on e friend (so long as social distancing can be maintained in the alternate location). Future Phase: Open the multipurpose room during lunch, with increased safety measures, including the following: Assign students to a specific seat . Limit multipurpose r oom seating to the number of assigned seats. If students line up for lunch service, permit only one class to line up at a time, and place markings on the floor to indicate where students should stand to maintain social distancing. Alternatively, serve food to each student at their assigned seat. Serve lunches on disposable food service items (trays, plates, etc.), if possible. If disposable items cannot be used, have food service staff collect items while wearing gloves. Prohibit students from sharing lunch items with one another. We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 8 Bathrooms: ISMV staff will only send one student (boy/girl) to the restroom at a time to limit the number of students using the restroom. Front Offices: ISMV will post signage directing visitors to maintain proper social distancing as indicated by the markers. Visitors: ISMV is committed to the safety and well -being of every stakeholder. The school understands the importance and value of school visitors and volunteers, but at this time, ISMV is not allowing anyone other than staff or students on campus.. Hand Washing: Require all students to wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol at the following times: upon arrival at school (use hand sanitizer if there is no sink in the classroom) after being outside for physical activity before and after lunch in between classroom changes prior to leaving school for home after sneezing, coughing, or blowing nose LOGISTICS Facilities Management Imagine Schools at Mountain View will make adjustments intended to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19. Touchless water bottle refill stations will be installed in common areas to be accessible to all staff and students. Hand sanitizer pumps are available to students and staff in each classroom. When able, d esks will be arranged to meet the CDC social distancing guidelines. Signage will be placed in the hallway to ensure social distancing. Water fountains will not be used by students or staff. Signs will be placed in all hand -washing stations reminding students to wash hands. Technology will be provided to students as needed or required and cleaned and sanitized after each use Cleaning We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 9 High touch surfaces, such as desks, door knobs, sink heads, etc. will be cleaned regularly by ISMV staff. Shared materials will be limited as much as possible, but any items shared will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Each night, ISMV's contracted commercial cleaning crew will provide a detailed cleaning of the facilities. An electromagnetic spray will be utilized throughout the day to sanitize and disinfect surface areas. A deep sanitizing cleaning of the campus will be provided Monthly . Additional filtration systems are being considered to enhance the existing ventilation system. Nutrition Services/Breakfast & Lunch ISMV will implement the following procedures for breakfast and lunch: Breakfast will be served in the lunchroom with ap propriate social distancing. The lunchroom will be closed during lunch times; lunches will be served in classrooms until recommendations are made to return to the lunchroom. Disposable food service items will be utilized. Kitchen staff will wear masks and gloves. Students with food allergies will be eating in a separate location, when necessary. Lunch will be delivered to classrooms until recommendations are made to return to the lunchroom. Grab and Go meals will be provided if the school has to move to r emote learning. Transportation/Arrival and Dismissal ISMV will continue to utilize our carpool system to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19. Students will be arriving in their individual vehicles which ensures proper social distancing. There will be outside markers to indicate proper social distancing f or those students who walk to school. During dismissal, students will stay in their classrooms and will be called to exit the building in a staggered fashion. Students will be exiting through their outside classroom door to minimize movement throughout th e building. Athletics/Extracurricular Activities Imagine Schools at Mountain View values the importance of extracurricular activities. There are several ways that the school can adjust these events to minimize the risk of spreading COVID -19. After sc hool clubs will follow the school's schedule and promote appropriate social distancing. When ISMV leaders determine the school is prepared and capable of following all state and CDC guidelines in conjunction with the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Ass ociation Re -Opening Guidance, resuming athletics will be revisited. WELLNESS AND RECOVERY Social -Emotional Learning -Tier 1 We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 10 Imagine Schools at Mountain View understands the importance of student emotional health and mental wellbeing. It is necessary fo r students to have the proper support to maintain a healthy mindset. To meet these needs, ISMV will provide universal social emotional support to students by continuing the foundational approach and belief in educating the whole child by Shared Values, Ch aracter Education and ongoing intentional efforts to meet the Social Emotional Learning needs of all students. ISMV will utilize multiple tier 1 social emotional support for its students across our school campus. These supports include but not limited to: School -wide expectations and procedures School -wide training and overall awareness of student needs Systematic reinforcements Culturally responsive practices Partner & Community partnerships Cross curriculum learning opportunities Responsive classroom env ironments Mindfulness practices Focus on Character Development: Coping Skills, Self Esteem, Empathy, Kindness, Friendship, Conflict Resolution, etc. Trauma -Informed Practices - Tiers 1 -3 ISMV will provide ongoing support to staff, students and families for their social and emotional needs. ISMV will proactively encourage every person on campus to talk with people they trust about their feelings and concerns. ISMV leadership will work to build strong relationships with staff, students, and families. It will be important for ISMV to consider educators who have experienced hardships during this time due to health concerns, personal losses and other factors. For students, it will be important for staff to recognize which students have more significan t needs that require a more immediate response, as well as students who have emerging symptoms that require monitoring over time. ISMV has to work and make decisions with these social emotional needs in mind. Universally, ISMV will use these tier 1 trauma- informed practices & interventions for its campus: Learning self- awareness strategies Understanding and utilizing coping skills Practice problem solving skills SSP support groups For more targeted and intensive support, ISMV will use these tier 2 & tier 3 interventions: One-on-one weekly meetings between student and SSP via Zoom or in the building Selected strategy from Restorative Behavior System Positive adult interaction and connection Identify/provide community resources Supporting Educators a nd Staff ISMV supports the mental health and wellbeing of its educators and staff. They are the driving force behind the success of the students and the campuses. ISMV will focus on three main bedrocks in helping teachers. We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 11 1. Foster wellness . ISMV has and will c ontinue to educate staff about mental health and encourage open conversation about the challenges people are experiencing, employees may be more likely to access care when needed. ISMV will reach out to a wellness provider to consider hosting virtual mindfulness or discussion sessions. CASLV will promote the importance of healthy sleep. 2. Provide training. ISMV acknowledges that staff members may have different levels of ability with using virtual platforms and new learning technologies. ISMV has been an d will continue to offer training and technical support for new job demands. This may help to reduce stress. 3. Model healthy behavior: ISMV will encourage all school leaders to take care of their own physical, social, and psychological needs. By doing so , they serve as role models and set the tone that it is acceptable and necessary to take care of oneself. IN-PERSON LEARNING: Accelerating Student Learning ISMV is well aware of the potential negative effect of the school closures and the distance lea rning program with limited hours of instruction provided to students since March 2020. Therefore, we are excited to be able to resume offering ALL students a full- day in person / traditional learning program starting in August 2021. Implementing Assessments ISMV will begin the school year with a comprehensive plan to diagnose and identify student needs. ISMV will use every tool available to identify student needs and the learning gaps. Some of these tools include but are not limited to Brigance Screener for Kindergarten, NWEA MAP Fall assessment, classroom level benchmark assessments, and hearing & vision screenings. Data Informed Instruction The teachers will look at the beginning of the year data during the Child Study Team (CST) meetings and prepa re a comprehensive plan to meet the student needs. Schools will make the intervention groups during the first CST meeting by the beginning of September. Tutoring and intervention services will be provided during the school day and after school time. ISMV w ill utilize a wide range of programs to accelerate learning and close the achievement gap. Some of the intervention programs include but are not limited to Literacy Footprints, Freckle, and Zearn. In-Person Learning & Special Populations Special popula tions such as SPED, EL, and immigrant students will continue to receive services from licensed teachers. These groups will be identified and services will be provided in accordance with the Nevada State and Federal requirements and guidelines. Students wil l be served in their own groups and grant funds and other funds will be used solely to service these students. In addition, ISMV will offer a Saturday school along with after school tutoring. These services will be offered to identified intervention studen ts at no cost. DISTANCE LEARNING We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 12 Imagine Schools at Mountain View (ISMV) has created a distance learning plan for the 2021 -2022 school year ONLY for students with a medically identified need. The distance learning plan is specifically designed for students: With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in -person learning, as determined by a medical health professional Who tested positive for Covid -19 Identified as close contacts of Covid -19 Affected by school closures and/or tightening governm ent health protocols, ISMV is dedicated to maintaining high expectations and strong academic achievement for all students, whether full- time in -person or full- time distance learning. Information Technology Imagine Schools at Mountain View recognizes the v alue of technology to ensure the success of a distance learning program. Family survey data will be used to determine student technology needs. Currently ISMV has the capacity to provide a device to families that identify a need. In the fourth quarter o f the 2019 -2020 school year, ISMV was able to provide all families in need of a device the proper technology totaling 58 devices. The school will continue to provide those families technology, as well as any new families, or families who have had a change in their status. Additional options will be made available for families who do not have access to internet connectivity. Staff will also be equipped with the necessary technology resources to successfully execute the components of the distance learning plans. High -Risk Medical Exemption Process If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition*, a Medical Certification for COVID -19 High Risk Exemption Form (provided in the next section) may be completed in order to p articipate in distance online learning at home for the 2021 -2022 school year. A health care medical professional must complete the exemption form and email it to ISMV. ISMV will review the form, and either approve or deny. The medical exemption form is attached. In the event that getting a physician's wet signature is not possible (due to moving from a different region or other similar circumstances), a letter from the physician on letterhead will suffice. In order to mitigate any possible exposure and risk, students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not participate in any in -person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). If there are needs for in person requirements such as important assessments a safe, socially -distanced environment will be set up for the students to be in. CDC guidelines will be followed to insure the student's safety and well being. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning at the end of first semester - which will be determined on a case -by-case basis. Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies , poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 13 disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kid ney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. During the school year, if public health conditions worsen and/or students develop certain health conditions that may qualify for a high -risk medical exemption, families can reach out to school leadership to discuss joining full -time distance learning. Covid -19 Positive & Close Contacts - Logistics Full-time in -person students who have tested positive for Covid -19 must quarantine as determined by the guidelines outlined by the SNHD. Contact tracing will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus. Full-time in -person students who have been identified as Covid -19 close contacts (from the school, SNHD, or personal connection for any case) must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. A student's quarantine can be for two weeks (most of the time). School leadership will communicate the next steps for distance learning with families. Students are required to follow all procedures as stated by their teachers and leadership. Students are expected to attend class every day. Students should let teachers and front office staff know if they will be absent. Teacher(s) will try to connect with the student daily. Quarantined Students & Distance Learning We foresee there being two types of quarantines for full- time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. Individual/Limited number of Students When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, students will be placed in Distance Learning with thei r in-person teacher. All work/activities will be accessed via Bloomz, and instruction will be synchronous through Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Dista nce Learning. When only a limited number of students need to be quarantined, students will be assigned to the dedicated DL teacher's classroom. Attendance will be taken in Infinite Campus. All assignments will be turned in via Bloomz and/or google class room. We have great experience in using this learning model during the 4th quarter of the 2019 -2020 school year and entire 2020- 2021 school year. We also have had to quarantine classrooms regularly during the 2020 -2021 school year. EMERGENCY SCHOOL LEARNING PLAN ISMV recognizes that there may be emergency situations that shut down a campus for an extended period of time. Examples of emergency situations could include, but not limited to, a pandemic, a facility issue, or a natural disaster. Imagine Schools at Mountain View (ISMV) is committed to providing high -quality education to its students and has developed this emergency school closure learning plan. This plan will be made available to all staff, families, and We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 14 students. This plan will suc ceed in delivering instruction online to meet students' requirements. The purpose of this plan is to empower and prepare students for success by enabling them to access quality online instruction. This plan will act as a guide to improve learning and enhance student success. It is also aimed to fulfill all applicable rules, regulations, and policies stipulated by the Nevada Department of Education and the US federal government. ISMV will continue to use email, Bloomz, and the school website for normal comm unications with parents, students, and teachers. This plan is developed for at least 10 consecutive days of implementation. Primary Online Learning Platform Bloomz will be used by every teacher to relay classroom content and deliver classroom instruction. Teachers upload videos, assignments and related information for student use. In addition to Bloomz, teachers will continue to use MyOn, Freckle, Zearn, and Google classroom. Zoom are additional teleconference methods being used by teachers for classroom instruction. Technology Access For any students without access to such technology, school leadership will work with families to ensure technology is acces sible. Families will have to complete a form to borrow the technology for the school year. If approved, students will be provided with a Chromebook at no cost to the family. Parents of DL students will be able to set up their Bloomz accounts at the beginni ng of the year and monitor their student's progress and see all upcoming assignments, tests, and due dates throughout the school year. Families will receive training by an ISMV staff member on how to use the technology if needed. If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year, families are encouraged to contact their teacher. Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year. Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus (at leadership's discretion). If there are greater issues in technology (i.e., internet service provider shutdown, blackout, etc.), distance learning can be done through paper correspondence. Nutrition Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided. DL students will be able to pick up nutrition services as scheduled by the food services coordinator. Serving Special Populations in Distance Learning The distance learning program will provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plan. Special education teachers will mee t virtually with students as needed to meet the mandated number of instructional minutes. We are LEADERS We are ACHIEVERS We are BUCKET FILLERS We are BOBCATS BOBCAT PRIDE! 15 School staff will consider alternative ways to provide equitable access and appropriate educational opportunities for students with disabilities, including explorin g all available supplementary aids and services and related services to include online or virtual platforms, and/or other activities, such as paper/pencil activities. Documentation of all efforts to provide equitable access to educational opportunities is required. Special education teachers must document that the student is receiving his/her specially designed instruction through the approved instructional model on the status record. Related service providers must continue to follow current procedu res to document services provided. Assessments, MDT meetings, and IEP meetings that do not need to be conducted in -person will continue to take place virtually or by phone. If the school cannot contact the parent/guardian to schedule an IEP meeting, the school will follow standard procedures. IEP teams must include any data collected, including any deficit areas, behavioral data, the effectiveness of accommodations, etc. A case manager or related service provider must provide how instruction is scaffolded or the background knowledge needed for the student to complete the assignments aligned to the Nevada Standards or the NVACS/Connectors and goals and benchmarks/objectives. A case manager or related service provider must also review and address student work and/or finished assignments, checking for understanding and accuracy, adapting content, methodology, and/or instruction to the needs of the student. When on campus for an IEP -mandated procedure, the IEP should also include input from parents/guardians regarding difficulties with the student's compliance with rules related to social distancing, wearing face coverings, washing hands, and other safety protocols. Goals, be nchmarks and/or short -term objectives should be based on the current present levels of academic achievement and functional performance. Based on prior goals and benchmarks or objectives, the team should consider the student's anticipated progress for the r emainder of the annual IEP. *** As context may change with CDC guidance and community transmissions the plan may be updated and/or revised.

The 2021 Legislative Session produced Senate Bill 215. Schools are required to develop a distance education plan in the event of an emergency that may cause a school closure of at least 10 days. This way schools are more prepared to tackle any sudden closu res, similar to what was experienced in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. In an effort to streamline all of the requested information, the State Public Charter School Authority has requested that schools submit a 2021 -2022 reopening plan. In it, there are three key requirements: Requirement A: Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID -19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will res pond to the impact of COVID -19 on students' opportunity to learn. Requirement B: Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Distance Education Plans for the 2021 -22 school year. This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that w ould be compromised by attending school in-person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Requirement C: Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community, parents and school employees. This plan 1 Section 8 of Emergency Directive 044 2 establishes an emergency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emergency. Safe Reopening for In- Person Learning Learning Bridge recognizes that the health and safety of students and staff is of the utmost importance. Learning Bridge will seek data, guidance, recommendations, and/or approval from 4 4 the Southern Nevada Health District, the Center for Disease Control, the Nevada Department of Education, and the Nevada Governor's Office. Learning Bridge will continually work with its families, staff, leadership and Board to implement Covid -19 mitigation protocols that are the safest for its in -person students and staff at any point in time. Ultimately, Learning Bridge will use all available scientific information to help make a determination on these matters. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette Learning Bridge will continue to promote proper personal hygiene: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Keep 6 feet of physical distance from others when possible Avoid contact with others if within 6 feet when possible Wear a cloth face mask covering in School A. All fully vaccinated staff and fully vaccinated students are not required to wear a mask at school district sites or events (excluding graduations). B. Any students or staff that are outside and can be socially distant are not required to wear a mask regardless of their age. C. Masks are opti onal for any student in Pre -K through grade 3 (0 -9 years old). D. Masks are required for all adults and students who participate in or attend graduation ceremonies Avoid traveling if you are sick Stay home if you are feeling ill Get medical care as needed Staff will remind students to continually wash their hands and use sanitizer between activities. Staff will also possess spray disinfectant, wipes and gloves to ensure classroom surfaces are clean. Masks will be provided for t hose students and staff that wish to wear them. Diagnostic and Screening Testing Staff and students will self -screen their physical health. If any staff member or student is not feeling well and having any symptoms, that person will need to stay at home. They should only return to school when there are no remaining symptoms. If a stud ent or staff member chooses to go to school while ill (no matter the illness), they will not be allowed in the classroom. For students, the parent will be contacted to take the student home and will not be allowed to return until they are symptom -free. For staff, they cannot return until they are symptom -free. In the event that a student or a staff member feels ill during the school day, they will be removed from the classroom. They will be asked relevant questions pertaining to their health and assessed by a staff member with a touchless thermometer. If it is determined that the student 5 5 needs to be sent home, a parent will be contacted and their belongings will be gathered from the classroom for them. If it is determined that the staff member nee ds to be sent home, another staff member will cover their classroom/classes for the remainder of the day. They cannot return until they are symptom -free. A list of symptoms will be gathered from public health organizations. Each campus will have touchless thermometers and will be used at the discretion of school staff. Students will exit the classroom to a temporary place if they have a temperature. If a student or staff member is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease, the person will be required to self -quarantine, and the Southern Nevada Health District will be contacted. Learning Bridge will work in consultation with medical and Learning Bridge County public health experts, the State Public Charter School Authority, and the Nevada Department of Education to determine the extent of testing in the school and if a closure is necessary. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities Learning Bridge will make multiple adjustments to each campus' facilities to minimize the risk of COVID -19. Hand sanitizer pumps will be placed in the lunchroom and classrooms locations throughout the campus. Desks will be arranged to be socially distanced. Furniture that is difficult to clean will not be utilized or replaced. All air filters will be monitored and replaced as needed. Learning Bridge is a brand new building. All shared items, such as athletic balls, will be cleaned accordingly. Students will fill their water bottles at the fill station. Students and staff will be encouraged to bring their own water bottles. Technology will be assigned to students as needed/requested and cleaned after every use. All emergency plans will be adjusted to accommodate social distancing guidelines while maintaining the necessary safety, urgency and precaution. At each campus, staff will check the cleanliness of the campus to ensure a safe and healthy environment. All restrooms will be monitored regularly throughout the day to ensure cleanliness. High touch points, such as water fountains, sink heads, door knobs, and student desks, will be cleaned regularly by Learning Bridge staff. Shared materials will be limited as much as possible, and they will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Each night, there will be daily detailed cleaning of facilities from Learn ing Bridge Custodial Services. We will perform a thorough deep sanitizing cleaning of each campus using approved cleaning materials. In the event of a pandemic scare or a positive COVID -19 diagnosis, our school has access to an electrostatic sprayer that will disinfectant on contact when used. After this has been used in a space, that area will be disinfected and suitable for occupancy. Face Coverings Our campuses will have masks readily available for anyone who wants it. Ultimately, Learning 6 6 Bridge will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA for guidelines requiring face coverings. If face coverings become mandated for whatever reason, Learnin g Bridge will ensure that anyone stepping onto campus has a face covering on. Some of our students may not be able to wear a mask or face covering due to medical reasons. A doctor's note must be provided by a medical physician on their letterhead. IEP/504 students may not be required to wear masks based on individual needs. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staff that has tested positive for Covid -19, the county Health Inspector and school administration will conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in closed contact with the positive individual. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes. The administrator will connect with the Ely Public Health Official . The administrator will share the names of close contacts, their contact information, and parent information if the close contact is a student. From there, the Ely Public Health Official will contact the Southern Nevada Health District. Our Public Health Official will instruct us as far as any issues, needed quarantines or closing. Social Distancing & Capacity Learning Bridge will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA when it comes to social distancing requirements and room capacity limits. Learning Bridge has measured each of its classrooms. It knows the full capacity limit and can adjust accordingly to any percentage. Accommodations for Children with Disabilities If students and staff have one of the disability types listed below, they might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness Learning Bridge will work with families of children with disabilities to see if in -person learning is the best option. If it is, then campus leadership will work with each family to develop an action plan that is both academically enriching and safe and healthy. 7 7 Vaccination Access & Awareness Learning Bridge has and will continue to strongly encourage students, families and staff members to get their vaccinations if they are of age and health abides. Learning Bridge campuses will promote local vaccination sites to its staff and families. Traveling Abroad A quarantine may be required if a student/staff member has returned from traveling to an international COVID -19 hotspot, as determined by school leadership. There will be an exception for families that had work -related military job duty responsibilities. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing Being in the midst of a pandemic can bring a whirlwind of feelings within oneself. In any organization, it is critical for itself to make sure that the needs of its people are met. When it comes to students, those needs most likely also include socioemotio nal needs and the trauma that can be triggered by a pandemic. For Learning Bridge , the wellbeing and mental health of staff and students are of the utmost importance. Supporting Students: Social -Emotional Learning - Tier 1 Learning Bridge will utilize multiple tier 1 social emotional support for its students across all campuses. These supports include: School -wide expectations and procedures Systematic reinforcements Culturally responsive practices Data -based decision making Partner & Community partnerships Art activities Classroom meetings Mindfulness practices Monthly School Challenges: Coping Skills, Self Esteem, Empathy, Kindness, Friendship, Conflict Resolution, etc. 8 8 Supporting Students: Trauma -Informed Practices - Tier 2 -3 Learning Bridge along with the school counselor will provide ongoing support to staff, students and families for their social and emotional needs. Learning Bridge will proactively encourage every person on campus to talk with people they trust about their feelings and concerns. Learning Bridge leadership will work to build strong relationships with staff, students, and families. It will be important for Learning Bridge to consider educators who have experienced hardships during this time due to health conce rns, personal losses and other factors. For students, it will be important for staff to recognize which students have more significant needs that require a more immediate response, as well as students who have emerging symptoms that require monitoring over time. Learning Bridge has to work and make decisions with these social emotional needs in mind. Universally, Learning Bridge will use these tier 1 trauma -informed practices & interventions for its campuses: Learning positive self -talk Practice problem solving skills Anxiety/grief support groups For more targeted and intensive support, Learning Bridge will use these tier 2 & tier 3 interventions: One -on-one weekly meetings between student and counselor Use of empathy in multiple forms Supporting Educators and Staff Learning Bridge supports the mental health and wellbeing of its educators and staff. They are the driving force behind the success of the students and the campuses. Learning Bridge will focus on three main bedrocks in helpin g teachers. 1. Foster wellness by continuing to educate staff about mental health and encourage open conversation about the challenges people are experiencing, employees may be more likely to access care when needed. 2. Provide training . Learning Bridge acknowledges that staff members may have different levels of ability with using virtual platforms and new learning technologies. With the help of IT and other educated technologically savvy staff with training and expertise we will continue to offer training and technical support for new job demands. This may he lp to reduce stress. 9 9 3. Model healthy behavior: Learning Bridge will encourage all school leaders to take care of their own physical, social, and psychological needs. By doing so, they serve as role models and set the tone that it is acceptable and necessary to take care of oneself. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning Learning Bridge is well aware of the potential negative effect of the school closures and the distance learning program with limited hours of instruction provided to students since March 2020. Therefore, we are excited to be able to resume offering a full -day in person / traditional learning program starting on August 30, 2021. Implementing Assessments Learning Bridge will begin the school year with a comprehensive plan to diagnose and identify student needs. Learning Bridge will use every tool available to identify student needs and the learning gaps. Some of these tools include but are not limited to Brigance Screener for Kindergarten, NWEA MAP Fall assessment, classroom level benchmark assessments, and hearing & vision screenings. Pairing Data with Instruction The teachers will look at the beginning of the year data during Staff and Teacher meetings and prepare a comprehensive plan to meet the student needs. Teachers will make the intervention decisions and plans of action during the first Staff development meetings in August . Tutoring and intervention services will be provided during the school day and after schoo l time. In-Person Learning & Special Populations Special populations such as SPED, EL, and immigrant students will continue to receive services from licensed teachers. These groups will be identified and services will be provided in accordance with the Nevada State and Federal requirements and guidelines . Students will be served in their own groups with a push in and pull out model. Path Forward Program: Distance Learning Learning Bridge Charter School has created a distance learning plan for the 2021 -2022 school year. We recognize that there may be families that require a virtual environment because of illness or other extenuating circumstances. The distance learning plan is specifically designed for s tudents: 10 10 With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in- person learning, as determined by a medical health professional Who tested positive for Covid -19 Identified as close contacts of Covid -19 Affected by school closures and/or tightening gov ernment health protocols If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition* A health care medical professional must complete in writing on letter head the need for virtual learning. Students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not participate in any in- person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions , and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID -19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. There may be times, like for important assessments, where stude nts may need to be on campus. During these times, a safe, socially -distanced environment will be set up for the students to be in. Every person will wear a mask in these environments. Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, c ancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. During the school year, if public health conditions worsen and/or students develop certain health conditions that may qualify for a high -risk medical exemption, families can reach out to school leadership to discuss joining full -time distance learning. High Risk Exemption Form Page 1 - Information If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition *, a Medical Certification for COVID -19 High Risk Exemption Form may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021 -2022 school year. Students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not participate in any in - person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics ( as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID -19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. Once approved for distance learning, students may switch back to in -person learni ng on a case -by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. 11 11 Distance learning will consist of your student working individually on assigned work through different learning platforms designed and chosen by the student's teacher. Students will check in daily with their teacher for progress check -ins, checking for understanding of the lessons, academic goal setting, assessment preparation, etc. *Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. Procedure for submitting a medical exemption form: Fill in your child's name, grade, and the parent -related information. Have your licensed health care provider complete and sign the form. Turn in the completed form to the front office staff. For siblings , one form must be completed for each sibling. If the student's medical physician cannot be reached for signature (i.e., moved to Las Vegas from another state), a letter from the physician on letterhead will suffice in place of the form All medical exemption requests will be subject to verification. form must be completed and signed by a licensed health care provider and is subject to verification. Parents/guardians will be notified by administrative leadership when the form has been verified and accepted. High Risk Exemption Form Page 2 - Medical Certification Student Name: Grade: The High -Risk Exemption is due to the health of: (circle one) Student Household Member Parent Name: Parent Email: Parent Signature: Parent Phone #: 12 12 Should a student be required to return to in -person instruction, but the student or an individual in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, this medical certification form will need to be submitted in order for the student to be considered for remote learning. Completed forms should be submitted to the Learning Bridge office to claim the high -risk exemption for COVID -19. Forms must be signed by a licensed health care provider and are subject to ve rification. Parents/Guardians will be notified when the form has been approved. Individual at Higher Risk: Individuals at higher risk for severe illness from COVID -19 are those individuals with certain underlying health conditions as designated by the CDC, which provides as follows: Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poo rly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies , and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, liver disease, or severe obesity.

Does the named student or individual in his/her household have an underlying medical condition deemed to be high risk for severe illness from COVID -19 as determined by the CDC and listed above? Yes No 2. Please provide the medical diagnosis of the underlying condition for the student/household member. _________________________________________________________________________________________ __ ___________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ ___________________ Signature of Health Care Provider Date Received by :________________________________________________ Date :______________________ 13 13 Parent Considerations for Distance Learning Parents/guardians are asked to consider the following information when seeking full -time distance learning (DL) for their student: Students w ill only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning quarter, on a case -by-case basis with public health protocols in mind. If a full -time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face -to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the real -time synchronous sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs assistance, they should not interrupt a lesson Students will be expected to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real - time sessions during the school's instructional day. Kindergarten - 2nd grade will have a minimum of 60 -90 minutes of real -time sessions daily. This may be adjusted. 3rd - 5th grade will have a minimum of 90 -120 minutes of real -time sessions daily. This may be adjusted. Middle School will have a minimum of 60 -90 minutes of real -time sessions per week per course. Full -time distance education elementary students must have an adult at home readily available to support their learning. Students will be required to attend school face -to-face for designated activities and assessments. Some courses/classes may not be offered through full -time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Parents will assist students in planning a time schedule for long -term assignments. Make -up work is available to all students. Students are responsible for asking teachers for the make -up work upon returning to class. Students will receive credit for satisfactory make -up work, including tests, after an absence, but may receive a zero for any make -up work, including tests, not made up within the allotted time. Any assignme nt not turned in within the allotted time falls within the late work guidelines. Exceptions may be granted by the teacher in extenuating circumstances. Full- Time Distance Learning Full- time distance learning will only take place for high -risk students whose exemption form has 14 14 been approved. Once eligible for the Distance Learning (DL) program, students will be assigned to the class of the dedicated DL program teacher(s) /substitute teacher(s). The school will make a schedule based on the number of DL eligible students from each grade level. The schedule may need to be revised/revisited throughout the year. Teachers will regularly review and revise the curriculum to reflect real -worl d needs, depth and complexity, rigor and relevance, and meeting all students' needs. Classwork is any instructional activity defined/planned by the teacher to be completed during a class period to facilitate the learning process. There could be occasions w here classwork becomes homework. Students will have access to DL instruction programs and resources. Students will be provided a Chromebook to take home. Students will also be provided internet service if need be. Students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in- person teacher if the entire class goes under quarantine. The DL teacher will commu nicate with families each day via email, video conferencing, or phone calls. The communication will be documented in Infinite Campus or via a spreadsheet. Suppose a student cannot be accessed via phone, video conferencing, or email. In that case, the dedicated DL teacher will need to find other ways of interacting with the family and record all communication and details. Covid -19 Positive & Close Contacts - Logistics Full- time in -person students who have tested positive for Covid -19 must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. Proof of a positive test should be provided to campus leadership . Contact tracing will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus. Full- time in -person students who have been identified as Covid -19 close contacts (from the school, SNHD, or personal connection for any case) must quarantine as dete rmined by their campus leadership. A student's quarantine can be for two weeks (most of the time) but can be longer depending on different factors. During a student's quarantine, a Chromebook will be provided if needed. School leadership will communicate the next steps for distance learning with families. Students are required to follow all procedures as stated by their teachers and leadership. Students are expected to attend class every day. Students should let teachers and front office staff know if they will be absent. Teacher(s) will try to connect with the stud ent daily. Students may return to school from their quarantine on the agreed upon date. If the student is not symptom -free at the end of their quarantine, the quarantine will be extended for the safety of everyone. Once symptom -free, they may return to in -person learning. 15 15 Quarantined Students & Distance Learning We foresee there being two types of quarantines for full -time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. Individual/Limited number of Students When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in -person teacher. All work/activities will be accessed and instruction will be synchronous. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. When only a limited number of students need to be quarantined, students will be assigned to the dedicated DL teacher's classroom. Attendance will be taken in Infinite Campus. All assignments will be turned in to the teacher . Transitioning due to Public Health Conditions Worsening public health conditions can affect the learning model that is implemented. If the Southern Nevada Health District, Center for Disease Control, and/or the Nevada Department of Education enforce new directives, we will make those changes as necessary. It will be a smooth transition for us due to our experience, and we are equipped to adapt to the changes. The past 15 months have shown that we are capable of supporting students with the necessary technology, communicating with families effectively, and providing high -quality instruction to students. If we are mandated to switch learning models during the 20 21-2022 school year, our schools and staff members will be ready. If we are forced to shift the learning model abruptly, we will be ready to make that change immediately. Serving Special Populations in Distance Learning The distance learning program will provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plan. Special education teachers will meet virtually with students as needed to meet the mandated number of instructional minutes. 16 16 School staff will consider alternative ways to provide equitable access and appropriate educational opportunities for students with disabilities, including exploring all available supplementary aids and services and relate d services to include online or virtual platforms, and/or other activities, such as paper/pencil activities. Documentation of all efforts to provide equitable access to educational opportunities is required. Special education teachers must document that the student is receiving his/her specially designed instruction through the approved instructional model on the status record. Related service providers must continue to follow current procedures to document services provided. Assessments and IEP meetings that do not need to be conducted in- person will continue to take place virtually or by phone. If the school cannot contact the parent/guardian to schedule an IEP meeting, the school will follow standard procedures. IEP teams must include any data collected, including any deficit areas, behavioral data, the effectiveness of accommodations, etc. A teacher must provide how instruction is scaffolded or the background knowledge needed for the student to complete the assignments aligned to the Nevada Standards and alignment or the goals and benchmarks/objectives. A teacher must also review and address student work and/or finished assignments, checking for understanding and accuracy, adapting content, methodology, and/or instruction to the needs of the student. When on campus for an IEP -mandated procedure, the IEP should also include input from parents/guardians regarding difficulties with the student's compliance with rules related to social distancing, wearing face coverings, washing hands, and other safety pro tocols. Goals, benchmarks and/or short- term objectives should be based on the current present levels of academic achievement and functional performance. Based on prior goals and benchmarks or objectives, the team should consider the student's anticipated progress for the remainder of the annual IEP. Staffing & Development for Distance Learning Learning Bridge will utilize licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes to be the instructors for distance education. Teachers will post the content and language objectives for each class. Teachers will be accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. Teachers will provide any support to families during distance learning. Teachers will be able to 17 17 direct families to the necessary resources in support of the student's learning; they will communicate to the student the nature of the outstanding work and th e time limitation for completing the work. During teacher in -service week, teachers will be receiving professional development and training on distance learning, Covid -19 protocols, and working with families through this time. Student Attendance in Full -Time Distance Learning Each student participating full -time in distance education will be contacted via electronic means or by telephone by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher at least once per instructional day. If a student's confirmed lack of access to a teleph one or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record attempted contact via other means (e.g., home visit) once per week and maintain a record of attempts. Staff will use a consisten t method in Infinite Campus for recording contact with students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physically present; and/or (2) The pupil makes progress in their classwork leading toward mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and/or a course's completion that can be verified through a learning management system or other means; and/or (3) The pupil participates in a real -time (synchronous) class session; and/or (4) The pupil meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who is able to discuss the pupil's progress in the course. Families m ay contact the main office of their campus if there is an attendance issue, such incorrectly marked absence. Ten consecutive unexcused absences with no contact will result in a withdrawal from the Learning Bridge . Technology Access For any students without access to such technology, school leadership will work with families to ensure technology is accessible. Families will have to complete a form to borrow the technology for the school year. If approved, students will be provided wit h a hotspot and a Chromebook at no cost to the family. 18 18 Families will receive training by a Learning Bridge staff member on how to use the technology if needed. If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year, families are encouraged to contact their teacher. Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year. Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus (at leadership's discretion). If there are greater issues in technology (i.e., internet service provider shutdown, blackout, etc.), distance learning can be done through paper correspondence. Student/Family Communication Students are required to check in with their teachers each day. Whether through email, a phone call, or (video) messaging through a learning management system and/or other platform provided by the school , it will count as an interaction for the day. A tea cher will schedule one or more conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the student is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is presenting some problem to the teacher, or in any other case t hat the teacher considers necessary. Such conferences may be handled by telephone, in person, or via written communication If families and/or students call teachers, it has to be a viable conversation about academics to count as a present attendance mark. If not answered, a voicemail message should be recorded. A teacher will respond within 24 hours. If a student emails a teacher, the teacher will respond within 24 hours. Email communication sent on Fridays after 12:00 p.m. should expect a response by close of business on the non -holiday business day. If a student has not communicated with a staff mem ber for 5 days in a row, a home visit will take place. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, campus leadership, the teacher and the community outreach coordinator will work together to provide resources. Nutrition Learning Bridge does not provide lunch for any of its students. Students bring their own lunches daily. We do however have the CACH supplemental food program that parents can contact through the school. Social -Emotional Support The pandemic has affected the social -emotional wellbeing of many people, students included. Staff 19 19 are encouraged to get to know their students and build trust and respect. Staff are trained to identify and report anything out of the ordinary. Students have an open- door policy with all staff. When a student does need social -emotional support, it is critical that parents work in partnership with school staff to create an action plan. The goal is to cope, mitigate or solve the underlying issue that is affecting the student. By addressing trauma s ensitively and thoughtfully, it will help heal the student holistically. Mask & Visitation Policy Distance learning students and their family members are required to wear masks when visiting their campus at all times. This is for the safety of the studen ts and their families. Distance learning students and their families may only stay in the main office area. For them to move through the campus, they must be given permission from school leadership. IEP students are allowed to be on campuses if it is determined that they need services that can only be performed in -person. Emergency School Closure Learning Plan Learning Bridge recognizes that there may be emergency situations that shut down a campus for an extended period of time. Examples of emergency situations could include, but not limited to, a pandemic, a facility issue, or a natural disaster. Learning Bridge is committe d to providing high -quality education to its students and has developed this emergency school closure learning plan. This plan will be made available to all staff, families, and students. This plan will succeed in delivering instruction online to meet students' elective and general education requirements. The purpose of this plan is to empower and prepare students for success by enabling them to access quality online instruction. This plan will act as a guide to improve learning and enhance student success. It is also aimed to fulfill all applicable rules, regulations, and policies stipulated by the Nevada Department of Education and the US federal government. Learning Bridge will continue t o use email, the school facebook page and the school website for normal communications with parents, students, and teachers. Education Management System Infinite Campus will continue to be used as the Student Information System (SIS). It will be the prim ary source of grading, attendance accounting and information distribution to students and families. Although the legal attendance requirement is 1 contact per student per week, the site is requiring teachers to take attendance daily to address \"absent\" students on an ongoing basis. Teachers are required to enter grades at least one time per week. 20 20 Primary Online Learning Platform Educational Platforms will be used by every teacher to relay classroom content and deliver classroom instruction. Teachers will up load videos, assignments and related information for student use. In addition to Google Cla ssroom, teachers will continue to use IXL, Khan Academy and various Computer Science platforms and Art software to provide instruction. Google Meet and Zoom are additional teleconference methods being used by teachers for classroom instruction. Student Materials, Technology, Supplies Distribution A student survey will be delivered to families to determine technology needs at the start of each school year. Chromebooks will then be distributed to families at a time, date, and location, which will be communicated right away to families. Additional supplies will also be distributed for select classes during this time . Academic Progress Tracking The staff will report to administration students who are disengaged or not showing progress in specific courses. The administration then reaches out and develops action plans for getting students back on track. Staff Communication Learning Bridge Staff will discuss the educational and social emotional needs of all of its students weekly at teacher meetings and staff meetings. Teachers are required to contact parents via as an additional means of communication with students and parents. The Administrator of Learning Bridge will join weekly planning meetings scheduled by the Central Office and SPCSA and update their staff accordingly. IT is available and established to allow teachers to reach out with any instructional technology questions they may have. Attendance Initially, teachers will reach out to the families if the students do not check -in or turn in their assignments. After some attempts, if the issue continues, teachers will inform administrators. Special Education Program The Special Education Department within Learning Bridge recognizes the unique needs, strengths, and challenges of each of its special education students and families. In our attempt to 21 21 provide the best- individualized plan of spec ialized instruction during this situation, we strive to consider factors that hinder inclusion, accessibility, and equity such as technology, family socio - economics, language and culture, and parental obligations outside of the home. Therefore, a multimoda l approach to student and family support has been put into place. Initial Preparation Prior to the transition to online instruction, in anticipation of the need to fully move to online instruction, all special education teachers continue to be provided with an introductory training to online instruction that included modes of communication and instruction, asynchronous vs synchronous instruction, preventing miscommunication within the virtual environment, and tips for online classroom management. Primary Online Platforms Google Classroom Google Meet/Chat IXL Moodle Site -specific supplemental platforms Practical Issues IT facilities and support - especially if running state -wide modules & work across parent/guardian schedules may require tutor flexibility Some functionality is impaired on mobile devices Institutional usernames and passwords to access all platforms Upkeep of the system - maintaining links etc. Monitoring student engagement Requires a similar amount of tutor time Special Education Specific Progress Monitoring Systems Paraprofessionals and Supports Virtual and Related Services and Coordination A Dedicated Special Education Person to Monitor Student Progress & Report to Team Related Service Providers 22 22 Related Services Related Service providers will continue to provide related services using online learning platforms, for the seamless continuation of face to face service delivery, when the student and parent have access to the required technology. For parents who do not have the required technology for electronic service provision, related service providers will make weekly contact with the parent to offer continued support such a recommended strategies to implement at home, connecting parents to helpful resources, and gathering information which may be beneficial for the case manager and/or special education staff to know in order to support the student in their virtual classroom environment through modification and accommodations. Special Education Teacher Each special education teacher will provide pull out service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, Google classroom, supplemental online options, and progress monitoring to ensure work towards IEP goals. Spe cial Education teachers will be available form 8:00 am - 3:00 pm Monday to Friday. Each teacher will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar classroom. This schedule will be communicated individually with parents/guardians and studen ts. A flexible option will also be available. Special education teachers will monitor student progress, attendance, and assignment completion. Special education teachers will maintain a weekly log of services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made. Further, qualitative information will be included to alert Learning Bridge special education administration to ongoing concerns or themes which need support. Paraprofessionals Paraprofessionals and their assigned case managers will be in contact throughout the week, in order to plan and provide the support required for the student and their family to meet the week's objectives. An initial learning objective will be established f or each new week, as co -designed by the case manager, student, and parent. This learning objective will be communicated with the paraprofessionals, who with the case manager, will develop a plan of action on how to measurably support the student within and outside of special education instruction, to include preparation of materials, modifying assignments, pre and reteaching, and the electronic dissemination and collection of materials. Each paraprofessional will provide push -in service minutes using asy nchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, monitoring and assisting with general education Google classrooms, student support, and supplemental online options. Paraprofessionals will be available from 9:00 am - 3:00 pm Monday to Friday. Each paraprofessional will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar school. This schedule will be communicated individually by both the paraprofessional and special education teacher to parents/guardians and students. A flexible option will also be available. 23 23 Instruction Special education support services are provided by both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Online learning platforms in use include Google Classroom and Zoom. Other methods of instruction and communication include Skype, FaceTime, email, and telephone. Teachers and support staff are required to be available between the hours of 9 am -3 pm during the school day, and as otherwise scheduled by the parent and teacher. Direct instruction is provided to address the previously designated areas of eligibility, as well as the support provided through push -in services, the modification of general education assignments, and ongoing accommodations. Special education teachers are in weekly contact with the general education classroom teachers to provide continued colla boration and planning. Parent/Guardian Communication Parents will be individually contacted by their case managers or a campus -based special education representative with a cursory description of what to expect over the coming weeks, the opportunity to schedule a phone call for Q&A, and methods by which parents could contac t their campus support person. Additionally, parents will be queried as to their digital savvy and accessibility. If school personnel need to go to the home to be sure equipment is being used properly and to ask questions we will make this happen to the best of our ability. Progress Monitoring The Learning Bridge special education staff will be designated as the individual responsible for collecting weekly progress monitoring, comparing the data against the student's goals, and ensuring that intervention d ecision making reflects the needs based on the data. This individual will also provide any necessary professional development, coaching, or other support to teachers and buildings, with best practices for designing effective and efficient progress monitori ng tools within the virtual learning environment. Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) All annual IEP meetings will be held using GoToMeeting or other platforms and scheduled by the special education teacher . Each family will have the option to sign electronic permission to share documentation if they would like documents shared via email. A ll required documentation will be sent via US Postal Service or delivered by staff if necessary. Student- Specific Decision Making Parents will be contacted weekly to determine student -specific needs. An IEP team meeting will be scheduled for any discussion impacting the IEP or change in services or placement. Based on 24 24 student and parent needs, strengths, and accessibility, examples o f instruction may include: *Asynchronous Zoom session between staff, parent, and student, whereby a specific skill is targeted and remediated through evidenced- based activities, such as phonological awareness exercises that target rhyming, blending, and so forth. *An individual act ivity in which the parent can supervise the student in independently completing several worksheets in a skill area in which the student was close to the target. *Hands -on materials, created by school staff or by parents in coordination with school staff, whereby the student can practice a new skill in math or perhaps sentence construction with parents submitting photos of the finished product will be acceptable.

In the program, schools have to provide details on their distance learning plan for full -time distance learning students for the 2021 -2022 school year. There has to be key i nformation included, such as how students were approved for distance learning, what the learning model will look like, and how attendance will be taken. The State Public Charter School Authority requested more information from schools, such as what schools are doing to ensure health and safety for all, what a school's in- person learning will look like, and what steps schools are taking to support students and staff with their social and emotional wellbeing. The 2021 Legislative Session produced Senate Bill 215. Schools are required to develop a distance education plan in the event of an emergency that may cause a school closure of at least 10 days. This way schools are more prepared to tackle any sudden closures, similar to what was experienced in spring 202 0 because of the pandemic. In an effort to streamline all of the requested information, the State Public Charter School Authority has requested that schools submit a 2021 -2022 reopening plan. In it, there are three key requirements: Requirement A: Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID -19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID- 19 on students' opportunity to learn. Requirement B: Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Distance Education P lans for the 2021 -22 school year. This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be c ompromised by attending school in -person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Requirement C: Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conduc ting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community , parents and school employees. This plan 1 Section 8 of Emergency Directive 044 2 establishes an emergency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emergency. Safe Reopening for In -Person Learning 5 MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA recognizes that the health and safety of students and staff is of the utmost importance. MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will seek data, guidance, recommendations, and/or approval from the Southern Nevada Health District, the Center for Disease Control, the Nevada Departmen t of Education, and the Nevada Governor's Office. MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will continually work with its families, staff, leadership and Board to implement Covid -19 mitigation protocols that are the safest for its in -person students and staff at any point in time. Ultimately, MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will use all available scientific information to help make a determination on these matters. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette Mater Academy of Las Vegas will continue to promote proper personal hygiene: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Wear a cloth face mask covering in public Avoid traveling if you are sick Stay home if you are feeling ill Get medical care as needed All staff that has not been fully vaccinated will be required to wear a face mask at all times. Students over the age of nine who are not vaccinated will be required to wear face masks at all times. Face masks will be provided to t hose who may need it. Students nine and under are not required to wear a mask. Students nine or older must provide evidence that they are vaccinated in order to not wear a mask. Each campus will have an abundance of signage promoting positive physical hygiene. For example, each restroom mirror will have a sticker reminding students to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds. In the event that a student may not be implementing safe and healthy hygiene practices, staff will re -educate the stude nt and inform the student's parents. Diagnostic and Screening Testing If any staff member or student is not feeling well and having any symptoms, that person will need to stay at home. They should only return to school when there are no remaining symptoms. For screening and testing, parents and staff will be required to monitor symptoms, stay home if symptoms are present, and follow all SNHD and CDC guidelines. Optional Binax Rapid tests will be provided with parent/guardian consent. Persons who test positive via Binax Rapid test will still be recommended to be tested using the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Efforts will be implemented to increase access and awareness to vaccinations. Mater Academy will 6 communicate with stakeholders about access and awareness to vaccinations when applicable. Mater Academy will continue to partner with the SNHD and the UNLV School of Medicine to provide vaccines to eligible families. If a student or staff member is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease, the person will be required to self -quarantine, and the Southe rn Nevada Health District will be contacted. MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will work in consultation with medical and public health experts, the State Public Charter School Authority, and the Nevada Department of Education to determine the extent of testing in t he school and if a closure is necessary. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will make multiple adjustments to each campus' facilities to minimize the risk of COVID- 19. Hand sanitizer pumps will be placed on walls in various locations throughout the campus. There is an increase in signage enforcing social distancing and healthy personal hygiene in hallways and classrooms. There are decals in restrooms reminding individuals to wash their hands. Furniture that is difficult to c lean will not be utilized or replaced. All air filters will be monitored and replaced as needed. HVAC vendors have serviced each campus' HVAC system more frequently in the past 12 months. All shared items, such as athletic balls, will be cleaned accordingl y There will be limited use of the water fountain. Students and staff will be encouraged to bring their own water bottles. Technology will be assigned to students as needed/requested All emergency plans will be adjusted to accommodate social distancing gui delines while maintaining the necessary safety, urgency and precaution At each campus, staff will check the cleanliness of the cam pus to ensure a safe and healthy environment. All restrooms will be monitored regularly throughout the day to ensure cleanliness. High touch points, such as water fountains, sink heads, door knobs, and student desks, will be cleaned regularly by MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA staff. Shared mater ials will be limited as much as possible, and they will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Each night, there will be daily detailed cleaning of facilities from our night vendor to ensure all areas were cleaned. In the event of a pandemic scare or a p ositive COVID -19 diagnosis, each school has been equipped COVID -19 approved machines that run ever thirty minutes to kill any possible COVID -19 materials. These will be distributed throughout the school and run accordingly. Face Coverings Our campuses wi ll have masks readily available for anyone who wants it. Ultimately, MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA for guidelines 7 requiring face coverings. If face coverings become mandated for whatever reason, MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will ensure that anyone stepping onto campus has a face covering on. Some of our students may not be able to wear a mask or face covering due to medical reasons. A doctor's note must be provided by a medical physician on their letterhead. IEP/504 students may not be required to wear masks based on individual needs. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staff that has tested positive for Covid -19, principals conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in close contact with the positive individual. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes. The principal will share the names of close contacts, their contact information, and parent information if the close contact is a student. From there, the Principal will contact the Southern Nevada Health District. At that point in time, the length of quarantine will be determined. Students or staff will remain on their quarantine and return after their quarantine time has passed and have no sym ptoms for 24 hours. Social Distancing & Capacity MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA when it comes to social distancing requirements and room capacity limits. MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA has measured each of its classrooms. It knows the full capacity limit and can adjust accordingly to any p ercentage. Accommodations for Children with Disabilities The EL Team, SPED team, and school support staff will schedule time during both in- person and for students who have to be quarantined or have documentation from a medical professional to support Engl ish language learners and special education students. Instructional aides will be accessible during in- person instruction and remote instruction. Remote instruction students have access to remote break -out groups to receive small group or one -on-one instructional support. The school will evaluate the efficacy of the plan based on student engagement, student data and stakeholder feedback. Vaccination Access & Awareness MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA has and will continue to strongly encourage students, families and staff members to get their vaccinations if they are of age and health abides. MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA campuses will promote local and site based testing sites in order to raise awareness. 8 Traveling Abroad A quarantine may be required if a student/staf f member has returned from traveling to an international COVID -19 hotspot, as determined by school leadership. There will be an exception for families that had work -related military job duty responsibilities. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing Student and Staff wellbeing is at the top of Mater Academy of Nevada 's list. SEL time has been built in to our everyday schedules to make sure that we are checking in with our students daily. Wellness and Recovery SOCIAL -EMOTIONAL LEARNING - TIER 1 Social Emotional Learning team (SEL team) will first begin by providing training to all staff, including teachers, administration and support positions, on how to address student trauma, activities to start open conversations in classrooms, and how to refe r students who may be struggling more significantly. TRAUMA- INFORMED PRACTICES - TIERS 1 -3 Referral system starts with training teachers and staff to know the signs and symptoms of anxiety and depression in students and who they can contact on the SEL t eam for further assistance. Training will begin the first week back for teachers in either in person or webinar format. Tier 1 (universal) trauma -informed practices will be in place Teachers being supplied \"teachable moment\" lesson plans, following CALM procedures, maintaining an optimistic and calm approach to COVID concerns for students while adhering to CDC recommendations for safety of students and staff. Addressing key issues with facts and fostering a supportive and safe community for children and parents. What TIER 2 and TIER 3 additional supports will be available to support students, families and staff that may be in need of more intensive support? SEL team, including psychologist, counselors, and social workers will be available by referral to speak with families and students individually in order to provide school based, solution focused, therapy and outside resources for families in need. Suppor ting Educators and Staff MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will support educators and staff by focusing on areas to ensure their safety and well -being. 9 1. Foster wellness . MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA has and will continue to educate staff about mental health and encourage open conversation about the challenges people are experiencing, employees may be more likely to access care when needed. MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will continue to have an open door policy with their staff which allows them to feel comfortable to come in and talk about things they may be going through. Mater Academy of Nevada will continue to do weekly check- ins with their teachers to provide consistent opportunities for those conversations to be had. 2. Provide training . MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will continue t o put an emphasis on training all staff not just at the beginning of the year, but weekly trainings to allow teachers that continued professional development. 3. Model healthy behavior: MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will promote an emphasis of school leadership to be the driving force behind modeling behavior for the rest of the staff which will make its way down to students modeling proper behaviors. Implementing Assessments/ Pairing Data with Instruction Mater Academy of Nevada will continue to use diagnostic and formative assessments of student data (MAP, i -Ready, etc.) to evaluate the needs and effectiveness of instruction and determine the needs of students' academic progress. Teachers will have data chats with students and determine student goals based on formative assessments, summative assessments, and diagnostic results. Teachers will work with students to evaluate their progress toward their personalized goals and create a plan of action to work toward meeting those goals. We will utilize PLCs to analyze and monitor data to determine class and grade level needs to support students who need intervention, extension, and re-teaching. We will provide needed resources including necessary technology and curricular needs to those students who remain virtual due to a medical necessity or a necessary quarantine. Path Forward Program: Distance Learning Mater Academy of Nevada has created a distanc e learning plan for the 2021 -2022 school year. MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA recognizes that there may be families that need to keep learning in a virtual environment. The distance learning plan is specifically designed for students: With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in- person learning, as determined by a medical health professional Who tested positive for Covid -19 Students who have to quarantine due to exposure 10 High -Risk Medical Exemption Process If a student or an individu al in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition*, a Medical Certification for COVID- 19 High Risk Exemption Form (provided in the next section) may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home. A health care medical pr ofessional must complete the exemption form and email it to MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA . MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will review the form, and either approve or deny. The medical exemption form is attached. Students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not participate in any in- person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). There may be times, like for important assessments, where students may need to be on campus. During these times, a safe, socially -distanced environment will be set up for the students to be in. Every person will wear a mask in these environments. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be a llowed to switch back to in -person learning at the end of first semester - which will be determined on a case -by-case basis. High Risk Exemption Form Page 1 - Information If a student or an individual in his/her household has a high -risk medical condition *, a Medical Certification for COVID -19 High Risk Exemption Form may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021 -2022 school year. Students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not participate in any in -person learning, face -to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior appro val). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID -19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning - which will be determined on a case -by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. Distance learning will consist of your student working individually on assigned work through different learning platforms. Students will check in with their teacher for progress check -ins, checking for understanding of the lessons, academic goal setting, assessment preparation, etc. *Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but n ot limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart 11 disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. Procedure for submitting a medi cal exemption form: Please see the next page for the form. Fill in your child's name, grade, campus, and the parent -related information. Have your licensed health care provider complete and sign the form. Turn in the completed form to the front office staff. For siblings , one form must be completed for each sibling. If the student's medical physician cannot be reached for signature (i.e., moved to Las Vegas from another state), a letter from the physician on letterhead will suffice in place of the form All medical exemption requests will be subject to verification. form must be completed and signed by a licensed health care provider and is subject to verification . Parents/guardians will be notified by campus leadership when the form has been verified and accepted.

Please provide the medical diagnosis of the underlying condition for the student/household member. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________ _________________________________________ ___________________ Signature of Health Care Provider Date Received by :________________________________________________ Date :______________________ Parent Considerations for Distance Learning Parents/guardians are asked to consider the following information when seeking full -time distance learning (DL) for their student: Students will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning, which will be determined on a case -by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. If a full -time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face -to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the real -time synchronous sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs assistance, they should not interrupt a lesson A student participating in full -time distance learning who qualifies for free and reduced lunch, may receive meals at the school at no cost. 13 Successful candidates for full -time distance learning have demonstrated positive attendance and grades during the previous year of school. All full -time distance learning requests are subject to approval by the school leadership. Students will be expected to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real-time sessions during the s chool's instructional day. Some courses/classes may not be offered through full -time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Parents will assist students in planning a time schedule for long -term assignments. Make -up work is available to all students. Students are responsible for asking teachers for the make -up work upon returning to class. Students will receive credit for satisfactory make -up work, including tests, after an absence, but may receive a zero for any make -up work, including tests, not made up within the allotted time. Any assignment not turned in within the allotted time falls within the late work guidelines. Exceptions may be granted by the teacher in extenuating circumstanc es. Covid -19 Positive & Close Contacts - Logistics Full- time in -person students who have tested positive for Covid -19 must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. Proof of a positive test should be provided to campus leadership . Contact tracin g will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus. Full- time in -person students who have been identified as Covid -19 close contacts (from the school, SNHD, or personal connection for any case) must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. A student's quarantine can be for two weeks (most of the time) but can be longer dependi ng on different factors. School leadership will communicate the next steps for distance learning with families. Students are required to follow all procedures as stated by their teachers and leadership. Students are expected to attend class every day. Students should let teachers and front office staff know if they will be absent. Teacher(s) will try to connect with the student daily. Students may return to school from their quarantine on the agreed upon date. If the student is not symptom -free at the end of their quarantine, the quarantine will be extended for the safety of everyone. Once symptom -free, they may return to in -person lear ning. Quarantined Students & Distance Learning We foresee there being two types of quarantines for full -time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. Individual/Limited number of Students 14 When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, stude nts will be placed in Distance Learning with their in -person teacher. I nstruction will be synchronous through Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. Attendance will be taken i n Infinite Campus. Full -Time Distance Learning Full- time distance learning will only take place for high -risk students whose exemption form has been approved, or for a student who need to be quarantined. The school will work to ensure continuity of services, including access to necessary technology and resources, special education and EL services, and nutrition services for students participating in distance education by following the protocols set forth in Directive 044 . Serving Special Populations in Distance Learning Assessments, MDT meetings, and IEP meetings that do not need to be conducted in -person will continue to take place virtually or by phone. If the school cannot contact the parent/guardian to schedule an IEP meeting, the school will follow standard procedures. IEP teams must include any data collected, including any deficit areas, behavioral data, the effectiveness of accommodations, etc. When on campus for an IEP -mandated procedure, the IEP s hould also include input from parents/guardians regarding difficulties with the student's compliance with rules related to social distancing, wearing face coverings, washing hands, and other safety protocols. Goals, benchmarks and/or short -term objectives should be based on the current present levels of academic achievement and functional performance. Based on prior goals and benchmarks or objectives, the team should consider the student's anticipated progress for the remainder of the annual IEP. Staffing & Development for Distance Learning Mater Academy of Nevada will utilize licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes to be the instructors for distance education. Teachers will post the content and language objectives for each class. 15 These teachers will create lessons and units through Colegia and other programs to assist with planning instruction. Teachers will be accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. Teachers will provide any support to families during distance learning. Teachers will be able to direct families to the necessary resources in support of the student's learning; they will communicate to the student the nature of the outstanding work and the time limitation for completing the work. During teacher in -service wee k, teachers will be receiving professional development and training on distance learning, Covid -19 protocols, and working with families through this time. Student Attendance in Full -Time Distance Learning Each student participating full -time in distance ed ucation will be contacted via electronic means or by telephone by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher at least once per instructional day. If a student's confirmed lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record attempted contact via other means (e.g., home visit) once per week and maintain a record of attempts. Staff will use a consistent method in Infinite Campus for recording contact wit h students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through Canvas. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physical ly present; and/or (2) The pupil makes progress in their classwork leading toward mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and/or a course's completion that can be verified through a learning management system or other means; and/or (3) The pupil participates in a real -time (synchronous) class session; and/or (4) The pupil meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who is able to discuss the pupil's progress in the course. Families may contact the main office of their campus if there is an attendance issue, such incorrectly marked absence. Ten consecutive unexcused absences with no contact will resul t in a withdrawal from the Mater Academy . 16 Social -Emotional Support The pandemic has affected the social -emotional we llbeing of many people, students included. Staff are encouraged to get to know their students and build trust and respect. Staff are trained to identify and report anything out of the ordinary. Students have an open- door policy with all staff. When a stude nt does need social -emotional support, it is critical that parents work in partnership with school staff to create an action plan. The goal is to cope, mitigate or solve the underlying issue that is affecting the student. By addressing trauma sensitively a nd thoughtfully, it will help heal the student holistically. Education Management System Infinite Campus will continue to be used as the Student Information System (SIS). It will be the primary source of grading, attendance accounting and information distr ibution to students and families. Although the legal attendance requirement is 1 contact per student per week, the site is requiring teachers to take attendance daily . Primary Online Learning Platform Google Classroom will be used by every teacher to rela y classroom content and deliver classroom instruction. Each teacher shared their Google Classroom codes with administration through a Google Form to create a Master List so all staff could access codes for any student or parent further streamlining the enr ollment process. Teachers upload videos, assignments and related information for student use. In addition to Google Classroom, teachers will continue to use IXL, iReady, and their online curriculums. Google Meet and Zoom are additional teleconference meth ods being used by teachers for classroom instruction. Student Materials, Technology, Supplies Distribution Chromebooks will be distributed to families at a time, date, and location, which will be communicated right away to families. Additional supplies wi ll also be distributed for select cl asses during this time. Academic Progress Tracking The Counseling Department created a Google Form for staff to report students who are disengaged or not showing progress in specific courses. The administration then reac hes out and develops action plans for getting students back on track. 17 Staff Communication Grade level, department, and all staff zoom meetings are scheduled weekly as well as emergency staff meetings when ne cessary. Teachers are required to contact parents via email or Google Voice phone number as an additional means of communication with students and parents. Weekly PLC's and Staff Meetings are held via Google Meet or Zoom. Principals will join weekly planning meetings sche duled by the SPCSA and upd ate their staff accordingly. A tech team has been established that allows teachers to reach out with any instructional technology questions they may have. Attendance Teachers will reach out to the families if the students do not check -in or turn in their assignments. After some attempts, if the issue continues, teachers will inform administrators. The administration will reach out to families whose child(ren) does not check -in by Wednesdays. Registrars enter attendance for the school by the end of Friday fo r each week. Special Education Program The Special Education Department within Mater Academy of Nevada recognizes the unique needs, strengths, and challenges of each of its special education students and families. In our attempt to provide the best- individ ualized plan of specialized instruction during this situation, we strive to consider factors that hinder inclusion, accessibility, and equity such as technology, family socio -economics, language and culture, and parental obligations outside of the home. Th erefore, a multimodal approach to student and family support has been put into place. Initial Preparation Prior to the transition to online instruction, in anticipation of the need to fully move to online instruction, all special education teachers were pr ovided with an introductory training to online instruction that included modes of communication and instruction, asynchronous vs synchronous instruction, preventing miscommunication within the virtual environment, and tips for online classroom management. Primary Online Platforms Google Classroom Google Meet/Chat Zoom 18 Colegia IXL Springboard Wonders GoMath Amplify Practical Issues IT facilities and support - especially if running state -wide modules & work across parent/guardian schedules may require tutor flexibility Some functionality is impaired on mobile devices Institutional usernames and passwords to access all platforms Upkeep of system - maintaining links etc. Monitoring student engagement Requires a similar amount of tutor time Special Educ ation Specific Progress Monitoring Systems Paraprofessionals and Supports Virtual and Related Services and Coordination A Dedicated Special Education Person to Monitor Student Progress & Report to Team Related Service Providers Related Services Related Service providers will continue to provide related services using online learning platforms, for the seamless continuation of face to face service delivery, when the student and parent have access to the required technology. For parents who do not have the required technology for electronic service provision, related service providers will make weekly contact with the parent to offer continued support such a recommended strategy to implement at home, connecting parents to helpful resources, and gathering information which may be beneficial for the case manager and/or special education staff to know in order to support the stud ent in their virtual classroom environment through modification and accommodations. Related Service Providers will maintain a weekly log of services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made. Further, qualitative information will be included to alert MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA special education administration to ongoing concerns or themes which need support. A special education administrative staff with MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will collect weekly records of communica tion between the related service providers, students, and parents, and determine areas that need further support, based on the data. 19 Special Education Teacher Each special education teacher will provide pull out service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, Google classroom, supplemental online options, and progress monitoring to ensure work towards IEP goals. Special Education teac hers will be available form 8:00 am - 3:30 pm Monday to Friday. Each teacher will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar classroom. This schedule will be communicated individually with parents/guardians and students. A flexible option will also be available. Special education teachers will monitor student progress, attendance, and assi gnment completion.

A special education administrative staff with MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA will collect weekly records of communication between the related service providers, students, and parent s, and determine areas that need further support, based on the data. Paraprofessionals Paraprofessionals and their assigned case managers will be in contact throughout the week, in order to plan and provide the support required for the student and their fa mily to meet the week's objectives. An initial learning objective will be established for each new week, as co -designed by the case manager, student, and parent. This learning objective will be communicated with the paraprofessionals, who with the case manager, will develop a plan of action on how to measurably support the student within and outside of special education instruction, to include preparation of materials, modifying assignments, pre and reteaching, and the electronic dissemination and collectio n of materials. Each paraprofessional will provide push -in service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, monitoring and assisting with general education Google classrooms, student support, and supplemental online options. Paraprofessi onals will b e available from 8:00 am - 3:30 pm Monday to Friday. Each paraprofessional will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar school.

Instruction Special education support services are provided by both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Online learning platforms in use include Google Classroom and Zoom. Other methods of instruction and communication include Skype, FaceTime, email, and telephone. Teachers and support staff are required to be available between the hours of 7:30 am-3:30 pm during the school day, and as otherwise scheduled by the par ent and teacher. Direct instruction is provided to address the previously designated areas of eligibility, as well as the support provided through push -in services, the modification of general education assignments, and ongoing 20 accommodations. Special education teachers are in weekly contact with the general education classroom teachers to provide continued collaboration and planning. Parent/Guardian Communication Parents were individually contacted by their case managers or a campus -based special education representative with a cursory description of what to expect over the coming weeks, the opportunity to schedule a phone call for Q&A, and methods by which parents could contact their campus support person. Additionally, parents were further queried as to t heir digital savvy and accessibility. Progress Monitoring The MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA special education administrative staff will be designated as the individual responsible for collecting weekly progress monitoring, comparing the data against the student' s goals, and ensuring that intervention decision making reflects the needs based on the data. This individual will also provide any necessary professional development, coaching, or other support to teachers and buildings, with best practices for designing effective and efficient progress monitoring tools within the virtual learning environment. Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) All annual IEP meetings will be held using GoToMeeting and scheduled by the case manager. Each family will have the option to sign electronic permission to share documentation if they would like documents shared via email. All required documentation will be sent via US Postal Service. Student -Specific Decision Making Parents will be contacted weekly to determine student -specific needs. An IEP team meeting will be scheduled for any discussion impacting the IEP or change in services or placement. Based on student and parent needs, strengths, and accessibility, examples of instruction may include: *Asynchronous Zoom session between staff, parent, and student, whereby a specific skill is targeted and remediated through evidenced -based activities, such as phonological awareness exercises that target rhyming, blending, and so forth. *An individual activity in which the parent c an supervise the student in independently completing several worksheets in a skill area in which the student was close to the target. *Hands -on materials, created by school staff or by parents in coordination with school staff, whereby the student can exer cise practicing a new skill in math or sentence construction with parents submitting photos of the finished product. 21 Elementary Approximate Time Frames for Learning Students are responsible for visiting their teacher's Google Classroom page for online assignments on a daily basis Students will attend virtual class as specified in each teacher's email Students will have assignments from each teacher with specified due dates Counselors will be available to support students with academic, social, or emotional needs.

Establish routines and expectations 3. Take an active role in helping your student process and own their learning 4. Encourage physical activity and/or exercise 5. Monitor how much time student is spending online 6. Monitor student's social media use, especially during school closure. 7. Cyber bullying: the use of electronic communication to bully a person including sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. What should you do if you're being bullied? Do not respond to harassment or threats --this may encourage the bully. Keep a record of messages received (print or take screenshots). Reach out to parents, teachers, counselors, and school administrators. Block communication from the bully (if possible). Do not participate in cyberbully ing (even in response to a bully). Ask for help if you are being cyberbullied. Stand up if you see somebody being cyberbullied Technology Access If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year, families are encouraged to contact their teacher. Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year. Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus (at leadership's disc retion). Student/Family Communication Students are required to check in with their teachers each day. Whether through email, a phone call, or (video) messaging through a learning management system and/or Zoom, it will count as an interaction for the day. A teacher will schedule one or more conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the student is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is presenting some problem to the teacher, or in any other ca se that the teacher considers necessary. If a student has not communicated with a staff member for 5 days in a row, a home visit will take place. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, campus leadership, the teacher and the community outreach coordinator will work together to provide resources. 24 Nutrition Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school For virtual students to receive their lunch, the student and/or a family member will need to visit the campus in -person during a designated lunch period set by the campus administration. The school will then provide a lunch meal. Mask & Visitation Policy Distance lea rning students and their family members are required to wear masks when visiting their campus at all times. This is for the safety of the students and their families. IEP students are allowed to be on campuses if it is determined that they need services th at can only be performed in -person. Emergency School Closure Learning Plan MATER ACADEMY OF NEVADA recognizes that there may be emergency situations that shut down a campus for an extended period of time. Examples of emergency situations could include, but not limited to, a pandemic, a facility issue, or a natural disaster. In the case of a school wide shut down due to an outbreak, Mater Academy will transition smoothly to a full virtual teaching model through the use of our technology at our disposal. Teachers will use the \"classroom of the future\" technology that was purchased for last year's instruction to provide the best education possible if students are at home. Mater Academy of Nevada is a one to one technology system, which allows instruction to be delivered from a distance. Students will access their online curriculums in order to continue their education. Additional Outreach Emails will be sent weekly with details providing drive -through lunch options for students.

Each classroom will have a calm down routine and students will be able to ask for a br eak and access a calm down strategy. Our school is in the PBIS cohort and will be actively using our PRIDE system to positively support students and their behavior. We will use data from our PBIS system to help inform school wide, as well as classroom, trends and determine what time to teaching and support is needed to help shift inappropriate behaviors. Staff has been trained on Restorative Questioning and we will continue to use those questions when working through an issue with a student. o Social Emotiona l Learning -Tier 2 and 3 Counseling staff and/or members of the Leadership Team will check in on students who are Tier 2 or 3 for behavior, or who are simply having a difficult time with the current situation. Counseling staff will be facilitating several different types of support groups for students. Students who need more one -on-one support will have either daily or weekly check ins with the counseling staff. Some students will be on a daily check in/check out program for support. Restorative resolution meetings will happen after a situation arises and then follow up check ins will continue until the situation has been completely resolved. Counseling staff will continually look for and update our resource list for parents and help parents get the suppor t they need. o Staff Emotional Learning Our staff has been trained on Trauma Informed Practices and Secondary Trauma. We will continue to revisit these topics during the year with PD as well as our Wednesday Wellness and Thankful Thursday emails. The leader ship team will model leading a balanced life and encouraging staff to balance their life as well. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning Assessments We will use diagnostic and formative assessments of student data (MAP, iReady, Curriculum summative assessments, Brigance Screener for Kindergarten, etc.) to evaluate the needs and effectiveness of instruction and determine the needs of students' academic progress. Pairing Data with Instruction Teachers will have data chats with students and determine student goals based on formative assessments, summative assessments, and diagnostic results. Students will participate in small group interventions every day to address any learning gaps and provide students support to close those gaps Teachers will work with students to evaluate their progress toward their personalized goals and create a plan of action to work toward meeting those goals. We will utilize PLCs to analyze and monitor data to determine c lass and grade level needs to support students who need intervention, extension, and re - teaching. In-Person Learning and Special Populations All students with IEP will continue to receive their individual educational assistance in the school setting from t heir teachers. EL services will be provided through either an integrated program or a pull -out program, depending on the students' individual needs. MANN will follow all state and federal guidelines around these programs to ensure that our students receive the very best. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in- person Mater Academy of Northern Nevada (MANN) has created the following distance education plan for students who may need to learn remotely. Currently, all students at MANN are returning to full time, in person learning. This plan will be used if a student needs to quarantine, becomes ill, or has a health issue where they need limited exposure to other students. o Our distance learning plan wil l address the needs of students in the following situations: Medical situation that requires a limited exposure to in person learning Positive Covid result Quarantined because of close contact to a Covid patient o Medical Exemption Parent will provide medic al documentation about the current medical needs of the child. The parent and the school principal will have a meeting to determine what the needs of the student are and develop a plan to accommodate their individual medical situation. If a student requi res a distance learning plan, they will not be able to participate in any school activities for the length of their distance learning. This would include after school clubs, night events, school pictures, and field trips. If the student needs to be in pe rson for any assessments. A safe space where the child can socially distance will be provided. Every person in that space will be in a mask for the entire time. Once approved for distance learning, the student will remain in the distance program until th ere is a change in recommendation from the child's medical provider. If at any time during the school year, a child has a change in health condition the steps mentioned above would be followed. All parents at MANN were notified in the spring of the return to full time in person learning for the 2021- 2022 school year and no students were in need of this option at that time. No parents have reached out to request a distance education plan since the spring either. If a student begins to struggle on a distance education plan, a parent conference will be held, and an intervention plan developed to help support the student with learning at home or to determine the need to return to in person learning. If a student is having attendance issues while on full time di stance education, a parent conference will be held, and an attendance plan developed to support the student learning at home or determine the need for the student to return to in person learning. If the student has an IEP, their case manager will work with the family to provide services during distance learning. o Parent Considerations for a Distance Learning Plan Students will need to watch the recorded instructional lessons daily Students will need to complete asynchronistic assignments (iReady , ST Math, Smarty Ants) daily Students will need to sign on to a live zoom call with their teachers daily An adult will need to be home with their child if their child is in elementary school Parents will need to contact the school immediately if a problem arises Students who are on Distance Education will be able to have a parent pick up a grab and go meal from Mater Academy of Northern Nevada at 8:30 every day. They will be able to pick up both a breakfast and a lunch for the day. o Full Time Distance Lear ning Students will be assigned either a Chromebook or an iPad Students will have Math and ELA recorded lessons daily to watch. Middle School students will have all of their core content areas to watch. Students will have assignments to complete after wat ching the recorded lessons that will need to be submitted to the teacher at the end of each instructional day. Students will spend one hour a day participating in asynchronistic lessons through various learning platforms (iReady, ST Math, USA Test Prep, Sm arty Ants) Students will sign on to zoom daily to meet with their teacher. Students will access their lessons, assignments, and zoom links through the Colegia platform. The teacher will communicate with parents daily through the zoom call, class dojo messa ges, IC messages and/or IC grade updates. o Specialized teachers will provide students who require individual educational support (IEP/EL/504) with the following supports: Classroom lessons through Zoom On-line curriculum Differentiated computer -based instr uction Classroom assignments Special Education teachers and related service providers will document all services. Any assessments, meetings or IEPs that can be conducted virtually will. If the student needs to be in person for any assessments. A safe space where the child can socially distance will be provided. Every person in that space will be in a mask for the entire time. o Teacher will document daily student attendance in Infinite Campus using one of the following: Monitoring student learning on- line Assignments submitted to the teacher Phone call home Zoom meeting If a child does not participate, after a week of attempted contact by the teacher, administration will conduct a home visit. All attempts at contact will be documented in a Path Forward Distance Education Log. o Full Time Distance Learning \u2014Class or School Wide If the entire class or school has to mo ve to a distance learning environment, the entire class would participate in the activities listed above on a daily basis until in person learning can resume. Mater Academy was able to transition our school to a full -time virtual platform in the spring of 2020 with very little planning time. We were again able to transition to a hybrid learning model in the Fall of 2020 with minimal lead time. We will use the positive programs and systems, lessons learned, as well as parent feedback from those experiences to help us transition to an alternative learning format if a health crisis requires that. o Students with positive Covid results or close contact with a Covid patient Parent will provide documentation from the WCHD to determine how long the student will nee d to be out of school. If a child is too sick to participate in their learning, they will be marked absent and then allowed to make up the missed instruction. Students who are quarantined or out with Covid will participate in the learning plan detailed in the full -time distance learning above. Students may return to school after their quarantined time. If they are not symptom free, they will need to continue to participate in distance learning until they are symptom free for 24 hours. o Technology Access All students will be assigned either a Chromebook or iPad. If a family doesn't have access to internet, we will work with the family to provide a hot spot Tech support will be available during the school day, either over the phone or with the parent bringing the device in to have it looked at. At the end of the year, families will need to return all technology which was checked out to them, including charging cords and cases. If a family has an internet disruption, they need to call the school and not ify us of the reason for the missed instruction. A paper instructional packet will be created and provided to the family until the internet is reestablished. o Student/Family Communications Students are required to sign into zoom daily to meet with their te achers Teachers will schedule conference if the student is struggling with any aspect of their distance learning. Teachers will schedule conferences on zoom during the regularly scheduled conference weeks. If a child or parent emails a teacher for support, the teacher will return the email within 24 hours. If a child does not participate, after a week of attempted contact by the teacher, administration will conduct a home visit. All attempts at contact will be documented in a Path Forward Distance Education Log. If a family indicates the need for support or resources, admin will work with teacher, counselor and outside agencies to provide the support needed. o Nutrition Students who are on Distance Education will be able to have a parent pick up a grab and go meal from Mater Academy of Northern Nevada at 8:30 every day. They will be able to pick up both a breakfast and a lunch for the day. o Masks If a student is on full time distance learning and are visiting the campus, every family member will be required to wear a mask. The family will only be able to stay in the main office area, unless a clean and safe space has already been set up for the student. Distance Education: Emergency Closure Mater Academy was able to transition our school to a full -time virtual platform in the spring of 2020 with very little planning time. We were again able to transition to a hybrid learning model in the Fall of 2020 with minimal lead time. We will use the successful programs and systems, lessons learned, as well as parent feedback from those experiences to help us transition to an alternative learning format if a health crisis requires that. o Full Time Distance Learning Students will be assigned either a C hromebook or an iPad Students will have live Math and ELA lessons daily. Students will have assignments to complete after watching the recorded lessons that will need to be submitted to the teacher at the end of each instructional day. Students will spend one hour a day participating in asynchronistic lessons through various learning platforms (iReady, ST Math, USA Test Prep, Smarty Ants) Students will sign on to zoom daily to meet with their teacher. Students will access their lessons, assignments, and zo om links through the Colegia platform. The teacher will communicate with parents daily through the zoom call, class dojo messages, IC messages and/or IC grade updates. o Specialized teachers will provide students who require individual educational support (IEP/EL/504) with the following supports: Classroom lessons through Zoom On-line curriculum Differentiated computer -based instruction Classroom assignments Special Education teachers and related service providers will document all services. Any assessments, meetings or IEPs that can be conducted virtually will. If the student needs to be in person for any assessments. A safe space where the child can socially distance will be provided. Every person in that space will be in a mask for the entire time. o Teacher will document daily student attendance in Infinite Campus using one of the following: Monitoring student learning on- line Assignments submitted to the teacher Phone call home Zoom meeting If a child does not participate, after a week o f attempted contact by the teacher, administration will conduct a home visit. All attempts at contact will be documented in a Path Forward Distance Education Log. 2021- 2022 School Year Plan In-Person Learning: Health and Safety Nevada Connections Academy (NCA) is a program of full -time distance education. Though we provide school virtually, there will be staff members at our main office located in Reno, Nevada. We will also be holding various field trips and events throughout the year. In order to best protect staff who may be working in the office, office staff will remain on a rotation schedule until further notice. This will ensure tha t no more than one staff member is at the office at a time. If more staff need to be present, we will observe CDC and state protocols regarding social distancing and mask mandates. Janitorial staff will continue to do a regular deep cleaning. Wipes are placed in high touch places and required signs have been posted throughout the building. The office will be cleaned and sanitized three days per week. However, if we have an illness in the office we will have the office deep cleaned immediately that evening. Nevada Connections Academy plans on providing some in- person/field trip opportunities during the upcoming school year. During the in- person events, NCA will follow all CDC and local health authority recommendations and guidance to ensure compliance as well as the safety and wellbeing of students, staff and family members. Hand sanitizer will be provided, masks will be available for those that would like to wear one and wipes will be accessible for all. We will also be providing virtual events to ensure that participation in events is still available for students and families who may not feel comfortable attending in -person. In order to protect the health and well -being of all staff, in person events are currently optional for staff that having continuing concerns regarding COVID -19. For in- person meetings (i.e. back to school professional development, etc.) staff who continue have COVID -19 concerns are provided with a virtual option. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing Although we provide full time distance education for all students, our student's social, emotional, mental and physical health needs are one of our top priorities. In order to m eet students' social, emotional, mental and physic al health needs , NCA provides a variety of supports. To begin, a ll students are placed with a homeroom teacher who has been trained and receives continuous bi -weekly professional development training to address better support student needs and provide resources and strategies . Students are placed on a monthly, bi - weekly or weekly call rotation depending on their academic and/or social need. Students may request to increase call frequency if they desire. Homeroom teachers also provide LiveLessons for student s to attend. This helps give students a sense of community and belonging. Grade level academies will be implemented at the start of the 21 -22 School Year. Each grade level will work together to create events (virtual and in person), discuss ways to increas e student engagement and ensure that a sense of community is felt not only within the grade level academy but throughout NCA as well. Additionally, if greater level of supports are needed, students are id entified by counselors/teachers. These supports include but aren't limited to: Child Welfare, SEL Mentors, increased call frequency from homeroom teacher and calls from administration. Each case is looked at individually and the proper supports are put in place based on the needs of the individual student. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning Though our students attend virtually and did not have to transition as hastily as those in a traditional brick and mortar school, we are aware of the following: Students who enrolled at NCA due to COVID restrictions Students who were directly impacted by COVID whether that be contracting COVID themselves or having someone in their family or friends contract the virus. Students who have lost someone due to COVID. We are prepared to re- engage our students, detect barriers and/or concerns and identify academic learning gaps. The following will be utilized throughout the school year: Data from the 20 -21 School Year will be utilized to identify students needing extra support from the start of the year. o Reading Support - Students who obtained a reading score on the Renaissance Star 360 Assessment that fell in the bottom tenth percentile will be placed in an extra support group with our Literacy Coach. o Onboarding - Newly enrolled 10th graders will be sectioned into an Onboarding Section with our Onboarding Specialists. Students will remain in this section until our Onboarding Specialist has determined they are prepared to work independently. Important Note: 11 th & 12th grade enrollment is closed so there will be no new 11th and 12th graders this school year. 9th grade onboarding will take place in their homeroom since all 9th graders will be new to NCA. o At Risk Students - Students identified through our data reports that provide number of credits earned and number of failed courses, will be placed into a separate section for extra support from our Onboarding Specialist. They will receive re -onboarding help and academic guidance to increase their chances of success. Benchmark Assessments - Students will complete the Renaissance Star 360 Assessment during the fall, winter and s pring testing windows. o Data obtained from these assessments throughout the year will be analyzed frequently. Adjustments will be made to the sections detailed above as needed. Counseling LiveLessons - Our counseling team will be holding monthly counseling lessons to help support our students socially and emotionally. Lesson topics will also include: credit tracking, transcript reading, planning for graduation and college & career readiness. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in person Students unable to participate in person would not be impacted being that we are a virtual school. All students will be receiving an education virtually. In addition to completing their lessons through their daily planner, they will be invited to participa te in the following: Phone calls with their homeroom and content area teachers LiveLessons (held virtually) with their homeroom and content area teachers Virtual Field Trips Virtual Grade Level Assemblies Clubs and extra -curricular activities (chosen by the student) held virtually Benchmark Assessments where students will attend virtually and will be monitored by their homeroom teacher Other events and activities held virtually that will be planned throughout the year Distance E ducation: Emergency Closure If restrictions were increased and schools were to return to virtual education, NCA would run as normal. No changes would need to be made to the day to day operations and student learning as we are a full -time virtual school. In regards to field trips and events, all i n-person events would be canceled until further notice . Events and field trips would take place virtually. T he main office would also be completely closed if state restrictions prohibit in person interaction. Distance Education: Supporting Students The following supports are in place for students at all times throughout the school year: Technology - Upon enrollment, students and families can decide to use a school provided computer. They may also choose to opt out if they have a personal device. Students are informed that their device must be a desktop, laptop or tablet. Lessons may not be completed on their cell phone. If they initially choose to decline the school provided technology, they may choose to adjust this at any point in the school year. Families with more than one student enrolled at NCA may also request to have more than one computer sent in order to provide one on one technology. Families may also qualify for internet subsidies twice per year. Special Education - Each student with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) has designated Case Manager to work with them throughout the school year. The Case Manager will hold necessary IEP meetings, regular phone calls with the family and LiveLesson supports based on the student's IEP goals. Students with IEP's will also be sectioned into general education classes where they will have access to g eneral education teachers, curriculum, LiveLessons and support. Students who may be eligible to receive Special Education services will be discussed with our Manager of Special Education Services. EL Services - During the enrollment process, students ident ified as English Language Learners will populate on a report. This report can be pulled by administration and or English Language Specialist. Our EL Specialist sets up regular calls, holds LiveLessons and provides ongoing support to all identified EL stude nts. Nutrition Services - Though we do not have a cafeteria and we do not provide food to our students, if a student and their family needs nutrition services, we will provide them the necessary information to get them the needed resources. McKinney Vent o Students - During the enrollment process, students with unstable living environments are flagged for our McKinney Vento Liaison to review and assess. Our MV Liaison will reach out to each family flagged to offer support and resources. Regular calls will be scheduled if necessary. Reopening and Path Forward Distance Learning Plan Summary Nevada Prep Charter School Revised July 14, 2021 Disclaimer: This document is a summary intended to: 1) meet the requirements of the information requested by the State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA); and 2) communicate this information in summary form to interested external parties. More detailed information about specific staff procedures, routines, and training is not included here but is available for review upon request. In an effort to directly respond to all requirements from the SPCSA, this document is structured to include the SPCSA's headers and sub-questions for reference. Throughout the document, the SPCSA's criteria and questions are highlighted in yellow, and the school's responses to the questions follow in plain text. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety: How will the school maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other school staff? Student and staff safety is our top priority. We will continue to monitor guidance from federal and local officials. We will also continue to gather feedback from our community to ensure that people are safe and feel safe. The responses below provide more context on specific actions the school has taken or will take to reduce risks and promote health and safety of our community. How is the school addressing key CDC recommendations including: Use of face coverings; As long as mask-wearing is required or recommended by the CDC and local health authorities, NV Prep will require mask wearing in accordance with federal and local guidelines. The school will indefinitely continue to allow mask wearing for any individuals who feel more comfortable wearing a mask. Handwashing and respiratory etiquette; Handwashing signage will remain posted in all restrooms, and handwashing reminders will play an increased role in student and staff orientation for 2021-22. As long as mask wearing is required for some or all individuals, up-to-date signage confirming expectations will remain posted at prominent locations throughout campus, and these expectations will be communicated to parents and included in staff and student orientation for the 2021-22 school year. Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including improving ventilation; NV Prep will operate from a new campus for the 2021-22 school year. Each classroom has an external door that can be opened to the outdoors to improve ventilation. Each classroom also has its own, independent A/C unit, which increases ventilation and reduced potential contamination across classrooms. Nightly cleaning and sanitation by a full-time custodian will continue to take place as long as it is recommended by health authorities. Regular sanitation of workspaces and computers will continue to take place during the school day, especially during transitions. Hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes will continue to be provided in all rooms. Contact tracing; & Diagnostic and screening testing; The school will conduct contact tracing in line with CDC guidelines and local requirements, as they change throughout the year. Weekly, school leadership will send an informational blast to staff and students to keep our community apprised of updates. Sources consulted will include the following: o https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/contact-tracing.html o https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/index.html Efforts to increase access and awareness to vaccinations; and Regular email and text blasts to families will continue to include information on vaccination events and resources in our community. Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to health and safety policies. The school has hired a new, experienced student success director. This leader has been charged to review all IEP and 504 documents and to communicate with all affected families prior to the start of school in August to ensure that all required accommodations are in place and to provide direct recommendations if any students have needs not addressed by whole-school, global health and safety protocols or existing ADA compliance measures on campus. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing How will the school meet students' social, emotional, mental and physical health needs and provide access to a safe and inclusive learning environment? Scholars will continue to have access to an experienced school counselor who is also a licensed youth and family therapist. Appropriate relationships with teachers are a tremendous source of strength for scholars. Scholars will continue to build these relationships during intentional lessons with an explicit focus on SEL. Consistent routines and structures including weekly community circles will allow for opportunities for human connection, even if these events need to occur in a virtual or hybrid format. Scholars will continue to have access to on campus nursing services, as needed. The school has transitioned to a new nursing services provider for the 2021-22 school year. All staff will again receive first aid training, including CPR, as part of summer professional development. During summer professional development, teachers will receive at least 2 hours of training on trauma-informed practices. Additional training will be scheduled based on individual staff needs. How will the school support educator and staff well-being? For the 2021-22 school year, the school has introduced a number of new, meaningful wellness benefits, including the following: o A generous Lifestyle Spending Account (LSA). This can be used for a variety of purposes including fitness memberships or equipment, or a broadly defined category of other wellness-promoting activities or products. o Maximum employer contributions and matching contributions to a Flex Spending Account (FSA) as allowed by federal law. These funds will reduce the stress of any anticipated medical, dental, and vision expenses. o Increased training on mental health benefits already offered through the school's insurance plans. o Addition of a new Employee Assistance Program (EAP) benefit, with extensive supplemental mental health supports. In addition, the school will continue to monitor employee absences and personal day use to encourage that all employees take the time off they need, and that employees who do not historically use their personal days without reminders feel empowered to use the time to promote mental health. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning How will the school address the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn, including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, effectively using data, and addressing resource inequities? Fortunately, the school's model was initially developed with the goal of devoting increased resources to students who have fallen behind academically in order to accelerate their learning. This commitment is evident in many ways including the current practice of providing in-home summer tutoring for our scholars most affected by COVID-19, in addition to face-to-face summer school offerings. During the full school year, our investment in interventions to address learning loss is most evident in the structure of our school day. For two hours each day, scholars who have not yet exceeded standards in math and/or ELA participate in a supplemental course called ELA power hour or Math power hour, depending on the scholar's needs. In these power hour classes, teachers rely on student achievement data to provide targeted interventions through intentional use of specific online learning activities and teacher-led small groups or 1:1 tutoring. Power hour classes usually have 2-4 adults in each classroom, based on the group's needs. The school intends to use a good share of upcoming ESSER funds, for example, to hire additional support teachers to further enhance the attention scholars can receive during power hour classes. The school will also continue to invest in Friday collaboration time for teachers to analyze student achievement data and optimize instruction for students with the greatest academic needs. To enhance this collaborative process, the school works with outside experts like Data Insight Partners who can provide one more perspective on relationships and trends between the following data points: interim assessment data, unit assessment data, lesson-level assessment data, attendance, student grades, etc. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in-person How will the school ensure that any student who falls into the one of the categories listed below is able to participate in distance education that meets the requirements established for a Path Forward Programs of Distance Education? o Students who have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person One of the few benefits of being forced to adapt to the COVID-19 Pandemic has been that the school has learned invaluable lessons about adaptability and virtual instruction. The school has the resources and capacity to deliver instruction to scholars anywhere with an internet connection. If students need to receive instruction from home, the school has ensured that each scholar will have a Chromebook and all learning materials needed to learn from home. The school also continues to support all families in securing high-speed internet access at home. Even when scholars are attending classes on campus, it is a matter of equity to ensure that they have access to the internet at home. If a scholar is unable to attend classes on campus, for a short or extended period, the school will take the following steps: 1. Ensure the scholar has a device and internet connection 2. Ensure the scholar has two-way communication into the classroom (e.g., through Zoom and Swivl) 3. Ensure that teachers focus explicitly on inclusion and classroom culture so that the scholar feels welcome and others in the class take steps to make the scholar feel welcome 4. Communicate at least weekly with the family about the scholar's progress 5. Send a staff member to the home for check-ins, as needed. The school is prepared to make individualized accommodations as needed, including in cases where the child's medical needs or treatment schedule make it unfeasible for the child to join live classes virtually. o Students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials As long as a child who is quarantined is physically well enough to join classes virtually, the same steps described above for students with documented medical needs will be taken. In cases where students are physical not well enough to join live classes virtually, teachers will meet with the child and the parents individually to develop a plan for acceleration to receive content missed during the period of quarantine where the child was unable to participate in classes. Distance Education: Emergency Closure How will the school ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event that school must be closed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another major emergency that necessitates the closure of school? Fortunately, the past 18 months have provided a blueprint for how the school can respond if another emergency closure is necessary. Families, scholars, and teachers are now proficient in joining virtual classes. To be clear, the school has no intention of ever returning to a fully virtual model, but if that becomes necessary, the school would return to established practices and routines and would develop an emergency action plan based on the prior transition to virtual learning in March 2020. In 2020, the school transitioned to a virtual model within 72 hours of receiving notice. Now that routines are established, and we maintain our focus on ensuring all families have high speed internet access at home, the school is prepared to transition to a full virtual instructional model immediately, if needed. Our scholar and family handbook has been revised to include a disclaimer about the return to virtual learning as well. Our employment agreements have also been revised to provide clarity around any potential return to virtual learning. As with the prior emergency closures, the school understands that no two families have identical needs, so the school will be ready to support individual families as needed with critical needs such as childcare. Distance Education: Supporting Students How will the school ensure continuity of services, including access to necessary technology and resources, special education and EL services, and nutrition services, for students participating in distance education? The school is committed to equity, so access to technology and resources is not dependent on COVID-19. All scholars receive all required learning materials. In 2021, we believe this includes providing each scholar with a Chromebook or similar device. As part of the student enrollment process, the school assists new families with securing high-speed internet access, usually through the Connect2Compete program. Special education and EL services will continue to be provided. This may mean home visits must be conducted or scholars with IEPs are invited to campus in a modified setting with increased social distancing and minimal direct contact. Some special education services can also be provided virtually, if this is required or preferred by the family. Nutrition services were uninterrupted during the prior transition to virtual learning. The school's transportation team delivered hundreds of breakfasts and lunches per week throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation evolves in 2021-22, the transportation team is committed to ensuring that scholars continue to have access to free, nutritious, compliant meals. REOPENING THE PATH TO COLLEGE 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Academic and Operational plans for a safe learning environment in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. Updated July 2021 2 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021- 2022 Overview and Purpose of this Document On April 19, 2021, Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 044 requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to update the requirements and provide written guidance to county school districts and State and district sponsored charter schools (\"districts and schools\") regarding reopening plans and plans for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education for the 2021- 22 school year Under Emergency Directive 0 44, Nevada Rise Academy is required to develop plans for the 2021- 22 school year that contemplate instruction offered through both in- person and distance education. In implementing Path Forward Programs of Distance Education, Nevada Rise must ensure students participating in distance education have access to the technology necessary to participate in distance education, such as access to a computer and internet connectivity, or plan to provide accommodations for students without access to such technology. The following takes into consideration guidance from the Center for Disease Control, the Southern Nevada Health District, and the Nevada Department of Education document \"Nevada's Path Forward: A Framework f or a Safe, Efficient, and Equitable Return to School Buildings.\" Additionally, guidelines and suggestions from the following resource: COVID -19 Handbook Volume 1: Strategies for Safely Reopening Elementary and Secondary Schools, COVID -19 Handbook, Volume 2: Roadmap to Reopening Safely and Meeting All Students' Needs, and Operational Strategy for K -12 Schools through Phased Prevention It is important to remember that this document is a set of guidelines and a plan that will most likely be revised on a conti nual basis. The circumstances surrounding COVID -19 are ever- changing, and we will make every effort to adapt and modify as necessary. CRISIS & EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANS Nevada Rise Academy has developed an Emergency Operations Plan, updated with procedures for protocols for pandemic and infectious disease. These plans meet the Nevada Requirements for Crisis and Emergency Response for Schools in Nevada public, private and charter schools and the federal definition of a high- quality school EOP; in addition to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) requirements (NRS 388.229 - .261 Public Schools) and were submitted in July 2021. 3 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021-2022 NEVADA RISE ACADEMY: 2021- 2022 School Year P lan RE-OPENING APPROACH The approach described b elow is guided by the following principles: 1. Working within recommendations from Southern Nevada Health District/ Center for Disease Control while following the guidance from the State Public Charter School Authority, and the requirements from the Nevada Department of Education. 2. Maximizing in -person, consistent learning in mind 3. Incorporating Parent/Family input in options 4. Equality in the choice- all students receive the same education. IN-PERSON LEARNING : HEALTH AND SAFETY Safety of educators and students will remain our priority. We will maintain efforts from our initial re -opening plans from the spring of 2021, while utilizing increased resources and updated guidelines. USE OF FACE COVERINGS & SOCIAL DISTANCING All staff and students will be encouraged to wear well-fitting face coverings with proper filtration throughout the school day. Exceptions will be made for outside activities, eating and drinking, and any documented medical reasons. Nevada Rise will keep a supply of face coverings (both masks and shields) for all school community members (staff, student, parent, partner, volunteer ). We also sell Nevada Rise- branded face coverings. The following considerations are in place: STAFF: All staff who report as not having been vaccinated will be required to wear face coverings when interacting with any school community members. All vaccinated staff are recommended to wear face coverings when interacting with any school community members. STUDENTS: Students in kindergarten through 3 rd grade are encouraged to wear face coverings during school hours and any time while in the building, including during before and after school activities. Students in 4 th grade are required to ear a mask at all times, with the exception of meal service and outdoor activities. To the extent possible, students will s ocially distance. Space limitations within our facility restrict the amount of space between students at all times, but through the use of physical barriers, every effort will be made to mitigate transmission. PHYSICAL HEALTH SCREENIN G Any person (student, staff, parent, volunteer, etc.) who has a fever of 100.4F or above or demonstrates other signs of illness will not be admitted on campus. Nevada Rise will encourage parents to be on the alert for signs of illness in their children and to keep the m home when they are sick. Nevada Rise Academy will implement all CDC examples of screening methods to assist in a screening plan. 1. Daily Screening: Nevada rise will screen all students daily during arrival with a thermometer reading. Ask parents/guardians to take their child's temperature either before coming to the facility or upon arrival at the facility. Upon their arrival, stand at least 3 feet away from the parent/guardian and child. 4 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021- 2022 Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness. All staff record temperatures on our log sheet located in front office. Operations team will ensure 1 00% of staff and contracted partners are screened. 2. Reliance on Barrier/Partition Controls, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Where/When Possible & Practical Stand behind a physical barrier or use PPE that can serve to protect the staff member's face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the child being screened sneezes, coughs, or talks. Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness Conduct temperature screening, perform hand hygiene, wash ha nds with soap and water for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Use non- contact thermometers only. Screenings will be conducted safely and respectfully, and with measures in place to ensure confidentiality. If a case is confirmed on campus, we will follow the CDC protocol below: Nevada Rise, in a ccordance with CDC guidelines, will recommend that all individuals with flu -like symptoms stay home for 72 hours after symptoms resolve, as COVID -19 symptoms can be similar to flu -like symptoms. Recovered COVID -19 patients can return 10 days after recovery or 72 hours after symptoms resolve - whichever is longer. If Nevada Rise suspects a case(s) of COVID -19: 1. Place a face mask on the person immediately , ensuring mask is being properly worn across the bridge of their nose and down to chin 2. Isolate the case in a separate room. 3. Contact local/state health department as soon as possible. 4. Create a list of all (students and staff) who could have been exposed (contacts). 5. Consider hospitalization for those with severe symptoms. 5 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021- 2022 Nevada Rise will f ollow the advice of the local/state health department regarding reporting, isolation of cases/quarantining contacts, environmental disinfection, individual hygiene, and the probability of school closure. Finally, Nevada Rise will communicate to staff, parents or guardians, and students that it is critical to be current on all required immunizations. PHYSICAL HYGI ENE How will you address and reinforce hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette? How will face coverings be used? Please refer to Emergency Directive 024 and the associated guidance which outline the requirements for face coverings. In 2020, Nevada Rise changed janitorial/sanitation supply vendors to ensure more adequate hygiene protocols and constant supplies for soap and hand sanitizer. Through weekly services and inventory controls , all supplies are stocked. Hand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette : According to the CDC, handwashing is especially important and is one of the best ways to protect and prevent staff and students from getting sick as well as spreading germs. To help mitigate spread of any illness and/or virus, we will take the following measures: Nevada Rise will t each and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students, teachers, and staff. If handwashing is not possible, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol should be used. Hand sanitizer dispensers have been installed for each classroom, in common areas, and outside restrooms. Nevada Rise will dedicate the majority of the first days to routines, including those that establish healthy hand- washing routines and habits. We will review each time students take bathroom breaks, create songs to remind them, and post student -friendly signs and posters t o reinforce these habits. We will share these practices with families and assign these same routines as \"homework\" to practice at home as well. We will teach and encourage students and staff to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue when not wearing a mas k and immediately wash their hands after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing. Operations will ensure tissues are in each room through weekly walkthroughs. Water fountains have been replaced with touchless water bottle filling stations and each class room has individual water dispensing machines to ensure accountability. Water bottles are also on site in case students forget their own. Increased signage for all grade levels is present in all restrooms and outside classrooms to help remind all stakeholders to wash and sanitize hands . FACILITIES MANAGEMENT : CLEANING & MAINTAINING A HEALTHY SCHOOL It is our goal at Nevada Rise to provide a learning environment that is productive and safe. Facilities are all - inclusive of any structures on campus. Therefore, addressing safety and security is essential, which includes the cleaning and disinfecting as well as monitoring of access to any room or space within a facility. As Nevada Rise is in a shared space, we will coordinate with Paradise Church to ensure consistency in standards across all parties. Facility Adjustments: 6 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021- 2022 Water fountains have been upgraded to include a touchless water bottle filling station and a dispensing machine in each classroom to limit hallway traffic. Hand s anitizer dispensers have been installed throughout the building, including outside each classroom. Janitorial supply company changed to ensure adequate supply of appropriate cleaning materials Posters and signs are place d strategically through the building to remind all stakeholders of hygiene and safety practices. Relocated our front office location and installed barriers for social -distancing, safety, and control. Students, as much as possible , except for restrooms and outside, will remain in the same classroom for all subjects and activities. Enrichment teachers, associate teachers, administration, and specialists will transition from class to class. All student supplies will be individualized. Each student will have a s upply box with necessary materials as well as individual technology devices . Ventilation: Outdoor Air: Each classroom at Nevada Rise includes either a door or window that allows outdoor air to circulate through the classrooms , the kitchen, and throughout the building. HVAC Units: HVAC units are dedicated to a maximum of two classrooms, with the majority of rooms having one dedicated unit. This limits the amount of shared air circulated through the building. Filters are replaced twice monthly, well before the recommended replacement cycle. Each classroom now has a n air purifier capable of cleaning a room of up to 1000 square feet. Exhaust fans are installed in each restroom. Cleaning/Sanitizing Space : In coordination with our contracted janitorial service, we have doubled the time spent on campus to ensure a daily cleaning and sanitation of the facility and classrooms. The following are required daily of the cleaning staff: We will have a dedicated staff member to clean bathrooms multiple times daily, as well as assisting with meal service and charged with frequent cleaning and disinfecting of door handles, faucets, keyboards, tables, desks, shared objects, etc. Operations associate will be staffed to assist with cleaning duties and meal service. We have increased our deep cleaning of classrooms to nightly service, with additional deep cleaning on Fridays. CONTACT TRACING Nevada Rise will collaborate with the health department, to the extent allowable by privacy laws and other applicable laws, to confidentially provide information about people diagnosed with or exposed to COVID -19. Students, teachers, and staff wit h positive test results will isolate , and any close contacts will isolate and quarantine in consultation with the Southern Nevada Health District. Nevada Rise will report positive cases to the SNHD as soon as they are informed. School officials should notify families of close contacts as soon as possible after they are notified that someone in the school has tested positive (within the same school day). We will also encourage our families to be comm unicative of all COVID -19 cases in their individual households and communities. As addressed above, every person who enters the building will be screened. We are working with our families to ensure they understand that students need to stay home if sympt oms of COVID -19 are present. We also 7 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021- 2022 message that to teachers and staff. We have staffed our team with the necessary personnel for adequate coverage in the event of an absence. In the event that a community member begins to exhibit symptoms during the school day, those individuals will be isolated while arrangements are made for them to return home. As mentioned above, Nevada Rise will work with SNHD and, if needed, the SPCSA to facilitate isolation and case investigation. We will fully cooperate with the agencies by providing information and records to aid in the identification and contact of those potentially exposed. Seating charts will be maintained and student seating will remain, to the extent possible, similar in all areas of the school (cafeteria, enrichment classes). If it has been determined any individuals have been exposed, we will follow the guidelines and directives from the SNHD. Unless vaccinated or tested positive in the last three months, and do not have any symtpoms , those ide ntified will stay home and follow the direction of the local public health department about when it is safe for them to be around others. If a child with a disability is required to quarantine, Nevada Rise will provide services consistent with federal disability laws. The special education team will ensure all materials and instruction is delivered. In an effort to r aise awareness, Nevada Rise will include vaccination information and availability in our weekly newsletter. Any nearby or known community partner offering vaccines will be highlighted and encouraged. IN-PERSON LEARNING: STUDENT & STAFF WELL BEING STUDE NT WELL -BEING Nevada Rise recognizes the need for social -emotional learning (SEL) in response to both the COVID -19 pandemic ad well as the social movements of recent months. We agree with the Nevada Department of Education that \"...it is crucial for students and staff to feel connected and schools are in the unique position to be able to bring together educator s, staff, students, families, and community partners to cocreate safe, supportive learning environments and an intervention framework where all students and adults can work through the process of coping and healing.\" Curriculum : The core curriculum for English Language Arts (EL Education) incorporates SEL components into weekly lessons. Additionally, we are adopting their framework for inclusive school culture, \"We Are Crew.\" This incorporate elements of restorative circles, collaboration, and character development. To address this topic more directly, we have purchased a quality curriculum to guide SEL to ensure multiple resources are available for students and staff. Our curriculum is aligned to the Collaboration for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) which defines SEL as how children and adults learn to understand and manage emotions, set goals, show empathy for others, establish positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. At least one formal, dedicated, sequenti al SEL lesson will be delivered weekly. A second SEL curriculum was purchased to supplement as needed. Partnerships/Resources: 8 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021- 2022 Nevada Rise is proud to partner with Project AWARE via the SPCSA to incorporate a multi -tiered system of supports (MTSS) for al l learners. In school year 2020- 2021, we partnered with Code Switch to provide our staff training on Restorative Justice and circles to foster a more inclusive learning environment. We are also excited to begin a partnership with the Eighth Judicial District Court's Truancy Diversion Program (TDP) to support students and their families to address students' school attendance, behavior, and grades. The court staff helps students to focus on the importance of school attendance and grades, including homework completion and appropriate classroom/school behavior, while providing a positive supportive environment. A part -time social worker is available to provide resources and support for students and families. Additionally, morning announcements will address SEL topics. Our RISE values have been redefined to incorporate more student empowerment and SEL components. Finally, we will communicate these shifts by incorporating them into our established communication systems, highlighting SEL themes in our newsletters, and streamed morning announcements. Our Families for Achievement Council is working to make sure parents have a full understanding of the approach to SEL, behavior management, and DEI . STAFF WELL -BEING Nevada Rise has established a Diversity, Equity, and In clusion (DEI) committee to guide our staff's work in SEL as well as our approach to behavior management. Our school environment and culture ensures high expectations and predictable routines, but our behavior management systems have been overhauled to ensure a Multi- Tiered System of Supports (MTSS), and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS). We are working to incorporate dedicated sections of SEL and DEI into weekly lesson planning to frame the work for our educators. The DEI committee is al so working to identify appropriate professional development for staff. Elements found in both Project Aware (MTSS) and We Are Crew will be applied to staff. We have also transitioned to a 4- day per week instructional calendar, affording staff a full day of planning, collaboration, and providing more work -life balance opportunities. IN-PERSON LEARNING: ACCELERATING STUDENT LEARNING Accelerating student learning is among our top priorities coming into the 2021 -2022 school year. There are a variety of shifts we are making to address this issue. Professional Development: Given that these are unprecedented times, we are leveraging the strength of professional and academic organizations to help us in the professional development (P D) of accelerating student learning. During our two week summer PD, we are partnering with the Relay Graduate School of Education to engage in the following sessions: o Building and Affirming Learning Partnerships o Accelerating Learning Through Student Work o Planning to Address Gaps While Maintaining the Bar o Supporting Students Who Are Multilingual in General Education Nevada Rise has recently partnered with Bellwether Education to create a three- year strategic plan , including the following compon ents: 9 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021- 2022 o Data Driven Instruction utilizing daily strategies, weekly analysis, benchmark planning, and incorporating more data in the Response to Instruction (RtI) process. o Educator development through targeted observation, feedback, and the coaching process. Two of our current partners, Project Aware and Data Insight Partners, will continue to provide PD to staff on utilizing data to drive instructional decisions and increase student achievement, in both academic and cultural components. Finally, the full PD days on Fridays will include weekly meetings with an e mbedded component of data analysi s. Staffing: To assist with learning acceleration, we have created a Intervention Coordinator, charged with ensuring daily small groups and intervention groups are using data to inform instructional activities, tracking progress through consistent progress monitoring systems, and facilitating conversations among and between stakeholders (teachers, associate teachers, parents, special education, and administration). Th e number of associate teachers per grade level who will work with lead classroom teachers has increased to create more small group learning opportunities to all ow for targeted instruction. ESSER funds have contributed a great deal to ensure we eliminate resource inequity on campus. Student learning materials are provided by Nevada Rise Academy. DISTANCE EDUCATION: SUPPORTING STUDENTS UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN-PERSON Nevada Rise will ensure a distance education option is always available . This option will be reserved for: Students who have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in- person or Students who are quarantined on the advice of the Southern Nevada Health District or Students who have documentation outlining extenuating circumstances that do not allow the student to attend school in- person, a nd will be decided on a case -by-case basis. Having provided distance education through a hybrid model during the 2020- 2021 school year, each classroom on campus is equipped with the technology to allow any student learning through distance education to join classes virtually. Distance learners are expected to attend the full instructional school day, with breaks for meal service. Students who are in short -term distance education ( in quarantine, for example), will remain with their class. Given the demands of the hybrid model, one classroom per grade level in kindergarten through 2 nd grade will serve as the hybrid classroom as to adequately staff the classroom for both in- person and distance learners. This will apply to those students who are in long- term distance education. All students are provided a Chromebook, and, if needed, a hotspot for internet access. If a student has an IEP or a 504 Plan, all accommodations, modifications, and other requirements outlined in those documents will be followed. Our support services are adequately staffed to ensure all students receive required accommodations. If needed (for long -term distance education), we will work with families to modify the IEP to make it conducive to distance education. During the initial school closure and distance education experience , Nevada Rise adapted support services, and we will continue to enhance these. The special education staff members will maintain: Dedicated online classroom (Goo gle Classroom) specifically for students with IEPs. 10 Nevada Rise Academy : The Path to Forward, School Year 2021- 2022 Work with our contracted support service te am to continue small group and individual therapy, as well as teletherapy, when possible. Administration will check lesson plans and observe delivery in all models (distance education and on campus) to ensure goals for individual students are met and lessons aligned with those goals. We have established an English Learner support team, with two members ensuring adaptations and accommodations are provided for English Learners Students with special needs will have priority in attending in- person or in scheduling video lessons. Students learning through distance education will have daily direct contact through our classroom communication platform or phone call. In that communication, full nutrition services will be offered. Families will have the option to receive daily meals, or they can receive a full week's worth of meal s at one time. Utilizing MyEducationData, parents can track progress of all students . DISTANCE EDUCATION: EMERGENCY CLOSURE Nevada Rise understands that, despite our best efforts to mitigate transmission, there are many factors outside our control. There is also an understanding that there are situations that may occur that lead to temporarily closing schools or parts of a school. These decisions will be guided by the SNHD and based on careful consideration of a variety of factors, prioritizing health and safety of our school and larger community, and secondarily, the academic impact . As an elemen tary school, all classes stay in cohorts throughout the day, minimizing contact with students from other classes. In grades 3 and 4, teachers rotate to classrooms to limit traffic in hallways and contact with other classes. In the event of a closure, Nevada Rise will transition to a synchronous distance learning platform enabling students to continue to learn from home. The infrastructure for such a transition was established and developed during the 2020- 2021 school. The s ynchronous distance learning model incorporates live instruction, through student devices, in both whole group and differentiated, targeted instruction in small groups. Enrichment classes will continue to be offered, as well as nutrition services (as allow ed by health officials). Each grade level also maintains a website with recorded lessons for those who miss instruction, and there are a variety of other self -paced learning platforms for students. Teachers and staff will contact each individual family weekly during any closure. Teachers will have a daily designated time in which they will reach out to families. All teachers will make the attempt and log the outcome on an internal spreadsheet to orga nize easily. Teachers will be accessible to students during the school's regular instructional hours using Class Dojo as a primary point of contact and text message as a secondary. Associate teachers, operations staff, and student support services will ass ist in communication. These records will ultimately be maintained in Infinite Campus. Overview and Purpose of this Document Background Under Emergency Directive 022, all charter schools must develop re -opening plans for the 2020 -21 school year that contemplate instruction offered through: 1. In-person instruction following social distancing protocols; 2. Distance education under an approved Path Forward Program of Distance Education; or 3. A combination of distance education and in -person instruction. Re-opening plans must be based on Nevada's Path Forward: A Framework for a Safe, Effici ent, and Equitable Return to School Buildings and include a Path Forward Program of Distance Education1 in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth by the Nevada Department of Education (NDE). With an understanding that developing a re-opening plan is complex and time intensive , the State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) has developed an optional re-opening plan template which covers the topics outlined in NDE's minimum requirements and the Path Forward Framework . This document should be seen as a resource for schools and not a mandate. Whether schools decide to use this template or develop their own, the topics and guiding questions can serve as a tool for ensur ing a comprehensive plan.

NEVADA 89121 1 NVVA- 21/22 SY Reopening /Path Forward Plan As of July 2020, Nevada Virtual Academy's Charter Contract increased the maximum total enrollment at the Charter School. Enrollment shall not exceed 2,100 students (the \"Maximum Enrollment Number\"), and shall not increase or decrease by 10%. For the 21/22 school year starting August 9th, 2021, Nevada Virtual Academy will fully open the school to staff, students and public. Pandemic safety protocols will continue to be in place until otherw ise directed by the Governor, NDE, SPCSA and Nevada Health District. The following plan outlines these procedures. NVVA is currently in the process of securing a new building as the current building is not large enough to effectively contain a growing popu lation of students and staff. NVVA expects to have the facility secured by late winter of 2021. The increased square footage will allow room for additional students to receive instructions on blended days and house additional staff along with the ability t o provide a safe environment . Please see Addendum A for details. Overview COVID 19 The virus tends to be a respiratory disease but can also display other symptoms. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person Close contact (less than 6 fe et) Through respiratory drops in the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes It is possible to become infected after touching an object or surface that has the virus on it and then touching your own mo uth, nose or eyes. Exposure Risk As the Sandhill Office is the location of all in office staff, blended classrooms for students , and is open to the public , there is a risk of exposure to staff and students. NVVA has set forth guidance to minimize the exposure risk. These are in no way a regulati on and create no legal obligations. At this time C OVID -19 information is continuing to evolve and this plan will be updated as new information and guidance is released. NVVA would most likely be a medium to high risk area.

SANDHILL RD. NEVADA 89121 11 SY Reopening /Path Forward Plan ADDENDUM A Addendum A - Securing a New NVVA Location School year 2021/22 NVVA is currently in the process of securing a new location for the school and office. Our current lease ends on 7/31/21 and our continued growth necessitates a bigger campus. The current location is not able to effectively house students and staff, comfortably and safely. NVVA has been working with a local realtor to finalize a contract for the Board to vote on and will work with the school to obtain necessary permits for the use of the building as a school, planning improvements necessary to the building and securing a contractor. The following items were taken into consideration during the planning to secure a new facility. Size of the building Classrooms - Blended Program - At this time, we are limited to the number of students that can attend the blended, face to face instruction, to ensure academic success. By adding additional classrooms, we will have the ability to expand the blended learning opportunity. Classroom Space - Orientation - NVVA has developed a comprehensive orientation process that has over time, shown to increase success for our students. Additional space would allow the school to effectively schedule the sessions. Classroom Space - State Mandated Testing - NVVA utilizes the Blended learning campus as a test site during state mandated testing such as Access Screener, WIDA, MAP, Science and Smarter Assessments. Additional space would allow the school to effectively assess a larger population of our student body. Staff - Office space is limited, and additional areas need to be included to house support staff positions . Environment Control and Safety Protocols The new building will need to be retrofitted for the items listed below . The additions will include but are not limited to: Air filtration - Keep proper circulation of air to allow limited amount of Covid or other respiratory illness droplets in the air. Allow for consistent and constant exchange of fresh air. PA system - Timely and safe manner to alert students and s taff to any emergencies , drills or events. Security System - Buzzer and lock system to allow for increased security of classrooms and building. This will aid in tightening our E mergency Operating procedures. Enable monitoring of staff and public entering school building. Oasis Academy Plan for the Safe Return to In Person Instruction & Continuity of Services. Fall 2021-2022 Oasis Academy Bighorns 2021-2022, Approve June 30, 2021 ; Amended Aug. 25, 2021 1Plan for the Safe Return to In-Person Instruction Oasis Academy is required to have a reopening plan pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 . Oasis Academy's plan is in alignment with the SPCSA Plan for the Safe Return to In-Person Learning , the key topics addressed in the Nevada Department of Education's Framework for a Safe, Efficient, and Equitable Return to School Buildings as well as the U.S. Department of Education's ED COVID-19 Handbook, Volume 1: Strategies for Safely Reopening Elementary and Secondary Schools and ED COVID-19 Handbook, Volume 2: Roadmap to Reopening Safely and Meeting All Students' Needs . Additionally, Oasis Academy will follow the CDC Operational Strategy for K-12 Schools . OA will continue to modify practices based on the most recent CDC guidance. CDC guidance as it relates to schools in the fall should be out shortly and we will follow that guidance. Oasis Academy will stay in compliance with all state emergency directives, including those of the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, and make changes accordingly. ESTABLISHING A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT There are significant educational and financial costs associated with COVID-19 for OA. When students are symptomatic and have to learn on-line there are significant educational costs. When unvaccinated employees are symptomatic and have to stay-home there is a financial cost associated with these absences. As such it is important that we continue to do all that we can to maintain a safe learning environment. Face Coverings In regards to face coverings OA will follow Emergency Directive 045 and recent guidance from the CDC. The CDC recommends unvaccinated people wear face coverings in schools. All children and staff using school transportation (extra curricular activities may ride buses) with more than one occupant are required to wear face coverings while using that transportation. All children and adults are welcome to wear face coverings at any time. On Aug. 4, 2021 Emergency Directive 048 was released. In conjunction the K-12 School Summary Guidance and the Department of Health and Human Services 21-22 Covid-19 Guidelines for Prevention and Outbreak Control in School Settings . Those guidelines made masks mandatory for all adults on school campuses indoors and at school events indoors. They highly recommend that CDC guidance is followed and that all students wear masks. Social Distancing and COVID-19 Mitigation Measures OA will follow CDC guidance with regard to COVID-19 health and safety mitigation measures including physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory etiquette, and cleaning. As that guidance changes OA will modify practices to match. Unvaccinated students and staff who are symptomatic will be isolated at home for 10 days, or until they receive a negative COVID test and are symptom free. OA will continue to provide COVID testing on site with parent permission. OA will no longer conduct daily health screenings in the manner they did in 20-21, rather classroom teachers will send symptomatic students to the office. Individuals who have had COVID-19 within Oasis Academy Bighorns 2021-2022, Approve June 30, 2021 ; Amended Aug. 25, 2021 2the last 90 days, and can provide a copy of their positive test results will not have to be isolated. OA will continue to maintain a log of excluded staff and students. OA will continue to work with local authorities and the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services to conduct contract tracing as necessary. Cleaning and Ventilation OA will continue to sanitize the school and maintain ventilation levels in accordance with the Oasis Academy Plan for a Safe, Efficient, and Equitable Return to School 20-2 1. Volunteers The school would like to return to using some volunteers in the lunchroom for supervision and Pizza Thursday. Additionally, some teachers have expressed interest in having volunteers in their classrooms. It is essential that all volunteers be vaccinated to mitigate contract tracing requirements of school employees. For example, if a volunteer was helping in the lunchroom, and they tested positive for COVID the contract tracing would likely lead to a shut down of the school for 10 days; similarly if unvaccinated volunteer are in the building and a student tested positive we now have to determine if any volunteers were around that child and complete all the contract tracing (which includes calling each person individually, as well as reporting in writing all of that information to the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services). Our priority is to keep the school open and out of \"school wide outbreak\" status so the fewer people in the building who we have to worry about the better we are able to do this. School wide outbreak status leads to mandatory masks for students and often to partial or whole school closure for 10-14 days. MEETING THE SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS & STAFF Oasis Academy provides a multi tiered system of support to all students. In the 21-22 school year OA will utilize a K-12 Social, Emotional, & Ethical Learning curriculum developed by Emory University in guidance. Guidance will happen throughout the year in each classroom. SEE Learning incorporates the latest developments in trauma research and trauma-informed care to provide a way for educators and students to explore emotions, self-regulation, and reflective practices. It does so through a strengths-based resiliency lens, meaning that it is appropriate for all students, including both those who have suffered from trauma and those who have not. OA will continue to utilize the quarterly SAEBRS screener (Social, Academic, and Emotional Behavior Risk Screener) assessment to monitor emotional well being and behavior. Counselors will work with both small groups and individuals whose assessments or teacher referrals indicate are in need of additional support. OA has been a TRIBES school since it opened and will continue to use those practices and philosophies on a day to day basis. OA has also been utilizing mindfulness daily with students for the last 4 years and will continue with that practice. The OA comprehensive school counseling program will continue to follow the ASCA national model and keep our direct and indirect student services at eighty percent. Oasis Academy Bighorns 2021-2022, Approve June 30, 2021 ; Amended Aug. 25, 2021 3ACCELERATING LEARNING Accelerated learning provides opportunities for students to learn at grade level rather than through tracking or remediation, which can narrow educational opportunities for students and might lead them to become disengaged. Acceleration builds on what students already know as a way to access new learning. Studies have shown that when students tie background knowledge to new information, they are better at making inferences and retaining the new information more effectively. Oasis Academy will use three approaches to accelerate learning: In-school acceleration, tutoring, and summer learning and enrichment. School will resume on our normal schedule. Kindergarten and first grade will attend school 8-2, all other grades will attend 8-4. In School Acceleration All students will have access to rigorous grade level curriculum with needed support provided within the context of grade level work. OA will teach social studies and science through project based learning consistent with pre-pandemic practices. OA will utilize diagnostic (MAPS) and formative assessments that provide timely information to help educators know where to focus for particular students. OA will continue to utilize extended learning time. Our students receive additional minutes beyond state requirements. Grade Level Required Minutes OA Minutes Quality Tutoring OA will, whenever feasible, will provide high quality tutoring according to the high dosage principles research shows are the most impactful- tutoring that is provided consistently by licensed educators or paraprofessionals at least three days per week for at least 30 minutes at a time in groups of five or fewer students. OA will focus on language arts and has hired a reading specialist for the 21-22 school year. Students in grades k-1 will receive tutoring after school from 2:00-3:15 from their classroom teacher. Students in grades 2-6 will receive tutoring from the reading specialist during the school day. Students in grades 7-12 will receive additional support from their classroom teacher throughout the school day. Summer Learning and Enrichment Oasis Academy will develop a summer learning and enrichment program for summer 2022. The goal is to have this plan in place by March of 2022. Oasis Academy Bighorns 2021-2022, Approve June 30, 2021 ; Amended Aug. 25, 2021 4EXTRA -CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES Oasis will follow these guidelines for all K-12 extra-curricular activities, including sports and clubs. As always, these are subject to change as determined by the school, County, State, Department of Education, SPCSA and NIAA. ALL students wishing to participate in co-curricular activities at Oasis Academy must abide by these regulations in order to participate. 1. COVID Testing: Fully vaccinated team/club members are EXEMPT from all testing at this time. Team/club members include: players, coaches, advisors, managers and volunteers. School can administer tests and/or require team members to obtain a test at their own expense. Oasis is planning on providing rapid tests free of charge while our supplies last, which come from the Nevada Department of Education. Weekly testing is mandatory for close contact sports, which include football, basketball and wrestling while in-season. The school will provide a schedule of testing prior to each team/club's season. Testing is required for teams/clubs traveling OUT OF COUNTY for contests for ALL co-curricular activities. 2. Face Coverings: Guidance applies to IN-DOORS ONLY. Outdoor activities do NOT require masks. For in-door activities, ALL persons, regardless of vaccination status, MUST be masked at all times EXCEPT students who are in uniform and on the active roster for that contest/practice/meeting . Students always have the choice to mask up if they desire. Active participants do NOT have to mask at any time while at the contest/practice. 3. Vaccinations: Team members must be fully vaccinated as defined by the CDC, and MUST provide proof of vaccination to be exempt from testing. Proof is limited to an official COVID vaccination card, OR an immunization record listing the COVID vaccine, and must be uploaded to Register My Athlete (RMA) or brought to the school nurse prior to the student being allowed to participate in contests. 4. Screenings - Depending upon the circumstances, including case counts at the school or in our community, coaches/advisors may conduct COVID screening prior to team events (practices, contests, meetings, etc.). However, at this time, only verbal screening will be conducted. 5. Positive COVID case protocol will follow the most recently approved Outbreak Response Plan at the school. 6. Students who have tested positive for COVID within the past 90 days will, with a doctor's note indicating the date and results of the test, will be treated as vaccinated for 90 days from the test date. WNC Students On Friday August 20, 2021 the State Board of Health voted to require all students who attend NSHE institutions, which includes WNC to be vaccinated. Oasis Academy 11th and 12th grade students are dually enrolled at WNC and therefore will have to be vaccinated by the Nov. 1. 2021 deadline. Oasis Academy will follow the guidelines and procedures that will be forthcoming from WNC surrounding this mandate. Oasis Academy Bighorns 2021-2022, Approve June 30, 2021 ; Amended Aug. 25, 2021 5Path Forward Program Distance Education Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and Guidance Memorandum 21-02 , charter schools must provide distance education options to students who a) have a documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person, or b) are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. FULL TIME VIRTUAL STUDENTS Parents must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person. Each case will require approval from the CEO. Oasis Academy will hire either a licensed teacher or licensed substitute to serve as the \"Virtual Education Coordinator.\" The virtual education coordinator will: Provide links to pre-recorded lessons to full time virtual students. Virtual students will be 1 day behind classroom peers. Coordinate with teachers and put together packets, supplies, and other materials on a regularly scheduled basis for full time virtual students. Provide a daily \"Google Meet\" time for full time virtual students, during normal school hours, to check in. Students who do not log in to the scheduled time will be marked absent for the day. Students IEP's, 504, and ELL accommodations will be made and provided for by members of the student services team. EXCLUDED STUDENTS (Symptomatic Unvaccinated Students) Oasis Academy will hire either a licensed teacher or licensed substitute to serve as the \"Virtual Education Coordinator.\" The virtual education coordinator will: Provide links to pre-recorded lessons to excluded virtual students.

Provide a daily \"Google Meet\" time for excluded virtual students to check in, during normal school hours. Students who do not log in to the scheduled time will be marked absent for the day. Students IEP's, 504, and ELL accommodations will be made and provided for by members of the Student Services Department. DISTANCE EDUCATION, EMERGENCY CLOSURE In the event that Oasis Academy has to fully close under emergency circumstances we will ensure that all students are able to continue to learn via distance learning. Oasis Academy has 1:1 chromebooks for each student those would be available to anyone who needed one. Oasis Academy has hotspot devices for Oasis Academy Bighorns 2021-2022, Approve June 30, 2021 ; Amended Aug. 25, 2021 6students who do not have access to the internet (historically that number has been very low at 1-2 students). Students would attend scheduled classes live with their assigned classroom teacher using the Google Meets and the Google classroom platforms. During the 20-21 school year Oasis Academy established a functioning materials drop off and pick up system at the school and that system would be utilized again. This was primarily important for the younger students whose work could not solely be completed online.

In the program, schools have to provide details on their distance learning plan for full -time distance learning students for the 2021 -2022 school year. There has to be key informat ion included, such as how students were approved for distance learning, what the learning model will look like, and how attendance will be taken. The State Public Charter School Authority requested more information from schools, such as what schools are d oing to ensure health and safety for all, what a school's in- person learning will look like, and what steps schools are taking to support students and staff with their social and emotional wellbeing. The 2021 Legislative Session produced Senate Bill 215. Schools are required to develop a distance education plan in the event of an emergency that may cause a school closure of at least 10 days. This way schools are more prepared to tackle any sudden closures, similar to what was experienced in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. In an effort to streamline all of the requested information, the State Public Charter School Authority has requested that schools submit a 2021 -2022 reopening plan. In it, there are three key requirements: Requirement A: Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID -19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID -19 on students' opportunity to learn. Requirement B: Pursuant to Emergency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Distance Education Plans for the 2021 -22 school year. This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Requirement C: Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emergency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan must be submitted to the charter school sponsor and provided to the school community, parents and school employees. This plan 1 Section 8 of Emergency Directive 044 2 establishes an emergency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emergency. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 5 Safe Reopening for In-Person Learning Pinecrest Academy of Nevada recognizes that the health and safety of students and staff is of the utmost importance. Pinecrest Academy will seek data, guidance, recommendations, and/or approval from the Southern Nevada Heal th District, the Center for Disease Control, the Nevada Department of Education, and the Nevada Governor's Office. Pinecrest Academy will continually work with its families, staff, leadership and Board to implement Covid -19 mitigation protocols that are th e safest for its in -person students and staff at any point in time. Ultimately, Pinecrest Academy will use all available scientific information to help make a determination on these matters. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette Pinecrest Academy will continue to promote proper personal hygiene: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Avoid contact with others if within 6 feet Wear a cloth face mask covering in public Avoid traveling if you are sick Stay home if you are feeling ill Get medical care as needed Each campus will have an abundance of signage promoting positive physical hygiene. For example, each restroom mirror will have a sticker re minding students to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds. These visual cues will be incredibly helpful, especially for visual learners. In the event that a student may not be implementing safe and healthy hygiene practices, staff will re-educate the student and inform the student's parents. Diagnostic and Screening Testing Staff and students will self -screen their physical health. If any staff member or student is not feeling well and having any symptoms, that person will need to stay at home. They should only return to school when there are no remaining symptoms. If a student or staff member chooses to go to school while ill (no matter the illness), they will not be allowed in the classroom. For students, the parent will be contacted to take the student home and will not be allowed to return until they are symptom -free. For staff, they cannot return until they are symptom -free. In the event that a student or a staff member feels ill during the school day, they will be remove d from the classroom. They will be asked relevant questions pertaining to their health and Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 6 assessed by a staff member with a touchless thermometer. If it is determined that the student needs to be sent home, a parent will be contacted and their belongings will be gathered from the classroom for them. If it is determined that the staff member needs to be sent home, another staff member will cover their classroom/classes for the remainder of the day. They cannot return until they are symptom -free. A list of symptoms will be gathered from public health organizations. Each campus will have touchless thermometers and will be used at the discretion of school staff. Spaces will be created in our campuses for temporary isolation. If a student or staff member is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease, the person will be required to self-quarantine, and the Southern Nevada Health District will be contacted. Pinecrest Academy will work in consultation with medical and public health experts, the State Public Charter School Authority, and the Nevada Department of Education to determine the extent of testing in the school and if a closure is necessary. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities Pinecrest Academy will mak e multiple adjustments to each campus' facilities to minimize the risk of COVID -19. Hand sanitizer pumps will be placed on walls in various locations throughout the campus. There is an increase in signage enforcing social distancing and healthy personal hygiene in hallways and classrooms. There are visual cues on the floor showing where to stand, wait, and move. There are decals in restrooms reminding individuals to wash their hands. Furniture that is difficult to clean will not be utilized or replaced. All air filters will be monitored and replaced as needed. All shared items, such as athletic balls, will be cleaned accordingly There will be limited use of the water fountain. Students and staff will be encouraged to bring their own water bottles Technology will be assigned to students as needed/requested All emergency plans will be adjusted to accommodate up-to-date guidelines while maintaining the necessary safety, urgency and precaution At each campus, staff will check the cleanliness of the campus to ensure a safe and health environment. All restrooms will be monitored regularly throughout the day to ensure cleanliness. High touch points, such as water fountains, sink heads, door knobs, and student desks, will be cleaned regularly by Pinecrest Academy staff. Shared materials will be limited as much as possible, and they will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 7 Each night, there will be daily detailed cleaning of facilities from a contracted cleaning service . Our vendors use chemicals for sanitizing , including but not limited to : Waxie 730 hp Disenfectant Cleaner as an all -purpose disinfectant with a quick virus kill time Each campus has been equipped with an electrostatic sprayer that will disinfectant on contact when used. These sprayers are used throughout the day in high touch areas, playgrounds, classrooms, lobbies and office areas . Enhanced cleaning will t ake place in the event of a positive Covid case or elevated cases in the community. Face Coverings Our campuses will have masks readily a vailable. Ultimately, Pinecrest Academy will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA for guidelines requiring face coverings. Some of our students may not be able to wear a mask or face covering due to medical reasons. A doctor's note must be provided by a medical physician on their letterhead. IEP/504 students may not be required to wear masks based on individual needs. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staff that has tested positive for Covid -19, principals conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determi ne which students were in close contact with the positive individual. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes. School health care staff will contact the Southern Nevada Health District and the length of quarantine will be determined. Ad ministration or school health care staff will contact the appropriate families and/or staff . Social Distancing & Capacity Pinecrest Academy will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA when it comes to social distancing requirements and room capacity limits. Pinecrest Academy has measured each of its classrooms. It knows the full capacity limit and can adjust accordingly to any percentage. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 8 Accommodations for Children with Disabilities If students and staff have one of the disability types listed below, they might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness Pinecrest Academy will work with families of children with disabilities to see if in -person learning is the best option. If it is, then campus leadership will work with each family to develop an action plan that is both academically enriching , safe and healthy. There may be students with disabilities who require special considerations when attempting to ensure that the child is able to execute CDC safety and health recommendations. In these circumstances, the school is prepared to col laborate with the child's parents and the child's medical team(s) when appropriate to delineate how the safety and health procedures will be appropriately executed while still aligning to the child's needs. The schools will also follow the SNHD's COVID -19 Preparedness and Response Plan for Schools 2020 - 2021 (dated January 2021) that outlines how to address medical exemptions and exemptions based on student behavioral needs. This document can be found at: https://media.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/downlo ad/COVID - 19/resources/snhd_covid19_preparedness_and_response_plan_for_schools_v2_2021.pdf . Vaccination Access & Awareness Pinecrest Academy will follow SNHD and CDC guidelines for diagnostic and screening testing as applicable. Pinecrest Academy campuses will promote local vaccination sites to its staff and families. Traveling Abroad A quarantine may be required if a student/staff m ember has returned from traveling to an international COVID -19 hotspot, as determined by school leadership. There may l be an exception for families that had work -related military job duty responsibilities. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing For Pinecrest Academy , the wellbeing and mental health of staff and students are of the utmost importance. Pinecrest Academy will provide a 7 hour instructional day for students to learn in - person, interact with peers on all levels of learning, attend specials classes to provide social, emotional, physical, and creative outlets, have recess each day and a lunch for social time, and have access to be fore- and after -school programming for additional learning, social, and physical Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 9 opportunities. A social worker is also available for students in need of additional assistance. Teachers and administrators are also available to students at all times on camp us. Supporting Students: Social -Emotional Learning - Tier 1 Pinecrest Academy will utilize multiple tier 1 social emotional support for its students across all campuses. These supports include: School -wide expectations and procedures Systematic reinforcements Culturally responsive practices Data- based decision making Partner & Community partnerships Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 10 Journal writing Art activities Classroom meetings Mindfulness practices Supporting Students: Trauma -Informed Practices - Tier 2-3 PInecrest Academy will provide ongoing support to staff, students and families for their social and emotional needs. Pinecrest Academy will proactively encourage every person on campus to talk with people they trust about th eir feelings and concerns. Pinecrest Academy leadership will work to build strong relationships with staff, students, and families . It will be important for Pinecrest Academy to consider educators who have experienced hardships during this time due to health concerns, personal losses and other factors. For students, it will be important for staff to recognize which students have more significant needs that require a more immediate response, as well as students who have emerging symptoms that require monitoring over time. Supporting Educators and Staff Pinecrest Academy recognizes and celebrates contributions of all staff on daily, weekly, and monthly basis to boost morale and encourage collegiality. Teachers have common prep and lunch time with grade levels to promote relationship -building and co mradery. Staff events throughout the year also promote a positive climate. Social workers can be brought in from other schools if there are urgent matters on a larger scale to address with staff members, and every staff member has a certain number of days of paid time off to take when needed in addition to their contracted or regularly scheduled days off. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning Pinecrest Academy of Nevada is well aware of the potential negative effect of the school closures and t he distance learning program with limited hours of instruction provided to students since March 2020. Implementing Assessments Pinecrest Academy will begin the school year with a comprehensive plan to diagnose and identify student needs. CASLV will use e very tool available to identify student needs and the learning gaps. Some of these tools include but are not limited to Brigance Screener for Kindergarten, NWEA MAP Fall assessment, classroom level benchmark assessments, and hearing & vision screenings. I-Ready assessments will be administered in August to determine baseline and identify specific areas to target for each student's improvement. Intervention and enrichment groups will be formed based on i -Ready baseline data and spring SBAC data (if available). Master schedules are built with school -wide intervention blocks included in the instructional day. Additional staff have been hired to provide interventions for students demonstrating learning loss and below -grade level achievement and will work across the school campus to address students' needs. I-Ready and ST Math have been purchased to provide indiv idualized additional support and learning paths on computer programs to supplement classroom instruction. All students have access to a mobile device at school and at home if remaining virtual. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 11 Students in need of a wifi hotspot to support virtual learning from home will have access to a hotspot provided by Pinecrest Academy. All students have access to the school library and to the online library, myOn. In-Person Learning & Special Populations Special populations such as SPED, EL, and immigrant students will continue to receive services from licensed teachers. These groups will be identified and services will be provided in accordance with the Nevada State and Federal requirements and guidelines. Students will be served in their own groups and gr ant funds and other funds will be used solely to service these students. If a student or group of students who receive services within Special Education have to participate in \"full distance education\" instructional models, our school is prepared to ensure the continuity of services including access to necessary technology, resources, and personnel including, but not limited to, related service staff as written into IEPs. Below is a list of processes/activities that we are prepared to execute: \u00b7 Providing c hild with technology device that has Wi -Fi accessibility and all appropriate applications that child would need in order to ensure their individualized FAPE is provided (i.e., text to speech/speech to text, Google Classroom, iReady, etc.). Families in need of in home Wi -Fi will be also be supported. \u00b7 Students will continue to receive their individualized FAPE via a combination of live virtual instruction (Synchronous) as well as other types of virtual instruction (Asynchronous and reviewing of recorded instruction) from their corresponding certified teachers. \u00b7 Students in need of non -virtual learning materials will be provided those materials (construction paper, hard copies of learning curriculum, learning manipulatives, etc.) \u00b7 Every parent of a child wi th a disability is offered the opportunity to revise their child's IEP to include a Special Education Alternative Learning Plan (SEALP). The SEALP is a document that allows the IEP to consider the child's current IEP services and discuss how, when, and by whom the services will be delivered while participating in a \"full distance education\" model. The SEALP also allows the IEP team the opportunity to consider supports/services that may be needed now that the child is participating in a \"full distance educat ion\" model and then to appropriately include those supports/services in the SEALP as an addendum to the child's IEP. It will be our recommendation that for students who request to be on a \"full virtual track\" for an extended amount of time as delineated in writing by a medical professional, that an IEP Revision meeting takes place to properly address that change of placement and corresponding adjustments to supports and services. For students who are unexpectedly forced to remain out of school for a tempora ry amount of time as a result of having to quarantine according to adopted guidance health policy, it will be our recommendation for teams to send out a Prior Written Notice to families as soon as possible identifying the proposed supports and services bei ng offered to the child within that timeframe. More formal IEP Revisions may be needed for students under these circumstances depending on the student's individual learning needs and current state of health while under quarantine. \u00b7 Depending on the nature of having to implement the \"full distance learning\" model, schools are prepared to work with individual families of students with unique special education needs to consider if any amount of \"in person\" learning may need to take place despite what is being allowed/offered to the general student population. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 12 Path Forward Program: Distance Learning Pinecrest Academy of Nevada has created a distance learning plan for the 2021 -2022 school year. Pinecrest Academy recognizes that there may be families that need to keep learning in a virtual environment. The distance learning plan is specifically designed for students: With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in -person learning, as determined by a medical health professional Who tested positive for Covid -19 Identified as close contacts of Covid -19 Affected by school closures and/or tightening government health protocols Pinecrest Academy is dedicated to maintaining high expectations and strong academic achievement for all students, whether full-time in-person or full-time distance learning. High -Risk Medical Exemption Process Families must submit documentation from a health care medical professional and email it to their campus principal by July 25, 2021. Pinecrest Administration will review the form, and either approve or deny. After July 25 , 2021, if any student gets off the waitlist and enrolls at any of our camp uses or there is a change of circumstances for any enrolled student , they will submit medical documentation to the campus as soon as possible. Students who are out on a high -risk medical exemption may not participate in any in- person learning, assemblies, face-to-face extracurricular or on -campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID -19, just as be ing in the classroom on campus would. There may be times, like for important assessments, where students may need to be on campus. During these times, a safe, socially -distanced environment will be set up for the students to be in. Every person will wear a mask in these environments. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 13 Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning at the end of first semester - which will be determined on a case -by-case basis. Those individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congen ital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, or liver disease. During the school year, if public health conditions worsen and/or students develop certain health conditions that may qualify for a high -risk medical exemption, families can reach out to school leadership to discuss joining full-time distance learning. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 14 Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 15 Parent Considerations for Distance Learning Parents/guardians are asked to consider the following information when seeking full-time distance learning (DL) for their student: Students will only be allowed to switch back to in -person learning at the end of the semester or with administrator approval , which will be determined on a case -by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. All full- time distance learning requests are subject to approval by the school leadership. If a full -time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted wit h the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face-to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the real-time synchronous sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs assistance, they should not interrupt a lesson A student participating in full -time distance learning who qualifies for free and reduced lunch, may receive meals at the school at no cost. Students participating in distance learning are expected to demonstrate positive attendance and grades. Students will be expected to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real- time sessions during the school's instructional day, unless otherwise instructed by the teacher . Students will be required to attend school face-to-face for designated activities and assessments. Some courses/electives may not be offered through full-time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Make -up work is available to all students. Students are responsible for asking teachers for the make -up work upon returning to class. Students will receive credit for satisfactory make -up work, including tests, after an absence, but may receive a zero for any make -up work, including tests, not made up within the allotted time. Any assignment not turned in within the allotted time falls within the late work guidelines. Exceptions may be granted by the teacher in extenuating circumstances. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 16 Full- Time Distance Learning Full- time distance learning will only take place for high -risk students whose exemption form has been approved. Once eligible for the Distance Learning (DL) program, students will be assigned to a class/schedule aligned with in -person schedules. DL students will be observing in -person instruction and completing assignments which are the same or modified for DL. Teach ers will regularly review and revise the curriculum to reflect real -world needs, depth and complexity, rigor and relevance, and meeting all students' needs. Classwork is any instructional activity defined/planned by the teacher to be completed during a class period to facilitate the learning process. There could be occasions where classwork becomes homework. Students wi ll have access to Google Classroom and other DL instruction programs and resources. Students will be provided a Chromebook to take home , as needed . Students will also be provided internet service if need be. Students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in- person teacher if the entire class goes under quarantine. All work/activities will be accessed via Google Classroom and instruction will take place via Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher or substitute who is providing Distance Learning. DL students will receive the same communication and updates as in- person students. Covid -19 Positive & Close Contacts - Logistics Full- time in-person students who have tested positive for Covid -19 must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership in consultation with the SNHD . Proof of a positive test should be provided to campus leadership . Contact tracing will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus. During a student's quarantine, a Chromebook will be provided if needed. School leadership will communicate the next steps for distance learning with families. Students are required to follow all procedures as stated by their teachers and leadership. Students are expected to attend class every day. Students should let teachers and front office staff know if they will be absent. Teacher(s) will try to connect with the student daily. Students may return to school from their quarantine on the agreed upon date. If the student is not symptom -free at the end of their quarantine, the quarantine will be extended for the safety of everyone. Once symptom -free, they may return to in-person learning. Quarantined Students & Distance Learning We foresee there being two types of quarantines for full-time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. number of Students Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 17 When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in-person teacher. All work/activities will be accessed via Google Classro om and other curriculum platforms and instruction will be synchronous through Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher /substitute who is providing Distance Learning. When only a limited number of students need to be quarantined, students will be assigned to the dedicated DL teacher's classroom. Attendance will be taken in Infinite Campus. All assignments will be turned in via Google Classroom or Curricular platforms . We have great experience in using this learning model during the 4th quarter of the 2019 -2020 school year and entire 2020 -2021 school year. We also have had to quarantine classrooms regularly during the 2020 -2021 school year. Transitioning due to Public Health Conditions Worsening public health conditions can affect the learning model that is implemented. If the Southern Nevada Health District, Center for Disease Control, and/or the Nevada Department of Education enforce new di rectives, we will make those changes as necessary. It will be a smooth transition for us due to our experience, and we are equipped to adapt to the changes. The past 15 months have shown that we are capable of supporting students with the necessary techno logy, communicating with families effectively, and providing high -quality instruction to students. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 18 We made a shift from in -person learning to full -time distance learning when schools were closed in March 2020. Within a matter of days , live i nstruction was taking place online. This is because we prepared our staff and students for what we saw coming. When conditions were improving, we were one of the first schools to bring back students in- person through a hybrid model. By the start of the second quarter, we were managing AM/PM/full- distance cohorts at all of our campuses. It went smoothly because of the training that staff received and the communication between the students, families and the school. Through both models, our campuses implemented strict health and cleaning policies for staff, students and visitors to our campuses. We abided by any social distancing measures in the hallways and in classrooms. We provided nutrition meals during that time as well. If we are mandated to switch learning models during the 2021 -2022 school year, our schools and staff members will be ready. If we are forced to shift the learning model abruptly, we will be ready to make that change immediately. Serving Special Populations in Distance Learning The distance learning program will provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plan. Special education teachers will meet virtually with student s as needed to meet the mandated number of instructional minutes. School staff will consider alternative ways to provide equitable access and appropriate educational opportunities for students with disabilities, including exploring all available supplementary aids and services and related services to include online or virtual platforms, and/or other activities, such as paper/pencil activities. Documentation of all efforts to provide equitable access to educational opportunities is required. Speci al education teachers must document that the student is receiving his/her specially designed instruction through the approved instructional model on the status record. Related service providers must continue to follow current procedures to document services provided. Assessments, MDT meetings, and IEP meetings may be held virtually or in -person . If the school cannot contact the parent/guardian to schedule an IEP meeting, the school will follow standard procedures. IEP teams must include any data collected, including any deficit areas, behavioral data, the effectiveness of accommodations, etc. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 19 A case manager or related service provider must provide how instruction is scaffolded or the background knowledge needed for the student to complete the assignments aligned to the Nevada Pre-K Standards or the NVACS/Connectors and goals and benchmarks/objectives. A case manager or related service provider must also review and address student work and/or finished assignments, checking for und erstanding and accuracy, adapting content, methodology, and/or instruction to the needs of the student. When on campus for an IEP- mandated procedure, the IEP should also include input from parents/guardians regarding difficulties with the student's compliance with rules related to social distancing, wearing face coverings, washing hands, and other safety protocols. Goals, benchmarks and/or short -term objectives should be based on the current present levels of academic achievement and funct ional performance. Based on prior goals and benchmarks or objectives, the team should consider the student's anticipated progress for the remainder of the annual IEP. Staffing & Development for Distance Learning Pinecrest Academy will utilize licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes to be the instructors for distance education. Teachers will post the objectives for each class. These teachers will create lessons and units through Google Classroom and other programs to assist with planning instruction. Teachers will be accessible to students via zoom or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours. Teachers will provide any support to families during distance learning. Teachers will be able to direct families to the necessary resources in support of the student's learning; they will communicate to the student the nature of the outstanding work and the time limitation for completing the work. During teacher in-service week, teachers will be receiving professional development and training on distance learning, Covid -19 protocols, and working with families through this time. Student Attendance in Full -Time Distance Learning Each student participating full -time in distanc e education will be expected to be online for the entire instructional day, with the exception of lunch, specials, specified electives, or as communicated by their teacher. Students will be contacted via electronic means or by telephone by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher at least once per instructional day/class to confirm attendance . Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 20 If a student's confirmed lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitut e teacher will maintain a record of attempts. Staff will use a consistent method in Infinite Campus for recording contact with students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through Google Classroom . Families may contact the main office of their campus if there is an attendance issue, such incorrectly marked absence. Ten consecutive unexcused absences with no contact will result in a withdrawal from Pinecrest Academy of Nevada . Technology Access For any students without access to such technology, school leadership will work with families to ensure technology is accessible. Famil ies will have to complete a contract to borrow the techn ology for the school year. If approved, students will be provided with a hotspot and a Chromebook at no cost to the family. Families will rece ive training by a Pinecrest Academy staff member on how to use the technology if needed. If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year, families are encouraged to contact their teacher. Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year. Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus (at leadership's discretion). If there are greater issues in technology (i.e., internet service provider shutdown, blackout, etc.), distance learning can be done through paper corresp ondence. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021-2022 School Year Plan Page 21 Student/Family Communication A teacher will schedule one or more conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the student is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is pres enting some problem to the teacher, or in any other case that the teacher considers necessary. Such conferences may be handled by telephone, in person, or via written communication If a student emails a teacher, the teacher will respond within 24 hours. Email communication sent on Fridays after 12:00 p.m. should expect a response by close of business on the non- holiday business day. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, campus leadership, the teacher and the community outreach coordinator will work together to provide resources. Nutrition Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school. For virtual students to receive their lunch, the student and/or a family member will need to visit the campus in -person during a designated pick- up period set by the campus administration . The school will then provide a lunch meal. A lunch meal will be not provided to anyone arriving before or after their designated lunch period, unless at the discretion of school administration. Pinecrest Academy of Nevada 2021 -2022 School Year Plan Page 22 Social -Emotional Support The pandemic has affected the social -emotional wellbeing of many people, students included. Staff are encouraged to get to know their students and build trust and respect. Staff are trained to identify and report anything out of the ordinary. Students have an open- door poli cy with all staff. When a student does need social -emotional support, it is critical that parents work in partnership with school staff to create an action plan. The goal is to cope, mitigate or solve the underlying issue that is affecting the student. By addressing trauma sensitively and thoughtfully, it will help heal the student holistically. Mask & Visitation Policy Distance learning students and their family members are required to wear masks when visiting their campus at all times , such a s dropping off paperwork, obtaining services, or attending a meeting . This is for the safety of the students and their families. Distance learning students and their families may only stay in the main office area.

Every pare nt of a child with a disability is offered the opportunity to revise their child's IEP to include a Special Education Alternative Learning Plan (SEALP). The SEALP is a document that allows the IEP to consider the child's current IEP services and discuss ho w, when, and by whom the services will be delivered while participating in a \"full distance education\" model. The SEALP also allows the IEP team the opportunity to consider supports/services that may be needed now that the child is participating in a \"full distance education\" model and then to appropriately include those supports/services in the SEALP as an addendum to the child's IEP. It will be our recommendation that for students who request to be on a \"full virtual track\" for an extended amount of time as delineated in writing by a medical professional, that an IEP Revision meeting takes place to properly address that change of placement and corresponding adjustments to supports and services. For students who are unexpectedly forced to remain out of scho ol for a temporary amount of time as a result of having to quarantine according to adopted guidance health policy, it will be our recommendation for teams to send out a Prior Written Notice to families as soon as possible identifying the proposed supports and services being offered to the child within that timeframe. More formal IEP Revisions may be needed for students under these circumstances depending on the student's individual learning needs and current state of health while under quarantine. Depending on the nature of having to implement the \"full distance learning\" model, schools are prepared to work with individual families of students with unique special education needs to consider if any amount of \"in person\" learning may need to take place despite what is being allowed/offered to the general student population.

It will be our recommendation that for students who request to be on a \"full virtual track\" for an extended amount of time as delineated in writing by a medical professional, that an IEP Revision meeting takes place to properly address that change of placement and corresponding adjustments to supports and services. For students who are unexpectedly forced to remain out of school for a temporary amount of time as a result of having to quarantine according to adopted guidance health policy, it will be our recommendation for teams to send out a Prior Written Notice to families as soon as possible identifying the proposed supports and services being o\u0000ered to the child within that timeframe. More formal IEP Revisions may be needed for students under these circumstances depending on the student's individual learning needs and current state of health while under quarantine. Depending on the nature of having to implement the \"full distance learning\" model, schools are prepared to work with individual families of students with unique special education needs to consider if any amount of \"in person\" learning may need to take place despite what is being allowed/o\u0000ered to the general student population. Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school. VIRTUAL LEARNING: QUARANTINED STUDENTS Students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health o\u0000cials will access classes virtually with their classroom teachers and follow their regular schedule. Alternative assignments may be provided for elective classes and specials. All students may have access to a mobile device if quarantined. Students in need of a wi hotspot to support virtual learning from home will have access to a hotspot provided by Pinecrest Academy of Northern Nevada. All students have access to the school library and to the online library, myOn. Students will access classes and lessons online through the Zoom virtual platform and will participate in live instruction every day via Zoom. Students will complete and submit assignments via Google Classroom and online platforms. In-person students will return to in-person instruction at the end of their quarantine period. VIRTUAL LEARNING: EMERGENCY CLOSURE How will the school ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event that school must be closed due to the e\u0000ects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another major emergency that necessitates the closure of school? Pinecrest Academy of Northern Nevada will follow the same procedures implemented in the 2020-2021 school year. Each student who needs a mobile device may check one out from the school. Each student who needs a wi hotspot may check one out for the school. Students will access classes and lessons online through the Zoom virtual platform and will participate in live instruction every day via Zoom. Students will complete and submit assignments via Google Classroom and the Colegia platform. Devices will be deployed and materials given to families through the carloop system to ensure safety, ease of delivery, and expediency in the event of a major emergency that necessitates the closure of school. All details of an emergency closure will be provided by Pinecrest Academy of Northern Nevada and individual campuses. Your campus will be communicating further information as the start of the school year approaches. Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.

We have learned a lot and grown in many ways as we now prepare for the 2021-2022 school year. Once again, we have a Path Forward Program to ensure success for our students. Background for the SY2122 Path Forward Plans: Superintendent Jhone Ebert and (NDE) requested the submission of a Path Forward Program for the 2021-2022 school year . There are three key components and requirements to our school' s reopening plan. 1. Charter Schools are responsible for determining certain COVID-19 mitigation measures and therefore, must develop plans for how they will ensure the safe reopening of school buildings. This plan addresses health and safety as well as how the school will respond to the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn. 2. Pursuant to Emer gency Directive 044 and guidance provided by the Nevada Department of Education on May 28, 2021, charter schools must develop Path Forward Program Distance Education Plans for the 2021-22 school year . This plan addresses how the school will provide distance education to students who are unable to learn in person. These students must provide documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person or be quarantined on the advice of local public health of ficials. 3. Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session now requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emer gency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan establishes an emer gency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emer gency . This way schools are more prepared to tackle any sudden closures, similar to what was experienced in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. Thank you to all in the Quest community for your patience, support, and positive spirit throughout the past 18 months. Quest will work hard to ensure our students are provided a safe, equitable, and accessible learning environment to become leaders of today and tomorrow . Sincerely , Janelle Veith Principal Page 3Quest' s Plan and Layout Quest' s plan is responsive to our school community and written with lessons learned throughout the pandemic. On July 9th, 2021, the CDC issued updated guidance on safe school openings, which have been incorporated in this document. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of fers guidance for ways in which schools can help protect students, educators, and staf f and slow the spread of disease. Quest must determine, in collaboration with health officials and to the extent possible, whether and how to implement these considerations while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of our local community . Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of the Quest community . CDC guidance documents are meant to supplement, not replace, any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools must comply . EQUITY STATEMENT Quest advocates for equitable access for all students to the highest quality public education, while supporting school educators and staf f. Equity means the learning needs of every student are supported in an environment where all students are valued, respected, and see themselves in their curriculum and instructional materials while experiencing academic success without regard to dif ferences in age, gender , socio-economic status, religion, race, ethnicity , sexual orientation, ability , native language, national origin, or citizenship status. HOW TO USE THE PLAN AND ITS LA YOUT This Plan intends to cover major areas for the 2021-2022 school year as well as the new requirements set forth in Senate Bill 215 from the 2021 Legislative Session. SB 215 requires the governing body of each charter school to \"develop a plan for conducting a program of distance education for at least 10 school days in the event of an emer gency that necessitates the closing of all public schools in this State.\" This plan establishes an emer gency distance learning plan to be implemented in the event of a major emer gency . The Plan addresses six key components: 1. In Person Learning: Health and Safety 2. In Person Learning: Student and Staf f Well Being 3. In Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning 4. Distance Education: Students Unable to Participate in Person 5. Distance Education: Supporting Students 6. Distance Education: Emer gency Closure Page 4COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Re-opening plans created after a complex public health crisis require a collective approach. It is critical to engage, educate, and empower all families and staf f and ensure our re-opening plan is responsive to their voice and needs and address specific challenges in the Quest community . Regardless of the challenges and changes, Quest will ensure students are academically growing through research based best practice instruction and rigorous standards for performance. Quest will adhere to our Mission and Vision to grow leaders for today and tomorrow . M i s s i o n Quest Academy is an academic institution that is dedicated to growth, perseverance, and academic achievement. We foster students' personal and intellectual growth so that they are prepared to be positively productive and engaged citizens of their communities. We pride ourselves on our familial environment, and caring and committed teaching, leadership, and support staf f. V i s i o n Quest Preparatory Academy provides a uniquely designed, academically rigorous, caring and nurturing learning experience in a tuition-free, public school setting. We are a close-knit community of teachers, leaders, and families, committed to providing our diverse student population with the high-quality educational experience that they deserve. COMMUNICA TION Quest will utilize the following ways to communicate: providing updates via school website; text messaging; and email communication to educators, families, students, community members, and other key stakeholders. Additional communication methods will include social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) and communication platforms such as Infinite Campus and Microsoft Teams. Consistent, accurate information regarding policies and procedures is needed to keep everyone informed: Posted signs in highly visible locations, such as the school entrances and restrooms, that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs (such as proper handwashing and use of a cloth face-covering). Broadcast regular morning announcements on reducing the spread of illness to K-8 students and staf f Include messages and videos about behaviors that prevent the spread of illness when communicating with staf f and families on school websites, in emails, and on school social media accounts. Disseminate CDC print and digital resources from the CDC' s communications resource main page. Ensure student- and family-facing materials are reader -friendly and available in a language all community members can understand. Create opportunities for staf f training, both overall for pandemic response and tailored to dif ferent roles Page 5EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT Emer gency management is a critical component of or ganizational leadership and a plan must be in place to implement and communicate with stakeholders. Quest will maintain a communication system that will ensure to reach all stakeholders. The first line of communication will be through Infinite Campus. Then, announcements will go through Microsoft Teams. Third, social media platforms and then the school website. Continuation of Operations Planning in an Emergency Closure In the event of a pandemic or similar public health emer gency , there are special considerations for school operations. Quest' s emer gency operations plan includes a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). The extent to which Quest will remain operational during a pandemic will lar gely depend on the severity of the pandemic and our plan for continuity of education. If Quest is closed to students for learning, it will remain operational in part. To determine the appropriate level of operations and to ensure functionality , the School Safety Committee will develop a standard operating procedure for essential functions and processes. Quest utilizes the Federal Emer gency Management Agency (FEMA) for instruction on planning for continued operations. This includes using the school' s COOP plan and working with the local health authority . Emergency Operations Planning Emer gency Operation Plans (EOPs) are developed by a collaborative planning team with clearly defined roles and responsibilities to help responders understand the situation at hand, as well as identify and prioritize threats (hazards and risks). Quest' s EOP includes the necessary elements of: communications, resources and assets, safety and security , staf f responsibilities, utilities. Nevada Requirements for Crisis and Emergency Response for Schools Nevada charter schools are required to have school EOPs that meet the federal definition of a high-quality school EOP; in addition to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) requirements. NRS 388.229-.26 Public Schools Page 6IN PERSON LEARNING: Health and Safety Quest recognizes that the health and safety of students and staf f is of the utmost importance. Quest will seek data, guidance, recommendations, and/or approval from the Southern Nevada Health District, the Center for Disease Control, the Nevada Department of Education, and the Nevada Governor 's Office. Quest will continually work with its families, staf f, leadership and Board to implement Covid-19 mitigation protocols that are the safest for its in-person students and staf f at any point in time. Ultimately , Quest will use all available scientific information to help make a determination on these matters. According to the USDE COVID-19 Handbook ( U.S. Department of Education, Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development, ED COVID-19 Handbook, Volume 1: Strategies for Safely Reopening Elementary and Secondary Schools, Washington, DC, 2021. This report is available on the Department's website at https://www2.ed.gov/documents/coronavirus/reopening.pdf ) , K-12 schools can open safely for in-person instruction when strictly implementing prevention strategies. The CDC K-12 Operational Strategy emphasizes the importance of using a combination of layered prevention strategies to avoid COVID-19 transmission in schools, including: 1. Universal and correct wearing of masks. 2. Physical distancing. 3. Handwashing and respiratory etiquette 4. Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including ventilation improvements. 5. Contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine, in collaboration with the state, local, territorial, or Tribal health departments. *\" While each of these strategies is important, emphasis should be placed on the universal and corr ect wearing of masks and physical distancing. \" CDC' s operational strategy then advises on how to use the thresholds determined by these metrics as a first step in planning to implement prevention strategies in elementary and middle school level learning: Levels of Community Transmission At low (blue) levels K-12 schools open for in-person learning if they strictly implement the previously listed five key prevention strategies, including masking and physical distancing of 3 feet or more. Sports and extracurricular activities can occur with physical distancing to the greatest extent possible. At moderate (yellow) levels K-12 schools open for in-person learning if they strictly implement the previously listed five key prevention strategies, including masking and physical distancing of 3 feet or more. Sports and extracurricular activities should only occur in person if physical distancing of 6 feet or more can be maintained. At substantial (orange) levels K-12 schools open for in-person learning if they strictly implement the previously listed five key prevention strategies, including masking and physical distancing of 3 feet or more. Cohorting is recommended when possible. Sports and extracurricular activities should occur only if they can be held outdoors with physical distancing of 6 feet or more. Page 7At high (red) levels Elementary schools open for in-person learning with strict adherence to prevention strategies, including masking. Physical distancing of 3 feet or more should be required . Cohorting is recommended when possible. Middle schools that can use cohorting can operate in person with 3 feet or more of distance with strict adherence to all prevention strategies (including masking). Schools that cannot use cohorting should ensure 6 feet of distance between students in classrooms and continue to use 6 feet of distance between students outside classrooms and throughout the school, as previously recommended. The total number of new cases per 100,000 people can be calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other community type) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other community type) and multiplying by 100,000 HEALTH Quest will address key CDC recommendations based on the current guidance in the following health areas: 1. Use of Face Coverings 2. Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette 3. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities 4. Improving Ventilation 5. Contact Tracing 6. Diagnostic and Screening Testing 7. Efforts to Increase Access and Awareness to Vaccinations 8. Appropriate Accommodations for Children with Disabilities with respect to health and safety policies 1. Use of Face Coverings Quest will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA for guidelines requiring face coverings with awareness of the current level of community spread using CDC thresholds as indicators. According to the CDC, a critical mitigation strategy is consistent and correct universal mask use. When teachers, staf f, and students who are not fully vaccinated consistently and correctly wear a mask, they protect others as well as themselves . Consistent and correct mask use by people who are not fully vaccinated is especially important indoors and in crowded settings, when physical distancing cannot be maintained. Indoors: Mask use is recommended for people who are not fully vaccinated including students, teachers, and staf f. Children under 2 years of age should not wear a mask. Outdoors: In general, people do not need to wear masks when outdoors. However , particularly in areas of substantial to high transmission , CDC recommends that people who are not fully vaccinated wear a mask in crowded outdoor settings or during activities that involve sustained close contact with other people who are not fully vaccinated. As of July 1st, 2021, Clark County is at a high (red) level for community transmission. Quest will use universal masking of unvaccinated individuals while in levels of substantial and high community transmission. While providing vaccination documentation is voluntary , vaccination documentation must be provided to Human Resources (staf f) and to the Registrar (students) to not wear a mask. Quest is supportive of people who are fully vaccinated, but choose to continue to wear a mask, as a personal choice or because they have a medical Page 8condition that may weaken their immune system. With vaccination status, Quest will use the same standard protocols that are used to collect and secure other immunization or health status information from students. The protocol to collect, secure, use, and further disclose this information will comply with relevant statutory and regulatory requirements, including Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERP A) statutory and regulatory requirements. Policies or practices related to providing or receiving proof of COVID-19 vaccination will comply with all relevant state, tribal, local, or territorial laws and regulations. As community transmission levels fluctuate throughout the year , the school leader and Governing Board designee will meet and coordinate with the school safety team regularly to update the mask policy to adjust to local conditions and recommendations/requirements of the SNHD, state of Nevada, and CDC. Community transmission levels will be monitored weekly . Any update to the mask policy or COVID-19 related policies will be communicated to the school community through a schoolwide email and notice home to parents. The narrow subset of students with disabilities who cannot wear a mask because of their disability , or cannot safely wear a mask, might still be able to attend school safely if other prevention strategies can be followed, including, for example, correct masking for others who work or learn with them and physical distancing. Adaptations and alternatives, such as additional facial protections can be considered for educators and other students working with or learning with such students in addition to physical distancing. IEP/504 students may not be required to wear masks based on individual needs. 2. Handwashing and Respiratory Etiquette Individuals should continue to practice good hygiene. Employees must wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer , especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces. All students, staf f, and visitors will be required to utilize hand sanitizer upon entering the school building. Quest will continue to promote proper personal hygiene to include: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Keep 6 feet of physical distance from others Avoid contact with others if within 6 feet Wear a cloth face mask covering in public (if unvaccinated) Avoid traveling if you are sick Stay home if you are feeling ill Get medical care as needed Quest will have an abundance of signage promoting positive physical hygiene. For example, each restroom mirror will have a sticker reminding students to wash their hands for at least 20 seconds. These visual cues will be incredibly helpful, especially for visual learners. In the event that a student may not be implementing safe and healthy hygiene practices, staf f will re-educate the student and inform the student' s parents. Handwashing Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students and staf f If soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol can be used Sneezes/Coughs Page 9 Teach and reinforce coughing and sneezing with a cover (tissue) or if one is not available, into your elbow Encourage staf f and students to throw used tissues in the trash and hand wash immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Cloth Face Coverings Quest will teach and reinforce the correct use of cloth face coverings. Individuals will be reminded frequently not to touch the face covering and to wash their hands frequently . Information regarding hygiene will be shared with families through email regarding handwashing, coughing/sneezing, and proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings. 3. Cleaning and Maintaining Healthy Facilities Quest will make multiple adjustments to clean and maintain healthy facilities to minimize the risk of COVID-19. This will include: Hand sanitizer pumps will be placed on walls in various locations throughout the campus. There is an increase in signage enforcing social distancing and healthy personal hygiene in hallways and classrooms. There are visual cues on the floor showing where to stand, wait, and move. There are decals in restrooms reminding individuals to wash their hands. Occupancy capacity signs are placed in each classroom. Desks will be arranged to be socially distanced to the furthest extent possible. Desks will be marked to show which ones are assigned to which students. Furniture that is dif ficult to clean will not be utilized or replaced. All air filters will be monitored and replaced as needed. HV AC vendors service the school multiple times throughout the school year . Students will be required to have individual school supplies. This includes student headphones. All shared items, such as athletic balls, will be cleaned accordingly . There will be limited use of the water fountain. Students and staf f will be encouraged to bring their own water bottles. All emer gency plans will be adjusted to accommodate social distancing guidelines while maintaining the necessary safety , urgency and precaution. In each building, staf f will check the cleanliness of the campus to ensure a safe and healthy environment. All restrooms will be monitored regularly throughout the day to ensure cleanliness. High touch points, such as water fountains, sink heads, door knobs, and student desks, will be cleaned regularly by Quest staf f. Shared materials will be limited as much as possible, and they will be cleaned and sanitized after each use. In the event of a pandemic scare or a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, the school has been equipped with an electrostatic sprayer that will disinfectant on contact when used. After this has been used in a space, that area will be disinfected and suitable for occupancy . The Facilities department, working with the safety committee, has determined the definition, frequency , and need of 'deep cleaning'. Quest will complete frequent cleaning and disinfecting of door handles, faucets, keyboards, tables, desks, shared objects, etc. High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings will be cleaned routinely . Page 10Libraries, gyms, and playgrounds are of f limits unless they are sanitized between groups. Quest will provide hand sanitizers in every room and common areas. Teachers and staf f will ensure proper supervision, especially with elementary students. Quest Facilities will ensure the safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children. Supplies needed include: hand soap, sanitizer that contains 60% or higher alcohol, paper towels, disinfectant wipes, no-touch trash cans, and EP A-approved disinfectants against COVID-19. In classrooms, students' belongings will be separated from others' in individually labeled containers in grades K-2. In grades 3-8, students' belongings will remain in their backpack, which will hang behind their chair . Quest will support healthy hygiene behaviors by providing supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol (for staf f and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, cloth face coverings for staf f and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans. 4. Impr oving Ventilation Improve facility cleaning and ventilation to the greatest extent possible, including, minimally , by opening windows and doors and using fans where safe and feasible; routinely and consistently cleaning the facility , particularly hightouch or shared surfaces; conducting assessments or audits of existing ventilation systems; and developing a ventilation improvement plan, which may be based on tools from CDC. Quest can schedule incremental checkpoints to ensure plans for updating ventilation are going according to schedule and increase the frequency of changing ventilation filters. 5. Contact Tracing For any student and/or staf f that has tested positive for Covid-19, the Safety Coordinator will conduct an investigation. In the investigation, they will determine which students were in close contact with the positive individual and share the results with the Principal. Close contact is defined as within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes. The Safety Coordinator will connect with the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD). The Safety Coordinator will share the names of close contacts, their contact information, and parent information if the close contact is a student. From there, the Safety Coordinator will contact the Southern Nevada Health District. At that point in time, the length of quarantine will be determined. The Safety Coordinator will share that information with the principal. The principal will have the Registrar message the appropriate families. 6. Diagnostic and Scr eening Testing Staff and students (and their parents) will self-screen their physical health daily . Under no circumstances should any employee with any symptoms report to the workplace (Appendix C: CDC Poster Guidance). If any student is not feeling well and having any symptoms, that person will need to stay at home. Any individual who does not feel well or is symptomatic (fever , shortness of breath, etc.) should remain at home and away from others. Staf f and students should only return to school when there are no remaining symptoms. If a student or staf f member chooses to go to school while ill (no matter the illness), they will not be allowed in the classroom. For students, the parent will be contacted to take the student home and will not be Page 11allowed to return until they are symptom-free. For staf f, they cannot return until they are symptom-free. In the event that a student or a staf f member feels ill during the school day , they will be removed from the classroom. They will be asked relevant questions pertaining to their health and assessed by a staf f member with a touchless thermometer and if necessary , another staf f member will cover their classes. All individuals feeling sick should stay home. Under no circumstances should an employee go to or stay at work if they feel ill. Employees should contact and follow the advice of their medical provider . In addition, employees and supervisors should stay in contact and communicate often and openly discuss any return to work to support the health of other employees. Spaces have been created in the Elementary School and the Middle School for temporary isolation. If a student or staf f member is diagnosed with a contagious or infectious disease, the person will be required to self-quarantine, and the Southern Nevada Health District will be contacted. Quest will work in consultation with medical and public health experts, the State Public Charter School Authority , and the Nevada Department of Education to determine the extent of testing in the school and if a closure is necessary . Physical Health Screening Plan Employees Daily (to be completed by the employee) -temperature screening and symptom checking Employee shall notify Human Resources of a elevated temperature or symptoms Students Daily (to be completed at home) -temperature screening and symptom checking Parents/guardians will be provided the checklists of symptoms to self screen their child(ren) at home in the morning before the school year begins. Visitors Every visit-temperature screening and symptom checking using form in Appendix D. Screening will occur when the visitor enters the lobby . A sign on the door will notify the visitor of the screening requirements if they enter the building. Volunteers will not be allowed during substantial or high levels of community spread. The safety committee in conjunction with the school leader and governing board designee will provide guidelines for visitors when there is low or moderate community spread. Immunizations-Of fice staf f will communicate to staf f, parents or guardians, and students that it is critical to be up to date on all required immunizations. Protocols for Self-Isolation for individuals who are sick or who have come in contact with someone who is sick COVID-19 Circumstances: According to the CDC, it is recommended that all individuals with flu-like symptoms stay home for 72 hours after symptoms resolve, as COVID-19 symptoms can be similar to flu-like symptoms. Recovered, confirmed COVID-19 patients can return 10 days after the first day of symptoms or positive test (if no symptoms) or 72 hours after a fever resolves-whichever is longer . If Quest suspects a case(s) of COVID-19: 1. A face mask will be placed on the staf f member or student immediately regardless if she/he has symptoms or not to include confirmed vaccinated individuals. Page 122. Isolate the case in a separate room. 3. Notify parent/guardian. 4. Contact our local/state health department as soon as possible. 5. Create a list of all (students and staf f) who could have been exposed (contacts). 6. Consider hospitalization for those with severe symptoms. Quest will follow the advice of the local/state health department regarding reporting, isolation of cases/quarantining contacts, environmental disinfection, individual hygiene, and the probability of school closure. Students that require quarantine or need to comply with stay at home medical orders will be accommodated with full-time distance learning for the required number of days. Staff that require quarantine or need to comply with stay at home medical orders will be addressed with the HR of fice. 7. Efforts to Incr ease Access and Awareness to Vaccinations Quest has and will continue to strongly encourage students, families and staf f members to get their vaccinations if they are of age and health abides. Quest will also utilize the CDC recommended strategies below: 1. Partner up on COVID-19 vaccine-related activities in your community . Example: Inform parents through a school' s communication channels about the dates and places of COVID-19 vaccination events or on-going clinics. Send out electronic sign-up links for parents to register their child and/or themselves for a COVID-19 vaccination appointment. 2. Arm school staf f with resources for answering general COVID-19 vaccination questions during pre-service training. 3. Promote vaccine confidence among students, parents, and guardians. 4. Promote well-child visits for routine health needs. 5. Make COVID-19 a teachable moment. 8. Appr opriate Accommodations for Childr en with Disabilities with r espect to health and safety policies Accommodations for Children with Disabilities: If students and staf f have one of the disability types listed below , they might be at increased risk of becoming infected or having unrecognized illness. People who have limited mobility or who cannot avoid coming into close contact with others who may be infected, such as direct support providers and family members. People who have trouble understanding information or practicing preventive measures, such as hand washing and social distancing. People who may not be able to communicate symptoms of illness. Quest will work with families of children with disabilities to see if in-person learning is the best option. If it is, then campus leadership will work with each family to develop an action plan that is both academically enriching and safe and healthy . Page 13SAFETY Use of Space: Social Distancing & Capacity Quest will follow the guidance of the CDC, SNHD, and SPCSA when it comes to social distancing requirements and room capacity limits. Social distancing, also called \"physical distancing,\" means keeping space between yourself and other people, which is one of the best tools to avoid being exposed to viruses and for slowing down the spread. As is possible, staff and students will be asked to stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings. Students will maintain at least 3 feet of physical distance between students within classrooms, combined with indoor mask wearing by people who are not fully vaccinated, to reduce transmission risk. When it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of at least 3 feet, it is especially important to layer multiple other prevention strategies, such as indoor masking. In the classroom setting, staf f will stay at least 6 feet from other people but when not possible, must wear a cloth face covering and have a physical barrier as feasible. Quest will work with educators, facility staf f, and leaders to identify suf ficient safe space that allows for physical distancing, making adjustments as needed to classroom layouts. Educators have been given time before the school reopening to redesign their classroom space and develop and coordinate new routines among staf f to support physical distancing. All staf f members should monitor to avoid those circumstances that do not allow for appropriate physical distancing. Again, every individual is responsible for the safety and health of themselves and fellow employees. Capacity in buildings and rooms is important to identify . Quest has measured each of its classrooms and spaces and identified the full capacity limit and can adjust accordingly to any percentage required by appropriate authorities. School events will be planned utilizing capacity numbers that allow for appropriate distancing and will require RSVPs. Space Dividers Quest has Plexiglass for the elementary and middle school front of fice to serve as an additional physical barrier . When students are unable to adhere to 3 feet physical distancing in classrooms, space dividers will be utilized as feasible. Traffic: Drop Of f and Pick Up : Drop of f will be car drop of f only . For students that live within a 1 mile radius and have a walking permission slip, an outdoor screening line will be enforced and temperature checks will be conducted. Parents will be responsible for completing online health screen surveys before their child arrives. Pick up will be car pick up only . Quest will continue our school policy of silent dismissal. There may not be any congregation of parents/guardians outside the school. Students will only be released to those in vehicles. For students that live within a 2 mile radius and have a walking permission slip, they will be released to walk home once car pick up is complete. Classroom and School Usage Class changes will be 'static' when practical. If the schedule determines that class changes would be 'fluid', tables and high touch surfaces would be wiped down prior to another group' s entry . Students will line up using social distancing and hallways will be one way each direction. There will not be passing periods where students commingle and do not go directly to class. All schedules must be adhered to in case the school must facilitate contact tracing. Page 14Restroom usage policies that maintain social/physical distancing will come from the Safety Committee. The office staf f will monitor the restrooms in building 1 and 3. Signage will be marked on the floor for where to wait for the restroom to become available. The PE teachers will be responsible for adhering to the restroom policy in building 4. In building 2, markings will be provided on the floor and teachers will maintain a restroom log. Playgrounds and gym use will require physical distancing for activities. Playground accessories (such as a jump rope) will be kept by each class and sanitized daily to avoid any cross contamination. In the gym, high touch surfaces will be wiped between every class. Cooperative games such as hopscotch, four square, and other activities will be implemented. Upon entering the building from recess, all students will receive hand sanitizer . Quest will utilize pre-designated entry and exit plans. For the elementary , entry will occur at the southwest corner of building 1. Once out of the vehicle, students will proceed to the southeast entrance for handwashing/sanitizer and then follow the path in the hallway until they reach their classroom. All students will follow the same walking pattern and it is one way . In the middle school, entry will occur in the southwest entrance. Cars will pull up next to the east side of the dirt lot and students will proceed in one direction to the southwest middle school entrance. Once inside the building, students will follow the same walking pattern and it is one way to their advisory class. During pick up, the same hallway patterns will be used in the opposite direction. Students will not leave until their vehicle is at the front of the queue. Staf f not in a classroom will be responsible for various spots along the exit route to ensure students and staf f adhere to social distancing requirements. Schoolwide-based procedures for staf f, students, and parents or guardians will be communicated through email, phone calls, flyers, and social media. Quest will determine, based on local health department guidelines, the gradual relaxation of the initial guidelines including social/physical distancing measures. FOOD SAFETY Quest will continue to operate the 2021-2022 school with a special provision, Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to streamline meal counting and claiming as well as maximize the number of students receiving free meals. Based on current state and local health department guidelines, Quest will consider social/physical distancing requirements and may utilize seating in a classroom versus the cafeteria to avoid lar ge gatherings. For breakfast, students will pick it up on their way into the school and eat in their classroom. This will limit student contact. No meals will be served buf fet or family-styled. Meals will be in pre-packaged boxes or bags for each individual. The Facilities Manager will communicate with vendors to anticipate changes to menus and the necessary new food items, sanitation supplies, packaging supplies, etc. Quest Facilities will procure any equipment necessary (carts, temperature control bags, etc.) as needed for the modified meal distribution model. Food services staf f will continue to follow cleaning protocols that have a high frequency of disinfecting of high-touch areas throughout the day . VISIT OR POLICY All business with the public, whenever possible, should be conducted over the phone or online during substantial and high levels of community spread. In cases where this is not possible, the following requirements Page 15should be in place to include following Quest visitation policies. All buildings must have proper signage and social distancing materials placed in visible and appropriate locations to ensure safety of employees and visitors. Person(s) requiring access to our building, of fices and facilities must do so only with a scheduled, pre-arranged appointment (This does not include employees conducting regular business). Ensure public reception spaces where appointments could gather to ensure appropriate physical distancing. These areas should be stringently monitored for compliance. Any additional furniture/seating that would support more than that number of visitors should be removed. Visitor Questionnaire and Acknowledgement forms must be uniform and copied in advance and provided to every visitor upon arrival (Appendix D: Visitor Questionnaire and Acknowledgement). Visitors must be explicitly informed that they will be asked questions about their health, visitation requirements for social distancing and the requirement to use a mask or face covering. Visitors must be explicitly informed they may have to submit to a temperature check. Persons with a temperature above 100.4 will be rescheduled. Visitors must be explicitly informed that they are expected to be on time for the scheduled appointment. If the visitor is more than 5 minutes late for the appointment, then the appointment may be rescheduled for another date and time. Visitors must be explicitly informed that access to the facility will be denied if they fail to complete the Visitor Questionnaire and Acknowledgement, feel sick or do not have a mask or face covering. Requesting an Appointment: All Visitors requesting an appointment must be explicitly informed of the following requirements. Visitors must call upon arrival to the location to ensure the lobby or location are prepared for their arrival. If the visitor is more than 5 minutes late for the appointment, then the appointment may be rescheduled for another date and time. While on the phone, persons with an appointment must explicitly state that they feel well and are asymptomatic (no fever , shortness of breath, etc.). If they cannot meet this criteria, they must be rescheduled. While on the phone, persons with an appointment must be reminded of the requirement for social distancing and confirm they have a mask. If they are vaccinated, they must provide proof of vaccination. If they cannot meet this criteria, they must be rescheduled. Visitors must be explicitly informed that they may have to submit to a temperature check and will be required to answer a Visitor Questionnaire and Acknowledgement prior to or immediately upon entering the building or of fice location. Failure to do so will prevent the visitor from keeping their scheduled appointment. Page 16IN PERSON LEARNING: Student and Staff Well Being Quest will meet students' social, emotional, mental and physical health needs and provide access to a safe and inclusive learning environment through a focus on wellness and recovery . The school will support educator and staff well-being throughout the year utilizing specific strategies. WELLNESS AND RECOVERY As we work to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and move through this pandemic, social emotional connectedness is critical. The pandemic has caused a whirlwind of feelings within oneself. Therefore it is critical for Quest to make sure that the needs of its people are met. Quest will embed and integrate social and emotional learning (SEL) into all academic subjects onsite or via remote learning for both students and staff. When it comes to students, those needs most likely also include socioemotional needs and the trauma that can be triggered by a pandemic. For Quest, the wellbeing and mental health of staf f and students are of the utmost importance. Emphasize Social and Emotional Learning Quest will emphasize social and emotional learning throughout the school year . Effective teaching and learning are highly connected to relationships, and therefore, the leadership team will model support and encourage teachers and school staf f to find ways of building connections and relationships with each other and their students in various scenarios. In the elementary school, a round table is held at the beginning of the day to work on building school community , safety and respect. In middle school, this will occur in Advisory/Leadership. Quest also adheres to the 7 habits of highly ef fective people as modeled in Leader in Me. Adults and children are taught how to be leaders of self and leaders of others. Quest has a Sunshine Committee that works to build community . The committee provides input about how to celebrate missed and upcoming milestones and creates next steps. While rallies and assemblies are not yet possible, morning announcements through Microsoft Teams video, visual bulletin boards, and newsletters will provide ways to express school values and continue to build the sense of school community . Teach Coping and Resilience Skills Quest utilizes the Second Step program for social emotional learning and anti bullying curriculum. These lessons provide ways for the community to learn empathy , problem solve, and use coping strategies. Training on the Second Step program will be provided to staf f during pre-service. Quest utilizes Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) to focus on prosocial skills and to ensure that as soon as someone shows signs of struggling there is support ready . The Student Support Team uses the PBIS framework along with a Multi-T iered System of Support (MTSS) when supporting students' needs. Page 17Determining Student and Staf f Social Emotional Needs For staf f, a social-emotional needs universal screener will be conducted on the first day that staf f returns. The leadership team will analyze the staf f's need for support before the first day of school and what may be needed when students return. For students, social-emotional check-ins will occur during advisory or morning roundtables. Teachers may refer students who may need a higher level of support to the guidance counselor . The first two weeks of school will be focused on building community with the staf f and students through our Leader in Me program. The school experience will be something not felt for well over a year and therefore Quest believes building communication and community will provide an environment to continue to monitor social emotional needs. For students that are referred to the counselor as needing additional support, the student will be referred to the Student Support Team to determine support and structure needed. Monitor Staf f and Students Quest will monitor staf f and students by allowing listening sessions and communicating how lessons learned will be incorporated into the school improvement processes. If students, staf f, or families are struggling, a process for support will integrate the MTSS framework to help assess social-emotional well-being and identify needs for supports. The counselor will schedule regular check-ins with those with an identified need. The Student Support Team will use data to drive decisions and address equity . The SST will regularly review data for needed adjustments and support. The SST will work with community and state agencies and utilize referral pathways from basic needs to mental health services. SUPPORTING STAFF AND STUDENTS Quest will provide ongoing support to staf f, students and families for their social and emotional needs. Quest will proactively encourage every person on campus to talk with people they trust about their feelings and concerns. Quest leadership will work to build strong relationships with staf f, students, and families. Supporting Students: Social-Emotional Learning - T ier 1 Quest will utilize multiple tier 1 social emotional support for its students. These supports include: School-wide expectations, procedures, and problem solving skills Positive systematic reinforcements Culturally responsive practices Data-based decision making Community partnerships Journal writing Art activities Daily classroom meetings Mindfulness practices-example: learning positive self-talk Monthly focuses on the 7 Habits through the Leader in Me program Supporting Students: T rauma-Informed Practices - T ier 2-3 For students, it will be important for staf f to recognize which students have more significant needs that require a more immediate response, as well as students who have emer ging symptoms that require monitoring over time. Page 18Quest has to work and make decisions with these social emotional needs in mind. Universally , Quest will use the tier 1 trauma-informed practices & interventions provided above as a first step. If students are identified that need additional support, additional practices will be used. For more tar geted and intensive support, Quest will use these tier 2 & tier 3 interventions: Weekly reflection meetings Practice problem solving skills Creating a \"calm down toolkit\" Anxiety/grief support groups One-on-one weekly meetings between student and counselor Virtual home visit between student and counselor Behavior contract Restorative justice Use of empathy in multiple forms Supporting Educators and Staf f Quest supports the mental health and wellbeing of its educators and staf f. They are the driving force behind the success of the students and the campuses. Also, it will be important for Quest to consider educators who have experienced hardships during this time due to health concerns, personal losses and other factors. Quest will focus on three main bedrocks in helping teachers. 1. Foster wellness. Quest has and will continue to educate staf f about mental health and encourage open conversation about the challenges people are experiencing, employees may be more likely to access care when needed. Quest will reach out to a wellness provider to consider hosting virtual mindfulness or discussion sessions. Quest will promote the importance of healthy sleep. Quest will encourage staf f to serve as valuable resources to one another by sharing strategies for coping with the pandemic. 2. Provide training. Quest acknowledges that staf f members may have dif ferent levels of ability with using virtual platforms and new learning technologies. Quest has been and will continue to of fer training and technical support for new job demands. This may help to reduce stress. 3. Model healthy behavior: Quest will encourage all school leaders to take care of their own physical, social, and psychological needs. By doing so, they serve as role models and set the tone that it is acceptable and necessary to take care of oneself. Page 19IN PERSON LEARNING: Accelerating Student Learning Quest will address the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn, including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, ef fectively using data, and addressing resource inequities. Quest is well aware of the potential negative ef fect of the school closures and the distance learning program with limited hours of instruction provided to students since March 2020. Because of this, structures must be put in place to ensure the students have a safe environment at school while mitigating the pandemic and that academic time in person be maximized to accelerate student learning. Impact of COVID-19 on Students' Opportunity to Learn: Identifying Student Academic Need Quest will determine students' academic needs as a result of the pandemic and provide support as necessary . Quest will continue the assessment protocol of prior years where all students are assessed to determine a baseline of where each student is achieving. NWEA MAP Growth assessments will be utilized for K-8 Reading, K-8 Math, and 3-8 Science within the first 15 school days. On September 18th, the Professional Development Day will be dedicated to analysis of assessments and planning to provide support and needs based on results. Teachers will create both class goals and individualized goals for student growth. The Leadership and Student Support Team will look at grade and school level trends and provide instructional support and coaching for teachers to assist student academic needs being met. Students that are identified as high risk will be brought to the weekly Student Support Team to put response to intervention support in place. Student progress will be monitored with exit tickets at the end of classes and intervention time will be dedicated to meeting the individual needs of students. MAP Growth assessments will be administered again in November/December to identify growth and additional supports needed. Effectively Using Data Implementing Assessments Quest will begin the school year with a comprehensive plan to diagnose and identify student needs. Quest will use every tool available to identify student needs and the learning gaps. Some of these tools include but are not limited to Brigance Screener for Kinder garten, NWEA MAP Fall assessment, classroom level benchmark assessments, and hearing & vision screenings. Pairing Data with Instruction The teachers will look at the beginning of the year data during the Student Success Team (SST) meetings and prepare a comprehensive plan to meet the student needs. Schools will make the intervention groups during the first SST meeting by the beginning of September . Tutoring and intervention services will be provided during the school day and after school time. Quest will utilize a wide range of programs to accelerate learning and close the achievement gap. Some of the intervention programs include but are not limited to Smarty Ants, Achieve 3000, Dreambox, and Moby Max. In-Person Learning & Special Populations Special populations such as SPED, EL, and immigrant students will continue to receive services from licensed teachers. These groups will be identified and services will be provided in accordance with the Nevada State and Federal requirements and guidelines. Students will be served in their own groups and grant funds and other funds will be used solely to service these students. In addition, Quest will of fer after school tutoring, starting in November . After school tutoring will be of fered to identified intervention students at no cost. Page 20Strategies for Accelerating Learning Accelerating learning as a strategy means that we are not remediating, rather , we are looking forward to what students will need to know to succeed the next day , week, or year and focusing solely on those skills. Quest staf f will utilize multiple strategies to accelerate learning to include providing ef fective Tier I instruction, targeted instruction and support for Tier II and III, and using \"just in time\" instruction and min-lessons that allow teachers to figure out the crucial skills and pieces of knowledge students must have in hand to prepare them for tomorrow . Provide Core Content Delivery with Fidelity: T ier I Curriculum Teachers will continue to follow their yearlong curriculum maps to ensure coverage of Nevada Academic Content Standards. Teachers will continue to utilize the curriculum supports that are rated as highly effective through EdReports.or g: and Social Studies: Discovery Education (K-8) Targeted Instruction and Support for T ier II and III Teachers will utilize tar geted supports through utilization of programs that are individualized to the student' s current level of achievement. Then small group lessons and intervention can also be focused on standards and skills that students need. Supports: Dreambox (Math K-8), Achieve 3000 (ELA 3-8), Smarty Ants (ELA K-3) \"Just in T ime\" Instruction Another best practice Quest will use to slow down learning loss is to give students a \"just-in-time strategy\" where interventions and scaf folds happen right as they encounter grade-appropriate materials and demonstrate a need. Providing students with multiple entry points to the content, scaf folds, and dif ferentiated instruction is important in making grade-level content more accessible and rigorous. Just-in-case scaf folding\u2014providing hints and supports to all students even when they have not demonstrated the need for it\u2014creates issues of both access and equity . When you provide scaf folding to students before they have the opportunity to make sense of a challenging task on their own\u2014without the extra help\u2014they are inhibited from developing productive perseverance. All too often, so much support is provided through the initial scaf folding that the cognitive demand of the task is significantly decreased. If this sort of scaffolding is provided up front for students who struggle, then these same students are denied access to cognitively demanding tasks. When access is denied, equity becomes an issue. Page 21DIST ANCE LEARNING: Students Unable to Participate in Person Quest will ensure that any student who falls into the one of the categories listed below is able to participate in distance education that meets the requirements established for a Path Forward Programs of Distance Education. 1-Students who have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person 2-Students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials Quest has created a distance learning plan for the 2021-2022 school year . Quest recognizes that there may be families that need to keep learning in a virtual environment. The distance learning plan is specifically designed for students: With medical accommodations limiting them from attending in-person learning, as determined by a medical health professional. Who tested positive for Covid-19. Identified as close contacts of Covid-19. Affected by school closures and/or tightening government health protocols. Quest is dedicated to maintaining high expectations and strong academic achievement for all students, whether full-time in-person or full-time distance learning. 1-Students who have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person High-Risk Medical Exemption Process If a student or an individual has a high-risk medical condition*, a Medical Certification for COVID-19 High Risk Exemption Form (provided in Appendix A) may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021-2022 school year .. A health care medical professional must complete the exemption form and email it to Quest at m.hester@questlv .com . Quest will review the form, and either approve or deny within one week of receiving the request. All medical exemption requests will be subject to verification. Parents/guardians will be notified by campus leadership when the form has been verified and accepted. In the event that getting a physician' s wet signature is not possible (due to moving from a dif ferent region or other similar circumstances), a letter from the physician on letterhead will suf fice. Students who are out on a high-risk medical exemption may not participate in any in-person learning, face-to-face extracurricular or on-campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID-19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. There may be times, like for important assessments, where students may need to be on campus. During these times, a safe, socially-distanced environment will be set up for the students to be in with a minimum of 6 feet physical distance. Every person will wear a mask in these environments and complete health screenings. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning at the end of first semester - which will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Those individuals who are at higher Page 22risk of severe illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), are those with conditions including, but not limited to: asthma, chronic lung disease, compromised immune systems (including from smoking, cancer treatment, bone marrow or or gan transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticosteroids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chronic kidney disease under going dialysis, or liver disease. During the school year , if public health conditions worsen and/or students develop certain health conditions that may qualify for a high-risk medical exemption, families can reach out to school leadership to discuss joining full-time distance learning. Full-time distance learning will only take place for high-risk students whose exemption form has been approved. Once eligible for the Distance Learning (DL) program, students will be assigned to the class of the teacher that is designated at the grade level for hybrid instruction, meaning providing instruction to some in person students and some distance students. Parent Considerations for Full time Distance Learning with a Medical Exemption Parents/guardians are asked to consider the following information when seeking full-time distance learning (DL) for their student: Students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning at the end of each semester , which will be determined on a case-by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. If a full-time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face-to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the real-time synchronous sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs assistance, they should not interrupt a lesson. A student participating in full-time distance learning who qualifies for free and reduced lunch, may receive meals at the school at no cost. Successful candidates for full-time distance learning have demonstrated positive attendance and grades during the previous year of school. All full-time distance learning requests are subject to approval by the school leadership. Students will be expected to attend and have their cameras on for the full duration of real-time sessions during the school' s instructional day . Kinder garten - 2nd grade will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions daily . 3rd - 5th grade will have a minimum of 90-120 minutes of real-time sessions daily . Middle School will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions per week per course. Full-time distance education elementary students must have an adult at home readily available to support their learning. Students will be required to attend school face-to-face for designated activities and assessments. Some courses/classes may not be of fered through full-time distance education. Parents will initiate communication with the teacher as soon as concerns arise. Parents will assist students in planning a time schedule for long-term assignments. Make-up work is available to all students. Students are responsible for asking teachers for the make-up work upon returning to class. Students will receive credit for satisfactory make-up work, including tests, after an absence, but may receive a zero for any make-up work, including tests, not made up within the allotted time. Any assignment not turned in within the allotted time falls within the late work guidelines. Exceptions may be granted by the teacher in extenuating circumstances. Page 232-Students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials Quarantined Students & Distance Learning Any student at Quest who is quarantined on the advice of local public health of ficials will receive access to distance education. Covid-19 Positive & Close Contacts -Full-time in-person students who have tested positive for Covid-19 must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. Proof of a positive test should be provided to campus leadership. Contact tracing will be conducted to determine if there are any close contacts on campus. Full-time in-person students who have been identified as Covid-19 close contacts (from the school, SNHD, or personal connection for any case) must quarantine as determined by their campus leadership. A student' s quarantine can be for two weeks (most of the time) but can be longer depending on dif ferent factors. During a student' s quarantine, a Chromebook or laptop will be provided if needed. School leadership will communicate the next steps for distance learning with families. Students are required to follow all procedures as stated by their teachers and leadership. Students are expected to attend class every day . Students should let teachers and front office staf f know if they will be absent. Teacher(s) will try to connect with the student daily . Students may return to school from their quarantine on the agreed upon date. If the student is not symptom-free at the end of their quarantine, the quarantine will be extended for the safety of everyone. Once symptom-free, they may return to in-person learning. Quarantined Groups - We foresee there being two types of quarantines for full-time students: 1. Whole Class/Entire School Quarantine 2. Individual/Limited number of Students When the entire class / school needs to be quarantined, students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in-person teacher . All work/activities will be accessed via Microsoft Teams, and instruction will be synchronous through Microsoft Team meetings. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. When only a limited number of students need to be quarantined, students will be assigned to the dedicated DL teacher 's classroom. Attendance will be taken in Infinite Campus. All assignments will be turned in via Microsoft Teams. Quest Distance Learning Education Plan Overview Goals 1. Provide a supportive mode of learning through distance education for all students to grow and be successful. 2. Provide equitable access to those students without access, ensure equity , and provide for students with disabilities and English learners. Quest understands the need for continuous learning among its students utilizing a distance learning model. The teacher -directed instructional model is a hybrid of asynchronous and synchronous learning to create a structure where learners complete their work at their own pace and also have a particular time to meet with their classroom teachers for instruction and receive support when completing their work. It also has components of the online curriculum in printed format to ensure access to materials for all. To add to this, the plan to provide synchronous distance learning will occur through interaction during live lessons. This is critical for engagement, understanding of course material, and communication. Page 24The online learning platform of Quest is Microsoft Teams, which provides for secure communications between teachers and students. Live lessons are also available through Microsoft Teams. Teachers are trained on best practices with distance learning using Live Lessons and are integrating all distance components through Teams. Microsoft Teams provides a simple and robust communications platform. The integration of Teams allows teachers to use the functionality of video conferencing and teaching in a secure environment established through the integration of Teams and by requiring Microsoft Teams/Of fice 365 authentication. Students will continue to use their textbooks, both print (if needed) and online versions to support their learning. Full-T ime Distance Learning The school will make a schedule based on the number of DL eligible students from each grade level. Teachers will regularly review and revise the curriculum to reflect real-world needs, depth and complexity , rigor and relevance, and meeting all students' needs. Classwork is any instructional activity defined/planned by the teacher to be completed during a class period to facilitate the learning process. There could be occasions where classwork becomes homework. Students will have access to Microsoft Teams and other DL instruction programs and resources. Students will be provided a Chromebook to take home. Students will also be provided internet service if need be. If an entire class goes under quarantine, the regular teacher will provide virtual instruction to the class. All work/activities will be accessed via Microsoft Teams, and instruction will take place via Teams Meetings. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. Teachers will make at least one entry per week for each subject in the Infinite Campus Gradebook. The DL homeroom teacher will communicate with families each day via email, video conferencing, or phone calls. The communication will be documented in Infinite Campus or via a spreadsheet. If a student cannot be accessed via phone, video conferencing, or email, in that case, the dedicated DL teacher will need to find other ways of interacting with the family and record all communication and details. Content Delivery: Recommended T ime on T ask The instructional schedule may need to be revised/revisited throughout the year but the schedule will provide for the time allocations below: K-1: Students should be engaged in academic activities for approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes daily . The remainder of the day could be spent playing, exercising, drawing, dancing, listening to music, etc. 60-90 minutes will be live lesson instruction each day . 2-5: Students should be engaged in academic activities for approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes daily . The remainder of the day could be spent playing, exercising, drawing, dancing, listening to music, etc. 90-120 minutes will be live lesson instruction each day . 6-8: Students should be engaged in academic activities for approximately 4-5 hours daily . The remainder of the day could be spent reading, exercising, drawing, coding, listening to music, etc. Middle school will have a minimum of 60-90 minutes of real-time sessions per week per course. Equity and Access Quest' s student population has varying situations and circumstances. Quest will of fer devices for checkout to families who request for them. Our teachers' survey to their students' parents will also help Quest identify students' access to the internet and connectivity . Quest will also identify those families lacking appropriate devices used for distance education (A cell phone is not adequate technology for school work. Tablets, computers, and laptops will be needed). Quest will make technology and the internet accessible to all students requiring distance education. Page 25Transition Between In-Person Instruction, Full-T ime Distance Education, and Hybrid Learning Models During the 2020-2021 school year , Quest had a positive experience with all learning models and learned many lessons in helping our students and families. We also had experience quarantining students and/or classes. This has allowed the school community to provide a high-quality education in any setting. In the 2021-2022 school year, we will be utilizing in person instruction for all students except those that fall in the exemption categories listed previously in this section. While Quest does not anticipate a change to this learning model, we are ready to adjust to any new directive. When a change of health conditions occurs, the Principal will notify the Quest School Board designee of the change and recommended transition using previous learning models and plans from the 2020-2021 school year . Once approved through the Board (approval may be informal if time sensitive, confirmed by email and formal approval if needed at next Governing Board meeting), the school community will be notified of any plan transitions through Infinite Campus announcements via email, phone calls, and postings on Facebook and the school website. This adaptation of movement between phases is critical for success in an evolving pandemic. Transitioning due to Public Health Conditions Worsening public health conditions can af fect the learning model that is implemented. If the Southern Nevada Health District, Center for Disease Control, and/or the Nevada Department of Education enforce new directives, we will make those changes as necessary . Additionally , the school safety committee met regarding the CDC Guidance for the School decision tree. When closure authority is returned to the local level, the safety committee will incorporate that guidance into the decision-making process. During the school year , if there is a potential need to close again, the safety committee will convene to make decisions and recommendations to the school board. It will be a smooth transition for us due to our experience, and we are equipped to adapt to the changes. The past 15 months have shown that we are capable of supporting students with the necessary technology , communicating with families ef fectively , and providing high-quality instruction to students. We made a shift from in-person learning to full-time distance learning when schools were closed in March 2020. That occurred on a weekend. In a week, live instruction was taking place online. Now we are prepared to make the change overnight. This is because we prepared our staf f and students for multiple scenarios. When conditions were improving, we were one of the first schools to bring back students in-person through a hybrid model. By the start of the second quarter , we were managing blue week/green week/full-distance cohorts at our school. It went smoothly because of the training that staf f received and the communication between the students, families and the school. Through both models, our school implemented strict health and cleaning policies for staf f, students and visitors to our campuses. We abided by any social distancing measures in the hallways and in classrooms. We provided nutrition meals during that time as well. If we are mandated to switch learning models during the 2021-2022 school year , our schools and staf f members will be ready . If we are forced to shift the learning model abruptly , we will be ready to make that change immediately . Staffing & Development for Distance Learning Quest will utilize licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes to be the instructors for distance education. Teachers will post the content and language objectives for each class. These teachers will create lessons and units through Microsoft Teams and online curriculum programs. Teachers will be accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school' s regularly scheduled instructional hours. Teachers will provide any support to families during distance learning. Teachers will be able to direct families to the necessary resources in support of the student' s learning; they will communicate to the student the nature of the outstanding work and the time limitation for completing the work. During teacher in-service week, teachers will be receiving professional development and training on distance learning, Covid-19 protocols, and working with families through this time. Page 26Professional Development Provide and ensure participation in professional learning for educators and staf f regarding high-quality distance education and health and safety requirements related to preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses. Staff will be provided professional development prior to the school year beginning to address both the health and safety requirements related to the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses and how to deliver high-quality distance education. Training for health and safety will be provided by the Quest Safety Team as well as from our safety partner , Compliance Science. Training for high-quality distance education will occur during professional development the week before school begins. Optional training will begin at the end of July .Educators will receive training on building student relationships, instruction best practices in distance learning, and Microsoft Teams training. Training will be continuous throughout the school year. Leadership T eam Role The Leadership team at Quest meets weekly . The team shares the same information so the messaging to all stakeholders is clear and consistent. Additionally , the school leader distributes a weekly newsletter to all staf f and the of fice manager sends out family communication. Governing Board Role The school leader will send regular updates to the governing body to keep them informed of school operations through a bi-weekly email. Governing board members with questions may contact the school leader who will accurately respond to questions. Frequently Asked Questions A FAQ site is available on the Quest website under the \"Parent Resources\" then \"Distance Education\" tab. In order to provide accurate information and debunk inaccurate information so that it does not create panic or a misinformation vacuum, informational videos will be released in the weeks leading up to the school opening. Additionally , the parents on the school re-opening committee will serve as parent liaison for other families with questions and concerns. Attendance Quest will track daily attendance in its student information system, Infinite Campus. This will ensure Quest utilizes a consistent method for recording contact with students, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through Microsoft Teams, which serves as the learning management system. Each student participating full-time in distance education will be contacted via electronic means or by telephone by a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher , generally their advisory or homeroom teacher , at least once per instructional day . If a student' s confirmed lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher will record attempted contact via other means (e.g., home visit) once per week and maintain a record of attempts. Staf f will use a consistent method in a Microsoft Form for recording contact with students participating in distance education, which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through Microsoft Teams. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1) The student is physically present; and/or Page 27(2) The pupil makes progress in their classwork leading toward mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and/or a course' s completion that can be verified through a learning management system or other means; and/or (3) The pupil participates in a real-time (synchronous) class session; and/or (4) The pupil meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who is able to discuss the pupil' s progress in the course. Families may contact the main of fice of their campus if there is an attendance issue, such incorrectly marked absence. Ten consecutive unexcused absences with unknown whereabouts and no contact will result in a withdrawal from Quest. Page 28DIST ANCE LEARNING: Supporting Students Quest will ensure continuity of services, including access to necessary technology and resources, special education and EL services, and nutrition services, for students participating in distance education. Information T echnology Technology Access For any students without access to such technology , school leadership will work with families to ensure technology is accessible. Families will have to complete a form to borrow the technology for the school year . If approved, students will be provided with a hotspot and a Chromebook at no cost to the family . Parents of DL students will be able to set up their Infinite Campus Parent accounts at the beginning of the year and monitor their student' s progress and see all upcoming assignments, tests, and due dates throughout the school year . Families will receive training by a Quest staf f member on how to use the technology if needed. If technology is not working properly at any time throughout the school year , families are encouraged to contact their teacher . Families will have to return the technology at the end of the school year . Technology will have to be in good working condition. If deemed to be not in good condition, families may be required to reimburse the campus (at leadership' s discretion). If there are greater issues in technology (i.e., internet service provider shutdown, blackout, etc.), distance learning can be done through paper correspondence. Expand access to technology and internet connectivity for students, families, and educators, as well as provide accommodations for students without access to such technology . Quest will expand access to technology and internet connectivity for students, families, and education. Quest will have families complete an Information Technology Survey prior to the school year beginning to identify the need for accommodations. This will include information on devices that can be used for student learning as well as access to internet connectivity . In the Spring, Quest provided and checked out technology for all students that had a need. Families were also allowed to park in the school' s covered parking area for connection to the school wifi if connectivity was needed. Families were also given information regarding wifi access points such as libraries and the school district roving wifi busses. The school also will connect families with internet providers with school student rates. Families that have an economic hardship may contact the school for further individualized options. Resources Quest will provide resources to students and assistance and advice to parents/families so they can support students participating in distance education. Student/Family Communication Students are required to check in with their teachers each day . Whether through email, a phone call, or (video) messaging through a learning management system and/or Teams, it will count as an interaction for the day . A teacher will schedule one or more conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the student is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is presenting some problem to the teacher , or in any other case that the teacher considers necessary . This conference may be requested by indicating so on the eight-week progress report. Such conferences may be handled by telephone, in person, or via written communication If families and/or students call teachers, it has to be a viable conversation about academics to count as a present attendance mark. If not answered, a voicemail message should be recorded. A teacher will respond within 24 hours. If a student emails a teacher , the teacher will respond within 24 hours. Email communication sent on Fridays after 12:00 p.m. should expect a response by close of business on the non-holiday business day . If a student has not communicated with a staf f member for 5 days in a row , a home visit will take place. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, Page 29campus leadership, the teacher and the community outreach coordinator will work together to provide resources. Quest will provide assistance and advice to parents and families on how they can better support their child' s success and participation in distance education. Before the school year begins, families will be given informational material through emails, and required virtual Parent Training Nights. Parents and families attending distance education at Quest will be given a Parent Agreement and Acknowledgement of Responsibilities to read, review , and sign that outlines the responsibilities of all stakeholders in a successful distance education setting. Throughout the school year, the Student Support Team will continue to send out communications regarding ways to assist and support their child while learning at home. The Principal will continue to hold monthly \"Cof fee with the Principal\" meetings with parents and families and will incorporate assistance/advice to support students. Special Education and EL students Response to Intervention Quest will hold weekly Student Support Team meetings to monitor and support students' academic, social-emotional, and behavioral concerns. Teachers will continue to implement intervention sessions to their students attending classes in-person. For those who are attending classes virtually and are part of the Tier II and III groups, weekly online intervention classes will be held for those students. Special Education Support/504/EL Support The program of instruction at Quest provides appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and students with a 504 Plan. Special education students will be provided services/support in accordance with their IEPs. Parents of students whose individualized education plan (IEP) receiving services other than speech only will be contacted and given schedules for when the special education staf f will be providing for their child via Zoom or Microsoft Teams when the child is on a distance education schedule. Students' assignments may also be adjusted as an additional means to provide learning accommodations and/or modifications. Additionally , the speech therapist will work with the school registrar to identify which students receiving speech services are approved to attend classes virtually . With parent consent, the speech therapist will then provide services to those students virtually . Assessments administered by the psychologist and/or the school nurse must be done in person and by appointment. Schedules will be communicated to the parent if their child is on the list for assessment. Additionally , if an EL student is attending classes virtually . The EL teacher will provide daily video support to the student and his/her family . Supplemental packets for learning English, as well as a list of enrichment activities, will be sent home weekly so that the student and his/her family can continue to practice English skills. Nutrition Services Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school. Quest only serves lunch and breakfast to K-8 students at its campus. For virtual students to receive their lunch, the student and/or a family member will need to visit the campus during a designated lunch period set by the campus administration. The school will then provide a lunch meal. A lunch meal will be not provided to anyone arriving before or after the designated lunch period, unless at the discretion of school administration. Important Note: When picking up, stay in your vehicle. Food services will bring the meals to your vehicle. No meals will be served buf fet or family-styled. Meals will be in pre-packaged boxes or bags for each individual. Page 30The Facilities Manager will communicate with vendors to anticipate changes to menus and the necessary new food items, sanitation supplies, packaging supplies, etc. Quest Facilities will procure any equipment necessary (carts, temperature control bags, etc.) as needed for the modified meal distribution model. Staff will continue to follow cleaning protocols that have a high frequency of disinfecting of high-touch areas throughout the day . Page 31DIST ANCE LEARNING: Emergency Closur e Quest will ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event that school must be closed due to the ef fects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another major emer gency that necessitates the closure of school for at least 10 consecutive days. Emergency School Closure Learning Plan Quest recognizes that there may be emer gency situations that shut down a school for an extended period of time. Examples of emer gency situations could include, but not limited to, a pandemic, a facility issue, or a natural disaster . Quest is committed to providing a high-quality education to its students and has developed this emer gency school closure learning plan. This plan will be made available to all staf f, families, and students. This plan will succeed in delivering instruction online to meet students' elective and general education requirements. The purpose of this plan is to empower and prepare students for success by enabling them to access quality online instruction. This plan will act as a guide to improve learning and enhance student success. It is also aimed to fulfill all applicable rules, regulations, and policies stipulated by the Nevada Department of Education and the US federal government. Quest will continue to use email, Infinite Campus, and the school website for normal communications with parents, students, and teachers. This plan is developed for at least 10 consecutive days of implementation. The Emer gency School Closure Learning Plan will utilize the elements of the Distance Learning Plan for Covid-19 to include information from the previous two sections in this document and utilize the same goals. Goals 3. Provide a supportive mode of learning through distance education for all students to grow and be successful. 4. Provide equitable access to those students without access, ensure equity , and provide for students with disabilities and English learners. Education Management System Infinite Campus will continue to be used as the Student Information System (SIS). It will be the primary source of grading, attendance accounting and information distribution to students and families. Although the legal attendance requirement is 1 contact per student per week, the site is requiring teachers to take attendance daily on an Excel Sheet to address \"absent\" students on an ongoing basis. Teachers are required to enter grades at least one time per week. Primary Online Learning Platform Microsoft Teams (T eams) will be used by every teacher to relay classroom content and deliver classroom instruction. Each teacher at the beginning of the year will add all students to their Teams and have school leaders as owners of the Team. This will also allow for a quick transition for content delivery and provide access for staf f to ensure students and parents have access to all needed information. Teachers will upload videos, assignments and related information for student use as well as hold live lessons and of fice hours with Page 32Teams meetings. In addition to Microsoft Teams, teachers will continue to use Into Math, CKLA, MyPerspectives, Discovery Education, Smarty Ants, Achieve 3000, Dreambox, MobyMax, and various software that was previously implemented for classroom use. Microsoft Teams is the teleconference method being used by teachers for classroom instruction. Student Materials, T echnology , Supplies Distribution A student survey will be delivered to families to determine technology needs at the start of each school year. Chromebooks will then be distributed to families at a time, date, and location, which will be communicated right away to families when an emer gency closure is announced. Additional supplies will also be distributed for select classes during this time. Additional Outreach Emails will be sent weekly with details regarding drive-through lunch options for students. Quest will work with its vendor to deliver types of meals (hot, cold, etc.) that best serves its students during that time. Academic Progress T racking The Student Support Team created a Google Form for staff to report students who are disengaged or not showing progress in specific courses. The Student Support Team then reaches out and develops action plans for getting students back on track. Staff Communication The administration has created Microsoft Teams for staff, action teams, and PLCs chat groups for specialized administration and colleague support. Action teams, PLCs, and all staf f Teams meetings are scheduled weekly as well as emer gency staf f meetings when necessary . How-to videos for curriculum, lesson planning, grading, and other web-based programming are provided or created as needs are expressed by teachers. School Leaders are included as teachers/owners on all Microsoft Teams to aid in student learning when needed. Teachers are required to contact parents via email or video conference call as an additional means of communication with students and parents. Weekly Department and Staf f Meetings are held via Google Meet or Zoom. Principals will join weekly planning meetings scheduled by the Central Office and SPCSA and update their staf f accordingly . A tech team has been established that allows teachers to reach out with any instructional technology questions they may have. Attendance The Administrative team created attendance tracking sheets where teachers enter attendance as they interact with students. Initially , teachers will reach out to the families if the students do not check-in or turn in their assignments. After some attempts, if the issue continues, teachers will inform administrators. The administration will reach out to families whose child(ren) does not check-in by Wednesdays. Registrars enter attendance for the school by the end of Friday for each week and submit a detailed list to the Student Support Director and Principal for further reporting. Special Education Program The Special Education Department within Quest recognizes the unique needs, strengths, and challenges of each of its special education students and families. In our attempt to provide the best-individualized plan of specialized instruction during this situation, we strive to consider factors that hinder inclusion, accessibility , and Page 33equity such as technology , family socio-economics, language and culture, and parental obligations outside of the home. Therefore, a multimodal approach to student and family support has been put into place. Initial Preparation Prior to the transition to online instruction, in anticipation of the need to fully move to online instruction, all special education teachers were provided with an introductory training to online instruction that included modes of communication and instruction, asynchronous vs synchronous instruction, preventing miscommunication within the virtual environment, and tips for online classroom management. Primary Online Platforms Microsoft Teams Into Math CKLA and MyPerspectives Discovery Education Smarty Ants/Achieve 3000 Dreambox Site-specific supplemental platforms Practical Issues IT facilities and support - especially if running state-wide modules & work across parent/guardian schedules may require tutor flexibility Some functionality is impaired on mobile devices Institutional usernames and passwords to access all platforms Upkeep of system - maintaining links etc. Monitoring student engagement Requires a similar amount of tutor time Special Education Specific Progress Monitoring Systems Paraprofessionals and Supports Virtual and Related Services and Coordination A Dedicated Special Education Person to Monitor Student Progress & Report to Team Related Service Providers Related Services Related Service providers will continue to provide related services using online learning platforms, for the seamless continuation of face to face service delivery , when the student and parent have access to the required technology . For parents who do not have the required technology for electronic service provision, related service providers will make weekly contact with the parent to of fer continued support such a recommended strategies to implement at home, connecting parents to helpful resources, and gathering information which may be beneficial for the case manager and/or special education staf f to know in order to support the student in their virtual classroom environment through modification and accommodations. Related Service Providers will maintain a weekly log of services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which Page 34communication was made. Further , qualitative information will be included to alert Quest special education administration to ongoing concerns or themes which need support. A special education administrative staff with Quest will collect weekly records of communication between the related service providers, students, and parents, and determine areas that need further support, based on the data. Special Education T eacher Each special education teacher will provide pull out service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, Microsoft teams, supplemental online options, and progress monitoring to ensure work towards IEP goals. Special Education teachers will be available from 8:00 am - 3:00 pm Monday to Friday . Each teacher will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar classroom. This schedule will be communicated individually with parents/guardians and students. A flexible option will also be available. Special education teachers will monitor student progress, attendance, and assignment completion. Special education teachers will maintain a weekly log of services provided, communication made or attempted, and medium by which communication was made.

A special education administrative staf f with Quest. Paraprofessionals Paraprofessionals and their assigned case managers will be in contact throughout the week, in order to plan and provide the support required for the student and their family to meet the week' s objectives. An initial learning objective will be established for each new week, as co-designed by the case manager , student, and parent. This learning objective will be communicated with the paraprofessionals, who with the case manager , will develop a plan of action on how to measurably support the student within and outside of special education instruction, to include preparation of materials, modifying assignments, pre and reteaching, and the electronic dissemination and collection of materials. Each paraprofessional will provide push-in service minutes using asynchronous Classes and synchronous Classes, monitoring and assisting with general education Microsoft Team classrooms, student support, and supplemental online options. Paraprofessionals will be available from 9:00 am - 3:00 pm Monday to Friday . Each paraprofessional will set a schedule similar to that found in their brick and mortar school. This schedule will be communicated individually by both the paraprofessional and special education teacher to parents/guardians and students. A flexible option will also be available. Instruction Special education support services are provided by both synchronous and asynchronous methods. Online learning platforms in use include Google Classroom and Zoom. Other methods of instruction and communication include Skype, FaceT ime, email, and telephone. Teachers and support staff are required to be available between the hours of 8 am-3 pm during the school day , and as otherwise scheduled by the parent and teacher . Direct instruction is provided to address the previously designated areas of eligibility , as well as the support provided through push-in services, the modification of general education assignments, and ongoing accommodations. Special education teachers are in weekly contact with the general education classroom teachers to provide continued collaboration and planning. Parent/Guardian Communication Parents were individually contacted by their case managers or a campus-based special education representative with a cursory description of what to expect over the coming weeks, the opportunity to schedule a phone call for Page 35Q&A, and methods by which parents could contact their campus support person. Additionally , parents were further queried as to their digital savvy and accessibility . Progress Monitoring The Quest special education teacher will be designated as the individual responsible for collecting weekly progress monitoring, comparing the data against the student' s goals, and ensuring that intervention decision making reflects the needs based on the data. This individual will also provide any necessary professional development, coaching, or other support to teachers, with best practices for designing ef fective and ef ficient progress monitoring tools within the virtual learning environment. Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) All annual IEP meetings will be held using GoT oMeeting and scheduled by the case manager . Each family will have the option to sign electronic permission to share documentation if they would like documents shared via email. All required documentation will be sent via US Postal Service. Student-Specific Decision Making Parents will be contacted weekly to determine student-specific needs. An IEP team meeting will be scheduled for any discussion impacting the IEP or change in services or placement. Based on student and parent needs, strengths, and accessibility , examples of instruction may include: *Asynchronous Microsoft Team session between staf f, parent, and student, whereby a specific skill is targeted and remediated through evidenced-based activities, such as phonological awareness exercises that tar get rhyming, blending, and so forth. *An individual activity in which the parent can supervise the student in independently completing several worksheets in a skill area in which the student was close to the tar get. *Hands-on materials, created by school staf f or by parents in coordination with school staf f, whereby the student can exercise practicing a new skill in math or sentence construction with parents submitting photos of the finished product.

Cyberbullying: the use of electronic communication to bully a person including sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. Quest will engage parents and families regarding the importance of attendance in a distance education setting in a variety of ways. Before the school year begins, families will be given informational material through emails, Facebook Live, and phone calls to discuss the importance of attendance. Parents and families who are attending school via distance education will be given a Parent Agreement and Acknowledgement of Responsibilities to read, review , and sign. This agreement outlines the responsibilities of all stakeholders in a successful distance education setting. Throughout the school year , office staff will continue to send out communications regarding the importance of attendance while learning at home. What should you do if you're being bullied? Do not respond to harassment or threats--this may encourage the bully . Keep a record of messages received (print or take screenshots). Reach out to parents, teachers, counselors, and school administrators. Block communication from the bully (if possible). Do not participate in cyberbullying (even in response to a bully). Ask for help if you are being cyberbullied. Stand up if you see somebody being cyberbullied Page 38APPENDIX A: Medical Exemption Form Quest Academy: High Risk Exemption Form Page 1 - Information If a student or an individual has a high-risk medical condition*, a Medical Certification for COVID-19 High Risk Exemption Form may be completed in order to participate in distance online learning at home for the 2021-2022 school year . Students who are out on a high-risk medical exemption may not participate in any in-person learning, face-to-face extracurricular or on-campus activities, including field trips, competitions, and athletics (as a participant or spectator without prior approval). This is because it would open them up to possible exposure to COVID-19, just as being in the classroom on campus would. Once approved for distance learning, students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning at the end of each quarter - which will be determined on a case-by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. Distance learning will consist of your student working individually on assigned work through dif ferent learning platforms, such as Microsoft Teams, Ed Learning (Into Math), Discovery Education, and MyPerspectives. Students will check in daily with their teacher for progress check-ins, checking for understanding of the lessons, academic goal setting, assessment preparation, etc. *Those individuals who ar e at higher risk of sever e illness, as designated by the Centers for Disease Contr ol (CDC), ar e those with conditions including, but not limited to, asthma, chr onic lung disease, compr omised immune systems (including fr om smoking, cancer tr eatment, bone marr ow or or gan transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly contr olled HIV or AIDS, or use of corticoster oids or other immune weakening medications), diabetes, serious heart disease (including heart failur e, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and hypertension), chr onic kidney disease under going dialysis, or liver disease.

Students must request for help when needed, establish a schedule for learning and completing tasks, and take responsibility for meeting deadlines. 2. Parent/Guardian: Parents are critical for their child' s successful participation in the online/distance learning setting. This includes providing a suitable learning environment, encouragement, and appropriate level of assistance with the subject content when possible. Parents have access to many aspects of the school, including grades. It is expected that parents monitor their child' s academic activities daily through direct supervision. Parents must also maintain weekly contact with teachers, returning any calls/text/emails within 24 hours. Middle School (6-8) 1. Student: Students are primarily responsible for their learning. They must take the initiative to log in to the school-assigned portal, participate in live discussions or discussion boards on Microsoft Teams, and complete their work at the highest possible level of quality . Students must request for help when needed, establish a schedule for learning and completing tasks, and take responsibility for meeting deadlines. 2. Parent/Guardian: Parents are critical for their child' s successful participation in the online/distance learning setting. They are responsible for their student and for providing support for their student' s learning. This includes providing a suitable learning environment, encouragement, and appropriate level of assistance with the subject content when possible. Parents have access to many aspects of the school, including grades and participation reports. It is expected that parents monitor their child' s academic activities daily through direct supervision. Parents must also maintain weekly contact with teachers, returning any calls/text/emails within 24 hours. Parent Responsibilities Attendance is taken each time the student logs in online in the approved Microsoft Teams platform. The parent shall be responsible for their child' s school attendance as required by law . Quest Preparatory Academy' s school Policy states that \"In order to receive credit for the term, 90% attendance is required in each assigned class\". If the student is absent for any reason, parents must ensure that the child completes make-up assignments for all absences from their teachers upon return to their online academic program. If a student has excessive absences of more than 9 days, the parent will be notified and will be responsible to appear before the Student Support Team for an attendance review in order to provide information relating to their child' s absences and to support prescribed activities. Page 41Monitoring Student' s Assignments and Assessments In lieu of the daily presence of a face-to-face teacher , parents should take the lead in guiding their students through the curriculum, submission of work/assignments, online class sessions, producing projects, reviewing for quizzes and tests, as well as making sure that they participate in the school-wide and state tests. Appr opriate Devices for Learning Parents who opt to have their child attend Quest as a full time distance education student must ensure that their student is equipped with the appropriate learning device. Cellular phones are not permitted. Tablets, iPads, laptops or Chromebooks may be used for as long as they are able to connect to the internet. Devices must also be able to produce audio output at an appropriate volume as some lessons require students to watch and/or listen to their teacher or an audio or video. Quest will check out devices to students whose parents agree and sign the Acceptable Use Agreement for Quest devices. Quest will work with families regarding securing internet service to ensure student access. Parent/Legal Guardian and Learning Coach Identification Identification of parent/legal guardian must be confirmed when student information is discussed. The parent/legal guardian must be present and produce identification for activities involving enrollment, withdrawals, and change of address/contact information. Only the parent/legal guardian who enrolls the student may withdraw or transfer the student. A learning coach, or a person that supports the individual' s learning while in the distance education setting, is usually the parent/legal guardian. Any person identified as the student' s learning coach that is not the student' s parent/legal guardian must have a Permission for Release of Records and/or Information from Records signed by parent and learning coach authorizing Quest Preparatory Academy to discuss the student' s information with the learning coach. Student Identification Full-time distance education students will be scheduled to come to school in person to be photographed for a picture identification. This will be used for identification during assessments, various meetings, and inclusion in the school yearbook. Student Responsibilities The goal of every child should be that of a \"model student\". A model student is expected to be present at school each and every day , follow class expectations, and demonstrate appropriate behavior and a readiness to learn. This includes getting ready for school each day . The student will adhere to Quest dress code with Quest polos and Quest spirit shirts during live Microsoft Teams video. Bottoms do not need to be uniform but must wear bottoms appropriate for a school setting. Attendance Regular participation in classes is critical to student success. This will help to keep students motivated and keep them in touch with their teachers and peers. Virtual attendance is taken each school day in two ways: all students must sign in to the attendance portal daily befor e noon. Attendance in online subject/class portals, submissions of assignments/tasks, and assessments are also monitored. Students must log in to their Page 42subject/class portals for substantive participation daily . Teachers and/or administration will contact students by email and phone if they do not appear to be engaging frequently or making satisfactory progress in their classes. If such ef forts do not succeed in re-engaging the student, the parent will be notified in writing of a meeting with the Student Support Team and may receive a visit from the counselor , administrator or law enforcement (NRS 392.144). To have satisfactory \"attendance\" in a distance education setting, work must be submitted weekly and daily login to the attendance portal is expected. Arrangements for planned absences must be made in advance and must be approved by administration at least a week prior . Proof may also be required for absences due to emer gency . Excused/Unexcused School and Class Absences and Tardiness Reasons for excused/unexcused absences and tardiness in the distance setting are the same as those in the brick-and-mortar setting. Proper documentation/proof and/or required advanced written permission must be obtained or provided to the school. Truancy A pupil shall be deemed a truant who is absent from school without the written approval of the pupil' s teacher or the principal of the school, unless the pupil is physically or mentally unable to attend school. The teacher or principal shall give his or her written approval for a pupil to be absent if an emer gency exists or upon the request of a parent or legal guardian of the pupil (NRS 392.130(1)). Any child who has been declared a truant three or more times within one school year must be declared a habitual truant (NRS 392.140(1)). Truancy refers to student's' unexcused absences from school. Any school absence - excused or unexcused - as well as missed classes can af fect students negatively . Truancy af fects students of all ages, and costs students more than their education; it costs them their future. Students with excessive absences will not meet the requirements of this program and will be recommended to transfer out of the full distance learning environment. The following steps will be taken to ensure the truancy issue is rectified: 1. Written Notice to Parents After a student has had a minimum of five (5) unexcused absences within a calendar month, or ten (10) absences within 90 calendar days, the parents will be advised in writing of the unsatisfactory absences and the teacher/counselor may begin to process the truancy referral. After 15 unexcused absences within a 90 calendar day period (3 consecutive months), the school principal or designee will provide a written notice to the student' s parent to request their attendance at a Truancy Meeting with the Student Support Team to discuss the attendance problem and identify potential remedies. 2. Truancy Meeting with the Student Support Team and Report The Student Support Team will hold a Truancy Meeting with the parent on the date designated in the TM-SST notification. The purpose of this TM-SST is to: a. Discuss the reason(s) for the student' s absences; b. Identify and recommend potential remedies/interventions including to transferring out of full-time distance education learning; c. Advise parents that the student' s absences may result in a complaint of truancy to be filed with the Clark County Juvenile Justice Services through a referral to a social service agency (i.e. CPS). Page 43d. The principal or designee will ask the parent to sign the TM-SST report. Students who are aware that they will not be able to participate in distance education due to travel or other commitment must be on or ahead of pace and notify their teachers and the school of fice at least two weeks in advance of the planned absence, and discuss the completion of assignments and pacing beforehand. In the case of prolonged emer gency absence, the student and/or parent should notify the school administration as soon as possible. Parents may be required to provide notarized documentation when warranted. Academic Integrity Quest expects a full commitment to academic integrity from each Quest student. More information on academic integrity can be found on the Quest Family Handbook. Student Contact and Disenr ollment Policy Only through continuous communication can students be successful in a distance education environment. It is essential that the student and teacher maintain regular contact. At any point during enrollment, students may be disenrolled if there is no communication with an assigned teacher(s) for 10 consecutive days and may be disenrolled from Quest. To ensure that our students are aware of this commitment, the three-part process below will be followed: 1) If the student does not submit the expected number of assignment(s) within a period of five (5) consecutive days, the student and parent(s) will receive an electronic letter notifying them of the student's unacceptable pace for submitting assignments. 2) If the student does not respond to the letter by submitting the appropriate number of assignments within five (5) days, the teacher(s) will make a telephone call to the student/parent(s). 3) If the student does not respond by submitting all required assignments within fourteen (14) days of the initial letter , Quest will assume that the student does not intend to remain in the distance education setting, and the student will be administratively disenrolled. Once a student is transferred out of the full distance education setting, transferring back to the full distance education setting may not take place until the student demonstrates consistency in all subjects while in the regular classroom setting or is required due to Covid-19 directives . Case by case evaluation is conducted. It is the responsibility of the student/parent to be informed of Quest Preparatory Academy' s Family Handbook policies. The Quest Family Handbook can be accessed at https://www .questlv .com/quest-family-handbook.html Full Time Distance Education Student Expectation Summary Because of distance education' s unique nature, students must take primary responsibility for their own learning. Self-motivation, dedication to learning, daily submission of work, and communication are essential. It is the student who determines his or her own level of success. Students must expect deadlines for their work and expect to work hard, but at their own pace within the set guidelines. They will log in for attendance to the school each day and will respond to teachers' questions and prompts as they work through dif ferent classes. They'll use discussion boards and other communication tools to work with teachers and other students. These tools, which may have been used for social purposes, will be used for genuine academic communication to support learning goals. Students are expected to work to receive grades/credits required to move up to the next grade level. To remain as a full time distance education student at Quest, a student must earn grades of C or higher in each subject, maintain consistent pacing in every class, communicate successfully with teachers, and participate in all standardized and school-wide assessments. Those who fail to meet the minimum continuation Page 44requirements will be referred to the Student Support Team to discuss their educational goals in an educational setting better suited to their learning style. Time and Learning Requir ements The amount of time students spend on courses will vary from student to student, and even subject to subject. However , students will have the time they need to complete the assignments/tasks (within reason). On average, students should expect to approximately spend the following minutes per subject: Minutes Per Day (Synchronous and Asynchronous) Subject Elementary Middle ELA 120 min. 70 min. Math 90 min. 70 min. Science 30 min. 45 min. Social Studies 30 min. 45 min. Other 15 min. 15 min. School Calendar All academic subjects must be completed by the end of the school year . Full time distance education at Quest adheres to the school calendar established by Quest Preparatory Academy . Those failing to earn the necessary credits/grades for grade promotion will be assessed and may be referred to be transferred out of the full distance education program, and/or may be referred for grade level retention. Academic Counseling Quest' s full time distance education students and/or their parents may view their grades on Infinite Campus. Quest' s counselors are available to support, encourage and help monitor the success of our full time distance education students. Although any questions about the specifics of a subject should be directed to the particular teacher , any general questions about the school or the student' s education may be redirected to the guidance counselor . Guidance counselors may also contact the student and their parent for other referrals such as truancy or failing grades. Proctor ed Assessments For security and test validity purposes, Quest reserves the right to ask any full time distance education student to complete an exam at the school campus. Exemptions/special arrangements will be made for students who are sick or on quarantine. Quest shall ensure that safety and disinfecting protocols are followed before, during and after the student' s arrival/departure.

In-person instruction following social distancing protocols; 2. Distance education under an approved Path Forward Program of Distance Education; or 3. A combination of distance education and in-person instruction. Reopening plans must be based on Nevada's Path Forward: A Framework for a Safe, Efficient, and Equitable Return to School Buildings and include a Path Forward Program of Distance Education1 in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth by the Nevada Department of Education (NDE). With an understanding that developing a reopening plan is complex and time intensive, the State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) has developed an optional reopening plan template which covers the topics outlined in NDE's minimum requirements and the Path Forward Framework. This document should be seen as a resource for schools and not a mandate. Whether schools decide to use this template or develop their own, the topics and guiding questions can serve as a tool for ensuring a comprehensive plan.

It has been updated and modified to reflect a plan moving forward to reopen in-person for the school year 2021-2022. Plans and edits have been made by SSMCS' Reopening Committee based on new guidance from the State, and new resources from the County and Federal health and safety agencies. The Reopening Committee reviewed the school's prior reopening plan and with the new guidance and information from the State and its directive to refer to County and Federal health and safety agencies for direction. The goal is to help drive decisions and plans to move forward. The top priority of the Committee has always been the health and safety of the school community, students, and staff who are in the building. Next, and also of great importance, is the academic and social growth and well-being of our students. With those priorities at the forefront, the Committee formulated the following goal to drive this Plan to Move Forward: Make cautious but definite steps forward to support and assist our struggling students, whether dealing with academics or social-emotional needs, in an environment that uses mitigation strategies recommended by the State/County and CDC guidelines to help ensure a safe delivery of in-person learning and support. 6 Silver Sands Montessori Reopening Plan School Name: Silver Sands Montessori Charter School SCHOOL REOPENING TEAM: Keya Bromberg, SSMCS Middle School Teacher Dennis Burke, SSMCS Support Teacher Mayumi Coffman, Parent & SSMCS Board Member Erica Gingrich, SSMCS School FASA Kim Hodge, SSMCS Special Programs Administrator Kristofor Jacobson, SSMCS Board President Rebecca Maneilly, Parent & SSMCS Danette Olmos-Green, SSMCS Sheila Palombo, Seeley, SSMCS Lower Elementary Teacher Jonathan Valencia, SSMCS Assistant Principal Laura Yavitz, SSMCS Parent Results from surveys sent to all parents and staff were also used to assist the committee in planning and decision-making. 7 COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION How will you communicate important information to families about the SY2021-22 Plan to Move Forward?

Teachers will provide a schedule for virtual instruction (*Full details on pg. 21 under Full Distance Learning Plan) Students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials Students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials will be provided links for recorded lessons and teachers will have packets put together along with a Google Meet time to check-in. PHYSICAL HEALTH SCREENING How will you screen staff and students? How will you screen staff and students? Staff, students, parents and visitors are asked to self-screen and not come to school or enter the building if they show signs of COVID-19 or have been in known contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. 9 In alignment with CDC guidance, we will implement several strategies to prepare for when someone gets sick. SSMCS will follow CDC, state and local guidance for screening, and will adjust as necessary for changing local conditions. CDC guidance includes the following: Advise Staff and Families of Sick Students of Home Isolation Criteria Sick staff members or students should not return until they have met CDC's criteria to discontinue home isolation. Isolate and Transport Those Who are Sick Make sure that staff and families know that they (staff) or their children (families) should not come to school, and that they should notify school officials (e.g., the designated COVID-19 point of contact) if they (staff) or their child (families) become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. Immediately separate staff and children with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath) at school. Individuals who are sick should go home or to a healthcare facility depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for oneself and others who are sick. Work with school administrators, nurses, and other healthcare providers to identify an isolation room or area to separate anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms or tests positive but does not have symptoms. School nurses and other healthcare providers should use Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for sick people. (See: What Healthcare Personnel Should Know About Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection.) Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone who is sick to their home or to a healthcare facility. If you are calling an ambulance or bringing someone to the hospital, try to call first to alert them that the person may have COVID-19. Clean and Disinfect Close off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting. Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing products securely away from children. Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts In accordance with state and local laws and regulations, school administrators should notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Contact Tracing - Inform those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. 10 PHYSICAL HYGIENE How will you address and reinforce hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette? How will face coverings be used? Please refer to Emergency Directive 024 and the associated guidance which outline the requirements for face coverings. How will you address and reinforce hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette? How will face coverings be used?

Hand Hygiene: Hand Sanitizing stations in each class: Gallon-sized units of hand sanitizer have been purchased to be of use in each classroom (1 per room). Each classroom to designate an area to be used for hand sanitization. A freestanding sanitization station will be placed in/near the main office as that area has the majority of overlapping traffic. A second freestanding sanitization station will be purchased for the 2nd floor use. Friendly, informative visual signage on restrooms walls showing best handwashing practices and indicating for how long to effectively wash. The number of persons using a restroom facility at one time is limited to the number of sinks available per location. Respiratory Etiquette: Air Purifiers added in all rooms. Follow mask guidelines for all students, staff and visitors (see Health and Safety). Disposable masks on hand: Disposable masks are readily available for children and adults to be used in the event one forgets to wear his/her mask. Disposable gloves available; use is encouraged. SOCIAL DISTANCING How will you maintain social distancing in line with the Path Forward Framework, Governor's Emergency Directives, and Nevada Department of Education guidance? How will you transition as necessary when the prevailing guidance shifts in response to public health conditions? How will you maintain social distancing in line with the Path Forward Framework, Governor's Emergency Directives, and Nevada Department of Education guidance? Classroom Social Distancing: Removal of communal storage for supplies and water bottles. Each student will house their water bottle, and school day materials in their cubbies and drawers. Students will be assigned a mat for them to clean regularly (weekly). As much as possible, the center of the room will be an open area for students to work. All interior doors will be propped open to limit high touch areas, for instance upstairs classroom doors and downstairs doors interior leading to classroom areas. All exterior doors are to remain closed. Increased signage for social distancing and personal hygiene. The number of persons using a restroom facility at one time is limited to the number of sinks available per location. Each location will have a sign outside each restroom indicating the number of sink stations. 11 How will you transition as necessary when the prevailing guidance shifts in response to public health conditions? Shifts Incurred by Public Health Changes: This is a working document, setting forth broad parameters which will/can be adjusted to fit needs and community changes as required. We are following the Governor's Office, CDC | SNHD, and Clark County directives and protocols, understanding that this is a living document privy to immediate change and designed for fluid usability. HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF RETURN TO WORK How will staff return to work? How will you address circumstances where staff are not comfortable returning to work or are identified as \"vulnerable populations\"? How will you prepare for the possibility of increased staff absences due to illness and ensure that staff who are sick are able to stay home? How will you address circumstances where staff are identified as \"vulnerable populations\"? Accommodations for vulnerable staff populations will be examined and we will look for possible options such as physical barriers, and PPE. How will your staffing approach ensure strong implementation of your overall reopening approach? Staff will have 6 days prior to opening to receive training as well as collaborative meetings as an entire staff and also as grade level groups to plan for the upcoming school year. How will you prepare for the possibility of increased staff absences due to illness and ensure that staff who are sick are able to stay home? We will look to create a pool of licensed substitute staff. Reach out to Universities (Education departments) to create a substitute pool in the event of staff illness. GOVERNING BODY AND SCHOOL LEADERSHIP ROLE How will you share consistent and up-to-date information with your governing body and school leadership? How and to what extent will the governing body and school leadership weigh in on key decisions?

The priority of SSMCS will be to maintain a safe environment for the health and safety of students and staff. The committee agreed that a layered protection and regular evaluation of the program is key to maintaining that safety. Layered protection 1) Masks- mask guidelines a. Staff - optional mask if vaccinated (provide a copy for confidential files) b. Students - K-3 optional mask; for grades 4-8 mask is mandatory unless proof of vaccination is provided or obtained via WEB-IZ. When working in smaller groups, students may be asked to use a mask depending on activities, social distancing and local mitigation levels. c. Contractors (e.g., OTs) - masks required with/without vaccination card and social distancing when working with students; sanitize areas between students. d. Visitors - all visitors must sign in AND out and stay in a limited area. i. Short visit - mask required for visitors with/without vaccination card; limit time in building to 15 minutes or less, if possible ii. Long visit- mask required for visitor with/without vaccination card 2) Vaccination status - vaccination encouraged; staff and student vaccination status recorded in confidential files 3) Use of space - distancing; use of designated exterior doors & upper central doors by group; controlled access to building (checking in); designated pathways to move outside for outdoor activities 4) Handling classroom materials - teach proper handling and cleaning of materials; individual supplies where feasible 5) Handwashing & respiratory etiquette - do and teach 6) Enhanced Cleaning - we will continue sanitizing the building on a weekly basis plus add a day porter to clean midday any high-touch areas such as doors and restrooms 7) Contact tracing - SSMCS will continue following recommendations of SNHD for contact tracing and report as required 8) Cohorting - by classroom levels reviewed quarterly or as needed based on mitigation levels and recommendations; cohorting retained at recess & lunch in classrooms 9) Isolation room - students showing symptoms of COVID will be moved to the isolation room to be further assessed and tested (with parent permission) while waiting for parent/guardian to pick up 10) Encourage staying home if sick - sending reminders and guidelines for parents and staff when feeling sick. Quarterly review - Schedule quarterly reviews to adjust policies & procedures in response to changing local circumstances and guidance. SSMCS will follow CDC recommendations when possible regarding social distancing and use of cohorts depending on mitigation levels in Clark County. For middle school, Mitigation Levels will be assessed at the quarter in order to determine if students will be moving from class to class, or if teachers will move in order to maintain the cohorts and limit possible transmission to other grade level cohorts. FACILITIES MANAGEMENT What adjustments will be made to the facility or use of the facility to support your reopening plan and to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19? How and how frequently will you clean and sanitize various parts of the facility to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19? 13 What adjustments will be made to the facility or use of the facility to support your reopening plan and to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19? Adjustments to the facility - Before/after school activities or clubs at this time will be assessed and determined based on mitigation levels. The goal for Fall 2021 is to provide Before & After Care. (Procedures outlined p. 16) Upper Elementary & Middle School to refrain from using central entryway upon arrival: UE to use the left-facing door (closest to their classrooms), MS to use the right-facing door Isolation Room designated in the upstairs Women's restroom (pending approval). The Staff Men's restroom will become a unisex restroom. Specials - Teachers will rotate instead of having classes rotate if necessary due to review of local mitigation levels; this will be reviewed quarterly. Recess protocols and use of the outdoor equipment still TBD Parent Volunteers will not be allowed at this time to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19. Visitors to the building will be limited to 15 minutes or less, if possible, and visitors will require a mask when in the building. Protocols for picking up children outside of the regular pickup schedule will need to be evaluated. All visitors will be screened and asked the Covid-19 screening questions prior to entering the building (Signage). General rooms (classrooms, library, multipurpose room, and computer labs) to be used. How and how frequently will you clean and sanitize various parts of the facility to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19? Cleaning/Sanitization for Classrooms: Per CDC recommendations, classroom materials will be cleaned. Tables to be wiped routinely: before/after school day as well as before and after snack & lunch. Portable, high efficiency air purifiers will be placed in the classrooms being used, and other widely shared spaces. School/Widely Shared Spaces: Day porter to come in mid-day on days students are present to clean and sanitize the restrooms and drinking fountains. Markers placed on floors at heavy-traffic areas (both front entrances, water fountain, front desk, etc.). Drinking fountains to be used to refill water bottles only - students must bring water bottles. Water bottle filling stations may be used but students may not remove masks and drink from the fountains. TRANSPORTATION/ARRIVAL & DISMISSAL How will the school adjust arrival and dismissal to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19? If the school provides transportation, what changes will be made to ensure social distancing, proper cleaning and sanitation, and overall mitigation of the risk of spreading COVID-19? Before Care Arrivals The program will need further evaluation to determine best practices if mitigation levels are increased. Additional screening may be necessary if mixing of cohorts is necessary. 14 Students, currently estimated to be under 25 children, will arrive with a parent or guardian for Before Care services. These services will commence at 7:00am Monday through Friday. Space will be limited depending on room usage. A hand sanitizing station will be located outside the Before Care area. The parent/guardian and their child(ren) will be required to use this station before entering the area. Before Care staff will also ensure that each child has the proper PPE as mandated. Sign-in for Before Care will be located as close as possible to the outer door and parent/guardian will be asked the COVID screening questions prior to entering the room and/or additional screening may be required. No outside food will be consumed while attending Before Care. Children may use their pre-filled water bottles. Prior to the children being released to their classrooms at 8:00am, there will be an expectation that each child wipes down their table and/or chair with a sanitizing wipe. Exit from Before Bare shall take place via the outer balcony door. Before Care staff will be responsible for wiping down additional high-touch areas. How will the school adjust arrival and dismissal to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19? Hand sanitizer stations will be placed at main entrances for use before entering the school building. Students will enter their classroom at their designated entrance door. Students will follow classroom procedures for entering the classroom.

ACADEMICS - Path Forward Plan of Distance Education (required for all schools not already approved by the Nevada Department of Education to provide full-time distance education to 100% of students) IN-PERSON LEARNING: Accelerating Student Learning How will the school address the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn, including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, effectively using data, and addressing resource 18 inequities? How will the school address the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn, including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, effectively using data, and addressing resource inequities? The goal for SSMCS is to identify students who would need additional support. We would utilize after school hours two times per week to implement the intervention plan for those students. The benchmark assessments will take place in the fall, winter and spring. Following each benchmark assessment, the data will be collected and then teachers and administration will meet to determine which students will require additional educational support due to gaps in learning. Once the interventions are developed and implemented, there will be weekly teacher-based team meetings to discuss and analyze the progress monitoring data to determine how students are responding to the interventions. There will be a strategic approach that will include utilizing EasyCBM and Imagine Learning Math to monitor students receiving RTI. Based on the results from EasyCBM and Imagine Learning Math assessments along with the progress monitoring data, adjustments will be made so that the individual learning needs will be met for students. DISTANCE EDUCATION: INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACH FOR EMERGENCY CLOSURE How will the school ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event that school must be closed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another major emergency that necessitates the closure of school? How will instruction be provided to students (describe synchronous and asynchronous approaches, as applicable)? What accommodations will be provided to students without access to technology, which may include distance education through paper correspondence? How will the school ensure that students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials have access to distance education? How will the school ensure that a teacher attempts to contact each student via electronic means or by telephone at least once per day?

How will the school ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event that school must be closed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another major emergency that necessitates the closure of school? The lessons will follow the Nevada Common Core Standards along with Montessori Philosophy. Videos of the lessons will be created so that students can watch if they were not able to attend the live virtual lessons. At the Kindergarten and Lower Elementary grade levels, ClassDojo will be used to communicate with families to update about changes in instructional practices or update any building information. Upper Elementary and Middle School will utilize Google Classroom and email to communicate with families to update about changes in instructional practices or update any building information. In addition, virtual lessons, videos, and packets are prepared as needed. Teachers will contact families weekly to check on the Social and Emotional well-being of each family. There will be regular communication between administration and teaching staff about the well-being of the families. ZOOM and Google Hangouts will be used for more individualized lessons, interventions, or check-ins with students. How will instruction be provided to students (describe synchronous and asynchronous approaches, as applicable)? The goal of SSMCS is to continue meeting the Nevada Academic Content Standards using the Montessori Philosophy and materials. We will now be using a blended remote approach for our students (synchronous/ asynchronous). It is intended to engage the students in a learning process that will both interest them and extend their learning. Our 19 teachers are expected to review student work, and provide feedback and guidance. SSMCS will adjust their schedule to accommodate all the teachers to have their prep period either at the beginning or the end of each day to meet the needs of distance learners. Full Distance Learning Plan- This is an option we are offering to our families who have students with documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in person. Each case will require approval from the Administration. All students would still participate in the learning of new material, graded assignments, and assessments, and receive paper packets and some hands-on learning materials, and include pre-recorded instructional lessons and video conference classroom meetings. This option would also be enacted if the Governor's Executive Order closed schools again due to health concerns. Distant learners will receive direct instruction through pre-recorded instructional videos, and/or scheduled conference Zoom meetings. Each student will continue with his/her progression and mastery of concepts of all of the standards: Reading, Math, Science, and Social Studies. SSMCS will continue to provide as many Montessori resources as possible and will supplement lessons with individual learning packets, lessons via Google Classroom, Zoom, online lessons, and any other pertinent means of instruction. As usual, each student's skills, needs, and support will be taken into consideration. We understand that this requires a great deal of time and effort from parents and caregivers, and we will be attentive to those complications and worries. What accommodations will be provided to students without access to technology, which may include distance education through paper correspondence? Students needing internet-ready devices will be able to check out a school Chromebook. For families that do not have internet access, we recommend contacting the school for assistance in accessing relevant education-supporting programs available. How will the school ensure that students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials have access to distance education? Students who are quarantined will also, as available, be able to check out a school Chromebook. A designated pickup station will be made available. How will the school ensure that a teacher attempts to contact each student via electronic means or by telephone at least once per day? Teachers will be required to keep a daily communication log in Infinite Campus to be reviewed weekly by the admin team. How will teachers be accessible to students through the internet or by phone during the school's regular instructional hours? Teachers will establish regular office hours where students and/or parents can ask questions or receive help weekly. Updates and important information will continue to be provided by the school and teachers via email to parents and students, and parents and students can email teachers with questions as needed. 20 MEETING STUDENT NEEDS In Distance Learning: How will the school ensure continuity of services, including access to necessary technology and resources, special education and EL services, and nutrition services, for students participating in distance education.

Teachers will also send updates on the learning in their classroom. SSMCS will continue with \"climate\" surveys and then follow up to meet the needs and concerns of our families. During distance education in middle school, families will have a designated teacher as their main point of contact. This will be their student's 1st period teacher. This teacher will be responsible for contacting each family in that class, educating and providing guidance technology assistance and instructional practices during distance education. During distance education, all classrooms will provide instruction on a fixed schedule of Zoom and/or Google Classroom meetings to ensure classroom routine & structure, sound allocation of time set aside for instruction, and an optimal use of the building's bandwidth averting streaming overloads. All families will be privy to their student(s)' classroom's Zoom schedule.

We will ensure that custodial services regularly change air filters and clean air ducts. Contact tracing Somerset Academy will follow all contact tracing protocols set forth by the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) and/or CDC. Social Distancing Social Distancing protocols will be conducted in compliance with CDC, SNHD, and local regulations. Diagnostic and screening testing Somerset Academy of Las Vegas will utilize the following diagnostic and screening testing methods: Staff and students will self-screen their physical health. If any symptoms of illness are exhibited, staff or students will remain home until they are symptom free. Touchless thermometers will be available for use at staff discretion. If students become ill at school, they will be quarantined in the health office and sent home until they are symptom free for at least twenty four (24) hours. Efforts to increase access and awareness to vaccinations Somerset Academy will communicate with stakeholders about access and awareness to vaccinations when applicable. Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to health and safety policies. Somerset Academy will continue to follow all FERPA and IDEA, 504, and IEP accommodations. SEALPs (Special Education Alternative Learning Plan) will be created for students with an active IEP (Individualized Education Plan) to modify services. How will the school meet students' social, emotional, mental and physical health needs and provide access to a safe and inclusive learning environment? How will the school support educator and staff well-being? Social Emotional Learning- Tier 1 Our counselors and safe school professionals will provide direct classroom instruction to address SEL needs. Teachers will have a daily classroom meet up time to address SEL needs. The counseling staff will be available to help students as needed. Teachers will message the counseling staff when a student needs to have a one-on-one session. The counseling staff will then meet the student in the classroom. Our staff will utilize culturally responsive practices to reinforce social emotional learning. Our staff will continue to utilize data based decision making throughout campuses to ensure social emotional learning. Trauma Informed Practices- Tiers 1-3 Teachers will have a daily classroom meet up time as well as a daily ending activity to address SEL needs and determine if individual students need further support. Counseling staff and/or members of the Leadership Team will check in on students who are Tier 2 or 3 for behavior, or who are simply having a difficult time with the current situation. Counseling staff will continually look for and update our resource list for parents and help parents get the support they need. Activities may include, but are not limited to, the following: Learning positive self-talk, Practicing problem-solving skills, Anxiety/grief support groups.

Supporting Staff Somerset Academy of Las Vegas will continue to support staff by providing the following: Modeling of teaching strategies and student interactions, Providing training as needed. Utilizing character development programs to be implemented in the classroom. How will the school address the impact of COVID-19 on students' opportunity to learn, including implementing strategies for accelerating learning, effectively using data, and addressing resource inequities? We will use diagnostic and formative assessments of student data (MAP, i-Ready, Burst, etc.) to evaluate the needs and effectiveness of instruction and determine the needs of students' academic progress. There may be times when it is necessary to host ALL students on campus for administration of assessments. If this is necessary, Somerset Academy of Las Vegas will ensure that a safe, socially distanced environment is provided. Teachers will have data chats with students and determine student goals based on formative assessments, summative assessments, and diagnostic results. Teachers will work with students to evaluate their progress toward their personalized goals and create a plan of action to work toward meeting those goals. We will utilize PLCs to analyze and monitor data to determine class and grade level needs to support students who need intervention, extension, and re-teaching. We will provide needed resources including necessary technology and curricular needs to those students who remain virtual. Technology will be returned at the end of the year, in good working order. Families will be provided with training on technology, if necessary. How will the school ensure that any student who falls into one of the categories listed below is able to participate in distance education that meets the requirements established for a Path Forward Programs of Distance Education? Somerset Academy has created a Distance Education plan specifically designed for students: Who have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person, Who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. High Risk Medical Exemption Process: Students who have been identified as high-risk, or who have a high-risk individual in their household, must submit medical documentation to the Principal of the individual Somerset Academy of Las Vegas campus. The Principal will review the documentation with the family to determine if distance education is appropriate. Factors to consider when determining eligibility for distance learning include (but are not limited to): Students will only be allowed to switch back to in-person learning at the end of each quarter, which will be determined on a case-by-case basis and with public health protocols in mind. If a full-time distance learning student begins to struggle, intervention meetings may be conducted with the student and parent/guardian, and the student may be required to attend school for face-to-face instruction. Students with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may need to attend therapy and related services at the school. Only students may participate in the real-time synchronous sessions. If a parent/guardian has a question or needs assistance, they should not interrupt a lesson A student participating in full-time distance learning who qualifies for free and reduced lunch, may receive meals at the school at no cost. Successful candidates for full-time distance learning have demonstrated positive attendance and grades during the previous year of school. All full-time distance learning requests are subject to approval by the school leadership. Full time distance education: Full time distance education will only be allowed for those students who have completed the Medical Exemption for Distance Education and have conferred with the Principal. Each individual campus of Somerset Academy of Las Vegas will create a schedule for Distance Education based on the number of students eligible for Distance Education, but will include, at a minimum, the following: 60-90 minutes of real time instruction for students in Kindergarten through 2nd grade, 90-120 minutes of real time instruction for students in third through fifth grade, 60 minutes per subject per week for students in 6 - 12th grade. All students will have access to Clever, Google Classroom, and Zoom meetings (during which real time instruction will occur). Teachers will submit at least one grade a week (per class) utilizing Infinite Campus. Attendance will be recorded utilizing Infinite Campus. Teachers will record attendance based on participation in real time instruction, work submitted, and contact with students. If students are not participating in the above mentioned activities, staff will reach out to the family to determine circumstances (including whether or not distance education should be continued). Somerset Academy will utilize licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes for instruction during distance learning. Teachers will post assignments utilizing online forums, including Google Classroom and Clever. Teachers will be available to students via telephone or email throughout the school day. Teachers will provide support to families during distance learning. Somerset Academy will provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plan. Special education teachers will meet virtually with students as needed to meet the mandated number of instructional minutes. School staff will consider alternative ways to provide equitable access and appropriate educational opportunities for students with disabilities, including exploring all available supplementary aids and services and related services to include online or virtual platforms, and/or other activities, such as paper/pencil activities. There are two types of quarantine for full-time students: Whole school/class quarantine, Individual/limited number of students. How will the school ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event that school must be closed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another major emergency that necessitates the closure of school? There are two types of quarantine for full-time students: Whole school/class quarantine, Individual/limited number of students. In the case of a school closure, we will utilize synchronous and asynchronous learning to continue to provide students with a high quality education. Students will be placed in Distance Learning with their in-person teacher if the entire class goes under quarantine. All work/activities will be accessed via Clever, and instruction will take place via Zoom. If the assigned teacher cannot provide instruction, the entire class may receive instruction from another teacher who is providing Distance Learning. How will the school ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event that school must be closed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another major emergency that necessitates the closure of school? Worsening public health conditions can affect the learning model that is implemented. If the Southern Nevada Health District, Center for Disease Control, and/or the Nevada Department of Education enforce new directives, we will make those changes as necessary. It will be a smooth transition for us due to our experience, and we are equipped to adapt to the changes. The school will work to ensure continuity of services, including access to necessary technology and resources, special education and EL services, and nutrition services for students participating in distance education by following the protocols set forth in Directive 044. School/Family Communication Students are required to check in with their teachers each day. Whether through email, a phone call, or (video) messaging through a learning management system and/or Zoom, it will count as an interaction for the day. A teacher will schedule one or more conference(s) with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of a student if the student is not maintaining passing grades, is not achieving the expected level of performance, is presenting some problem to the teacher, or in any other case that the teacher considers necessary. Such conferences may be handled by telephone, in person, or via written communication. If families and/or students call teachers, it has to be a viable conversation about academics to count as a present attendance mark. If not answered, a voicemail message should be recorded. A teacher will respond within 24 hours. If a student emails a teacher, the teacher will respond within 24 hours. Email communication sent on Fridays after 12:00 p.m. should expect a response by close of business on the non-holiday business day. If a student has not communicated with a staff member for 5 days in a row, a home visit will take place. If a family communicates that they are in need of resources, campus leadership, the teacher and the community outreach coordinator will work together to provide resources. Nutrition Services Students will receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled, to the extent nutrition services are generally provided by their charter school. For virtual students to receive their lunch, the student and/or a family member will need to visit the campus in-person during a designated lunch period set by the campus administration. The school will then provide a lunch meal. A lunch meal will be not provided to anyone arriving before or after their designated lunch period, unless at the discretion of school administration.2021-2022 School Year Plan-SLAM Nevada essIn-Person Learning:Health SafetyHow the school maintain the health and safetyof students, educators,and other school staff?

It will be our recommendation that for students whorequest to be on a \"full virtual track\" for an extendedamount of time as delineated in writing by a medicalprofessional, that an IEP Revision meeting takes placetoproperly address that change of placement andcorresponding adjustments to supports and services. For students who are unexpectedly forced to remainout ofschool for a temporary amount of time as a resultof havingto quarantine according to adopted guidance healthpolicy,it will be our recommendation for teams to send outa PriorWritten Notice to families as soon as possible identifyingthe proposed supports and services being offered tothechild within that time frame. More formal IEP Revisionsmaybe needed for students under these circumstancesdepending on the student's individual learning needsandcurrent state of health while under quarantine.Depending on the nature of having to implement the\"fulldistance learning\" model, schools are prepared toworkwith individual families of students with unique specialeducation needs to consider if any amount of \"in person\"learning may need to take place despite what is beingallowed/offered to the general student population. PATH FORWARD PROGRAM OF DISTANCE EDUCATION 2021-2022 4660 N. Rancho Drive Las Vegas, NV 89130 Table of Contents: 1. In-Person Learning: Health and Safety 2. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Wellbeing 3. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning 4. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in-person 5. Distance Education: Emergency Closure 6. Distance Education: Supporting Students In-Person Learning: Health and Safety TEACH Las Vegas has purchased two temperature reading devices that each student, educator, and staff members must use before they enter the building in the morning. The device will track the daily temperature of every person on the campus daily for the 180 days of instruction. If any person attending the school has a temperature of 100.4 degrees, the device will alert the administration, nurse, or FASA and that person will be sent home until they are without a temperature for 24 hours without the use of medication. TEACH Las Vegas has also purchased cleaning and sanitizing products that will be used daily, multiple times a day if needed, to ensure that the campus is kept clean and sanitary. All staff and students will receive trainings on how to ensure they are cleaning their classrooms, common areas, and personal items clean. CDC Recommendations Face Coverings: In accordance with CDC guidelines, TEACH Las Vegas will follow the most up-to-date guidance from the CDC. All staff are required to wear a mask indoors if they are not fully vaccinated. Mask wearing is optional for students in Pre-K through Grade 3. Masks are required for students in grades 4 and 5, and optional for students in grades 6 through 12 who have been fully vaccinated. No one is required to wear a mask outdoors. Handwashing and respiratory etiquette: In accordance with CDC guidelines, TEACH Las Vegas will: Provide ongoing health education units and lessons, teach children proper handwashing, and reinforce behaviors, and provide adequate supplies. Ensure that teachers and staff use proper handwashing and respiratory etiquette. Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students, teachers, and staff. If handwashing is not possible, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol should be used. Encourage students and staff to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue when not wearing a mask and immediately wash their hands after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing. Some students with disabilities might need assistance with handwashing and respiratory etiquette behaviors. Supplies: Support healthy hygiene behaviors by providing adequate supplies, including soap, a way to dry hands, tissues, face masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans. If soap and water are not readily available, schools can provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer). Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities: In accordance with CDC guidelines, TEACH Las Vegas will: Make changes to physical spaces to maintain a healthy environment and facilities, including improving ventilation. Routinely clean high-touch surfaces (such as doorknobs and light switches). Ventilation: Improve ventilation to the extent possible to increase circulation of outdoor air, increase the delivery of clean air, and dilute potential contaminants. This can be achieved through several actions. o Bring in as much outdoor air as possible. o Ensure Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) settings are maximizing ventilation. o Filter and/or clean the air in the school by changing filters regularly o Use exhaust fans in restrooms and kitchens. Modified layouts: Adjust physical layouts in classrooms and other settings to maximize physical space, such as by turning desks to face in the same direction. Cleaning: Regularly clean high touch surfaces and objects (for example, playground equipment, door handles, sink handles, toilets, drinking fountains) within the school and on school buses at Communal spaces: Stagger use and clean regularly (for example, daily or as often as needed). Consider use of larger spaces such as cafeterias, libraries, gyms for academic instruction, to maximize physical distancing. Food service: Avoid offering any self-serve food or drink options such as hot and cold food bars, salad or condiment bars, and drink stations. Water systems: Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example, sink faucets, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Contact Tracing: In accordance with CDC Guidelines, TEACH Las Vegas will: TEACH Las Vegas will collaborate with the health department, to the extent allowable by privacy laws and other applicable laws, to confidentially provide information about people diagnosed with or exposed to COVID-19. Students, teachers, and staff with positive test results should isolate, and close contacts should quarantine. TEACH will report positive cases to the health department as soon as they are informed. TEACH school officials will notify families of close contacts as soon as possible after they are notified that someone in the school has tested positive (within the same school day). Staying home when appropriate: TEACH will educate teachers, staff and families about when they and their children should stay home and when they can return to school. Students, teachers, and staff who have symptoms should stay home and be referred to their healthcare provider for testing and care. TEACH may need to consider flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable teachers and staff to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or are caring for someone who is sick. TEACH will recruit and train sufficient substitute educators to ensure that teachers can stay home when they are sick or have been exposed to someone who is confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19. Isolation should be used to separate people diagnosed with COVID-19 from those who are not infected. Students, teachers, and staff who are in isolation should stay home and follow the direction of the local public health authority about when it is safe for them to be around others. Case investigation and contact tracing: TEACH will work with the local health department to facilitate, to the extent allowable by applicable laws, systematic case investigation and contact tracing of infected students, teachers, and staff, and consistent isolation of cases and quarantine of close contacts. TEACH will prepare and provide information and records to aid in the identification of potential contacts and exposure sites, consistent with applicable laws, including those related to privacy and confidentiality. Collaboration between the health department and K-12 school administration to obtain contact information of other individuals in shared rooms, class schedules, shared meals, or extracurricular activities will expedite contact tracing. For schools to remain open, health departments should ensure they have enough contact tracers to complete case investigation and notify contacts within 48 hours of a positive test result. Prompt identification, quarantine, and monitoring of those contacts exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can effectively break the chain of transmission and prevent further spread of the virus. o The definition of a close contact is someone who was within 6 feet of a person diagnosed with COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24 hour period. The definition of a close contact applies regardless of whether either person was wearing a mask. o For schools that use less than 6 feet between students in classrooms, the definition of close contacts should not change. Students sitting less than 6 feet next to another student or person diagnosed with COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more should quarantine at home and be referred for testing. Quarantine should be used for students, teachers, and staff who might have been exposed to COVID-19. Close contacts, identified through contact tracing, should quarantine unless they are fully vaccinated, or have tested positive in the last 3 months, and do not have any symptoms. Students, teachers, and staff who are in quarantine should stay home and follow the direction of the local public health department about when it is safe for them to be around others. If a child with a disability is required to quarantine, TEACH is required to provide services consistent with federal disability laws. Diagnostic and screening testing: In accordance with CDC guidelines, TEACH Las Vegas will, At all levels of community transmission, TEACH should offer referrals to diagnostic testing to any student, teacher, or staff member who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 at school. Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the individual level and is performed when there is a reason to suspect that an individual may be infected, such as having symptoms or suspected recent exposure. Examples of diagnostic testing strategies include testing symptomatic teachers, students, and staff who develop symptoms in school, and testing asymptomatic individuals who were exposed to someone with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. Additional considerations for diagnostic testing: TEACH will advise students, teachers, and staff to stay home if they are sick or if they have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. TEACH can encourage these individuals to talk to their healthcare provider about getting a COVID-19 test. If a student, teacher, or staff member becomes sick at school or reports a new COVID-19 diagnosis, TEACH should follow the steps of the COVID-19 Diagnosis flowchart on what to do next. This includes notifying a student's parent or guardian and initiating testing strategies. Notifications must be accessible for all students, parents, or guardians, including those with disabilities or limited English proficiency (for example, through use of interpreters or translated materials). It is important that school-based healthcare professionals have access to, and training on the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Not every school or school-based healthcare professional will have the staff, resources, or training to conduct testing. Public health officials should work with TEACH to help link students and their families, teachers, and staff to other opportunities for testing in their community. Testing could be offered by referral to community-based testing sites, through collaboration with local public health, or through a centralized test location offered by the school district. The presence of any of the symptoms below generally suggests a student, teacher, or staff member has an infectious illness and should not attend school, regardless of whether the illness is COVID-19. For students, staff, and teachers with chronic conditions, symptom presence should represent a change from their typical health status to warrant exclusion from school. Occurrence of any of the symptoms below while a student, teacher, or staff member is at school suggests the person may be referred for diagnostic testing. Temperature external icon of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher Sore throat Cough (for students with chronic cough due to allergies or asthma, a change in their cough from baseline) Difficulty breathing (for students with asthma, a change from their baseline breathing) Diarrhea or vomiting New loss of taste or smell New onset of severe headache, especially with a fever Students should not attend school in-person if they or their caregiver identifies new development of any of the symptoms above. Teach can provide options to separate students with COVID-19 symptoms or suspected or confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses by, for example, placing students in isolation room/areas until transportation can be arranged to send them home or seek emergency medical attention. If a COVID-19 diagnosis is confirmed, TEACH will support public health officials in determining which close contacts and other potentially exposed persons in the school setting could be tested and either isolated or quarantined. TEACH can assist by providing information, where appropriate, to identify close contacts (for example, class rosters, seating charts, and information to facilitate outreach to contacts). Increase awareness to vaccinations: In accordance with CDC guidelines, TEACH Las Vegas will make CDC resources available to teachers and school staff by posting the below links in the employee handbook and teachers lounge/workroom. The COVID-19 Vaccines for Teachers, School Staff, and Childcare Workers web page provides school and childcare staff with the latest information about where and how to book an appointment. The COVID-19 Vaccine Toolkit for School Settings and Childcare Programs provides schools and childcare programs with ready-made materials they can use to communicate with staff about COVID-19 vaccination. TEACH officials and health departments can work together to also support messaging and outreach about vaccination for members of school communities. TEACH communication platforms can facilitate outreach to encourage vaccination of household members of school-age children as they become eligible. This should include outreach in a language that limited English proficient family members of students can understand and in alternate formats as needed to facilitate effective communication for individuals with disabilities. Implementation of layered prevention strategies will need to continue until we better understand potential transmission among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine and there is more vaccination coverage in the community. In addition, vaccines are not yet approved for use in children under 16 years old. For these reasons, even after teachers and staff are vaccinated, schools need to continue prevention measures for the foreseeable future, including requiring masks in schools and physical distancing. Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities: In accordance with CDC guidelines, TEACH Las Vegas will ensure that students with an IEP (Individualized Educational Plan) or 504 Plan modifications and accommodations are being met and that their health and safety are not being compromised. In-Person Learning: Student and Staff Well Being TEACH will meet all students social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs by providing a safe and inclusive learning environment. TEACH staff will be trained in PBIS strategies and incorporate them in their classrooms daily. Staff will also communicate with parents weekly and will inquire about any issues that the student may be experiencing so we can address them at school if appropriate. TEACH will have a RN contracted and a FASA on site daily to support students. TEACH will ensure all students social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs are being met by conducting social/emotional lessons in every classroom at least weekly. Staff will be trained to look for signs of depression, anxiety, and harm to self-behaviors. If any student exhibits these behaviors, staff will communicate with school administration, and they will take the correct steps needed to support the students. TEACH will use the SAFEVOICE app to ensure that students have a technology-based resource that supports their social, emotional, mental, and physical health. School administrators will be the point of contact for SAFEVOICE and will immediately follow up with parents and students when a report is filed. All staff members will also receive Mandated Reporter training prior to school beginning. In year two of TEACH being in operation, we will staff a school counselor and social worker to support the social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs of our students. TEACH will support our staff by providing a safe, nurturing, calm, and peaceful workplace. TEACH will also notify and post the rights of Nevada employees to ensure that if an issue arises, all staff knows where they can access information, resources, and support. TEACH administration will also meet with staff weekly to communicate with and ensure that staff knows where to access support or be that point of support. In-Person Learning: Accelerating Student Learning TEACH Las Vegas will address the impacts of COVID-19's impact on student learning by doing the following: TEACH is a one-to-one Chromebook school. All students will have access to daily, reliable technology. TEACH will use benchmark testing, such as DIBLES and MAP testing to guide instruction, create interventions, implement interventions, and ensure consistent student academic growth. TEACH will provide breakfast and lunch to every student daily at no cost. Ensuring all students receive a balanced daily diet will help to increase their focus and ability to learn. TEACH will use the data from the WIDA assessment to help guide the instruction for our ELL students. TEACH will provide a daily intervention block, 30 minutes daily, to meet the specific and individual academic needs of every student. TEACH will form an intensive RTI process to ensure all students are making adequate progress. TEACH will re-evaluate and implement different learning and assessment strategies as needed by our students. We are using the most current curriculum for our core subject areas and will use our data to drive instruction. Distance Education: Students unable to participate in-person Students who fall under these two categories will be eligible for distance learning: 1. Students who have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in-person, 2. Students who are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. Students enrolled at TEACH and fall into either or both categories will be able to participate daily in their classroom activities and instruction via their Chromebook and if needed, TEACH will employ or offer a stipend to a teacher to provide additional academic support during the time the student is unable to attend school in-person. Distance Education: Emergency Closure TEACH will ensure that all students are able to continue to learn through distance education in the event the school must close because of the COVID -19 pandemic, or another major emergency necessitates the closure of school by: 1. All students will be provided a Chromebook for distance learning. 2. Classes will continue at their normal start and ending times. Instruction will be virtual instead of in-person 3. Teachers will be required to hold weekly parent meetings via phone call, text message, email, or Zoom call. During these meetings, teachers will address academics and any behavioral concerns. 4. If students are absent, teacher will contact parent the day of the absence. If student is absent longer that 3 days, school administration will contact parent and require a meeting. 5. Students will be provided all access to the web-based editions of all curricula. 6. Teachers will still provide daily interventions to all students; the time may decrease from 30 to 20 minutes if needed. 7. Students and teachers will still receive their daily prep time. Specialist will conduct classes virtually. TEACH will work cooperatively with parents and families to ensure that all students are academically successful, and that their social, emotional, mental, and physical needs are being met. Distance Education: Supporting Students TEACH will ensure that all students continue to receive auxiliary services by doing the following: 1. All students will have the ability to take their Chromebooks home. 2. All curricula will be supported by on-line access to assignments, interventions, tests, and notes. 3. TEACH and the Special Education team will make every effort to ensure that all IEP minutes, modifications, and accommodations are being met. If at any point during distance learning, the teacher, student, parent, or school administration believe the student is not receiving the adequate or appropriate support, a meeting will be held to develop a plan that addresses the deficiencies. 4. TEACH will have the same policy for our EL Leaners. If they begin to fall behind or need extra support, TEACH will provide tutoring. 5. Food services will continue. Breakfast and lunch will be served daily. Parents will be required to pick up food from the school campus. Appendix B: Stakeholder Input of the Development of this Plan Throughout 2020 and early 2021 , the SPCSA has engaged with stakeholders on numerous occasions to understand the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic and inform our actions. When schools closed in March of 2020, the SPCSA initiated a communications strategy whereby each school leader was assigned an SPCSA Liaison who regularly spoke to the school leader to discuss recent developmen ts, understand challenges the school was facing, address questions that the school leader had, and collect information to monitor school operations. Internally, SPCSA Liaisons met regularly, at first twice per week, to discuss common themes, challenges, an d questions. Information collected through these SPCSA Liaisons informed the actions and priorities of the SPCSA. In addition, the SPCSA's Executive Director regularly held \"All School Calls\" to share important updates and answer questions. Many of the top ics addressed in the All School Calls were informed by the trends observed by the SPCSA Liaisons. In addition, twice during the 2021 -22 school year, the SPSCA's Executive Director held a series of Focus Groups with school leaders and board chairs to gather input and inform key decision points. While these activities were not specifically intended to gather input on the SPCSA's Plan for the S afe Return to In-Person Instruction , the information collected has inherently shaped the work over the last year and t he contents of this plan. In developing the SPCSA's Plan for the S afe Return to In-Person Instruction , public comment was sought during the State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) board meeting on April 23, 2021. In addition, the SPCSA launched two s urveys seeking input from parents, families, educators , students and community members. The first survey was open from April 16 through May 7, 2021. The second survey was available in both English and Spanish from June 2 through June 15, 2021. In addition to using this survey data to inform this plan, the SPCSA disseminate d the data to each school to help inform their planning. T he SPCSA also held a special meeting of our Community Working Group which is comprised of community and business leaders, represen tatives from local municipalities, representatives from the charter school community, and education representatives from local school districts and the Nevada Department of Education. Board Meeting on April 23, 2021 During the Board Meeting on April 23, 2021, the SPCSA heard from three school leaders regarding the challenges they see within their school community and how they are planning to address these needs through federal emergency funds. Additionally, four individuals provided public comment regarding the Plan for the Safe Return to In -Person Instruction either in writing or du ring the meeting. The minutes from that meeting can be found here: https://charterschools.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/CharterSchool snvgov/content/News/2021/210423 -April- 23-Final- Minutes.pdf Survey The SPCSA launched two surveys seeking input from parents, families, educators, students and community members. The first survey was open from April 16 through May 7, 2021. The second sur vey was available in both English and Spanish from June 2 through June 15, 2021. In total, the SPCSA received 2,609 responses to these surveys.

The major themes are summarized below by stakeholder group: Charter School Parents and Family Members: The vas t majority of parent/family respondents indicated that full- time in person instruction is a priority for the upcoming school year. A number of parents spoke about the challenges of distance learning and hybrid learning, and some referenced the particular c hallenge of these learning models with multiple children. Some individuals indicated that they are not yet ready for their child to return to school in person and that they would like choices regarding learning model going into the next school year. In add ition, many indicated that health and safety are top priority . A range of strategies were referenced in responses including cleaning and sanitation, use of temperature checks or symptom screeners, maintaining small class sizes, handwashing, face masks, soc ial distancing, minimizing visitors, use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) , and ensuring sick students are sent home from school. A number of respondents indicated that they are concerned about children being required to wear masks and suggested that face coverings not be required in schools. Some requested that schools provide mask breaks during the school day. However, there were also many respondents that indicated that face coverings should be a priority. Several respondents indicated that promotin g vaccines should be a priority. Additionally, some parents/family members indicated vaccines should be mandatory for those that are eligible, while other indicated that vaccines should not be mandatory. Many parents and family members wrote about the need for students to engage with their peers. Additionally, many parents and family members indicated concerns for students social, emotional, and mental wellbeing.

Charter School Staff Many school staff members indicated that providing full time, in -person instruction for all students is a pr iority for the upcoming school year. Many staff members wrote about the importance of address learning gaps through high quality, face -to-face instruction. Additionally, many school staff indicated that health and safety are a top priority, pointing to COVID -19 mitigation measures such as face coverings, sanitation, small class sizes, reducing class rotations, social distancing, access to COVID -19 testing, personal protective equipment , ensuring that sick students and staff stay home, and th e recommendations outlined by the CDC. Some respondents indicated that mask and social distancing requirements posed challenges for schools and teachers, and that either alternatives such as mask breaks should be implemented or that these requirements shou ld be lifted. Many school staff members wrote about the challenges of teaching through a distance education or hybrid model this year. Some also suggested that distance education should not be offered in the upcoming school year. Many school staff members indicated that a top priority is addressing student learning gaps. Some respondents suggested hiring additional staff to support this effort and reduce the student to teacher ratio. Other suggested ensuring that teachers are adequately compensated. Many school staff members indicated concerns about student and staff soci al, emotional, and mental health. Some suggested strategies such as professional development on trauma informed instruction and/or social emotional learning . Several school staff members indicated that vaccinations are a priority .

Several school staff members indicated that they want to ensure that students continue to have access to technology going forward. Severa l school staff members wrote about the importance of including the school community, staff, students, and families, in major school decisions. Charter School Students: Many students indicated that they want to return to school in -person. One student pointe d out that many of his/her peers had a hard time during distance learning, but that returning to school has had a positive effect on student wellbeing. Additionally, a few students indicated that they would like to return in person but maintain one day a w eek of distance learning. Many students indicated that safety was a priority for in -person learning, pointing to a variety of COVID -19 mitigation measures such as masks, social distancing, temperature checks, small class sizes, ensuring sick students do no t come to school, and alerting students when they may have been exposed to an individual that tested positive. A few students specifically said that one of their priorities was not to get COVID -19 and to protect their family members from getting COVID -19. Some students also indicated that social distancing and masks have been a challenge . For example, a student indicated that it can be hard to hear their teacher through a mask. Several students indicated that vaccines should be a priority. Several students indicated that distance and hybrid learning can be challenging. A few specific reasons were listed including inconsistent internet access, which can lead to missing zoom lessons, and teachers having to split their attention between in -person students and online students. Several students indicated that their priority is academics, some specifically stating that they wanted to get better grades. Other students indicated that other components of school, such as socializing, specials classes, and recess were priorities. Additionally, some students indicated that mental health is a priority.

A few members of the public wrote about the importance of in -person learning and access to hands -on resources for students to ensure tha t schools can close learning gaps for students. Some members of the public wrote about the importance of ensuring adequate pay for educators. Community Working Group The SPCSA's C ommunity Working Group is comprised of community and business leaders, representatives from local municipalities, representatives from the charter school community, and education representatives from local school districts and the Nevada Department of Education. The purpose of t he Community Working Group is to provide input on how charter schools and the SPCSA can partner with communities and stakeholders to meet educational needs. This includes an explicit focus on equitable access and creating school environments that support t he needs of diverse learners. The Community Working Group met on Thursday, June 10, 2021 to provide input on the SPCSA's Plan for the Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and priorities for the use of emergency funding. Six members joined the meeting, an d others who were unable to join were encouraged to complete the SPCSA's survey. These members bring a range of expertise including family engagement, education, school leadership, serving homeless students, serving students with disabilities, and city planning. Below is a summary of the input they provided: Thus far, school re -openings have shown that students and school staff can adhere to COVID -19 mitigation measures. As students have returned to in -person learning the social engagement has been a huge positive. They are happy to be back with their peers and teachers. Schools must plan for welcoming students back at the beginning of the year and be prepared to support students who have experienced loss and/or trauma. There may be a number of students who are disengaged from school. Targeted efforts to locate and reengage these students are needed. It will be important for schools to assess student academic levels early . Schools should focus on accelerating learning by teaching on -grade level c ontent, while bridging gaps, rather than strictly focusing on remediation. Schools will need to have robust plans to support the social and emotional wellbeing of students, families and staff. This may also include a need for additional wrap around service s such as transportation , enrichment programs , and childcare . Schools need to evaluate the need for providing compensatory services to special education students who may not have received services during the pandemic. They also need to consider evaluating or re -evaluating students and emphasizing a return to pre -pandemic service levels. Some students may have moved during the pandemic or may not be living in stable housing. Schools need a plan to identify and reach out to these students so they can provide appropriate supports. Many high school students have b een working during the pandemic to contribute to their family's' income and/or provide childcare for younger siblings . Schools may need to think creatively about how to ensure these students can return to school while supporting family needs. Many educators are burnt out, so there is a need to ensure they are supported and sufficiently compensated. We need the community, including agencies and the media, to provide clear messages about the importance of returning to in -person instruction. The pandemic has required increased and different engagement between educators and families. Learning from and building on this increase d family engagement can help to improve outcomes for students and ensure parents are equipped to help their child be successful in school. Schools and districts need strong leadership and flexibility . They will need to be creative in developing solutions and while holding true to foundational strategies that are proven. Schools must learn from the last year and incorporate these lessons as they move forward. Appendix C: Guidance Memorandum 21- 02 Page 1 of 5 Steve Sisolak Governor Jhone M. Ebert Superintendent of Public Instruction Southern Nevada Office 2080 East Flamingo Rd, Suite 210 Las Vegas, Phone: (702) 486 -6458 Fax: (702) 486-6450 STATE OF NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 700 E. Fifth Street Carson City, Nevada 89701 -5096 Phone: (775) 687 GUIDANCE MEMORANDUM 21-02 TO: All School District Superintendents Charter School Sponsors FROM: Jhone M. Ebert, Superintendent of Public Instruction DATE: May 28, 2021 SUBJECT: Guidance for 2021 -22 School Year Reope ning This guidance supersedes all previous guidance issued by the Nevada Department of Education (NDE or Department) related to Path Forward Programs of Distance Education, existing authority for which expires at the end of the 2020-21 extended school year. Background On April 1 9, 2021 , Governor Sisolak issued Declaration of Emergency Directive 0 44 requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to update the requirements and provide written guidance to county school districts and State and district sponsored charter schools (\"districts and schools\") regarding reopening plans and plans for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education for the 2021 -22 school year. This memo describes the requirements for offering distance education during the 2021 -22 school year . To support districts and schools in plan ning ahead, t he final section of this memo provides background information regarding the reopening plans federally required under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act. In-Person Instruction In accordance with Directive 044 , effective May 1, 2021, authority for managing certain COVID -19 mitigation measures is delegated to district leaders and charter school spons ors. Superintendents and charter school sponsors (\"LEA leaders\") may determine capacity limits, social distancing protocols, and sanitation protocols for school transportation, spaces within school buildings or on school grounds, and for public gatherings and events of up to 250 people.1 LEA leaders should make these decisions in consultation with staff and families as well as local public health authorities. Path Forward Programs of Distance Education Given local control over mitigation requirements, it is anticipated that districts and schools will open for 1Public gatherings and events of over 250 people organized or hosted by districts or schools or in school buildings or on school grounds require a Large Gathering Plan pursuant to Directives 044 and 041. Page 2 of 5 the 2021 -22 school year with the capacity to offer in -person learning to all students. However, due to the need to accommodate student and family health and safety concerns and the potential need for students to have access to education while under quarantine, Section 15 of Directive 044 requires that all districts and schools provide a distance education option for students throughout the re mainder of the Governor's Declaration of Emergency in response to COVID -19. Therefore, all district s and schools must submit a Plan for a Path Forward Program of Distance Education for the 2021 -22 school year and the accompanying certification as described below . This requirement does not apply to programs of distance education as approved by NDE in accordance with Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 388.830 . Distance education options must be available to all students, regardless of their public school of enrollment, if they have documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compromised by attending school in -person or if they are quarantined on the advice of local public health officials. In addition , county school districts m ust provide distance education options to any student based on parent/guardian request through a process to be established by the district . County school districts may restrict entry into and exit from distance education to certain times within the academic year (i.e., beginning/end of quarter, semester, etc.) Minimum Requirements for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education In implementing Path Forward Programs of Distance Education, districts and schools must ensure students participating in distance education have access to the technology necessary to participate in distance education, such as access to a computer and internet connectivity, or plan to provide accommodations for stu dents without access to such technology . Districts and schools must provide opportunities for distance education as follows : (1)Any district or charter school student who has documentation from a medical professional related to a condition that would be compr omised by attending school in -person or is quarantined on the advice of local public health officials must have an opportunity to access and participate in distance education. (2)All county school district students must have an ability to access and particip ate in distance education at the request of their parent/guardian through a process to be established by the district. In addition, districts and schools must implement Path Forward Programs of D istance Education as follows: (1)A licensed teacher or substitut e teacher must attempt to contact each student via electronic means or by telephone at least once per instructional day; if a student's lack of access to a telephone or internet service results in an inability to be contacted, a licensed teacher or license d substitute teacher must attempt contact via other means (e.g., home visit ) once per week and maintain a record of attempts . (2)The program of instruction must provide appropriate education for English Learners, students with Individualized Education Programs, and students with 504 Plans . (3)Licensed teachers and/or licensed substitutes must be accessible to students through the internet or by telephone during the school's regularly scheduled instructional hours . (4)Students participating in distance education must receive access to the nutrition services to which they are entitled . (5)Districts and schools must use a consistent method in Infi nite Campus for recording contact with students participating in distance education , which may include students demonstrating regular weekly progress in their classwork that can be verified through a learning management system. No later than July 14, 2021: School district superintendents must submit the signed certification form attached via email to Page 3 of 5 Amelia Thibault at acthibault@doe.nv.gov . District plans describing their approach to Path Forward Programs of Dista nce Education must be incorporated into the federally required LEA Plans for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Service s, described in more detail below. Charter school leaders must submit the signed certification and their Plans for P ath Forward Programs of Distance Education to their sponsor; sponsoring authorities will compile and transmit the forms and plans to the Department. Hybrid Learning For the purposes of this guidance, \"hybrid learning\" is defined as any arrangement under which a district or school is providing in -person instruction concurrently with distance education either through electronic means or through paper correspondence. This may include scenarios under which some students are learning in -person and others are l earning through distance education, as well as scenarios under which all students are alternating between in -person instruction and distance education on a regular schedule. Districts and schools may, but are not required to , consider the following appro aches to implementing hybrid learning: Prioritizing in -person instruction for students most negatively impacted by COVID -19, including students from families experiencing poverty, students of color, English learners, students with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students; Evaluating students' Individualized Ed ucation Programs or 504 Plans to determine whether the provision of services requires in -person instruction or interaction; Determining that certain grade levels or courses are better suited to in -person instruction or distance education; or Considering d ocumented student and family medical circumstances. District s and schools may not determine whether students receive in -person instruction or distance education based on perceived access to technology, at -home support, or any other considerations of means or determinations of district or school personnel that are not based on evidence. Attendance Daily attendance must be taken for all modes of learning : in-person, hybrid, and full distance , except for schools that have approved Programs of Distance Learni ng per NAC 388.830. Schools with approved Programs of Distance Learning may continue to take attendance per NAC 387.193. Daily attendance may be satisfied in any of the following ways: (1)The student is physically present; and/or (2)The pupil makes progress in their classwork leading toward mastery of Nevada Academic Content Standards and/or a course's completion that can be verified through a learning management system or other means; and/or (3)The pupil participates in a real -time (sy nchronous) class session; and/or (4)The pupil meets with or otherwise communicates with a licensed teacher or licensed substitute teacher who is able to discuss the pupil's progress in the course. If a pupil participating in distance education full - or part -time demonstrates any one of the four criteria, the pupil is considered present for the full day. If the pupil does not demonstrate at least Page 4 of 5 one of the four criteria, they are considered absent for the full day. Federally Required Plan for Safe Return to In-Person Instruction and Continuity of Services This section of the document is information al to provide LEAs with context that may inform the process used by LEAs to formulate and finalize their Plans for Path Forward Programs of Distance Education. On April 22, 2021, U.S. Department of Education (USED) published an interim final rule (IFR) related to the implementation of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act . Per USED requirements, LEAs must either: (a)Within 30 days of r eceipt of ARP Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds, develop and make publicly available on the LEA's website a plan for the safe return to in- person instruction and continuity of services; or (b)Have developed and made publicly avai lable on the LEA's website such a plan that meets statutory requirements before the enactment of the ARP Act, which must be revised no later than six months after it was last reviewed. Given the USED guidance regarding LEA Plans for Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services (\"LEA Plans for Safe Return \"), it is anticipated that all LEAs2 must update or replace their 2020 -21 reopening plans (as previously required by Emergency Directive 022) to meet the statutory requirements of the ARP Act. The IFR regarding the LEA Plans for Safe Return is excerpted below for your ease of reference: \"First, the requirement clarifies that an LEA's plan must include how it will maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other school and LEA st aff, and the extent to which it has adopted policies, and a description of any such policies, on each of the CDC's safety recommendations including: Universal and correct wearing of masks; Modifying facilities to allow for physical distancing (e.g., use of cohorts/podding); Handwashing and respiratory etiquette; cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including improving ventilation; contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine, in collaboration with the State, local, territorial, or Tribal health departments; Diagnostic and screening testing; Efforts to provide vaccinations to school communities; Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to health and safety policies; and Coordination with State and l ocal health officials. \"Second, the requirement further clarifies that the plan must describe how the LEA will ensure continuity of services, including but not limited to services to address students' academic needs and students' and staff social, emotiona l, mental health and other needs, which may include student health and food services. \"Third, the requirement provides that, during the period of the ARP ESSER award established in section 2001(a) of the ARP Act (i.e., until September 30, 2023), an LEA mus t periodically, but no less frequently than every six months, review and, as appropriate, revise its plan. Consistent with section 2001(i)(2) of the ARP Act, which requires an LEA to seek public comment on the development of its plan, an LEA must seek publ ic input and take such input into account in determining whether to revise its plan and, if it determines revisions are necessary, on the 2 Districts that do not receive ARP ESSER funds via the Title I methodology do not have to complete LEA Plans for Safe Return and instead must submit a memo to the Department briefly describing their Path Forward Program of Distance Education. Page 5 of 5 revisions it makes to its plan, i.e., the LEA must seek public input on whether to revise its plan and on any revision s to its plan no less frequently than every six months (taking into consideration the timing of significant changes to CDC guidance on reopening schools).
